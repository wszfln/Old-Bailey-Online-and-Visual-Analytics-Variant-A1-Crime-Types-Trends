            . I am a pewterer in Whitecross Street. This lad Poole brought this brass hinge to me the 19th of April to sell. He said his father sent him to sell it, and that he had had it six years in the room. At first he said his father's name was Weyman, but his name his Poole. He had a two foot rule in his pocket, which we gave him again, as he said he bought it for a peny in Moorfields. He said it was the first fact, and owned that he took them out of Mrs. Giles's shop.</p>

            . I was looking out at a one pair of stairs window, and heard my aunt cry she was robbed, and somebody said here is a boy with a bundle of linen. I went up to him, and he laid the bundle down and run away, I run after him, and took him, and he called out several times for his case of pistols to shoot me; whether he had any gang with him I cannot tell, but I saw nobody but himself; it was pretty dark, I believe it was between eight and nine in the evening. <rs id="t17440510-2-verdict9" type="verdictDescription">

Two or three days afterwards Mrs. Gregory came and said, she believed if such a house was searched we might find some of the things. Some people went to search the Prisoner's house, and he said they were very welcome; but while they were searching it he ran away, and they found a tolling and some other things in the closet, and the fails were found at the top of the house. We went before a Justice, and the Prisoner Andrew said he would own every thing, and how they came there. Then said I, how did they come there? He answered, the man of the house where you found these things (Greswold) enticed us from our masters, and said we should not want for money, victuals, or clothes: one of the boys said, that Groswold sent them out o'night with tools to break open vessels, and that he received what they brought.</p>

               <p>Q. How did you go to the ship?</p>
               <p>Pinfold. Greswold lent us his little boat till we could get another to suit our conveniency: we used to take any large boat that we could find, and so go on board the ships; he had bought a larger boat and brought it home from the carpenter's the Saturday that we were taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had got these things where did you carry them?</p>
               <p>Pinfold. To Mr. Greswold's house, and delivered the sails, ropes and stanchions, &amp;c. to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night did you go to do this?</p>
               <p>Pinfold. The watchman went past one as we were taking them out of the yatch, which lay between Cole Harbour and Stone-Stairs. - Greswold lives at Cole-Harbour by Blackwall, and keeps the sign of the Ramsgate Pink.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he knew these things were stole?</p>

Accordingly we did, and when Mr. Hall took hold of a rope and said, that is a piece of my cable, he walked away. I said, Mr. Greswold, don't go; he said he was going to look for the boy, and would be back again in a minute. I sent two men after him, and then he run into the marsh - the Isle of Dogs, which is right against his house. I went the next day to his house again to search for him, and found him covered over in a copper he used to brew in (he used to brew his own beer) in his shirt, without his coat and waistcoat; there was water in it, for when he came out of the copper I was forced to stay till he changed his shoes and stockings, they were so wet.</p>

            . I went with a search-warrant to Greswold's, in order to look for Mr. Phillips's things, there was a closet by the fire side, said I, what have you got here? His wife said, some old ropes that we have bought, and I found them to be ours. I found some of our old fails in the garret, but his wife was not very ready to show them. The next day I went with a warrant to search for the rest of the things, for Pinfold told us where to find them. There was a woman talked pretty much, and I asked her what she had to do there? she said, she was to take care of the house. I said, I would take hold of her. She answered, I had no occasion to do that, for Mr. Greswold was above, and as I was going up I think I saw his legs, and one of our people found him in the copper in his brewhouse; he was stooping down, half bent, and said, if we used him well he would come out.</p>
               <p>Greswold. Did not you bring cutlasses, and say, cut him down ?</p>
               <p>Smith. I said no such thing; I had a cutlass, it was not properly a cutlass, it was a tuck; I was resolved indeed that he should not make his escape again.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. When they went away from you, which way did they go?</p>
               <p>Martin. They went towards London.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell certainly that this is the man? Was it light then?</p>
               <p>Martin. It was not very light, but I having known him some time before, I knew him as well as I did my own brother. I knew him by his voice, body and face; it is surprising he should have used me in that manner, and if the other man had not been more merciful than he, I should never have been here now.</p>

            ) came and called me out, and told me, there was one Mr. Martin almost killed in the fields, and he desired me to assist him. I went along with him and three or four more into the Five Fields. The constable and some of them staid behind, and one of them went about an hundred yards before me. Presently I saw a man coming up a good pace, and he struck at me; I had a bayonet in my hand, and I struck at him, and I believe I struck his coat, and then I cried out, stop thief. Then the constable and his man met him, and knocked him down, and we took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did this man prove to be?</p>
               <p>Rowe. The Prisoner at the bar. Then I took him to my house; when he came there, he put his hand round one of the door posts, and cried out, Murder! and would not go in, till he was forced in. Then I asked him where he was going? He said he was going to Esquire Man's on the other side of the college, and that he lived with one Esquire Chester, in Golden Square; but the next day, when Mr. Martin and we were going to Esquire Chester, to know the truth of it, he said, he did not live there.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went into the fields it was between ten and eleven, or near eleven, was Mr. Martin got home then?</p>
               <p>Rowe. He was got home some time before; for when the Prisoner came to my house, I sent for Mr. Martin, and as soon as he came in, he said, that is the man that robbed me, for I know him by his tongue, and he said, Mr. Saunders, how could you serve me so, when I have given you many a shilling, and many a meal's meat when you have been out of place; and the Prisoner denied then that he had done any thing to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him, whether I was the first person that met him?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174405100007"/>Rowe. There was one an hundred yards before me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This Mr. Martin is an undertaker, and he buried a master of mine; there were four servants of us, two men and two maids, and he gave us a guinea apiece; I would ask him, whether he ever gave me any thing else?</p>
               <p>Martin. I did bury a master of his, and I gave three guineas among the servants; how it was disposed of, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever given him a meal's meat?</p>
               <p>Martin. I don't know that I ever gave him a meal's meat, I have given him money, and treated him when he has been out of place, when I have met him, and when we have gone in to drink, I never let him pay any thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When you came into the room where I was, did not you ask me which way I got my bread?</p>
               <p>Martin. I asked you how you lived, and where you lived; and you would not tell me; and if I did ask you, I had very good reason for it, for this is a bad way of getting bread. He said he was in place at Esquire Chester's; and when I told him I would go to Esquire Chester's, then he said, he did not live there, but only said so; and then he begged for mercy.</p>

            . I happened to go over the Water Works Bridge, and saw Mr. Martin by the Two Star alehouse, and he said, that he was robbed, he did not say by who, he said, he should know the man again very well if he was to see him; I told him, I would do any thing to serve him; it happened to be my watch-night, and I said I would try if I could catch hold of any body. Mr. Fry was first, I said to Mr. Rowe, Do you go at such a distance; I was the third man, and my apprentice was the next; and we had a parson with us, but I don't know what's become of him; the Prisoner met Mr. Fry, and asked him, where he was going.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it that he met him?</p>

               <p>Wheeler. They met about forty yards on the other side of the Horse and Groom, between that and Perrot's illuminations, but it was nearest the Horse and Groom; when the Prisoner asked Mr. Fry where he was going, Mr. Fry said, he was going to London; then Mr. Rowe came, who was the second man; the Prisoner came up to Mr. Rowe, and, to the best of my knowledge, I saw him strike.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the Prisoner strike Rowe ?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. Yes, I did; with that I cried out. Here's the villain; I struck at him, and happened to strike him just down the back with a gun; and afterwards came my apprentice and another person, and my apprentice knocked him down into the ditch, with the bar of a door (which was the first thing he could light on) and then he resisted very much, and we were afraid the other should come up; I fired the gun at him, to make him stand, and then he went with us very quietly.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you carry him?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. We carried him to the Two Star alehouse, just by Mr. Martin's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he oppose going into the house?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. Yes, he took hold of one of the pillars of the door, and we got him by the lock of * hair upon the top of his head, and he cried out, Murder! and at last we got him into the house; I told him, he must go in, or I would shoot him; then I sent my apprentice to Mr. Martin's, and he brought him; Mr. Martin said, as soon as he came into the passage, the man was in the house, he knew by his voice; and then I took the Prisoner to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>* The Prisoner's hair was tied up, like many of the livery servants.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I say, take what I have, and spare my life?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. I don't remember that; I know I said if the law is on your side, you will be right; but if the law is against you, you must take what it will allow you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He told me, there was nothing but powder in the gun, and he fired it only to frighten me.</p>
               <p>Wheeler. I did not tell him any such thing.</p>
               <p>The Council for the Prisoner offered to prove where the Prisoner was from two o'clock in the afternoon till ten at night; and therefore if the robbery was committed at nine o'clock, the Prisoner could not be the person who committed this robbery; that he was informed, they had used some artisices to make him confess; but he always said, he was innocent, and that Mr. Martin sent a Romish Priest to tell him, that Mr. Martin was dead, and that he could not come to any damage, if he did confess the fact.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray Mr. Martin, did you send, or did you not send to Mr. Saunders, to let him know you was dead, and to desire that he would confess upon that account?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174405100008"/>Martin. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you privy to any such thing?</p>
               <p>Martin. No, I never was privy to any such thing.</p>
               <p>Jury. Pray Mr. Martin, was you in liquor at that time?</p>
               <p>Martin. No, I was not, I was very sober; I had been about business: they would not have meddled with me if I had had any body with me; they had enough as it was, only they had got a hanger.</p>

            . On the 17th of April, I had been at the Bun-House at Chelsea, and met the Prisoner about quarter before nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he walking or drinking?</p>
               <p>Paty. I met him there under the lamp.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you going?</p>
               <p>Paty. I was going to one Mr. Lerose's, to drink a pint of beer; for I intended to leave my watch there; we staid to drink a pint of beer at the dead wall; and he came with me as far as Hide-Park Corner; it was about five minutes after nine when I came from Chelsea, and I parted with him at Hide-Park Corner a quarter before ten - I have known him about ten years, he is a Gentleman's servant; he has been in several places, and I never heard him spoke disrespectfully of; he lived with Mr. Hutchins at Chelsea, and I don't think he would be guilty of any such act as this - I don't know how long he has been out of place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet any body in the Five Fields.</p>
               <p>Paty. No, there was a poor Scotsman lying among the pipes, we took him out of the ditch, and took care of him to Hide-Park Corner; he would have made us drink, but we would not accept of it.</p>
               <p>Watkins being examined, as to the Prisoner's character, said, he never heard any thing against his character in his life; and that gentle and simple always gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>- Lerose. I keep the Red Lion in Chelsea; on the 17th of April, the Prisoner came along with Paty (Mr. Mitchell's groom) to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he come?</p>
               <p>Lerose. I believe, as near as I can tell, it was about nine o'clock, or a l ittle after.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is your house from the Horse and Groom?</p>
               <p>Lerose. A good way - it may be two miles and a quarter, if not quite, but it is very near.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he look cool, or was he at all heated?</p>
               <p>Patey. He was not at all heated - he was not in a sweat - he was cool in his countenance - he did not look as if he had been in any violent motion.</p>
               <p>Jury, to the Constable. Was he searched, or was any thing found upon them?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. I did search him, but I found nothing upon him; he had private pockets about him, and though I found nothing when I searched him, he had money afterwards, for he treated me.</p>
               <p>Jury. If he had had a watch about him, and you had searched him, do you think you should not have found it?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. I believe I should if I had searched him strictly.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was not you informed of Mr. Martin's having lost a watch?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174405100009"/>Wheeler. Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Then why would you not search to find it?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. He had time enough to make it away before that, for I met Mr. Martin at a quarter after ten, and at the time I met the Prisoner it was nearer eleven.</p>
               <p>- Stanley, Esq; The first time I saw the Prisoner at the bar was in February was twelvemonths, at which time I was going down to offer my services at St. Albans, and having only one servant in town, my own servant, who had known him before, recommended him to me to serve me. I had during that time more than negative proofs of his honesty; for I sent my servant I had before, with more than 350 l. in bank notes to Mr. Child's, to desire him to let me have specie for them: my own servant brought me 250 l of the money, and the Prisoner brought me 100 l. very honestly, and by some circumstances I believe it would have been in his power to have taken away that 100 l. My own servant being disordered by riding in the country, I kept the Prisoner about a fortnight, during which time he was the only person intrusted with my linnen and clothes, and when he gave up the account of them there was nothing at all missing. I must also observe, that I never saw a more civil or sober servant than he was, and he always behaved himself in such a manner that I should not imagine him to be capable of the matter he is now charged with.</p>
               <p>- Lewis. I live in Bond Street, and am a hosier and haberdasher. I have known the Prisoner about two years, and during that time his character and behaviour (for what I know) has been honest and just. A young gentleman at my house wanted a servant, I enquired after several, and among them the Prisoner came, and he hired him from the character he had of him at Sir

            's, which was as good as any man could have; and upon it he had the young gentleman's place, where he behaved honestly and soberly. He was backward and forward at my house very often: he is a very sober man, I never saw him drunk in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Stanley. You say in about a fortnight's time he went from you, did he go from you upon any misbehaviour?</p>
               <p>- Stanley, Esq; He went away from me because my servant was well again; but if he had continued ill, or I had wanted another servant, I would have taken him preferable to any body I knew at that time.</p>
               <p>Jury. When they returned, did they come in company with this money, or did they come singly?</p>
               <p>- Stanley, Esq; They came in company. I do not know how far it may be proper to mention in evidence what my servant told me, who is absent; for when they were upon the road they were not so much in company, but that if he had had a mind to have gone away with the money he might.</p>

            . On the 20th of April as I was going through Eagle Court in the Strand, the Prisoner came up to me, and said, What have you got in your breeches? I put my hand to my breeches, and found my watch was gone. I took the Prisoner into the Street, and then into the Swan tavern. I sent for the guards, and took her before a justice - I had my watch about a quarter of an hour before - I had not been in any company, I had been in the city.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He had got two other women along with him, and he said I had got his watch, and had given it to another woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174405100010"/>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Hoskins. It was about nine o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Hoskins. It was dark.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know her then to be the person?</p>
               <p>Hoskins. Because we took her into the tavern.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober then?</p>
               <p>Hoskins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was an odd thing for a young gentleman to pick up a woman in the street, and was sober when you went about such a scandalous practice. Did not you charge two other women with it?</p>
               <p>Hoskins. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You followed no other but she and one more, what became of the other?</p>
               <p>Hoskins. There was a great mob about, and she got away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing upon the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Hoskins. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how could you charge her with taking your watch when she had nothing upon her?</p>
               <p>Hoskins. There was another woman came up to her, and I belive she gave it to her, for I missed it before the other woman came up.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she take it?</p>
               <p>Hoskins. She wrenched my breeches open, and then I suppose she took it. I never let her go after I took her till I carried her before the justice, for I charged her with it directly - I was going through Eagle Court, it is a thorough-fare, I did not go into the court with her.</p>

               <p>Mr. Forrest. I was coming along, I saw a quarrel, and looked into the croud, and saw Mr. Hoskins holding a woman (I think) by the collar, I assisted him, we got her into the tavern, she stripped herself, but the watch was not found upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Hoskins seem to be sober?</p>
               <p>Forrest. He did.</p>

            . I am servant to a fishwoman - I have seen the Prisoner come to my mistress's habitation. I was coming with a jole of salmon, and saw a gentleman (that last witness *) with two women, and they both had their clothes up in the court; so, says I, What do you go to play the rogue together, and they said get along you B - h, get along, and the woman pushed me down salmon and all.</p>
               <p>* Hobbins was mistaken, she did not know the Prosecutor from the witness, though they were very unlike. She delivered her evidence in a very odd manner, laughing most of the time.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw two women with the gentleman?</p>
               <p>Hobbins. Yes; and they had both of them their coats up.</p>
               <p>Q. What women were they; was it the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Hobbins. No, not this woman, for I went after the women for the salmon, for I knew my mistress would make me pay for it; so I said to the gentleman, you pushed me down, and the gentleman came up to the Prisoner, and said, you are one of the B - hes, and dragged her into the tavern. I stood a great while, and there came a great many soldiers, what became of the women afterwards I cannot tell; so, said my mistress, Do her all the service you can. - I am a Dutch woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you discern whether the gentleman was in liquor, you are upon your oath?</p>
               <p>Hobbins. Upon my oath he was very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Prisoner one of the women who was in company with the gentleman?</p>
               <p>Hobbins. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pursue the other two women?</p>
               <p>Hobbins. He run after them, but he could not overtake them; oh! L - d G - d bless me, this is the gentleman [she then happened to see the Prosecutor.]</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He had a beggar woman before the justice.</p>
               <p>Hoskins. I had hold of another woman, I had two women in my hand once.</p>
               <p>Q. You swore positively that from that time you took the Prisoner, you did not let her go?</p>
               <p>Hoskins. I did not let her go.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hobbins. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Hobbins. It was dark, it was between nine and ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Jury to Forrest. Were Hoskins and you acquainted before?</p>
               <p>Forrest. I never saw Mr. Hoskins before.</p>

            . On the 23d of April I happened to be abroad, and when I came home I was told the Prisoner was in a violent fit of the colic; I said, Nanny, you being something in years may have some disorder. She had a Miss a little before Christmas. I sent her some penny-royal water, and when I came up again I saw some further disorder, but no appearance of the birth of a child. I asked her what ailed her. [The witness expressed herself so as to show the nature of the Prisoner's disorder.] I sent for her aunt, and gave her that which was proper. In the morning the child was found in the yard. Her aunt came to me, and said, Mrs. Ditcher, Nanny has thrown it out. Said I, what has she thrown out? Why, a child, said she. Said I, you frighten me to death. I said, oh Nanny! how could you be so barbarous as to throw it out? Said she, Mrs. Ditcher, I did it to hide my shame, and for fear you should see it. I asked her, whether the child was alive when it was born, and she said it was not. I did not see it till next morning.</p>

            . I was called by the Coroner in order to examine this child, and upon examination of the child, I found it in the first place entirely free from all cleansing, but naturally as it came from the body. Upon examination, after they had cleansed it, I found there was a large contusion on the left cheek by the Os Temporum, there was a confraction of that and the jaw bone. I opened the Thorax to make an experiment upon the lungs, and some part of the lungs would swim, and some would not: she tore it away I suppose from her body. I saw upon opening the lungs that part of them were a little inflated, and would swim; this is a common experiment upon this subject, but by the tearing it away from her body, there was not time to inslate the lungs, and make them hollow. The child was blackish, which shows it was in a fluid slate while it was in the mother's body; but whether it had breathe or no after it came out of the body, I cannot pretend to say.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your general observation in cases of this nature?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174405100012"/>Kelleck. There is no role without an exception, sometimes, they may breathe before they come really into the world; I have tried that experiment many a time, but I cannot be downright certain and positive of it; but if you take an infant out of a woman's body (before it breathes) these lungs will never swim. Suppose a woman was six or seven months gone with child, and the child was dead within her, those lungs will never swim; but as children come forward in the birth, they may breathe before they are really born.</p>
               <p>Q. If a child is still-born, and dies before the delivery, the lungs will never swim; but if a child should die in the delivery, will they swim?</p>
               <p>Kelleck. It is possible they may, but I believe she was so hasty in the birth, that I apprehend she did not give time to let it breathe.</p>
               <p>Q. If the child had any respiration, would not the whole lungs be inflated with the first respiration?</p>
               <p>Kelleck. No; there must be several respirations before the whole lungs come to be inflated.</p>
               <p>Q. Now as to the contraction or expansion of the lungs, I would ask you, whether, if the actual respiration from which the blood circulates is performed for three or four seconds, all the lungs are not expanded?</p>
               <p>Kelleck. No; I believe not in so short a space.</p>
               <p>Q. Now in the case of a still-born child, will part of the lungs swim, and part sink?</p>
               <p>Kelleck. There have been experiments both ways.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose a child is suffocated in the delivery, in that case does it occur to you, that part of those lungs have swam, and part have sunk?</p>
               <p>Kelleck. Sometimes they have partly done so, and partly not, that is to say, if it was suffocated in the birth.</p>

               <p>Ditcher. Because she said when she flung it out at the window it was to hide her shame; and I asked her as to the other matters that belonged to the child, and she did not know what I meant. I asked her several questions afterwards, and she answered me as if she was delirious, particularly with relation to the manner of her delivery.

One Mr. Hakewell a jeweller in St. Martin's le Grand came to my master, and told him some of his servants had robbed him; for says he, there came into my hand seventeen pound of the same composition which I have had in my hand in your warehouse; Mr. Hopkins in Aldersgate Street brought me the glass, and I am satisfied it is yours: let your clerk come to my house, and I will get a light into this affair. I went to Mr. Hakewell's, he showed it me, and I was satisfied that it was our own: said he, if you will go to Duke's Place I will show you the person that sold it. I went into Duke's Place to

            , a Jew, who sold it to Mr. Hopkins the jeweller; and he went with me to enquire after the Prisoner, and Levi took him at an alehouse in Tower Street. [There were several sorts of the composition produced;] that in the basket is what the Prisoner sold, and here is some of Mr. Bowles's of the same number and colour.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to suspect the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Morse. The Prisoner has had access to our warehouse, under pretence of buying wine glasses, which he used to get flowered round the edges, and when the warehouse keeper was gone into the soror, where the glasses are neiled, the Prisoner had an opportunity of taking this out of the baskets.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the use of this composition?</p>
               <p>Morse. It is for the jewellers, it is for making pendants for the lady's ears, and jewels for the kidies necks. He will tell you an idle story by and by how he came by it, but I believe that will be of no avail to him, for I am pretty sure no body makes this composition but Mr. Bowles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use to buy any of this composition?</p>
               <p>Morse. No; he bought nothing but drinking glasses.</p>

            . The Prisoner at the bar came to my house in Duke's Place, and offered to sell me some composition of glass, I did not know the value of it, (I believe that is the same sort of glass) I told him I would go and enquire about it. I went and showed it to several people at the coffee-house, and nobody could tell what it was worth. I came back to him, and said I did not understand it; and said, if you think sit to leave it with me, I will show it to some gentlemen, and the Prisoner left it with me upon commission to sell for him if I could. I carried it to Mr. Hopkins a jeweller in Aldersgate Street, the Prisoner told me I must ask 4 s. a pound for it, and I asked Mr. Hopkins that price; he said that is too much, but if you will leave it with me, Mr. Levi, I will show it to a person who may buy it. I left it, and came to the Prisoner, and told him so, and that he must tell me the lowest price, and he told me I must take half a crown a pound, which was the lowest price, and Mr. Hopkins offered me half a crown a pound, and paid me two guineas: there was seventeen pound three ounces, and I brought the money to the Prisoner, and he gave me 3 s. and 6 d. for my trouble.</p>
               <p>Jury. Have not you seen large quantities of this glass in Mr. Hopkins's Shop ?</p>
               <p>Levi. No; I never saw any quantity of it in his shop, only the work that was made of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I carried the glass to Mr. Levi to dispose of for me because I was a stranger to that sort, and left it with him for two days, and he brought me 2 s. a pound for it; I told him I would rather have my glass again, and I said bring me the glass again, and he said there was no such thing as getting it again, for the gentleman would not part with it, so I was forced to take the 2 s. a pound for it, thought it cost me more.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you come by it?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I deal in glasses, I carry a basket about streets, I had it in exchange for some figured glasses, a pepper box, and several other things. I offered this glass to their warehouse-keeper to exchange for drinking glasses, and he would not take it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of this?</p>
               <p>Morse. I have been told so, our warehouse-keeper told me the Prisoner had been with three or four small pieces to change for drinking glasses, and that he made him this answer; our business is to sell this glass, we never take any again.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you sell it to any but jewellers?</p>
               <p>Morse. Never to any but jewellers as I know of.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is there nobody that makes this composition of glass besides Mr. Bowles?</p>
               <p>Morse. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>John Brown, a Juryman Sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of any composition of glass of the same nature with this, which is sold by other people?</p>
               <p>Brown. Yes; there is Mr. Batailliard and another person, and there is an apothecary and surgeon by Moorfields who make this composition. <rs id="t17440510-11-verdict61" type="verdictDescription">

He said, there was one Isaac, I cannot tell his other name, he goes by the name of Dumb Paw, [he has a lame hand] and Dobbs told me the meat was lodged at one Carpenter's in Gravel Lane. I went to Carpenter's house, and said, have you got any meat here? Yes, he said he had; said I, will you let me see it? yes, he said, and welcome; when he showed it me, said I, this is my meat. I asked him how he came to take it in, he said they told him they were going to Leadenhall Market with it. I asked him if he would let me have the favour of taking it away, he said yes, so I sent my son and another person and took the meat and sat away; the meat was vastly tumbled, and looked like dogs meat, and there was some of the sat in a bag that belonged to Mr. Carpenter.

I asked him how he came by it, he gave us no answer. I told him if he did not tell us how he came by it, he must go to the Compter, still he would not tell us his name, who he was, or where he had it; and as my brother officer had him in hand he confessed he had broke open a shop in Spittlefield's Market, (he did not tell it to me.) In the morning I had him before the Alderman at Guildhall, and then he confessed the whole fact - He confessed that he and Isaac, (I cannot tell his name, I think they call him Dumb Paw) broke open the shop with a chopper, that they took down the moulding of the window, and then took a shutter down, and then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174405100016"/> he went in and handed the meat out to Isaac, and they carried it to this Carpenter's house, and that they took two turns apiece, I believe it was the third time of his going that we took him.</p>

As soon as he came home, my boy came and told me, and then we went to his house, and took him and his wife together, but by some means or other the wife slipped away, and we thought she was gone for a set of Irish to make a rescue.

            . I happened to be attending the parliament house at Westminster, Mr. Clarke came to me, and said, they were seeking after a man who had committed a very great robbery, and desired I would go with him; I said I had no warrant; Mr. Clarke said you may detain a thief without a warrant, and the other constable (Appleton) and I, and Mr. Urton, went and took the Prisoner. The other constable bid me search his pockets while he held him, I only searched to see whether he had any knife, pistol, or other weapon, and then the other constable pulled several things out of his pocket.</p>

            . I went to the tavern to take half a pint of wine, and my kinsmen came to me, and told me that Mrs. Berridge's house was on fire. (this was last Monday was fortnight, April 23.) I went to the house, there was a constable, and a very great croud; said I to the constable, what are you here for, break the door open? I went first into the kitchen, there was no fire there, I came into the dining room and I was forced to go back the smell of fire was so strong. I went into the closet, then the fire began to burn, and the trunk was on fire. I clapped my hand upon it, and beat the fire in. Close to the wainscot they had placed this stool, [the stool was produced, which had been stuffed, but the covering was burnt; a trunk was also produced with a hole burnt through the lid about six or seven inches square, which Mrs. Berridge said was the trunk which she kept the plate in,] close to the stool they had placed this trunk, and the waincoat began to slake; the stool I slung out of the window, and I thought if there had been any thing in the trunk when I beat the fire in to have thrown that out of the window, but it was quite empty. They had so contrived it to set fire to these in the closet (for the next house to it is a cabinet maker's, and a slight wooden building) that if it had been in the night we should have been all in flames.</p>

            . On the 23d of April, it was on a Monday morning, I was going to market with my partner, I met Mr. Connor at the end of Maid's Court - it was between four and five in the morning, we bid good morrow to Mr. Connor, and he to us; when we came to Hog Lane I saw a sack lye upon the pavement, he ran to the sack, and took hold of it, and as he held hold of the sack he said this sack is very heavy, lend me a hand with it - he said you had better help me up with the bag, and he called out whether any body owned it, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174405100018"/> no body did; he said, it is very hard I must take this as no body owns it. My partner took hold of the sack with one hand to help him up, and I took hold of it and helped him up with it.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this, how long ago?</p>
               <p>Morson. I cannot tell how long, it was; April 23. St. George's Day.</p>
               <p>Q. What bulk was it?</p>
               <p>Morson. It was more than he could lift, or he would not have asked us to help him up with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it corn, or what was it?</p>
               <p>Morson. It felt like clothes - it felt hard and rattled, and he said afterwards, d - n it, there was nothing in but broken bottles and old rags.</p>

               <p>Morson. I do not know, it is by Peter's Street, near Soho Square, between Soho Square and St. Giles's.</p>

               <p>Q. What opinion had you of the boy before Price told you this?</p>
               <p>Tredgett. I thought he was a very honest boy; about an hour before, I had a very good opinion of him; I had no reason to think the contrary. I had a suspicion of Price for some months, and laid a trap to catch him. I was told of it three months ago. <rs id="t17440510-15-verdict85" type="verdictDescription">

After he was gone by, I said to my brother watchman, that man is a lead stealer. I had him in custody once before upon that account; so I stopped him, and found the lead upon him, hid under his coat. He said, he was going over the water, and I had no business with him. The lead was carried to Mr. Wall's house, and sitted exactly, and there was the same coloured paint upon the lead, as was upon a gutter, that joins to the door.</p>

            . On the 30th of December last, a little after nine o'clock at night, I was going home from St. Catharine's into Burr Street, where I live. Just as I came up by the King's Brewhouse, I saw four men stand opposite to me on the other side of the way talking and laughing. When I had got about ten yards from them, I heard somebody come after me. One of them came up to me, catched me by the shoulder, and asked me, what ship I belonged to; I answered, what was that to them. Another came on the right hand side of me, and said I must go to their officer. With that, my Lord, I told them, if they behaved like Gentlemen, and did not pull and hall me along. I would go with them. I had not walked above two or three steps before their officers (as they called them) came up to me, and one of them put a pistol to my mouth. and shoved me up against a palisado. When he had shoved me up against the rail, another came with another pistol, and they put one to each corner of my mouth, and said I must not speak, if I did they would shoot me. Then two of them came before me, and put their hands into my pockets, and I lost a guinea, a shilling, and some half pence. They asked me for my watch; I told them, I did not carry a watch. There was a little girl came out, who took me for her father, and cried out, oh lah, oh lah, what do you do to my father? I don't know what I should have done if it had not been for the child: one of them put a pistol to the child, which put me under more concern than I was under for myself.</p>

               <p>Pidgeon. When this Sherlock came up to me, I knew something of his face, but I cannot positively swear to Sherlock.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you take upon you to say that the prisoner was one of the four?</p>
               <p>Pidgeon. I cannot positively swear to him.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you say from what you saw at that time that the Prisoner was one of the persons?</p>

When I came they asked me if I had a mind to get a peny in an honest way. Said I, Don't think I am a coward, I'll go any where with you; so we concluded to go to meet with the first Chance we could - all four of us; we paid our reckoning, and went to a publick house in Bishopsgate Street, and there we had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174405100023"/> four pots of hot flip; from thence we went to White Chapel road, expecting to meet some coaches coming up, but happened to meet none (it was prodigious cold.) Then we stepped into Stepney Fields, expecting to meet somebody there, and we saw a boy with a link at a distance, and somebody with him. Expecting a prize, we all run, and I fell down and made my nose bleed, but we found it was only a joiner's boy with his hammer stuck in his apron. Then we concluded to go to the Round-about tavern in Wapping, to see if we could find any of the Captains of the Colliers, because it is used by them. We walked about for an hour, and met never a soul: then we went farther, and called at one

             stopped him and brought him to us; Cleaver stepped a little nearer, I believe, and they robbed him of shilling and some halfpence: Neagle clapped a pistol to his mouth, to keep him from crying out - The Prisoner had the money; I saw but a shilling and fivepence halfpeny.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you who he took it from?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. He could not tell the man's name, he said he took it from the person he had stopped; the prisoner came up to us with a great oath, and said, I have robbed him; but he did not say at first what he took from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the Prisoner ever a pistol?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. Upon my word, I cannot tell; for I don't remember that we had above one pistol between us four; there was but one pistol, and that Neagle had.</p>
               <p>Q. So he said he had got a shilling and fivepence halfpeny?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. No, he said he had got some money; and when we came to the night-house in Newgate Market, he said he had got a shilling and fivepence halfpeny. - It was about ten o'clock when we got there.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was Capt. Pidgeon that you robbed?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. I knew him in Holland, when he was Captain of a ship, and I was Mate of a merchant-man.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you meet Capt. Pidgeon ?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. I believe it was a little after nine; but it was almost ten when we came to the Night-house; and we spent the money there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said I shewed him a shilling and fivepence halfpeny, and then he said, they did not know what money I had got.</p>
               <p>Sherlock. I said, they did not know what money he had till he came to the night-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Sherlock there?</p>
               <p>Pidgeon. I had some knowledge of him, but I knew him when I was sent for the Wednesday following by Justice Willoughby to the Tower Goal.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Mr. Willoughby to send for you to the Tower Goal ?</p>
               <p>Pidgeon. He sent for me to acquaint me that a person was taken up the night before, and denied me to come and see whether I knew him; I went to the Tower Goal, and pitched upon him immediately, though I believe there were twenty people in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him at the time that you was robbed?</p>
               <p>Pidgeon. I knew him so well that I should remember him whenever I saw him again.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been then?</p>
               <p>Pidgeon. I had been to see a Lady home not above 100 yards from the place where they robbed me, and was returning back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you cannot say the Prisoner was one of them that robbed you?</p>
               <p>Pidgeon. I would not say so for the world - I believe he was one of them - They were all genteelly dressed, with ruffles, like Gentlemen; they were as well dressed as most people.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I met Sherlock by Inkester's door. Said he, How do you do? I said I was glad to see him, and would drink with him, and I said. I design to go to sea to-morrow, so we went into Mr. Inkester's, and I took my leave of him there; that is all I know of the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you say the first place you met the Prisoner at was in St. John's Square, not at Inkester's ?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. It was in St. John's Square, and we went from thence to the Round-about tavern.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Inkester's house?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. 'Tis at the Golden Lion by Wapping New Stairs.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the Prisoner on the 30th of December ?</p>
               <p>Inkester. I cannot tell the day of the month, because I did not take any particular notice of it; in a publick house we cannot tell what day of the month people come in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Sherlock and the Prisoner at your house in December after Christmas.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174405100024"/>Inkester. The Prisoner owed me a little money; he was a Gentleman's son, and had lodged at my house, and always paid me very honestly; the latter end of December he came to my house and told me he was going to sea the next morning: I cannot tell whether he went or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Sherlock there?</p>
               <p>Inkester. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they come into your house together?</p>
               <p>Inkester. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go away together?</p>
               <p>Inkester. Yes. I believe they did, I don't take much notice of these things; I leave such things to my wife and my servants - To the best of my knowledge they went away together.</p>
               <p>Q. When they were going from your house, did they seem as if they were going in company, or did they take leave of one another and part?</p>
               <p>Inkester. I believe they went away together; the Prisoner came to tell me he was going to sea; there was nothing of value between us to signify much; but it shewed an honest part, that he came to tell me he was going to sea.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any more in company?</p>
               <p>Inkester. Yes, I believe there were two more.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know one Neagle?</p>
               <p>Inkester. Upon my word, I don't know the man, neither do I know that ever I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know one Cleaver?</p>
               <p>Inkester. Upon my word, there are a great many people come to our house that I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know two people that go by those names?</p>
               <p>Inkester. I do not know them.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, there were two men in company, besides the Prisoner and Sherlock?</p>
               <p>Inkester. They were in the room, I don't know that they belonged to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing more to say?</p>
               <p>Inkester. That is what I have to say; the Prisoner has lodged four or five years in my house, and paid me very honestly; and I believe there is no body that knows any thing to his discredit, or to his dishonesty; and I think it was the part of an honest man, to come to tell me he was going to sea.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing more to say?</p>
               <p>Inkester. I have something more to say; his father is a merchant at Edinburgh; he has drawn upon his father for money, and he has sent bills to me for 20 l. 10 l. and 7 l. and they have been always very well paid by merchants in London; he was then Chief Mate of the Neptune, and was company for any Gentleman: I suppose you know Capt. Harris, who was one of the regulating Captains; the Prisoner was his Chief Mate, and kept his rendezvous at my house, and lodged there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Sometimes I have had letters of credit from Edinburgh, and they were commonly sent to his house, and they were very honestly paid; as to what Sherlock says, I know nothing of the matter.</p>
               <p>Jury. How was Sherlock dressed when he came that night?</p>
               <p>Inkester. To the best of my knowledge, with a shag coat, and a waistcoat trimmed with silver</p>
               <p>Q. Did he usually go so?</p>
               <p>Inkester. He used to go very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any ruffles on?</p>
               <p>Inkester. Upon my word I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. to Capt. Pidgeon. Did you see any of the persons that came upon you with a waistcoat trimmed with silver?</p>
               <p>Pidgeon. I cannot be positive to that, they were very handsomly dressed; it was cold weather, and their coats were buttoned up.</p>

I have used that rendezvous before and after; I always paid my men at this Inkester's house, on a Saturday night, and I never saw any thing by him but what was sober and modest; he was not given to cursing and swearing, as some sailors are, and that made me take more notice of him; if you have a mind to call any body to my character, you will judge whether I speak truth or no - I am an anchor Smith.</p>

I cannot tell whether it was the 29th or 30th; they came in brushing, as a great many gentlemen are apt to do; there were some of the Sandwich gang there; I told them, there was a press-gang in the house. Sherlock said, I don't mind that, for I belong to a gang myself; Sherlock threw open his coat, and there were two pistols and a hanger. When they were going, I asked who was to pay me; and Sherlock said to my husband, D - n you, you owe me money. I wanted to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174405100025"/> know how that was. Said I, Does my husband owe you any money? No, said Mr. Rockett, we owe him money. I went to see how the score was, and there was only two pots of beer; when Sherlock was taken up, I said to him, I am sorry for you, I hope you have not brought Rockett into this scrape; and Sherlock said, I am forced to do this to safe my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Sherlock at your house two days together?</p>

            .

He said, I believe you have had a shoplifter in your shop. After he was gone, I missed something. Mr. Wiseham came some time afterwards and brought me this remnant of printed cotton, which I had in the shop about a quarter of an hour before. I went directly to the Compter with Mr. Wiseham, and the Prisoner was there.</p>

            . On Monday the 23d of April, about four or five in the afternoon, as I was standing at my door, a person came to me, and said, there's one of the most notorious Shop-lifters in the Counter as ever was. Said I, I have lost a piece of calico this day, perhaps I may know the person. I went and looked at her, and she did not appear to be the person who was in my shop that day; I went back to my shop, and the person who told me she was a shop-lifter, said, she is gone into the Wheat-sheaf in Cheapside. I said, if she is so good a hand, may be she may make something; I went to that shop, and as I got there, she came out; I went into the shop, and asked Mr. Wealy whether he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174405100026"/> had lost any thing, for I was told, the woman was a notorious shop-lifter, and had lately returned from transportation. He said, he did not miss any thing; then I went to the Counter again afterwards, and the master of the Counter told me, if I would look into the cupboard, I might perhaps find my goods. The cupboard was opened, and I took this remnant of cotton out of the cupboard. I knew by the mark that it was Mr. Wealy's; so I went to him and asked him if he knew any thing of this, and he said, it is mine.</p>

            . Did you lock the cupboard door presently?</p>
               <p>Horabin. I did not lock it immediately; it was open some time, and the servant had the key, to take the liquors out; I was out of the room several times - I keep the tap on the master side of the Counter.</p>

               <p>Wealy. There was another woman in the shop after the Prisoner, but she went the other way; the Prisoner went one way, and she went the other; and if the other woman had gone the same way, she was not gone long enough to get to the Counter when Mr Wiseham brought me the cotton.</p>
               <p>Q How came you not to look over the goods as soon as the Prisoner went out of the shop?</p>
               <p>Wealy. Because I had not time till the other woman was gone - She bought four yards of painted cotton. <rs id="t17440510-26-verdict138" type="verdictDescription">

Upon that, I said, Don't shoot me, for that will do you no good, nor me neither. He laid hold of my horse's bridle again, and I put his hand away; then he put his hand in my pocket, and I put the gun away from my body with my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, he put his hand in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Bailey. Yes; he did three times.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to him?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I said, friend, what do you mean, I am not willing to be robbed? he then turned away from me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do then?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I turned myself a little from him, then he turned himself round to see if the Uxbridge road was clear, and shot at me after I was going from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174405100027"/>Q. How far were you gone from him?</p>
               <p>Bailey. About two pole I believe, not more, and I said to him, now you rogue, what good has this done you to shoot me, so he went to the stile from whence he came, and I saw no more of him, for my horse ran away with me, being frightened with the noise of the gun.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of the shot of the gun touch you?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I was shot into my right arm and out at my elbow, it shot the bone all to pieces, I have had abundance of stones and bones come out in an unaccountable manner, and I was near twenty weeks in a languishing condition with this wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the stones and bones come out of that wound?</p>
               <p>Bailey. They came out of the very same place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take any money from you?</p>
               <p>Bailey. He did not take any, he would have taken some, but I would not let him, for I put by his hand.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you say to him after he had shot you?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I said, you rogue, what good has it done you to shoot me? and then he went over the stile - I cannot say he went over the stile, but I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Q. What time o'night was it?</p>
               <p>Bailey. It was about seven o'clock, it was a clear star light night, I saw him three poles before he came to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before?</p>

               <p>Bailey. Yes; and I knew his father very well, the Prisoner lived then at Hillingdon End, and I believe he does now.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any disguise over his face?</p>
               <p>Bailey. No; none at all that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time observe any thing of his voice?</p>
               <p>Bailey. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the words he said to you?</p>
               <p>Bailey. He gave me no other words, but bid me stand and deliver my money, those were all the words that came from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you see the Prisoner, can you take upon you to swear that he is the man?</p>
               <p>Bailey. That is the man, and nobody else - For the Prisoner. Here is a commitment of another * person for the same fact, and Bailey kept him seventeen weeks in prison, and never appeared against him at the goal delivery.</p>

I went to him, and asked him as to the circumstances of the fact, and he said much the same as he has said now; I asked him who it was that did it. He said, he did not care to say who it was. I asked him whether it was Bowry: He said it was not him, as he said with respect to two or three other names that I mentioned. I asked him whether he would swear to any thing; he did not care to do it (he was in a very weak condition) but he said, if he lived to come abroad again, and was to see the man, he should know him as well as any man in England; I believe he was a little conscientious, as he thought himself a dying man, and so did not care to swear to any body.

I bid her call in the morning; she did so; and I went with her almost to Mr. Alexander's, the Proctor; I saw her and Mr. Alexander go to Doctors Commons, and I went into the Bell Inn. In about half an hour's time she came and said she had done the business. I gave her some money to pay for the will, which I think was six or seven shillings.

               <p>Q. Do you remember the Prisoner being with you upon any occasion?</p>
               <p>Major. I do remember the Prisoner very well, I am certain to her. On the 18th of November last she came to my office with a woman, who went by the name of Frail, and who had proved a will three days before. She said she had brought another woman whose husband was dead in the same ship that hers died in, and the Prisoner produced this will, and I wrote what we call the jurat upon it, and she was sworn before Dr. Chapman. She said she apprehended the effects did not amount to twenty pound, and I think she obtained a probate for six shillings, because the fees when the effects are under twenty pound are very low in the office. She had a bruise on one of her eyes, and she accounted for it in this manner: that she was lately come from Worcester, and by the waggon being turned over she had got that bruise. I told her I had lately been at Worcester, and that it was my mother country, and upon that we had some discourse. I told her as she was a stranger in town my clerk should go with her to the office, and I believe I sent my clerk with her, and the wages due were 42 l. 16 s. 5 d. and she did obtain the second probate on the 28th of November, 1743, before Dr. Chapman, and then the former probate was brought in and declared null and void, and she was resworn as the widow of this man, and sole executrix. She said she had not money for the second probate, by my bill there is due to me 2 l. 12 s. The last time I saw her at my office, she said she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174405100033"/> could not get the money, it being paid to another person. When I take a probate out in the Bishop of London's office, I enter it in the Prerogative to prevent a forged will being brought in.</p>
               <p>Q. How come the money to be paid to another person?</p>
               <p>Major. There was a probate granted in some inferior court, either at Deptford or Greenwich, &amp;c. but not at Doctor's Commons.</p>

He wrote the probate, and got her sworn; and she telling him a story of her coming from Worcester, that she was overturned in the waggon, very much bruised, and forced to lye by a month, and not knowing the town, Mr. Major desired I would go to the Navy Office with her. She had at first sworn that the effects were under twenty pound, and when I came to the office I was informed there were upwards of forty pound, and they would not pay it upon that probate, so I was obliged to get another probate. When that probate was made out which was the 28th of Nov. I went again to the office, and after a great deal of trouble in going several times to the Pay Office and Navy Office, at last I found by Mr. Turner that the money was paid to one

               <p>Rawlinson. About two or three years (but I call her Wollin frequently before her husband.) I cannot be certain how long she has been married; for I have a very bad memory - I don't know what business her husband was of; I never was much within the house only as to speaking or drinking, with her - I did live in the New Street in Goodman's Fields, and she lived in Ashffe Street; I had now in Cobb's Court in Black Friers, and have these two years.</p>

               <p>Rawlinson. I have seen her more than a dozen times, and have drank with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Now as you were so little acquainted with her, how came the name of Wollin so much in your mouth, that you cannot think of the name of Rochead?</p>

               <p>Council for the Prisoner. Were you to satisfy her for her risque.</p>
               <p>Sherlock. No; she was to run the risque herself. I showed her to Mr. Alexander's door, and she went and proved the will. I went home, and sent Aickin<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174405100035"/> and the Prisoner to Mr. Parr's in Crutched Friers, but they could not dispose of it there. He asked her some questions, and she said three ways two years: he asked her how long her husband had been on board, and she said two years: he asked how long he had been dead, and she said two years; and she said two years to another question: he said he believed she did not come honestly by it. Then I went to Gulliland in St. Catharine's, and he could not get it sold directly; Gulliland, Aickin, and I, went to the Ticket Office, and had it cast up - it was about 30 l. Some time afterwards Gulliland, the Prisoner, and I, went to a notary publick not a great way off, and who should come in while we were there but Mr. Tarver a merchant, and the bill of sale was made over to Mr. Tarver, (Aickin waited at the Woolpack in Birchin Lane.) After it was filled up, Mr. Tarver asked her to write her name, and she said she could not write, but she would set her mark; and Mr. Tarver said it is no matter whether you can write or no, for your mark will hang you as well as your hand writing. Gulliland, the Prisoner, and I, went into the Woolpack, Gulliland had a 20 l. note of Alderman Hankey's, which was payable to Mr. Tarver, and Gulliland brought the money; it was part in Portugal gold, and part in guineas; then Gulliland, the Prisoner, and I, went to the King's Arms Tavern in Lombard Street, and there he gave me the money, I think it was 15 l. or 16 l. - He said he knew the name as well as I, and that he had as much right to it as I, and he had three or four pound gratis besides 3 s. 6 d. in the pound, which he kept for the discount of the ticket; and I was not willing to make words about it, because I knew how it was, and the last day of January I put all of them in my information voluntarily before any body else, - I gave the Prisoner two guineas for her trouble, and I gave Aickin two guineas and a half; the Prisoner grumbled, and thought she had not enough, and I told her I would satisfy her, and I believe I gave her some silver to buy some fish.</p>

            . I went out of Town the 1st of March to go the midland circuit, and lost these coins which I have in my hand, and for which the prisoner stands indicted, locked up in a cabinet together, with a great many other old English Coins. In my absence, I was informed by a letter that all my gold and some of my silver coins were sold: when I came to town I found them all gone; I advertised them in several news-papers, that the public might have notice, that such a remarkable collection of English coins which are hardly to be found again in the Kingdom, from Edward the 3d to this time, were lost. Mr. Burgess a refiner came to my house, and brought me this parcel of coins, which I can swear are my own coins which I lost. It seems to be a little particular to swear to such a thing as money, and therefore I will give you a little trouble to show you that these are my own in Distinction from others, among these coins there is a counterfeit coin of Queen Elizabeth, it is silver gilt over, I have put it into the fire several times to remove the gilding which has done it some damage, and there are some pieces so remarkable in other respects that I can swear these are what were stole out of my house; the Prisoner was brought to my house and afterwards taken to Sir

             (who had been a Footman of my own) had given them to him to dispose of. He said he lodged at the Bull and Gate in Holbourn; there was an inquiry made after him, but the man was gone from that place, and the justice thought fit that the prisoner should be prosecuted: and I did consent he should be committed for further examination. When the justice was making his commitment, he was under some concern, and said, he believed he might take Gratrix at his own house, his saying that, is the occasion of my bringing him before you; for as the prisoner has the character of an honest man, I inquired into the acquaintance that was between him and Gratrix, and I found he is his nephew, not his nephew by blood, but by affinity; I thought it would be very hard to keep this man in prison, and therefore I thought fit to lay this thing before you, as I think it is my duty in order to do justice to my Country, that you may censure him as you think proper.</p>

I am a refiner, the 30th of March the Prisoner brought some gold coins to know the most I could give for them; I told him the most I could give was 3 l. 18 s. an ounce. He desired I would weigh them, and make a note of them. After I had bought them, I put them in a paper till I had an opportunity of looking them over. When I came to look them over, I had some reason to think that they belonged to some collection. My partner (Mr. Scot) immediately thought of Mr. White, and I went to Mr. White's to know if they were his, and he told me they were his.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the Advertiser then?</p>
               <p>Burgess. No, not then; I told Mr. White I would bring the man I bought them of, for he told me he lodged at the Bull and Gate in Holborn. I went there, they said he lodged there the night before, but was gone.</p>

Mr. Serjeant did some time ago live in the house that I lived in, and he used to come and demand money of me; he said I was indebted to him 48 s. 6 d. I desired to know for what; he said, I knew very well. I desired a bill of him; he said we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174405100038"/> attornies never make any bills; then said I, how should I know what to pay you?</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a sworn attorney?</p>
               <p>Cooke. I cannot tell that, I asked Summers for the money for the note. He said he had paid money enough already - Summers was prosecuted at my suit upon this note, and the Prisoner was my attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the note delivered back to you?</p>
               <p>Cooke. Yes; and the Prisoner came to me for 48 s. 6 d. I said I had paid a great deal of money upon the prosecution of that note, and that the note was of no signification to me; and Serjeant said it would be of signification to him, and so he arrested me for the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take the note from you?</p>
               <p>Cooke. He took the note off my counter, and arrested me for it again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take it before your face?</p>
               <p>Cooke. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he arrest you upon this very note?</p>
               <p>Cooke. He arrested me for three guineas, and the man (Summers) had paid him all the money but 8 s. 6 d. - I said the note is of no signification to me as the man who owes the money is come out of goal.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take the note in your presence?</p>
               <p>Cooke. He took it up off the counter, and carried it away.</p>

I asked her how she came by it. She said she bought it of one Messenger, a constable in Artillery Lane, and gave him 28 s. for it; and she said, she wanted to sell it to sit her husband out to sea. I bid her 19 s. she went away, but came back and took my money. A man came to my shop to enquire after such a thing, that was taken off a child's neck of three years old. In about a quarter of an hour I saw the Prisoner buying a cheesecake, she was with another woman, and the two children wanted a cheesecake. Said I, Mistress, do you love cheesecakes?

            . Chapter 4. Section 3. is made imprisonment for life, or at the pleasure of the King.</p>
               <p>Capt. Samuel Hall. We have a club of officers who meet at Mr. Walker's at the Griffin in York Buildings. On the 4th of March, about a eleven o'clock, Mr. Walker came up and said, Capt. Hall, there are some of the neighbours below stairs, who have informed me, there is a Romish Priest in the house. I said, Who is it? He said, his name is Morris. Said I, I know Morris, he is reputed to be a Romish Priest; said I, go down, and give my service to him, and tell him, it is not a proper time for him, who is a popish Priest, to be here, and to desire him to go about his business. He came and told me Mr. Morris returned me thanks; but said, it was more than I or any body else could prove. Mr. Morris then went away, but he was pursued and taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I desire to know whether that witness can prove that I said, he could not prove that I was a Popish Priest. I speak this to shew that I would not send such an abrupt message to any Gentleman.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. Can you prove that he is a Popish Priest?</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. Yes, we can; and that he owned himself to be a Popish Priest.</p>

In the bar there is a cupboard that my wife puts the money in; she took the money out into a room which is by the bar, and told a 3 l. 12 s. two guineas and some silver, and put it into a tin box in the cupboard (I saw all this) and left her bunch of keys hanging in the door, in about a quarter of an hour she called me out, and I went into the room to her, and left the Prisoner in the bar, in about five minutes two gentlemen knocked at the door, who came to spend the evening with a distiller that this money was to be paid to: the Prisoner still continued in the bar, drank up his beer, and went away; about a quarter of an hour after that my wife went to look for the money to pay the distiller, and the money was missing. Says she this man (Proctor) has taken the money away, what shall I do? Said I, perhaps he has only taken it in jest - The Prisoner is a cage maker or wire worker by business, and used to come sometimes with the officers. I went to his lodging, his wife said he had been at home, but was gone out again. I went to Mr. Guy's in Leadenhall Street to enquire after him, because he said he had been out with him to arrest some body, but he was not there. About eleven o'clock he came to my house, I had told Guy of it, and he had told him what I had said; the Prisoner told me he came on purpose to clear himself - he was admitted to bail.</p>

             confirmed the evidence of her husband with regard to the Prisoner's being in the bar, that she put the money (3 l. 12 s. two guineas, and six shillings) into the cupboard, and that no body had been in the bar from the time she put the money in till she missed it, but the maid servant. That when he came at eleven o'clock as he said to clear himself, her husband said, you have done a fine joke to take the money out of the cupboard, and he said, if you think it is a joke, I have done it in earnest.</p>
