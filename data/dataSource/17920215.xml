On the 4th of February, between six and eight o'clock in the evening, Saturday, I was in the shop, and a boy who takes out parcels,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179202150003"/>and no one else. This woman came into the shop, and asked for half a yard of linen cloth, which is here, and paid for it. After she asked to look at some printed cottons for gowns; I shewed her a vast number. She then asked to look at several other articles, and made as if she meant to purchase them, but with no intent to pay for them. She agreed for them, and had them cut off from the pieces. The last thing of all she looked at was some check for aprons, and I shewed her at least twenty pieces; and I was looking for a measure, she run immediately quite out of the shop. I jumped over the counter, and went after her, not thinking she had got any thing; she had got near one hundred yards, and fell down; I got up to her, and on taking her up, she said she had lost it; I asked her what she had lost, and from under her I took this piece of cotton. She fell down in putting her foot on the pavement; she slipped, and on taking her up, this lay under her. It was one of the pieces of the cotton I had cut off for her; all the other things were left behind excepting this that she had agreed for; she did not produce any money except 6 d. for the first half-yard, and that was before I shewed her the cotton.

When we came near Cannon-street, Ratcliff-highway, I saw three men, but I took no notice, having no thought. When we came to Nightingale-lane, which is a coach-standing, Mrs. Alexander's niece's husband was waiting for us; she asked me, if her husband should see me home? I declined it; he was on the opposite side, and then Mrs. Alexander and myself proceeded on towards Shadwell, where I live. I seeing the men behind me not very far, I said to Mrs. Alexander, in our language, I am certain they were bad men, because they had not left us from the time I first saw them, but had not seen their faces. I said to Mrs. Alexander, in Hebrew, I would wish to see these men walk before us; with that we made a stop; they walked on before till they came where there was some girls, and they stopped; and then we walked on again before them. We see a watchman a little way off with a lanthorn on the same side of the way before us; Mrs. Alexander said, you had better walk till we come to the watch, because I am rather afraid; I said, there is no call to be afraid, we are near now on our own spot. I was within forty or fifty yards of my own house. I then said to Mrs. Alexander, I see my own watchman, which I did not, but I thought that they might then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179202150004"/>be frightened, and walk off. With that one of the men rushed through the middle betwixt Mrs. Alexander and me, and made a full stop, and faced me, that I had a proper observation of his person; it was under a lamp, and it was light; I could have seen to have picked up a farthing from the street; I saw his face perfectly well; it was the prisoner with his hair on his shoulders, (

I said, No, fellow, what do you want? They said, they were not thieves. With that he snatched my hat, and tete and cap from my head. I cried out, Stop thief! I am robbed! Mrs. Alexander cried out, Watchman! but never a one came to our assistance. Dowdell took my hat, and threw it the other two, the cap and tete fell in the mud, Mrs. Alexander picked them up. Nobody pursued the men. I saw Dowdell go down New Gravel-lane; my fright was so great, I did not go after them; the watchmen were close to them, but did not offer to pursue or take them. The prisoners were apprehended on Friday. I had money, but they did not ask me for any; they did not even ask for my hat.</p>

               <p>Did you know their persons? - I did two out of the three; it was star-light; I had never seen them before; there were lamps opposite, not on the same side of the way; I was a good deal alarmed; I saw one the next morning, and I swore to him at the office; I was sent for to go there; I knew him directly; it is the furthest off, Wiltshire.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you was so much mistress of yourself as to observe him? - I was; he did not take the bundle; he stood with the pistol at my right-hand, opposite; he put the mouth of the pistol to my cheek, it touched it.</p>
               <p>You was very much alarmed? - I was.</p>
               <p>Did you see the face of the other? - I did; it was Gillthorpe, I am sure; he took the bundle; he was close to me.</p>
               <p>How long did this last? - Not above ten minutes; I begged for them not to take my bundle; they swore they would have it; I don't know justly who it was: after they had taken my bundle, I went into the Rose and Crown, at the bottom of the road, and gave an alarm that I had been robbed, and described the men; when somebody went to the office, and gave the information immediately, and I went to the office the next morning; they were dressed the same as on the night before; I had never seen them before that night; they took nothing more than the bundle, and the cloaks; they did not offer to search my pockets.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Counsel for Wiltshire. You have told us very fairly that you had never seen the people before; and that you was, as every body in your circumstances must have been, very much alarmed? - I was.</p>
               <p>Before you went to the office, you had been apprised that the officers had taken somebody that was suspected? - I was.</p>
               <p>Gillthorpe's Counsel. When was it you saw Gillthorpe after the robbery? - A fortnight and a day.</p>
               <p>You said you had never seen the prisoners before; Gillthorpe was not taken up by your description, I believe? - I don't know that.</p>
               <p>You saw him in custody, but not taken up by your description? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>It was a very dark night, I believe? - Not very dark.</p>
               <p>There was no moon? - It was star-light, and there was a lamp opposite; I am very sure they are the men.</p>
               <p>You was very much frightened, you have said? - I was not frightened before the pistol came; but, by being stopped twice, I had an opportunity of looking at them more.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I had been drinking in Newgate-market, and about two o'clock I came with a woman to St. Paul's; she said she would go with me if I would call a coach; I called a coach, and went to Holborn, and from thence to Gough-square; the woman did not go with me, so I thought it was as well to go to somebody that I knew; when I got to Gough-square, I could not get in; therefore I walked back to Creed-lane, No. 2, a place well known: before the aldermen none of the watchmen could swear to me, or even say they knew me.</p>

               <p>February the 2d, about half past twelve in the day, I called at Mrs. Branch's; Mrs. Branch shewed me three bundles of hairs which were offered to her for sale, and that a woman had brought in the morning; I asked her why she did not detain her, as she asked 1 s. 6 d. for goods worth 3 s. 9 d. the boy servant of Mrs. Branch watched the woman out, and saw her join another woman; Jackson worked for me a year and half; I was led to suspect the prisoner from the hairs being tied with lay-cord, which is used in tying up mops; I applied at Bow-street, but could not obtain a warrant, as I had not missed any thing; my foreman went to the house the woman was watched to;

               <p>I am foreman to Mr. Morley: I went to the prisoner's room with James Willson and Mrs. Branch's apprentice, it was between ten and eleven o'clock; Mrs. Turnbull told me that Mrs. Garnes had sent Mrs. Hurst with some of her husband's bristles to Mrs. Branch to sell; I advised Mr. Morley to go home to the prisoner; I saw in his room several things belonging to Morley; I saw the box opened; the first thing I took out was two trumpet hearth stocks; I told the prisoner they were his master's property; (produces one;) this is my master's property; I know them by the make, and the wood; other tradesmen have the like goods, the same pattern. (Produces several small bundles of hogs bristles.) When I took them in my hand, I knew them to be Morley's, by their being damaged; and being so damaged, they cannot be manufactured by themselves; on feeling them, they have a clammy, greasy feel; I swear they are Morley's.</p>
               <p>Jury. Point the mark out that you can swear to these bristles by. - They are nearly effaced, from frequent handling. (Produces a parcel of brush boards.) These brush boards are Morley's; the trade have not had any timber of this sort for many months; it is called whole-ends; Primmer, who is in Court, can further identify them. (Produces some broom-stocks.) These were made by Carr, of Tunbridge; these are not manufactured by Morley; therefore have not his mark: I do not swear to the wire-board.</p>

When Jackson was going to be conveyed from his lodgings, Langdale and Jackson being on the stairs, he begged he might return, and speak to me; they returned, and Jackson declared the property to be mine; he was not stimulated by any promise of favour, or by any threat; he said he would give it up to me, if I would not expose him to the trade.</p>

On Saturday preceding the 18th of January, my brother in law called upon me; there were some people in my room, so that I could not talk to him; when he went down I followed him, I told him in the passage we had got some money, and begged him to come in the middle of the week to place out the money with Mr. Kirkman; when he was gone, Mrs. Baker came out and said, is that your brother? I said yes; she said, he is a pretty man; she then said, I find you have got money. On Monday I was going out to buy potatoes, Mrs. Baker said, where are you going? I said only to buy some potatoes: she said, if you leave that girl at home, you will repent every vein in your heart; I told her I had no suspicion of the girl; but if she had, to go up stairs, and wait till my return: she said she would go up and make a pretence to borrow the rolling-pin. On the same day she wanted me to go with her and buy a pair of pattens; I refused; she then wanted me to go and buy a patch for a gown; I refused. The same day, about two o'clock, she wanted me to go to Cranbourn-alley, to see some of the Dutchess of York's bonnet's; I said, I will not go: she then pressed me to go to see the King and Queen going to court; still I refused. On Tuesday I was going to washing, and she said, I had better go out, the air would do me good; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179202150022"/>said I would not. On Wednesday she came up and lighted a candle, and asked me if I would go and see the King go to Court; I refused; she asked me whether I was going to market; I said yes: she said if you leave Nanny in the house, you may take my word you will be robbed: I asked the girl to go to market: she said she would; then she said, if Nanny and me went to market, she would boil the kettle against our coming back; I said, I will drink tea before I go; I did so, and she went to market with me and the girl; after we had got about five yards from the house, Mrs. Baker said, Nanny, have you shut the door, go back and see if it is safe? she did so, and joined us again; when I went out I did not know of any person being in the house; there were four men lodged in the back-room, I shut that room window about a minute before I went out, there was not any body in that room; we went to Lombard-court, she wanted me to go into a linen-draper's shop to look at some shawls; I said no. I did not want any; then she said, Mrs. Ashley, this is the first time I have been out with you, what will you drink? I said nothing, it will make me sick; we were gone about an hour; when I got home I saw the lid of the chest open in which we kept our money, open and propped up by the lid of the till; it was broke open; the girl was at home about two minutes before me, not more; she said to Hunt she is ruined; I heard that before I got up stairs, the pen-case was kept in the till, and the several articles mentioned in the indictment, the drawers had all been broken open, and the things thrown about; the watch hung over the mantle-piece, the lock was broke open, and it is an extraordinary good one; I was very much alarmed, and I went into fits. On Thursday morning Baker and his wife were taken up, I went down into their apartment, I saw Mr. De la Fontaine pick up this pen-case, it was on the floor under the bed; Mrs. Baker said, Mrs. Ashley has put that there; I left two receipts for rent in the till, that I swear, these receipts were found in the room, but not by me; they were picked up by the constable.</p>

No body was left in Mrs. Ashley's apartments; when I got a little way from the house, Mrs. Baker said, have you shut the door? I went back and found it fast; when we went out I left the door of Ashley's room double locked, and when I returned I found it only single<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179202150023"/>locked; I saw the chest broke open; I shrieked out, and Hunt, the publican, ran into the house; Mrs. Ashley came home in about two minutes after I had got home: when Mrs. Baker came home, Mrs. Ashley said, are you not a base woman to take me out, and let your gang rob me? I was in the front room when the officers searched; one of them took up a bonnet, and under it he found two papers with Ashley's name on them: I cried out, Oh, Lord!</p>

               <p>I went on Thursday the 19th of January and searched the apartments of Baker: under the bed, which lay on the floor, I found this pen-case (produced); it must have been placed under the bed, it could not have fallen there by accident; Mrs. Ashley immediately screamed out, and said it was her property: I searched the husband when he came home, and found nothing on him but half-a-guinea, and three or four shillings; I returned that to him: on his re-examination, I was at the Brown Bear, Bow-street, and in the same room with the prisoner; I pretended to go to sleep, and drew my breath hard, to induce them to think I was asleep; I heard Baker say, What a fool you are, having a whole night to take care of the things, to have these things found in your possession; I had sooner the whole bulk of money had been found in my hands, going out with it, than that those things should be found in your possession; this was said in a low tone of voice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Having heard this, did you state it before the magistrate? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you sign your examination? - I believe not.</p>
               <p>Who was the magistrate? - Mr. Addington.</p>
               <p>So much for memory: pray did you see me there? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What day of the week was it that he was re-examined; upon your oath, have you never told any body, before he was fully committed, of this conversation? - Never.</p>
               <p>You never told Mr. Briant so? - No.</p>
               <p>What day of the week was it that he was re-examined? - I think it was on a Thursday.</p>
               <p>What time of day was it they were re-examined? - I believe it was between seven and eight.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was the first examination in the forenoon? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Briant came to the Brown Bear, as solicitor on the part of the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. How long have you been at Bow-street? - Twelve months.</p>
               <p>Do you know of any reward in this case? - I do not; I made inquiry of Mr. Groves, and he said he did not think there was any in this case.</p>

               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Do you not know jobbers to buy and sell the same day; is it a singular thing; if so, how came it not to be noticed in the year 1790? - I have not inspected accounts, so I do not know; but ten years ago, when I inspected accounts, I remember that to have been done; when the books shut the 1st of December, and were opened the 19th of January.</p>
               <p>For what purpose are the clerks put? - To assist paying the dividends.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. What happened ten years ago was the selling some stock that had been bought the same day? - It was; it is not against all general orders; it is in cases of legacies, and on some particular occasions, when a person will not be in town the next day.</p>

Consols; I told him yes, I had; he then said, that owing to the multiplicity of names, and the hurry of business, there had been a mistake; that a person had received a dividend of 400 l. stock of mine, but had given him the money to pay me with, if I would accept of it; I told him, no; if there was any mistake, I would chuse to have it rectified at the Bank tomorrow; says he, it is a holiday, and no business done; come on Thursday; I told him yes, if nothing particular happened; he then told me that his name was Shaw, he had been some years in the 3 per Cent. office, and that he was very well known: on Thursday I went to the Bank; I found out the broker, and went to the 3 per Cent. office, and saw the chief clerk, who informed me that my stock stood right in the ledger, but the dividend-warrant was made out for 250 l. only; Mr. Vicary was the chief clerk.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. This conversation was on the 17th; you did not come till the 19th; he told you his name, and that he was a clerk of the Bank, and exceedingly well known? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am one of the chief clerks in the Bank: on Mr. Sladden's coming to the office, I looked into the state of the ledger, and found 650 l. to his credit.</p>
               <p>In what manner is the preparation for the dividend-warrants? - The books are shut at a certain time, when no transfers can be made, or paid, then of course the several stock-holders stocks had to the ledger; balances are taken on those stock-accounts, and dividend-warrants prepared on those balances, from the balance-sheet; the clerks in general do that; one takes the ledger, the other the slip; Mr. Shaw appears on the ledger to have over credit for 400 l., a false credit, which if taken from that improper place, Mr. Shaw's, and put in its proper place, Mr. Sladden's, it would have made Mr. Sladden's just 650 l. on the balance-sheet; the 400 l. being, in addition to his 250 l. which he had there, 650 l. and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179202150031"/>then Sladden would have his whole dividend on the 650 l.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Vicary. Was there a person of the name of Hands in the 3 per Cents.? - There was.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect seeing Mr. Shaw and Mr. Hands after Mr. Sladden came to the Bank on the 19th? - I did.</p>
               <p>Was that before or after Mr. Shaw was apprized that he must be examined by the Directors? - Before: in that instance it appears that 250 l. was called out to the name of Sladden.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shaw had nothing to do in making out that bill? - None in the least.</p>
               <p>Had any thing passed between you and Mr. Shaw? - I went and asked Mr. Shaw what mistakes had happened in the office, and what occasioned him to go to Kensington on the Tuesday; he muttered something, and attempted to speak to Mr. Hands, and did speak, as it appeared from what passed; I am not positive, because I was at a distance; soon after that, Mr. Shaw was sent for; I don't know that any intimacy has subsisted between Mr. Shaw and Mr. Hands; he has absconded, and is advertised for that and other offences.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. I believe no clerk in the Transfer-office does business in his own letter? - No, except he is in the place.</p>
               <p>Are they never placed in the letter where they have stock? - It is not particularly attended to; I believe he was not placed in letter S.</p>
               <p>The ticket that is put into a box a clerk takes it out, and compares it with the stock in the box? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was this balance taken by Mr. Shaw? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Do you not know that often mistakes have happened by people who job? - Certainly there have.</p>
               <p>Do you know that it frequently happens that a man buys and sells stock in the same day? - I cannot say; I don't know, except in cases of necessity.</p>
               <p>Is it not frequently done by a gratuity to the clerk? - It may be, but I don't allow it.</p>
               <p>Mr. WALSH sworn.</p>
               <p>I produce the ticket of the transfer in this particular instance, passed by Mr. Hands, whose duty it was in this particular instance to pass it.</p>

               <p>I am a clerk at the Bank; this is my balance-sheet belonging to the letter S. of my ledger for January, including Sladden's and Shaw's dividend; Mr. Hands made out the money; he assisted; they are not his figures, I don't know whose they are.</p>

               <p>On the 16th of November had Mr. Shaw 200 l. 3 per Cent. Consols.? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Had he any money at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Now I would ask you, whether, on the 30th of September, he had the sum of 200 l. or any other sum, in the Consols? - No.</p>
               <p>The department in which Mr. Shaw was engaged, was clerk in the Transfer-office? - It was no part of his business to deal in the payment of the dividends; it was the first or second day, and I believe the last is dated on that day.</p>
               <p>Was it his ordinary business to pay dividends? - No, his regular business was to transfer, except for the first day or two of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179202150032"/>paying dividends, when we send the clerks in to assist, and I believe Mr. Shaw went in.</p>
               <p>From the 18th of May, 1789, till this time, had he ever had more than 20 l. in his account in the Consols? - No, and that was there only to the 6th of August; there was none remaining more than a day.</p>
               <p>Do you permit that transaction to take place of buying and selling on the same day? - Not except in particular cases.</p>

            : these were not the stockings I put by; they were from another parcel; I am certain they were taken out of the parcel on the counter; I remembered seeing this pair on the counter, when I shewed the stockings to him; I knew them by the mark; I am sure they were in the parcel when he came into the shop; there were more pairs than one in the parcel with my mark, but I know this by the pattern; they were coloured silk without clocks; I have sold some in the shop of the same pattern, but not to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you know the number that was in the parcel? - No.</p>
               <p>Till he dropped the stockings, was you aware that he had any? - From what he had done, and I saw him in the motion of putting them in his pocket; I believe there was but one pair of that pattern in the parcel.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179202150042"/>Suppose you had not suspected any thing, should you have missed these stockings from the parcel? - I don't suppose I should.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Upcott, I observe these stockings are a very common pattern? - They are a very particular pattern, it has not been made above six weeks.</p>
               <p>You said you were sure this pair was there when the prisoner came in; can you venture to swear that these stockings were in the parcel? - I am as positive of it, that those stockings were in the parcel, as that I am in this place now; I knew them by the particular pattern of the stockings, and I swear more positively from hearing the noise of the parcel; I don't swear positively, by the pattern of the stockings, that they were in the parcel, but also by hearing a rustling on the counter.</p>
               <p>Upon your suspicions of this man, you went round to a leaf of the counter; and by your own account you carried him to the other side of your shop; what is the width? - About four feet.</p>
               <p>Now these stockings were found on the floor? - As close to the opposite counter as possible.</p>
               <p>How long might any stockings have been open on that counter? - Three or four hours, but not silk; we never have silk on that side.</p>
               <p>Can you venture to swear that there had been no silk opened on that side? - It is merely accidental if any are opened on that side; there was not a single pair opened on that counter at that time.</p>
               <p>I would just wish to know, so as to see, with all your accuracy, how he took them out? - I took them up at his feet.</p>
               <p>I want to know how you could see so much as this? - There were four candles in the shop.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to swear that you saw so accurately? - I have sworn it, and I will abide by the whole course of my evidence.</p>

               <p>Did this covering seem accidental? - It seemed intentional; he had his handkerchief in his hand when he came into the shop: I went to call Mr. Goldfinch round the end of the counter; I had got the cotton stockings down, and laid them on the counter, but had not opened them; they laid immediately behind me: he was going out of the door; I ran to him, laid hold of him by the collar, and brought him back again; a little scuffle ensued, during which he had laid the stockings down on the counter unperceived by me: when I had taken the cotton stockings down, I saw him concealing the silk stockings into his pocket, in the handkerchief; I did not see the stockings, but the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Can you say whether he took up the handkerchief and the stockings together? - Where he had taken the handkerchief up, the counter was quite clear; I am certain of that; the stockings were laid nearly on the same part, but quite in a confused state. I desired him to empty his pockets; but when a constable was sent for, nothing was found upon him but these stockings.</p>
               <p>How could they be put down, and you not see it? - It was near five o'clock, and at that time of the year duskish.</p>
               <p>Jury. If it was duskish, how could you see the counter was clear? - I am certain there was nothing on the counter: the stockings all belonged to my master.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Tell the Jury how much money was found upon the man. - I do not know exactly.</p>
               <p>Had he not considerably more than he had been treating for? - He had certainly.</p>
               <p>How far were you from the counter when you had what you call the scuffle? - Nothing like three yards.</p>
               <p>A man might turn round; the man had not got out of the shop at all? - I cannot say that.</p>

               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury; I had an occasion to do some particular business, and also being in want of some stockings, I went into the prosecutor's shop, and asked the shopman to shew me three pair of silk stockings; I asked the price of them; the shopman told me the price was 30 s. I examined the stockings very carefully, and found them rather slight, and not worth that money; I then offered him 27 s. which he refused, alledging he could not take less than 30 s. which was the price: on which he said he would shew me some inferior and lower quality, which I refused, and then stood by the counter, and took my pocket-handkerchief out of my pocket, and afterwards put the handkerchief into my pocket, and then I buttoned up my coat,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179202150044"/>with my stick in my hand, and walked five yards from the counter, and wished the shopman a good day: I was near out of the door, when the shopman called two more out of a room, and charged me with stealing the stockings; on which I was searched by them, but no stockings found on me at all, nor any thing else, saving cash to the amount of five guineas, and some silver; on which the shopman turned round and said, I see the stockings on the counter; all this happened on the 24th of January last, about four o'clock: these circumstances of my case I humbly offer to my Lord and the Jury, and I am entirely innocent of the charge against me.</p>

I carried him to the watch-house, and he gave charge; and the prosecutor began to cry like a child, because of losing his money and hat; the prisoner said to the prosecutor, when he came up to him, Is that your hat? No, says he, for you threw it to the other fellows: he said at the watch-house he could not tell whether it was four or five shillings exactly; the prisoner said he had no money about him; I did not search him, nor see him searched.</p>

               <p>I am watch-house-keeper of St. Giles's; I was at the watch-house; the prisoner was brought before one o'clock; the prosecutor came with him, and said he had robbed him of his hat and four shillings; that he had been knocked down, and beat a good deal, by three men; he appeared a good deal beat; I examined the prisoner, and to the best of my knowledge he had a shilling and some halfpence; the prosecutor did not own the shilling, he did not see it; I gave it to him again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was not searched in the watch-house; I had only three-pennyworth.</p>

               <p>Did you never hear of 40 l. reward from the officers? - No, never.</p>

               <p>I met this man in the street, and he spoke to me first, and he asked me then if I would go and take a share of a pint of beer with him; I told him I did not know him; he said he knew my face very well, but he could not recollect where; then I told him I would go with him, and he brought me into a house in the Coal-yard, Drury-lane, and he called for a pot of beer; in the course of the time, these two young men came in, that he has spoke of, and they sat down in another seat, almost opposite where we sat, and this young man asked them if they would not join us company; they said they had no objection; we all sat down in one seat together, and we had two pots more of beer, besides the first pot; and after that we all went out of the house together; these young men I bid good night, and went away from them; just as I parted from them, they called me back again, and asked me if I would come further with them, and drink more; I told them I would not, I wanted to go home; they said I should go; I said I would not; so one of the young men took my hat off, and went away towards this man; and I followed them, to get my hat; and when I came up to this man, they put my hat on my head again; I turned about to go from them the second time, and as soon as I turned about they knocked that man down.</p>
               <p>Where was this?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. In the coach-yard: he cried out; they ran away from him, and I went up towards him: when I came up towards him, he said, you was one of the men that were with them that knocked me down; says he, I will call the watchman; so he called the watchman; and that gentleman there was standing at his own door, and he came over; this was in the coach-yard; then the watchman came up, and this gentleman came over from his own door; and the watchman came up and had me; and when he came up to the man, he asked him whether I was one of the men; he said I was; and he stretched his hand across the watchman's arm, and struck me; the watchman asked him how much he had lost; he said one shilling; and when he came to the watch-house he said he had lost five shillings.</p>
               <p>Court to Watchman. You took him in Church-street? - I did: this coach-yard is a thoroughfare from Broad St. Giles's to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179202150047"/>Church-street, and some other places; there is a dark passage going through.</p>

               <p>Did he remove at all from the stable-door at the time he took up this stick? - The stick lay close by the stable-door, it fastened the stable-door; we then pulled Norris away from the stable-door, and the door flew open; we went into the stable, and found an ass, and a little horse, very dirty, with saddles on, such as smugglers use, made purposely for the carrying half-ankers; saddles calculated to take a tub, and a sling over; in the corner of the stable we found two half-ankers already slung in the sling; I found they were geneva; I told Norris I would seize them, and he endeavoured to prevent my taking them away; Mr. Lidden then went into the house through a passage, the door being opened; Norris went to the further end of the stable, and took up a pitchfork, and drove it at me; I guarded off the blow and took hold of it, and took it from him; I then carried the half-ankers from the stable into an open yard, from the premises of Norris; Norris went into the house, where Jack was; he came out again, and brought out a gun, which he struck me over the hand with in endeavouring to shoot; he went into the house a second time, and returned soon afterwards with Long Jack, the person he had been asking for; he then brought out a gun and a hanger; Norris brought them both out; the gun he kept in his own hand, and the hanger he gave to John; Norris then put the gun to Mr. Lidden's breast, swearing at the same time he would shoot him, Jack at the same time brandishing his sword over his head.</p>
               <p>How near was he to Lidden when he presented this blunderbuss to his breast? - Close, and John at the same time brandishing his sword over his head; Mr. Lidden then took out his pistol, and held it at Norris, and they were both in the same situation for some time, Norris holding the gun at Mr. Lidden, and Mr. Lidden holding his pistol at Norris; I then told Norris, that if he did shoot Lidden, I would instantly shoot him; I then took the half-ankers, and carried them into the lane, the public road, as I had brought them all out of the stable; Mr. Lidden, after some time, retreated backward into the lane from the yard, and Norris all the way continued pointing the gun at his breast; I then went to Norris, seeing Mr. Lidden in that dangerous situation, and told him, if he did not immediately take his gun away, I would shoot him; I then by force took the gun away from him, and threw it into the lane.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the gun charged? - I had not an opportunity to examine it, the prisoner and his wife were throwing stones at me so, to make me lay it down; Mr. Lidden then came and helped me to put the casks up, and then they all three, the prisoner, his wife, and Long Jack, all came and threw a parcel of flint stones at us; Norris kept gathering stones for the other two, while we were loading the horses; Norris or Long Jack, I cannot tell which of them, came and took away one of the half-ankers, and ran away with it; Mr. Lidden then fired his pistol at Norris, but did not hit him.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179202150053"/>Court. Did he fire with an intent to hit him? - He said so; we then went to get on horseback, to get away; and they all three, the prisoner, Long Jack, and his wife, came and threw stones at us again; the stones struck us several times; we went on, and the ground goes on a descent, and they continued throwing stones till we were got out of their reach.</p>
               <p>How soon after this did you prefer your indictment? - Some time in the next month.</p>
               <p>Could you find any thing of the prisoner at that time? - No.</p>
               <p>When was he apprehended? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Where did you first see him after this affair happened? - I saw him about six months ago.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know where he was apprehended? - He was apprehended at Gravesend.</p>
               <p>Can you identify his person? - I can; I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. You had never seen him before that transaction? - No.</p>

            , of Gravesend, has absconded himself? - I do not know that.</p>
               <p>You saw this man on his being taken up? - I did.</p>
               <p>From the time that this assault happened, till he was taken up, you did not see him? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Which is about a year? - It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You have no doubt at all of his being the person? - I am clear of it.</p>
               <p>- LIDDEN sworn.</p>
               <p>You are an excise officer? - Yes, I am. When I came up to the stable-door, Norris had put to the door, and put his back against it; we told him our business, and that we were excise officers, and had received some information of some goods on the road, and we had a suspicion they were in there, and we wished to look; he took up a stick, and said we should not; we took the stick from him; we pulled him away from the door, and the door came a little open; we pulled it quite open, and went in, and there were six casks, a jack-ass, and a little horse, and two smugglers saddles, called loading-saddles; we told him that we seized them; he took up a stick, and was going to strike us; I then went into the room adjoining, thinking there might be some more casks, but I saw Long Jack, and I went immediately to my brother officer; he told me that Norris was going to run a pitchfork into him; we then got the tubs out of the stable into an open place, it was a green place that had been a farm-yard; then Norris came from the stable, and went to his wife into the house, and returned again with a gun, and presented it to me, swearing he would shoot us.</p>
               <p>How near was the muzzle of the gun to your breast? - He was at a distance then; he then returned, and came out again with Long Jack, Norris with the gun, and Long Jack with the hanger; they both came very close to me, Norris swearing he would shoot me, and Long Jack swearing he would cut me down; I told them it was of no use, it was all in vain, and if they were not quiet I should shoot them immediately; he said I might shoot, and be damned; I presented my pistol; and Mr. Rudd then came and told Norris, if he did not immediately take his gun away, he would shoot him, and presented his pistol; and Mr. Rudd then came behind Norris, and took the gun from him; Norris then returned a little way back, where there were a great many flint stones; and Norris and his wife, and Long Jack, began to throw stones; and a little boy, who I believe was Norris's son, helped his father with the stones, and I was hit in several places; and I was hit in this hand, which made me unable to follow my business for some time; I then shot at Norris; I did not hit him; I aimed at his legs; I thought he would then be quiet.</p>
               <p>How long did this last? - I suppose for four or five minutes: we were a long while getting the tubs, and during the time this hand was hurt, and Norris came and took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179202150054"/>up one of the casks, and ran into the house with it.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was Norris that ran away with the cask? - I am sure it was Norris: we then got up as well as we could upon the horses, and they followed us on the road; but we rode off pretty fast, and got from them: I saw him several times since, but he was on horseback, in Stroud; but I did not attempt to take him, because I thought it was in vain: I am perfectly clear he is the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You indicted him, we understand, in January? - I believe it was in January.</p>
               <p>You had a warrant against him? - In consequence of that we had.</p>
               <p>You saw him in Stroud afterwards? - I did; I saw him in Stroud.</p>
               <p>Perhaps the Jury know that Stroud is a pretty large place; you gave no alarm when you saw this man? - It is impossible for a man on foot to take another on horseback.</p>
               <p>Did you give any alarm? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you ask any person to go with you after the man, and tell them that he was indicted? - I suppose he thought it was all dropped; and then he would be alarmed.</p>
               <p>Is there no such a thing as getting assistance in such a publick town as Stroud? - No; where would he have been while I got assistance.</p>
               <p>You did not make any attempt of that sort? - I did not at that time; I had not got the warrant.</p>
               <p>Where was the warrant got? - At Gravesend.</p>

He was taken from the bar, and brought up after the business of the Court was settled; he still continuing obstinate, was remanded to his former sentence, and to be confined in a solitary cell.</p>

He was taken from the bar, and brought up after the business of the Court was settled; he still continuing obstinate, was remanded to his former sentence, and to be confined in a solitary cell.</p>
