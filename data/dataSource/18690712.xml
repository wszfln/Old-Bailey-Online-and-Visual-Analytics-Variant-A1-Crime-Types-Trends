                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and carry on business at 12, St. Helen's Place, Bishopsgate Street, City—I am secretary to the Abney Park Cemetery Company—that is a company established by deed, which I have here—Ebenezer Clarke is one of the trustees—there are nine trustees altogether—the company's offices are at 12, St. Helen's Place, part of the same offices as mine—I have been clerk and secretary twenty-one years—a person named Samuel Howell Carter was in the employ of the company as clerk, at a salary of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—the prisoner was also a clerk—he had been in the company's service since 1856—his salary was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—the business of the company at the London Office, 12, St Helen's Place, was managed by Carter, the prisoner, and myself; no other person—it was the duty of either Carter or the prisoner to receive money when persons came to pay for interments—we have had books printed, which are termed rough order-books—it would be the duty of either Carter or the prisoner, on receiving the money, to fill up the counterfoil and the rough order-book, and give a duplicate of it as a receipt to the person paying the money—he would sign it when he received the commission, not without—there is a printed receipt with my name to it—the document itself, in fact, forms the receipt—when it is above 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a stamp is put upon it, but if it is under 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. The document itself represents the payment—if there is a commission paid to the under-taker, the person receiving the money for the company ought to get the undertaker to sign the counterfoil—all the particulars required ought to be filled up properly—there is what is called a fair order-book, which ought to be nearly a transcript of the counterfoils and the rough-order book, not entirely—it contains all the items of money paid—every transaction appearing in the rough order-book ought to appear also in the fair orders book, with the corresponding number taken from the rough order-book—the numbers ought to run on consecutively—there is also a book called a register of burials—that is in Court—it was the prisoner's duty to fill up all the columns in that register—the first number on the receipt refers ti the number in the register, not the number of the grave—then there is the date, name, sex, age, late abode, where buried, name of officiating minister, date of certificate of death, name and district of registrar, and name of the undertaker—that register would be kept by the prisoner—if the prisoner received money he ought to hand it over to Carter—it was Carter's duty to keep a cash-book, and to enter in that the money he received—Carter used to account to me every week—it was my practice to examine his cash-book with the rough order-book, and also with the fair order-book, and see that they corresponded—I did that regularly every week up to the time when he absconded—I found that all the money which was entered as received in the rough order-book and in the fair order-book was properly accounted for in the cash-book—sonic time early in April last, I, with my partner, Mr. Parker, examined the books—on the following day I went to the office—I found that Carter was not there—I have seen nothing of him since—I gave directions that same day to have him apprehended—in consequence of Carter not being at the office, I made a search in the office where Carter and the prisoner used to sit—that was either the same day or the subsequent</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186907120006"/>
               <p>day—I found this cover, which I have no doubt is the cover of one of the rough order-books—I also found this book at the bottom of a deep long drawer, covered with some old papers—some of the entries on these counterfoils are in the prisoner's handwriting, and some in Carter's—there are no consecutive numbers, or any numbers at all—none of the moneys entered there as received have been accounted for to me, nor are any of them entered in the fair order-book—but all the par<lb/>ticulars of them are entered in the register of burials in the prisoner's handwriting—I found a number of bundles of counterfoils, which I produce—there are about 750 or 800; some of them go up to the time of the prisoner's absconding—it is quite evident that they have been torn out of a book—about half of these are in the prisoner's handwriting, and about half of them in Carter's—this smaller bundle refers to last year, from April to April, our official year—there are about 150 of these—about half of them are in the prisoner's writing, and about half in Carter's—they are not entered in the fair order-book, but they are entered in the register of burials, in the prisoner's handwriting—none of the money referred to by these counterfoils has been accounted for to me—it would be necessary to preserve these counterfoils in case a grave should be required to be re-opened for a new interment—certain charges are regulated by the depth of the grave, and it would be necessary to refer to the last interment, with a view to ascertain that—that would not appear in the register of burials—unless these counterfoils had been kept neither Carter or the prisoner could have given the necessary information—when I found his book and papers I spoke to the prisoner on the subject—he was with me when I was making the search—he was standing by my side when I discovered all these bundles of counterfoils—I then took him into my private room, and asked him how he accounted for those—I pointed out to him that they were party in his handwriting and partly in Carter's, and that no such documents ought to be in existence at the office—he could give no account of them—I then said, "I will examine some of these and ascertain if they are in the register of burials"—I referred to several names which I had previously in<lb/>vestigated, and requested him to find out from the rough order-book where those names were entered—he referred to the book, and could find none—I then said, "How do you account for this?"—he hesitated a little at first, and then said, "I don't know; I don't know how it could be; they must have been torn out of the book"—I said that was impossible, because the book would show it immediately, the orders all being numbered consecu<lb/>tively, and in addition to that, any person who looked at the book could see nothing had been torn out of it—I asked where he obtained the materials to fill up the particulars—he said he obtained them from the certificate of the registrar of deaths of the district—I said, in reply, "That is impossible, because there are several particulars in them that you cannot find from the registrar's certificate"—he made no reply to that; he could give no expla<lb/>nation of it—it is a fact that the certificate of death does not contain the necessary materials to enter upon the register of burials—he could only get them from these counterfoils—this counterfoil of 9th October, relating to Mary Seller, for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., is in the prisoner's writing—Carter's initials are not to that; it is not in the fair order book, but it is in the register of burials—this counterfoil relating to Rebecca Geldart, for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., is in the prisoner's writing; that is not in the fair order-book, but is in the register of burials—this counterfoil relates to Percival K.

               <p>6th February, in the prisoner's writing—that is for a re-opening—this it not a receipt—I call the paper given to the customer a receipt—the one we keep is the counterfoil—these three papers are receipts—this last if not in the order-book, but is in the register of burials—this counterfoil of 8th February, of Daniel Cresswell, is the prisoner's writing; that, also, is not in the order-book, but is in the register—this counterfoil, for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., of Sarah Clark, on 8th February, is the prisoner's writing, and is also not in the order-book, but is in the register—this counterfoil, of R. M. Barber, is also in the prisoner's writing, and is in the register, but not in the fair order-book—on 31st March I find a receipt for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for Elizabeth Croxton, on 1st April—that is in the prisoner's writing—that is not in the fair order-book, but is in the register of burials—I find a counterfoil of that in this book, which I found covered over with papers—it is not torn out of the book, the book contains recent dates—the counterfoil is in Carter's writing—here is a receipt of Fortunatus E. <hi rend="italic">Anderson</hi>, that is a mistake for "Andrews," dated 1st April, in the prisoner's writing—I find a counterfoil of that in this book, in Carter's writing—that is in the register but not in the fair order-book—this receipt for Hephribah Elmers, of 3rd April, is in the prisoner's writing, that is not in the fair order-book, but is in the register of burials—certificates of death have to be given before a burial can take place; they are sent up to any office; these are two of them relating to Croxton and Elmers—they do not contain all the materials for entering up the register of burials, only a portion—I was not at all aware of the existence of this book until I found it underneath the papers in the office—there was a rough order-book of the same date, which was being used at the same time, which had been laid before me week by week—this is a book of which I knew nothing, and in which no numbers are entered—after this conversation with the prisoner he remained in the office for a short time either that day or the next; he then went out, under pretence of getting his lunch, and did not return—I applied for a warrant, and he surrendered himself about a week afterwards.</p>

               <p>him unless some alteration was made I should bring it before the directors; I complained of his being negligent of his duty—I did not complain of his playing billiards—I was not aware of it at the time, I have heard of it since—I complained of his inattention to business, and being so long at his dinner, and being absent so many hours—the prisoner was occasionally absent from illness; his health was not very good, and his brother occasionally came to assist in his absence—I kept a cash-book between myself and Carter—I have it here—I frequently took sums from Carter on account, from day to day during the week; it was entered simply as cash on account—when Carter was absent, and the prisoner has taken money, I have occasionally taken it, and he has entered it in Carter's cash-book, and I have initialed it—I examined the cash received with the rough order-book every week, except when I have been out of town, then it has run on for two or three weeks—I also examined the cash-book with the fair order-book, not with the register of burials—the register of burials is absolutely correct as far as I have been able to discover; that is a book which the prisoner kept—these loose papers were found in a little drawer in old-fashioned desk, which I was never in the habit of going to—the prisoner did not open that drawer, he was standing by; he did not take out the papers, I took them out; I opened them and saw that some of them were in his writing—he did not take out the book, I found that—these counterfoils ought to have been in some rough order-book—they go back some four years, I think—I see some are printed in 1863 and 1864—I should judge from that they went back six years, unless they kept back one of the old books which had not been used—the orders might not go back so far as that, the heading is printed 1863—I have not referred to the dates, I can only go by the date at the top—it must have been an old-book—half of these 150 counterfoils, I should say, are in the prisoner's writing—a good many of them have Carter's initials on them—these have been examined by our book-binder—he did not point out that the counterfoils had been stripped out from the rough order-book—he said that one or two had been pasted in one of the books—he pointed out that there should be precisely the same number of counterfoils in each fold—he did not say that any were missing or removed—he said the book had been tampered with in some way—I did not understand him to say that some of the folds contained less than the proper number—from 1863 there was never any examination with the register of burials—it was in that way it was discovered—it was not Mr. Bontems who suggested that an examination should be made—the way in which it was discovered was this: I heard from one or two gentlemen that Carter had been very extravagant in his expenditure—that aroused my suspicion—one of the gentlemen said Carter had informed him that he had private means—I believed that was not the case—Mr. Higgs' matter was notorious at that time, and that induced me to make the investigation—it was not made at the suggestion of a large shareholder—I am under surety for the fulfilment of the duties of the office to the extent of 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think very few of the shareholders have said that I ought to pay Carter's defi<lb/>ciences—I have heard it said, but a large majority of them take a very different view—I never suspected Carter of living extravagantly until I received that information—the shooting did not attract my attention at all all—I was very rarely out with him, and I saw no extravagance on those occasions—we only went into the marshes at Tottenham—there was no expense at all, except the powder and shot; not even the expense of a rail-way-ticket,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186907120009"/>
               <p>we were on the spot—I have seen Carter making entries in the books when persons have come with orders—I don't remember that I ever saw him commence a new book—he had the control of all the books—orders were constantly given at the cemetery, and sent on to the office, every week—I went through the superintendent's accounts every week, and brought them up with me—there is a rough order-book kept at the cemetery, but of a somewhat different form, having two counterfoils instead of one; one is sent to the office and the other remains there—either Carter or the prisoner entered from the loose papers that came from the cemetery into the rough order-book at the office; sometimes one and sometimes the other—Carter generally entered them at the time, but if he happened to be a little in arrear he would count the number of orders, and leave a space for them—that would not make it impossible for a person paying at the office to get a receipt with a consecutive number—there was always a con<lb/>secutive number—I have not got any receipts here with consecutive num<lb/>bers on them, because these are all orders that have not been accounted for—I don't know that there never was a consecutive number; it would be the duty of Carter and the prisoner to enter the consecutive number—I have never been present when a receipt has been given without a consecu<lb/>tive number—orders were always given to Carter or the prisoner—I did not take orders—I can only tell you what their duty was—I can't say what they actually did—I think the conversation with the prisoner was about the 16th April, but I am not sure—he did 'not tell me that he did his work under Carter's direction—he told Mr. Lewis, the solicitor, so—he was present at the time—he said he had, sometimes written in the register of burials from the direction of Carter, that Carter sometimes dictated to him what to write in it—that was said in the same conversation I have referred to.</p>

I am engaged by the Mint in coming cases—on Satur<lb/>day afternoon, 12th June, inconsequence of information, I went with Miller, Inspector Brannan, and other officers, to an oil-shop, in King Street, Drury Lane, and saw the prisoner in the back parlour, in Miller's custody—I said, "Mr. Cane, you are suspected of having counterfeit coin in your possession"—before ho had time to reply, Miller said, "He swallowed a lot, sir; I saw him with a lot in his mouth, shillings"—he said, "No, I swallowed some tobacco"—I said, "Where do you live?"—he said, "Nowhere; you must find out"—I said, "We shall take you to 5, Smith's Court, Drury Lane"—he said, "I never lived there in my life; it is no use to take me there"—we took him there to the second-floor front room—Hine called to me from the floor below, and handed me a packet with this counterfeit coin, partly wrapped up, and said, "Come down, we have found the coin in the prisoner's. room"—I went there and found Hine and Mrs. Pickerton, and Hine handed me a newspaper containing thirty half-crowns, thirty-eight florins, and forty-five shillings, wrapped in tissue paper, with paper lapped between—they had undergone the process of slumming with tallow and lamp-black, to give them the appearance of circulation—the prisoner was brought down stairs, and I told him what we had found—he said that he never lived in the room, but Mrs. Pickerton said, "Yes, George, you know you have lived there for the last six months"—he made no reply—Inspector Brannan searched the prisoner, and took from his pocket a piece of paper which cor<lb/>responded</p>

               <p>Hicks lives in the same house—on the morning this occurred, I went into the prosecutrix' room, and gave her a pack of cards which she had asked me for—the prisoner was in her room—he asked me if I knew the three game trick, which he had been playing with my friend—I said, "No"—I am certain he is the man—I saw him leave, and as he went down stairs the prosecutrix threw these coins into my room, and asked me whether they were good; I said, "No."</p>

I live at 3, James Street, Islington—on Saturday, 5th June, I was coming from the Carved Red Lion public-house—I saw the two prisoners together—Hays came up to me and tried to pick my pocket—I told him he ought to be ashamed of himself for trying to pick a poor woman's pocket—Carney followed me into Colebrooke Row, and said, "What did you call me a thief for?"—I said, "I did not"—he said, "I will knock your b—eye out"—he made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at my brooch, and he gave me a violent blow, and then knocked me down and kicked me three times in the side—Hays was not there at the time I was struck—he came up after and said, "I have not touched you"—I had a half-crown and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my hand—Carney knocked it out of my hand and took my brooch—he then ran away—Hays came up just as I got up—he said, "I have not touched you—I said, "All right"—with that he took two halfpence out of a child's hand, and ran away with them—the money was in my hand when I came out—I am sure of that, for I came out to pay it.</p>

I am a clerk in holy orders—on 5th June I was coming home from church—I saw two men and the last witness appa<lb/>rently in altercation together, as I got to the top of the street—I can't positively swear to the two men—my belief is that the prisoners were the men, but I could not positively swear—as I got near to them, one of the men seized the woman by the throat, in a very furious manner, and struck her two terrible blows in the face, then lifted his leg, and gave her A fearful kick in the lower part of the body, and she fell—I called out to the man, and made an effort to reach him, but he ran away—I never saw his face—the other man came up shortly after, and said, "Where is the villain gone? I will take him "—there was a little child standing near—she said, "That way," and pointed with her hand—the man took something out of the child's hand, and ran away—I then went to the woman—it was so momen<lb/>tary that I cannot swear to the men.</p>

I am the son of the prisoner, and lived with him and my mother, Sarah Smith—on Saturday night, 19th June, we were at home—my father and mother had both of them had a drop to drink—they were tipsy—there was a quarrel between then—I saw my father give mother a slap on the side of the head with his hand first—he then hit her on the back with a machine-stick—this is the stick (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—my father is a chimney-sweep, and this is one of the rods of the machine—I afterwards saw him lift his foot—I did not sec him kick her—my mother was always a worreting him every time he came in doors—she was worreting him this evening—I did not sec her doing anything else to him—after he lifted his foot I went into the next room, Mr. Williams' room—I went on an errand for him—I returned in about twenty minutes—I then saw my mother up against the window, sitting on the floor, and I saw blood on the floor, two or three drops—I forget where my father was at that time—he was there—I did not say anything to him, or he to me—I did not hear him say anything to mother—I heard her say to him, "Oh, you have done it for me now"—my father said something, but I really forget the words used—he then went down stairs—I went out afterwards—Mrs. Kelly and Mrs. Fox came into the room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Your father was always very kind to your mother, was he not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—she was very drunk that night, and that was not the first time by a great many—I saw her fall down stairs; she fell from the top to the bottom—father did not strike her then—she went up stairs after that—I went for the doctor—father did not send me, Mrs. Kelly did—mother had been drinking all that day—this happened about 7.30 or 7.45 at night—when she fell down stairs, father went and helped to get her upstairs.</p>

I am the wife of John Kelly, and lire at No. 2, Street's Buildings, right facing the window of the prisoner's room—on Saturday night, about 8 o'clock, I met the prisoner on his own door-step—he begged me to go up stairs and see his wife—he was drunk at the time—I went up immediately, and found her sitting down on the floor under the window—she had blood all over her, and I saw it come from her nostrils—I went and got some cold water and flannel, and wiped it up—there was blood on the floor, a reasonable share—while I was attending to her, Mrs. Fox came in—I sent for Dr. Bloxam—he came directly and examined her—she was put into a cab and taken to the hospital.</p>

I am the wife of Thomas Mount joy, and live in the same house with the prisoner—on Saturday evening, 19th June, I heard him and his wife quarrelling—I heard high words; I heard the voices of both—I did not hear what they said, as I was shut in my own room; but soon afterwards I heard Mrs. Smith fall down stairs, just against my door—I did not hear anything besides words of altercation—I heard the prisoner ask her to get up after she had fallen down the stairs—she said, "I can't," and that was the reason of me opening my door—I went out and picked her up, and took her inside my room—I kept her there five or ten minutes—during that time, George Woodcut, a fishmonger, came, and she left my room to speak to him—after that she returned to her own room, at least she left my room, and turned to go up stairs—my room is on the ground floor, just at the foot of the stairs—I still heard them talking loud up stairs—I think it was quarrelling between Mr. and Mrs. Smith—I went in and shut my door—I was afterwards called up by one of the neighbours, and found the deceased sitting on the floor, with her back towards the window, resting against the wall—that was about a quarter of an hour after I had assisted her up at the foot of the stairs, or not quite so long—she was not sensible then—she never spoke after I went into her room—when she was down in my room she could say very little—she was holding her hand to her side, and said she had hurt her side—I did not see any blood on her then—when I saw her up stairs I saw blood on the floor, in two or three different places, and there was some on her clothes.</p>

                  </hi>.—I am in practice at 21, Mount Street, Grosvenor Square—on Saturday night, 19th June, I received information, and went to Street's Buildings, where I saw the deceased lying on the floor, on her back, her head supported by a neighbour—she was insensible—her clothing was saturated with blood, and her body covered with blood and excrement—there were pools of blood upon the floor, in several places—I did not tike accurate notice of the number of stairs that I ascended in order to get to the prisoner's room—I have not been there since, but I should think there might have been some two dozen steps to the staircase—it was almost vertical, a remarkably steep stair-case, highly dangerous—the top was about fourteen feet or sixteen feet, perhaps, from the ground, but I could not speak positively—I desired her to be sent to the infirmary—I made a partial examination of her first—I discovered tin immense loss of blood, and supposed she had been wounded somewhere, but I did not discover any wound at that time—she was washed at the infirmary—I then found a lacerated and con used wound oh the left side of the external genital organ—the cavity of the wound would easily have contained a hen's egg—I proceeded to dress the wound in the usual manner, and she died during my attendance upon her—stimulants and nourishment were given to her whilst I was attending to her—the prisoner was in the room at the time I saw her at the house—I inquired if she had been drinking—he replied, "She is not drunk"—he was drunk—in my judgment the wound was certainly not the result of the fall clown stairs—I afterwards made a post-mortem examination—I found the body almost entirely drained of blood, the wound I have described, a severe bruise on the left temple, lacerating the temporal muscle, blood in the left nostril, the upper lip bruised and cut, several bruises on both fore-arms, some bruises on the scalp, a very severe bruise on the left lower rib, and slighter bruises on the arms, legs, and thighs—the vagina was, as it were, dissected from the surrounding tissues on the left side—in my judg<lb/>ment, that wound was inflicted by a kick, or thrust with some blunt instrument—this stick would be calculated to cause such a wound—there is no mark of blood on it that I can see—the immediate cause of death was hemorrhage.</p>

                  </hi>. I am joint proprietor with William Charman, of the Ampitheatre, Holborn—I live there—I executed this indenture in 1857—an action was brought against me in 1866—I was not going to leave the country at that time—I was arrested at the suit of the prisoner—the action went on for some time, and was settled by me on a release—the prisoner's son is in India—he was an apprentice under this indenture, at the time of the first arrest—I was not about to leave the country in May, this year—I had not sub-let the Amphitheatre, in Holborn, or entered into or contemplated any engagement to take me out of this country—the lease of the place in Holborn is for fifty-four years—I never saw Williamson till I was at Bow Street—I am married, and my wife and child live with me at the circus—there is not a word of truth in the statement that I was going to leave the country—I went on the continent in 1866 to engage artists for the amphitheatre—that was my only journey from England—I did not intend to leave England permanently.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you open this place as an amphitheatre? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I ceased to use it for that purpose in April last, and arranged it for promenade concerts—I discharged the circus company—I had probably sixty men in my employ, who went into other party—I opened the place as a concert room on 15th May, and engaged with a company of musicians—I took no one else into partnership; it was carried on by Mr. Chandler and myself—I did not go away from town to engage artists for the concerts—I did not suggest going anywhere—the prisoner's boy was articled to me for ten yean, from August, 1857—I have given him money—I never paid the father anything—the boy was in the charge of Peter Rainbow, a bill in<lb/>spector, at the time I left India, learning equestrianism for my benefit—I was arrested—the action with Cooper was compromised by my solicitor, Mr. Brandon—McGrady came to me to ask for the possession of his son—he did not threaten proceedings because I did not return him—I ordered him from my premises—Buck asked me where the indenture was, and I told him it was in the hands of my solicitor—I do not know that the prisoner was very anxious to have his son back—the <hi rend="italic">capias</hi> on which I was taken was issued in a second action—I do not know who the attorney was, I know nothing except that I was arrested coming out of the amphitheatre on Saturday—I think two pieces of parchment were shown to me when the officer came, one was a <hi rend="italic">capias</hi>, I do not know what the other was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Gowlett, a labourer, of Ux-bridge—I remember the 6th July, three weeks come Sunday evening (27th June)—I don't know the day of the month—I saw him sharpening some<lb/>thing on the step of his own door—he was eating his supper, for some minutes—we were inside our door—we live close to one another—after he had eaten it, I saw him throw a piece of bread out that he had done with—he was very much the worse for liquor; then I heard him scrap-ing something to and fro on the red brick, at the door—I did not speak to him then, nor he to me—I afterwards met him at the top or the passage, and he said, "I have just sharpened this, I owe a spite, and I mean having my revenge"—I could not say that I saw anything in his hand; whatever it was it went up his sleeve—I could not say what it was that he was sharpening; it was something that grated on the step—on Tuesday, 6th July, at something like 6.30, I saw the prisoner with Redrup—they went into Mrs. Murray's house—I heard them in—I don't know whether they fell down, or laid down—I went to the step of the door, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Will</hi>, whatever did you bring Redrup home here for, you know how it do annoy your mother"—he said, "He has been put upon where we have been drinking, and I brought him home to protect him"—his sister came running up from her own cottage—she looked in with me, and said, "Does he not look in a fit?"—I saw Redrup lying on the floor, on his back—they were both lying down together, on the floor, but Murray was rolled more over on his side—as he lifted up his head, he spoke to me—he laid close at Redrup's feet, as Redrup laid long ways, Mur<lb/>ray sat at his feet, in a chair, with his arms leaning on his knee—he got up from the ground—when I first saw him he was on the floor—he lifted up his head and spoke to me, and then he got up—Murray appeared to me to have a froth or foam coming from his mouth, but I quite thought it was from the drink he had had, and he was lying on his back—I saw a cushion lying close by, and I put it under his head—I shook him by the shoulder, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Tom, Tom</hi>, wake up; do you know me," and he opened his eyes, and said, "Yes, Mrs. Gowlett, I am all right"—he was wry much the worse for drink, still he recognized me; he knew my voice—he was drunk—there was nothing the matter with his throat at that time—Murray then said, "I shall lie down and have an hour or two's <hi rend="italic">doss</hi>"(dose); he then came from the chair which he sat in, blundered over him in some way, being tipsy, and laid down by the side of Redrup, and put his arm across him, and said again that he</p>

               <p>intended to have a <hi rend="italic">doss</hi>—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Will</hi>; leave your hand a little lower than that, as it may be difficult for Redrup to breathe;" and he then moved his arm a little lower, towards his stomach—I then left them both lying down close together—about ten minutes afterwards, or it might be a quarter of an hour, I could not say for a minute or two, I saw Murray pass my door, but did not take any particular notice of him; I heard his door shut, and heard him pass at the moment—I believe his sister was in her own house at this time, I don't know—I did not see anyone but Murray and the deceased in the house at the time I left, or after—after Murray had left the house, I heard a scream, "Oh, my God! here is a sight! look at <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Redrup!"—I went to the step, and looked in, and saw the face of Redrup in a different state to what I had left him; he was very pale, as though he was dead—I did not go in, I went away directly, and saw nothing more.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you known Murray some time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and his mother—he had been drinking a good deal for a long time—about six weeks before this transaction I heard that he had fallen down and cut his head, and lost a quantity of blood—I know he had been keeping company with a young woman, she had left him, and I heard that that preyed on his mind, and made him give to drink—he was drunk nearly every day shortly before this occurrence—when drunk, he was in a very wild and frenzied state—his sister lives near, at No. 1; she is married to Edward Groom, a painter—the prisoner's mother lives at No. 4—she is a nurse—he is not an only child, or an only son; he is the only one at home—I did not know his father, I believe he has been dead some years—Groom's father lives at No. 2, and I live at No. 3—No. 4 is a three-roomed house, one above the other—the room I saw them in is on the ground-floor, that is used as a kitchen and sitting-room; there is no other place besides that down stairs, except a little cupboard—the mother has not slept there for the last eight weeks, she goes out nursing—the prisoner slept in the top room—no one occupied the house but he and his mother, when she was at home—Neale lives at No. 5—I was at the end of the row when Neale came running by; I saw him go and look in after he had been for the water—before the prisoner got up into the chair he was lying beside the deceased, he was on his side and the deceased was on his back; the cushion was under his head then—I saw the prisoner lying in that way for a moment or so before he got into the chair—I could not say the time justly, for a minute—when I first looked in, I saw him lying beside Redrup—he could only have been there a few minutes, from the time they passed my door—I only said, "Why did you bring him in here?"—that seemed to disturb Murray, he seemed to be <hi rend="italic">doseficd</hi>—it was immediately after he used the words I have mentioned that he scrambled up into the chair—he then laid down again beside Redrup, and I left them in that way—my attention was called by the screaming, about ten minutes afterwards—when I left them there was nothing the matter with Redrup, that I saw, except the effects of drink.</p>

               <p>chair was, I should think, about two or three feet from the middle of his body; I have not measured it—the razor was in about the middle of the seat of the chair—it was a common Windsor chair—the razor was lying straight across the middle of the chair, not in a line with my brothers arm, but away from it, crossways—there was blood on the handle, and the blade too and two or three drops of blood had dropped from the handle on to the chair—I laid hold of my brother's hand, but I did not move it—I merely laid hold of it to feel if there was any life in him—I considered he was dead—his hands laid on his breast in that position (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>)—there was a pool of blood on the floor on each side of him—there were some persons at the door at the time, but no one else in the house when I went in; I think Mrs. Gowlett was at the door, I can't be certain—when I first saw my brother he lay on his back, with his hands so; both of them open, or nearly so; they might not have been quite flat, but in that position—there was a little blood on the back of his right hand, I think, but none on the front—there was no blood on the left hand; the left hand was uppermost, nearest his head—he lay flat on his back, and his legs quite straight, as though he was asleep, and had not moved—as soon as I found that he was dead, I came out again, and closed the door—Dr. Ferris came directly after me; I suppose I had been outside three or four minutes, and we went into the house again together—we examined him, and was satisfied that he was dead—I waited till a policeman came—I left the house in his charge, with orders not to allow anybody to touch him, or go into the house, except Dr. Ferris, or any other medical gentleman—I then went with a police-constable straight to my father's shop, in High Street, opposite the Market House, and the prisoner was there in custody—the constable said to him, "I take you in custody on a charge of the wilful murder of Frederick Redrup "—the shop was full of people, at least there was my sister, and several there; and I am not quite certain what the prisoner said, but I believe he said, "All right, I will go"—he was taken to the police-station, and given in charge—Sergeant Cooper asked the constable, West, what number it was in Smith's Buildings, and the prisoner said, "99 "—West said, "No. 4 "—the prisoner said, "You know nothing about it, Mr. West; if you had been there, you would have been in the same position as he is now "—the prisoner was searched, and a bead was produced from his pocket—I said to the constable, "Take care of that bead, for I believe we have some at home that will match it"—there were spots of blood on the inside of the leg of the prisoner's trowsers—I could see that as he was going along the street with us—I did not see any blood anywhere else—my brother was of weak mind, and had been so from his birth—the prisoner was the worse for liquor—I should wish to mention about the bead, I produce some which exactly match the one found on the prisoner; they belong to my daughter; my brother was in the habit of having a bead in his mouth, he was scarcely ever without a bead or a button in his mouth.</p>

               <p>of the left hand, and the palm of the fingers was covered with blood—the back of the fingers was covered with blood, with the exception of just the tip of the forefinger—there was nothing more on the back, just a little stream like, running down; but not continuously over it, as if it had run down from the back of the fingers—the insides of the fingers were covered with blood—there was no blood on the body lower than the collar bone, in front, on the shirt—I mean, running down—the wound must have been done when he was lying down—next afternoon I made a more detailed examination of the wound, with the assistance of Mr. Macnamara and Mr. Roberts, surgeons, of Uxbridge—I found a large gash right across the throat, and there was a smaller one on the left side, not reaching through the skin—the large wound was not deep, on the left side; the left carotid artery was not cut through—the windpipe was cut right through, at the top of the trachea—the gullet was not wounded—the right carotid artery was cut completely through, and the large muscle on the neck was also cut com<lb/>pletely through—the mass of blood was on the right side of the head, which would be accounted for by the right artery being cut—there were sprinkles of blood on his waistcoat and on his trowsers—the cut commenced on the left side of the throat—a razor would produce it—I saw this razor on the chair on the right side of the deceased—it would produce the wound I have described—death would ensue in a minute or two from such a wound, very quick—the wound was the cause of death—I noticed the room, there was no sign of struggle—there was a paper screen, about half a foot to the left of the deceased, which was not disarranged, nor was there blood upon it—there was a small, square piece of carpet, not nailed down, lying on the floor—that was not disarranged—that was under the deceased—the chairs were evenly against the wall, and there was a table to the left; in fact, there were no signs of a struggle—there were no scratches or bruises on the face or hands of the deceased—I examined some water in a basin; it was very dirty, soapy water; it had a reddish colour—I examined it—I cannot swear that it was blood—I found no distinct evidence of its being blood, although most probably it was—the prisoner's clothes were shown me next day—the red spots upon them were blood, decidedly, and human blood—his shirt was shown to me, and these trowsers and this towel—I think that was all—these marks are all blood, decidedly human blood—they appeared recent then—I am of opinion that if the deceased had got up to inflict the wound upon himself, the blood would have streamed down his chest, and there was none below the collar bone—if he did not get up, his hand would not reach the chair.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> But there is no proof that the chair had not been moved? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was there before the police; I don't know who may have been there before me—I have heard the evidence—I have heard it stated that the prisoner had been in the habit of drinking very freely for some time previously—constant habitual drunkenness of that sort would pro<lb/>duce a diseased state of the brain; an inflammatory condition; frenzy would be the more proper term, perhaps—persons in that condition would at times have no control over their actions, not if they have been drinking for a long time; they get into a state of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremerw</hi>—if the prisoner had received a severe blow on his head six weeks before this, that would render him more susceptible to these deleterious influences; it would have made the influence of drink more strong upon him—I agree with this passage in Dr. Taylor's work: "In cases where the head has sustained</p>

               <p>any physical injury, as among soldiers and sailors, drunkenness, even when existing to a slight extent, produces sometimes a fit of temporary insanity, leaving the mind clear when the drunken fit is over"—I did not examine the prisoner at all—I did not know him before this; I knew his mother.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">J. T. COOPER</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). The prisoner was in my charge part of the night—he was in the custody of two constables—I was in the station; but they were immediately with him the whole night, till he was taken before the Magistrate next day, at 12 o'clock—I saw him before the Magistrate—I had left him at 6 o'clock, and saw him again at 11.30—I was in the Court the whole of the time, and brought him to the House of Detention the same day—about 6 o'clock in the evening he seemed to have recovered from the effects of the drink—I saw him then at the Hillingdon police station—he was perfectly sensible then—he was asked by the Chairman of the Bench of Magistrates if he had any questions to ask any of the witnesses, at the end of their examination, and he said, "No"—he had slept in the station all night—he laid down on the cocoa-nut matting, and had a coat put under his head, and he slept there the whole night, at least, I won't say the whole night—he was dozing—he had completely recovered from his drunkenness in the evening, by 6 o'clock, and seemed perfectly composed and sober—he had some refreshments before 12, ginger beer and some bread and cheese.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Berridge, of 30, Thomas Street, Clerkenwell—it is our dwelling-house—the prisoner lodged with me on the first floor back—on the evening of the 7th July, she came home at 5.30—she asked me if I would give her a cup of tea—I told her to go to her own room, and I would bring it up to her—she refused to do so, and sat down in my kitchen—I poured her out a cup at the table—she did not drink it—she poured half of it out of the cup and threw it into my little girl's face—I ordered her out of the kitchen—she then took up the cat's saucer of cold water, and threw it into the little boy's face—she then took up a knife that I was cutting the bread and butter with, and ran to me in the corner, and said she would run it through me to the handle—she then threw the knife away across the table, and want up into her own room—she had been drinking—she went out, and returned about 8.45—I was speaking to a policeman at the time, asking his advice about what I should do, and she began abusing the policeman—she did not speak to me—she want and stood at the foot of the stain, and said she would burn the house down and all that was in it—she was still under the influence of liquor, but</p>

               <p>not so bad as she was at 5.30—the went up stairs to her own room, and sat there using the most obscene language for about half-an-hour—there was no one there—she said, "I will find my matches, and I will burn the place"—I went out into the yard about fire minutes afterwards, to get my clothes in, and I saw the flames reaching to the second floor window, and she was standing with the match box in one hand, and a large piece of lighted paper in the other, holding it underneath the valance of the window—the valance was all a blazing, and she was still holding it—I ran and got my little children out of bed, and laid them at the street door—a young man was passing the door, and I pulled him in, and begged him to come in and put the flames out—he went up stairs, and burst the door open, and went in and took the paper out of the prisoner's hand—I went in with him—it was all a blazing, the valance was best part burnt, and all the wood work and frame work was cracking—the young man put out the fire with rags—I sent for a policeman, and gave the prisoner in charge.</p>

I am a builder, and live in Great Wild Street—on Saturday night, 26th June, about 7 o'clock, I was at the corner of Gilbert's Passage, facing Portugal Street, and saw two vans coming along Portugal Street; the first ran had four heavy balks of timber on it—I saw five lit<lb/>tle children playing on the pavement on the off side of the van, against Messrs. Twining's reading rooms—the width of the pavement there is about three feet six inches—the van was coming down Portugal Street, and turn<lb/>ing into Portsmouth Street—that street is sixteen feet wide there, from kerb to kerb—this plan (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) is very near the mark for a rough sketch—the van was driven round the corner at a very sharp trot, it was drawn by two horses; it was a heavy four wheeled van—as it turned the corner the deceased child was on the kerb, and the box of the fore wheel caught her in the buttock, as she stood with her back to that van; she reeled, and was thrown under the hind wheel, which passed over her chest—I was on</p>

               <p>the opposite side of the road—my daughter was with me, she screamed out, and then the van was pulled up, it had gone on about thirty-six yards from where the child was killed; it had passed Mr. Lack's public-house, and the Black Jack, and was right over Mr. Jewel's furniture shop; they are long fronts, it had passed three houses, and the horses' heads were on to the fourth—I did not see the driver—there was nothing in the street to obstruct the driver's view—I did not hear any calling out from the van before the acci<lb/>dent happened—the children were playing on the foot pavement—I directly went after a constable, and a man picked up the child—the timbers projected over the front and tail of the van, they were said to be about twenty-six feet long, I should say they projected full eight feet over the tail of the van.</p>

Q.</hi> And how much over the front? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should sup-pose about the same—I and my daughter had been in Mr. Lack's public-house, we had one pint of beer there—there was no man named Beecham in my company—I don't know him—I came out of the house first, and my daughter followed me—the vans were then proceeding along Portugal Street; I can't say how far from me, I have no idea—I did not see Mr. Lack outside his house till after the occurrence—the driver evidently drew to that side of the road in order to get round with the timber that was in the waggon—it was not necessary for him to do so in order to avoid striking any persons on the other side—I have said that he was obliged to pull his van close 'to the kerb, to get his timber round; that was on account of his being on the off side—I can't say how far the hones' heads were from Mr. Lack's public-house at the time of the accident—I ran to pick up the child; they were not near Mr. Lack's house, I should suppose they were four feet from the pillars of the public-house, they might be more—the front wheel of the van grated the side of the off kerb as it passed—a person standing in Porte-mouth Street could have seen the accident—the children were three or four feet down Portugal Street, they were not in Portsmouth Street—the child was killed in Portugal Street, about three feet from the corner—the acci<lb/>dent happened as the van was turning the corner, the back wheel had not turned the corner—the front wheel was quite close to the kerb, the back wheel struck off, it was a very little distance from it, it might have been fifteen or sixteen inches perhaps from the kerb, not more—the van was between me and the child, I did not stoop to see the child, I was leaning with my foot on the spur stone—I do not know a person named Holder (<hi rend="italic">He was here called in</hi>) I saw that man—I did not speak to him about the accident, that I know of—I never saw him till I saw him at Bow Street—I did not say to him, or to anyone, that there was no blame to the driver—I should say I had not come out of the public-house two minutes before the accident happened—the van was going at a fast trot, I am no judge of pace—I have not said it was going seven miles an hour, no such thing, I said, about seven miles, according to my judgment—it did not go slower round the corner.</p>

I am a law-writer, and live at 13, Blewitt's Build-ings—on this Saturday evening I was in Portugal Street, just at the corner, nearly facing the hospital, close to the Temperance coffee-shop—I then beard the rattle of wheels, and the van came along—the box of the fore wheel struck the child, and nearly turned it on one side—she reeled, and fell off the pavement, and the hind wheel went over her—I made a spring, but before I could catch hold of the child she was under the wheel—I was about a yard from her—it was so sudden that I did not take any</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4 A, Clayland's Road, Peckham Road—I was in Portugal Street on this morning, in front of King's College Hospital, with a friend—the two vans passed us—the front van was laden with timber—it was proceeding towards Portsmouth Street, at a rate of not less than seven miles an hour, and I am confident I am under the mark—I was about 200 yards from where the accident occurred—I kept my eye on the van until it vanished round the corner—I did not observe any diminution in the rate of speed—I did not actually see the child run over, but imme<lb/>diately after the van had gone round the corner, I saw the last witness with the child in his arms, running across with it to the hospital—I went on into Portsmouth Street, and assisted in detaining the horses—the driver had left the box and gone to the hospital, and the van was in charge of a boy.</p>

I am a law stationer, and live at 28, Cursitor Street—I was in company with the last witness—my attention was attracted by the rate at which the vans passed, which induced me to make a remark to my friend—the rate of speed was not slackened—I did not see the accident myself—I saw the child lying in the gutter afterwards—I should say the van passed at the rate of seven miles an hour—I have often rode in vehicles.</p>

I went and got my knife and some tobacco, and sat on the side of the bed, cutting it She asked me would I forgive her the affair of Friday morning. I told her I would, and to drop it. She kept pulling me, and asking me to lie down; at last I made a hit at her, forgetting I had the knife.

I am a lather of buildings—my last employer was Mr. Williams, of the Amherst Arms, last week—on Thursday, 29th April, I was standing with a young gentleman (Alfred Weasby) against the Royal George—we heard a scuffling in the road, and a scream, and a policeman had hold of a short, stoutish fellow, who after tustling, slipped his coat and ran down Orchard Street, but the policeman could not catch him—he turned to his right and then to his left, and then I came back to the Royal George.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186907120091"/>
               <p>money"—he drinks very hard, and on the day of the fire I mentioned it, and he said that he earned his money—he went to dinner about 1 o'clock and I said, "Now, <hi rend="italic">Jim</hi>, you have taken a lot of micro on this job, and you know what a fix I am in for it"—he promised me that if I would give him ls to get something to eat, he would come back to work, and I gave him Is.—he then left for his dinner, and should have come back at 2 o'clock but did not—I did not see him again till the evening, when the fire was raging—I only managed to save my pocket-book, and then the roof fell in which turned me so sick that I went up to the Admiral Vernon, six doors off, where I met the prisoner—he said, "Here's a job, governor"—I said, "Oh, you villain!"—he said, "What for?"—we both got very excited, and he took off his coat to fight me—I said, "I am not in a position to fight now, I am in too much trouble"—he knew that I was not insured, because I used to beg all the men to be so careful about fire—the lease cost me 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and I have also lost my tools, and the covenant of the house—when the company found the inflammable nature of the materials, they did not actually refuse to insure, but they wanted such a lot of improvements that I could not carry them out.</p>

I am the prosecutor's errand boy—on 8th June I was sitting waiting for him on the step at No. 2, Nichol Street—all the work-people had left, and it was as near as possible 9.30—I saw the prisoner in the prosecutor's yard, buttoning up his coat, as he came up the passage leading to the street, on his toes—he did not go into the street, but went up the stain two at the time, on his toes—I lost sight of him when he got to the first flight—the stairs lead to the workshop and to the dwelling-rooms—the workshop is the second floor—I could see the window of it if I went into the street—two or three minutes afterwards I heard the door creak (I had noticed that the workshop door creaked before that), and directly after that I saw him come down stairs; he came through the passage, and when he got to me, he said, "Is the master at home?"—I said, "No, he has not come home yet"—he said, "I shall say good-night; I will go up stairs and see the <hi rend="italic">missue"</hi>—she was in No. 1, and he went to No. 2; and as soon as he got into the passage of No. 2, I saw the reflection of a light on the other side of the street—I went across the road to look, and saw long flames rising up against the workshop window, inside—they came from the middle window—the windows are in front of the house, and the fire-place at the side—I called out, "Fire!"and the prisoner came out directly, and said, "Well, good night, I'm off"—he walked up the street, and when he got to the beer-shop he ran—he could see the fire where he was, he looked up at it—the mistress was in the workshop after he left, her name is Marks—the lodgers were at home—I gave the alarm, and they came out—I did not stop to see whether any engines came, I was too glad to get home after I had got one or two of the things out of the down stairs room.</p>

I am a cabinet-maker, and was in the prosecutor's employ on 8th of June—I left the workshop about 9.5 this night—there was a fire in the fire-place, I put it out safely and scraped it all away, shavings and dust—when I left there was no smell or appearance of fire—I was supposed to be the last person on the premises—I went home and heard no more.</p>

               <p>it bowed up against the windows—on the 10th I saw the prisoner at the London Depot, in the Curtain Road, sitting down having a glass of ale—I asked him if he would be kind enough to tell me where he was from 8 to 10 o'clock on the evening of the fire, Tuesday night—he said. "What do you ask me this question for?"—I told him it was a very serious matter for me, and then he said, "I was not out of this house from 3 o'clock till 10 o'clock, only twice, to go to the Blue Last to get a drop of gin "—the officers heard what he said, and requested him to go to the station—my workshop has been burnt down, too.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Why don't you get back the cheques after the accounts art closed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is impossible to get them all—we get them back when we can.</p>
