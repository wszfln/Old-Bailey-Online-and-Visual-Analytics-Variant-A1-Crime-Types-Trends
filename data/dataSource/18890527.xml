               <p>he said he would give me a few shillings, or 5s.—next night, about half past 8, he brought five parcels; four of them were done up in sacks and one in bed-ticking, and tied up with rope—he left them there—he brought them in a cart—I did not see him again until he came to take them away, about a fortnight afterwards, on the 1st of May, about half past 7 in the evening—he said he would come back about half-past 8 and fetch them—he came back with a van with a cover, and took the five parcels away—he said he would come back in an hour, and pay me the money he had promised—I have not seen him since till now—I after wards saw the sacking and bed-ticking at the police-station—I was here last Session—I was brought here on subpoena.</p>

I am a greengrocer, of 33, Foster Street, Bethnal Green—I was convicted between ten and eleven years ago on Tuesday, 30th April, Inspector Helson sent for me and showed me three skins, and had some conversation with me about them—after that I went with Sergeant Edwards and Vagg that evening to a public-house in South Hackney—after I had been there about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour King came in with another man, who I was to meet there—that man said to King, "Here is a man that is likely to buy the leather," pointing to me—I don't know the man's name; he was a man with one eye—I said to King, "How many of them is there?" he said, "34 dozen"—I said, "And the price is how much?" he said, "They cost me £1 a dozen; I will take 4s. a dozen profit"—he said, "I would not part with them at that price, only they have come from a hot shop over the water, and if you will take the lot you can have them for 24s. a dozen, and they ought to fetch you £100"—after trying to get them a little cheaper I agreed to have them at his price—he said, "Have you got the money to pay for them?"—I said, "Yes; let us see how much they come to"—he reckoned it up and it came to £40 16s.—he said, "If you buy these, be very careful what you do with them; don't take them on the hawk"—I told him he need not trouble himself about that, as I thoroughly well knew what to do with them when I got them—I asked him when I could have them—he said, "You can't have them to-night, they are over the water"—I said, "Make your own time and appointment"—he said, "You can't have them till after 6 tomorrow night"—he then wrote a letter at the public-house bar—he showed me the letter after it was written—I asked him to let me post it—he said he would post it himself—I met him at</p>

               <p>Moorgate Street Station at 6 next evening—I saw the police waiting in a garden up the street—next evening, about 6, I went with a pony and van to Moorgate Street Station—I saw King reading a newspaper—I went and spoke to him—we then went into a public-house, where the van was standing, round a by-street; he said, "Have you got the money?"—I said, "I have got £35 in gold," showing him the money—this was when I was with King alone—I said I could get the other £5 in Bethnal Green Road—he said, "Wait a minute, I have got my mate outside"—he then went out, and in about two minutes he came in with Green—Green said, "Have you got the money?"—I said, "No; I am £5 short, as I told King, but if you will fetch the skins from over the water, and bring them to the Swan, in Bethnal Green Road, I can borrow the other £5 there"—Green then said, "The skins are not over the water, they are near Haggerston Station; you can't have them till it is dark; if you will meet me at a public-house near Haggerston Station"—I said, "I don't know the house, and for fear we should make a mistake, and lose one another, we had better meet at a house we all know;" and we made an appointment to meet at 8 o'clock, at the Black Horse in Kingsland Road—I then left them—I then saw Enright, and went to the Black Horse with the pony and van—after waiting there a few minutes I saw the two prisoners coming towards me—we went into the Black Horse—Green said, "Have you got the money?"—I said, "I could not get the £5 I promised, and if you won't trust me with the whole of the goods, detain £5 worth of them"—he said, "We will go and get the goods; give me what money you have got, and King can go with you to get the remainder"—we came out of the house together, and all three got into the van—Green said, "Let me drive"—he got hold of the reins, and instead of going over Kingsland Road Bridge he turned short round and went through Abbey Street and other streets, and eventually to Whitmore Road Bridge—I said, "We are going a long way round"—he said, "You can't be too careful over a job like this; you don't know who may be on the look-out"—he then stopped at a public-house somewhere in Hackney or Dalston, but we went so many turnings I could never go to the house again—he then said, "How are we going to manage about counting these skins?"—I said, "Can't I come and see them counted?"—he said, "No, they are done up like bundles of bedding; and you can't undo them where they are"—I said, "Well, how are we going to manage it? you don't suppose I am going to give you £30 or £40 for a bundle of bedding?'—he said, "I will fetch them here in the van, and then you can see what they are like"—I said, "The two of you had better go and fetch them; and when I see them, if I think they are worth £20 or £30, I will pay you what I think they are worth"—he said, "I will go and fetch them; King shall stop with you"—he then got up into the van—he said, "Here is the sample; they are counted in with the lot"—that is the three skins I had received from Inspector Helson—he then went away in the van—after he had gone King said to me, "For God's sake mind what you are doing with these, they come from a burglary over the water, and it would be as hot a job as ever you handled"—he said, "I should like to know where you live, I have got some stuff worth two guineas a pound; you might be able to do with it"—I said, "You had better get one job over at a time, and then I will let you know something further on"—before</p>

On Tuesday night, at a quarter to 11, he knocked me up and said he had a customer waiting over the road, and I must get up to see him. I reluctantly got up and saw him and the man that had the samples sold them to him. It was then arranged to meet last night at 6 o'clock, and I kept my appointment, hoping to earn a few shillings. I have been in regular employment for five years. I have been in a good deal of trouble, and have been in hospital since Christmas."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 78, St. George Street East, and am a soapmaker's clerk—at a quarter to twelve on the night of 10th May, I was going along Prescott Street, which leads from the Minories into Leman Street—I noticed three men about two or three yards off coming towards me—as they passed me I was suddenly thrown on my back—I felt someone touching my chest—I suffered no violence—the three men ran away, and I got up; picked up my hat and umbrella, and then found my watch and part of my chain gone, and some silver from my trousers pocket—I had seen the watch and chain immediately before; I cannot swear to the silver—I cannot say if the prisoner is one of the men—I walked along Prescott Street for sixty or eighty yards till. I met a con stable, to whom I complained; while I was doing so another policeman came up, said something, and took me to the station, where I found the prisoner—I could not identify him.</p>

On 17th May I went to Eldon Street, Finsbury Square, with four other officers, at 3. 45, and saw the five prisoners and two men not in custody—Davis and Martin were walking on one side of the road, and Ford, O'Hara, and Saunders on the other; the two men not in custody were walking behind Davis and Martin—I saw Davis and Martin look into a gateway where some buildings were going on; they returned and spoke to the other three prisoners—after loitering about Eldon Street till 4.30, sometimes together and sometimes separate, they all five went into the gateway of the building, and Davis inserted something into the door of the temporary office; it came open, he went in, came out directly, passed the other four prisoners, and came into Eldon Street, where Dowse and I were standing—I said to Davis, "I want that bag of money you have got;" he struggled very violently; I said, "I shall hit you if you are not quiet"—I took him to the station, and the others were brought there—I said, "I shall charge you all five with breaking and entering a counting-house on a piece of waste land in Eldon Street, Finsbury, and stealing this bag and contents"—the bag contained 15d. in bronze, 143 Hanover medals, and two pieces of lead, which I had made up in the morning with the foreman of the works—Davis said, "It is a put-up job; I will stand to it; I don't know the other prisoners"—it was not a put-up job; I put the lead there because we received information that they were going to break into the office—Davis said he would give his address to-morrow, but he did not—the others said they knew nothing about it; Martin said, "I refuse my name and address; "Ford gave an address in Birmingham; O'Hara said, "I am living at a coffee-house at Cow Cross, I don't know the number; I am over here on the Parnell Commission"—the Inspector asked Saunders her name and address, she said, "Find out"—she afterwards gave her name, Sarah Saunders—Martin gave his name at the Police-court, but no address.</p>

I am manager to Mr. Barnett, a pawnbroker, of 319, High Holborn—I have known the prisoner for ten or twelve years, during which he has been in the habit of offering things in pledge, and sometimes pledging—in January, 1888, he pledged this chain (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); it is marked "15-c.," that means 15-carat—I looked at it, and lent him £3 upon it—it has been tested; it is only 9-carat, and of the value of about £2 5s.—on March 30th last he came and presented this single stone diamond ring, and asked £5 on it—I refused to advance it, being gaslight at the time—he then produced this chain, and said "Lend me £6 on the two"—I asked him if it was gold—he said "I bought it as 15-carat gold"—I then communicated with Mr. Barnett—I tested the chain, and found it was base metal, or" mystery gold," that is a term used in the trade—I handed the chain to Mr. Barnett—he asked me to weigh it; I did so, and told him it was 14 dwts.—Mr. Barnett had some conversation with the prisoner which I did not hear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I knew the prisoner as a dealer in jewellery; the 15-c. is stamped on one of the links of the chain—I saw him frequently during last year—he was not given into custody for that—I did not speak to him about it—it became an unredeemed pledge, and we looked, it up for sale, and then discovered what it was—I weighed it when I took it in, and presumed it was correct; it took me in—I have had a good deal of experience—the correct weight would be 14 dwts.—it had a very good appearance—it stands the test of nitric acid—I don't know what mystery gold is composed of—we cannot tell whether it is real gold or not unless we apply the test—to the outside public there is no means of testing it—the diamond ring is worth £3—I don't think he</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, at 319, High Holborn—on 30th March I saw the prisoner in the shop—he wanted to pawn this ring and chain, and said he would take £6 <hi rend="italic">or</hi> £7—they were both on the counter—it was 6 or 7 in the evening, and it was very difficult to judge of things of this kind—I asked him if it was gold—he said, "Yes"—he said he bought it in Hatton Garden—I said, "Is it 15-c. or 9-c.?"—he said, "It is 15-c."—I offered him £5 on them—he said the stone was a very white one—I asked his name; he said, "Frederick Stanton, 198, Strand"—I said, "Do you really live at that address?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "What are you?"—he said, "I am on the staff of the <hi rend="italic">Illustrated London News</hi>"—I said, "I thought you were a dealer"—I had known him as a dealer—he afterwards said his uncle was a great chess player, the great man Stanton, on the <hi rend="italic">Illustrated London News</hi>—I was not satisfied, so I sent for a policeman, and gave him in charge for giving a wrong name and address—this chain is of no value—the ring is a common article—£3 is its outside value.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I went with him and the policeman to Bow Street station—I gave him in custody for giving a false name and address under the 34th Section of the Pawnbrokers' Act; next day I charged him with attempting to obtain money—I had not seen my solicitor, Mr. Attenborough, in the interval—I was not sure about the chain until I saw it by daylight—dealers congregate in Hatton Garden, and sell diamonds and jewellery among one another—if a man gives a false name and address I should not take in the goods—I should cross-examine him, and if I found it was false I should give him into custody—I have done it repeatedly; since I have been in business in London I have given three persons in custody for it—if they do give false names they do it against the law—I could tell next day by daylight that it was mystery gold; it depends on a man's judgment and experience—Caudell is experienced in some things, fairly well in gold chains—this was a fraud on the face of it—it is not of the specific gravity of gold, it is lighter; it would not deceive me—I have seen the prisoner very often in the shop, and the goods he offered were worth so much less that I did not take anything in from him—we often advance more than is asked—there are scores of men who make a living by pawning goods and living on the profit—I think he said he was the nephew of Mr. Stanton.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and assist Mrs. Bailey, of Leadenhall Street, in cleaning up the offices of merchants in the building—on 23rd April, a little after 7 p. m., the bell rang, and I opened the street door, and saw Mr. Baker, who was formerly Mr. Self's clerk; he spoke to me, and I gave him an answer, but did not let him in—he shortly afterwards returned with the prisoner; I called Mrs. Bailey, and she let them into Self, Johnson's office on the second floor—about three-quarters of an hour or an hour after that Mrs. Bailey came down, and said something to me, and I saw the prisoner and Mr. Baker coming downstairs—the prisoner had a hamper like this on his back (<hi rend="italic">A very large one</hi>)—it was very heavy; it did not seem empty—I asked the prisoner how long he should be; he said he should be gone an hour—they returned in about a quarter of an hour, and rang the bell—I opened it, and saw them both; the prisoner had the empty hamper—I do not know where they put it—they went up into Self, Johnson's office, and I followed them, and said to the prisoner, "It is very funny you have come in when they are gone," meaning the gentlemen connected with the office—he said, "They did not know we were coming back"—he was writing—he said, "We shall be done in ten minutes"—he told me to leave, because he was writing—I could not do the office while they were there, because I should sweep the dust over them, and I left them for a short time—they then left—empty hampers are kept in the front office on a shelf over the door.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 69, Leadenhall Street, and employ Mrs. Wood to assist me in cleaning—on this evening, after the outer door was closed, I was on the top floor and heard the bell ring, and went down and met Langworthy and Baker on the landing by Self, Johnson's office—I said, "If you were strangers I would not have allowed you to come in, as there has been a robbery committed a few doors off"—I knew them both; one was traveller and the other late traveller or clerk; the prisoner was a servant—I went down and spoke to Mrs. Wood—there is a door out of Self, Johnson's counting-house into the sample-room where the tobacco is kept.</p>

                  </hi>. I am traveller to Mr. Salsberg, who trades as Self, Johnson, and Co., tobacco brokers, 69, Leadenhall Street—the prisoner was in their service; he had £2 a week—a person named Baker had been in their service, but had left some time—samples of tobacco are kept in the sample-room—when travellers take out samples to show to customers an entry is made in the sample-book—the samples are collected and entered during business hours—we open about 9. 30 a. m. and close about 6 p. m.—Mr. Smith, the cashier, was supposed to lock up the sample-room and put the key in the safe at night—he leaves the office door open, so that Mrs. Bailey can get in and clean it—on the morning of April 24th, as I entered the office I met the prisoner leaving it, with a sample under his arm—I looked at the sample-book and found that it was entered—I did not see him again till he was in custody; but he brought back the sample in my absence—the full weight of the samples in question is 4 1bs.; they are dock samples, taken from the bulk from bales or cases at the docks—I received information, examined the samples, and found nearly 100 of them had been opened and plundered—we put the minimum deficiency down at 112 1bs.; value about £21—the samples were all in proper condition on the 18th, and no samples were taken out by the firm between the 18th and the 23rd—Baker had no right whatever on the premises—the prisoner, being a traveller, would be quite right in writing in the office in business hours—he had no counting-house duties to perform.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first ascertained on the morning of the 24th that the samples had been tampered with—Mr. Salsberg was then present, and two of the junior clerks—I do not know who the suggestion came from that Mr. Salsberg should go into the sample-room—the door was open then; it had been opened in the usual course of business in the morning; I do not know who by—there were only two keys to my knowledge—Mr. Smith had one and Mr. Salsberg the other—the samples are in bins with lids, and there may be a piece of paper on top—pieces were taken out of nearly 100 bundles like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and then they were tied up again—this is the dock ticket, the samples plundered had dock tickets on them—I saw that they had been plundered first by the weight—there is a good deal of moisture in tobacco; there is about 14 per cent, in this—a few of these samples have been carted by travellers about the country—I weighed this one—I went to Seething Lane station, and told the police next day, I think—I don't remember seeing Mr. Salsberg at the Mansion House; I did not see him go into the witness-box—he did not go in and run out again—he was prosecuting his servant for dishonesty—he did not go into the witness-box, nor did he go to the police-station—he authorised me to go to the police-station some days after—I have seen the prisoner receive £2—I don't know whether he gets a commission; I get as much as £2 a week, leaving commission out of the question—I have been in three places during the last four years—I was with Mr. Carlebach, and left by mutual agreement, and went to C. Cuskey and Co—I left there, and went to Mr. Moni, and then to Seman and Co.; I was also with Charlesworth and Austin, but that was not my proper business—I left to go back to the leaf trade—that was</p>

               <p>five places in twenty-two years—I have had no quarrel with Baker or with the prisoner—I may have been on bad terms with the prisoner, but I was not in a chronic state of warfare with him—I had no ill-feeling against him, but I was not fond of him—I did not consider him a man that ought to command my respect—I have not spoken to Mr. Salsberg about it, but I think he knew it by our demeanour towards each other—I may have thought he was dishonest, but I did not mention that to my employer, as I should like to be certain before I spoke—Baker assisted in weighing these things—he is not here, nor was he called at the Mansion House—the difference in weight was very great in the samples sent—I never made a suggestion to Baker about putting tobacco in a man's coat when I gave information to the police—I mentioned that Baker had gone with the man on the day this hamper was taken away—Mr. Salsberg told me that he prosecuted the prisoner, as he appeared to have the greatest hand in the matter—I suggested that Baker and the prisoner should be prosecuted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have no personal ill-feeling towards the prisoner—I formed certain conclusions, but did not choose to act till I had good ground—I gain nothing by his discharge, my salary does not increase, nor does my position—you could see at a glance that the samples in the bin had been tampered with in a very severe manner.</p>

I carry on business as Self, Johnson, and Co., at 69, Leadenhall Street, as tobacco brokers and merchants—the prisoner was in my service at a salary of £2 a week and his travelling expenses—he had no right to take out samples after office hours, or to take baskets out, unless he had them on a journey, and then an entry would be made—he had a right to send them to the station—on the morning of the 24th a communication was made to me, and I went to the police, I think the next day, and from that time Mr. McNamara was acting under my directions—I was at the Mansion House once; I went into the box and took the oath, but they did not want my evidence; the prisoner said that he should prefer to examine me later on.</p>

               <p>months' trial—he does not get a commission at present on sales, but I have led him to believe he was to have not full commission but a part of the profit—there is a good deal of shrinkage in the packages; they would decrease 1lb. in a year—when travellers take tobacco out we never send it out again; it is re-sampled—this is Dutch tobacco from Java—it lays in our bins two or three years. <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I took the prisoner on trial, to see what business he could do—I gave him £2 a week during probation, and if the business was satisfactory he was to receive commission—I cannot say whether this has been re-sampled or not.</p>

I live at 92, Antill Road, Bow—I was in Mr. Salsberg's service two years, and left in January, because I could not get on well with Mr. McNamara—I have been in the tobacco trade about eight years—on leaving Mr. Salsberg I started with Mr. Stride; I intended to set up for myself—there are not many people in the basket line who know how to make these baskets—on the evening of April 23rd I had an appointment with the prisoner at seven o'clock—I inquired at the door, and they said he had gone—I waited a little while, and he came in—we went up, and wrote two private letters, and Mrs. Bailey was in the office till 7. 15, talking to me, and at 7. 30 the prisoner took a basket out on his shoulder to a man named Okey, a basket maker, about five minutes' distance, to have one made exactly the same, but Okey's was not open; he closed at seven o'clock, and we took the basket back—on my oath it was empty when it left—we did not tamper with the sample room at all; I did not look at it—I was there the whole time, and the prisoner never touched the sample-room door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an American citizen—on Sunday night, 12th May, I arrived at the Cafe Gouglar, Leicester Place, Trafalgar Square, at seven o'clock, and at eight o'clock I met Williams in the bar—he bowed, and I spoke to him on general topics—I told him I was an American—he called my attention to Morbey, and said he was a jockey from St. Louis—I paid for the first drink; they reciprocated—they said, "Let us go elsewhere and get a drink"—I am not acquainted with the City—I don't know where they took me—I said I had just arrived, and I was not acquainted with the City—we went to several bars in that neighbourhood—after we had taken an American drink we walked through several streets and into an alley—then Morbey tossed up a coin, and said, "Williams has won your sovereign"—I said, "Well, take the sovereign; I don't understand the game, and I don't want to"—I took it out of my waistcoat pocket, where I carried my money loose—I meant I wanted to get out of the game—they kept on tossing up—I made several attempts to walk away, and both of them shoved me round, and would not allow me to go—I had six sovereigns in my pocket, and after I gave the first one I put my hand in my pocket each time, and Morbey took a</p>

               <p>sovereign out—I was not joining in the game, merely looking on—I commenced to remonstrate with them; I wanted to get out, and they said, "Won't you keep still!" in a sort of manner that I thought indicated they meant injury if I did not—this was in the middle of a street, with shops, under a gaslight; three vehicles abreast might have passed through it—I saw no people there—I have no idea what time it was—in the forepart of the evening at one of the bars I had mentioned that a letter of credit contained all my money—I did not show it then—in this courtway after they had won the six sovereigns, Morbey asked me to let them look at it—I did so; they read it and gave it back—then they kept on tossing up, and eventually they claimed the letter of credit; they asked me to let them see it again—I said, "What for?" and put my hand against it to protect it—Morbey took it from me; it was in this case; he took my hand away, put his hand in my pocket, and took out the case—he handed the letter of credit to Williams—I got the case back; I demanded my letter of credit; they said, "Won't you keep still?"—they were very polite till they got my letter—when I de manded the letter repeatedly they pulled me out of the alley-way into the main street, a very long one; a cab drove along, they called it and tried to put me in—I made resistance, but they got me in; I could not help my self—they gave orders to the cabman—we drove for about five or ten minutes—we stopped somewhere, I don't know where—the prisoners asked for admittance; the man and woman who kept the house refused them—they pushed their way in, and took me into a very dingy room—I demanded the letter of credit in the presence of the lady and gentleman, who then put us out, and said they would not allow them to bring me there—when we got out we walked about a square and a half—I was demanding my letter of credit—we met a tram car, which the prisoners got on to—I followed them—Morbey held back, and threatened me with his cane, and struck at me three times; I dodged the blows—I followed the tram for about a square, and met a constable, to whom I stated my case—I and the constable got on the top of the tram—I was very excited, I don't remember what the prisoners said; I know Williams told Morbey, who then had it, to tear up the letter of credit, and he tried to tear it up; and he did not use choice language—it was not torn up.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I went into the bar at the cafe I wanted some one to converse with, and I spoke to Williams with that object—I asked him if he could get off for a day to show me the sights, take me to West—minster Abbey, and so forth—I think we only had two drinks at the cafe—we went to three other bars; we had the American drink at the last—until then I had drunk bitter beer—I do not know the bars—I did not win £2 of Morbey and lose it again—I did not toss at all—I told Inspector Cox, "I have tossed, but I didn't understand the tossing; but Morbey told me sometimes I won and sometimes I lost"—I refused all along to admit having anything to do with it—I was not the worse for drink at the time of the tossing—the last drink I was not used to, but it had no effect on me—I don't think I was the worse for drink—I had been in the train, and I had nothing to drink except bovril, until I had the beer—we treated each other; I never drank much in America—all the tossing took place under the light of a lamp-post, in a street where three carriages could pass abreast—we were not very noisy about it—Morbey was crying out heads and tails—I was trying to get out of it; they would not let me</p>

               <p>—I did not think of shouting—I saw no one about—I wanted to get my money back—Morbey did not hand me any money—they told me I had won something, but they did not give me any money, I can swear—I did not see either of the prisoners throw anything away when they left to get on the tram-car—they had £6 in gold of my money—the police found on them at the station £3 odd—I said at the Police-court I did not know what they did with the rest of the money—I did not see them throw any away—I kept my eye on them from the time they left me till they got on the tram-car—I have signed my name at the bottom of the lotter of credit; when I present it I have to write my name on a piece of paper which the banker compares with the letter—I told the prisoners at the beginning of the evening that my money was in a letter of credit—I showed it to them; they looked at it and handed it back to me—when we got in the cab Williams pretended to be drunk; I am convinced he was only <hi rend="italic">shamming</hi>—I would not say he was perfectly sober—Morbey said he was to give me back the letter of credit; Williams would not do so—after that we went to the house; nothing was said about the character of it, and I had no idea as to the sort of house it was—I consider it was a bad sort of house—after I began calling for the letter, the man and woman said they would not have me in there—before we went in they refused entrance—the prisoners forced their way in—I could not swear they were perfectly sober—we had not been drinking very heavily—I was not the worse for drink, nor were they, apparently—towards the close of it, when they were trying to get away, and Morbey attempted to strike me, I said, "If I had a revolver I would shoot you"—I had dis posed of my revolver at Liverpool—I saw no one about till I saw the officers—the tram-car seemed pretty full—I was looking out for people, but I did not see any—I saw no one earlier than that but a woman, who halloed out of the window at the prisoners when they were tossing, and said something about "getting out of that"—I had been at Liverpool several days—I was not anxious to press the charge, provided I could get my money and letter back—the constable said, "If you don't charge these men I shall have to give the letter of credit back to the man from whom I took it"—I said, if I could not get the letter of credit back without charging them, I would charge them—as soon as I got into the station Morbey offered me the letter back if I would not charge them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> On the 9th I reeeived £10 in Liverpool on this letter of credit, and on the 12th I had £6 left—the Magistrate allowed me to draw £20 since this happened—I am certain I had £6 in gold in my waistcoat pocket—when tossing the prisoners said occasionally, "You have won"—they did not give me anything, and I protested all along that I did not want to play the game—Morbey said he would toss on my behalf—I did not consent to his doing so—when I paid the first sovereign they saw the other five, and Morbey took them out of my pocket piece by piece, after claiming one each time—I was frightened, and did not know what to do about it—no one else was in the street—while in the house they were in my sight the whole time—I do not think they could have disposed of the money then—I want to get back to America—I came over to see Liverpool and London—I am 19.</p>

I was in the Hampstead Road on the night of 12th May, when the prosecutor came running up and made a complaint, and pointed out a tram-car to me—I went on to the top of it with him—he pointed out the two prisoners to me on the top—I told them the prosecutor complained that they had robbed him of 300 dollars, and that I should take them into custody for stealing it—Williams shouted out to Morbey, who was sitting at the other end of the car, "Tear it up; don't let the b——have it"—I and another constable took the prisoners to the station—when being charged both prisoners said, "If you don't charge me, Johnson, we will give you the letter of credit back"—Morbey had it; I took it from him—he attempted to tear it up—the prosecutor, in their presence, said they had had six gold pieces from him—they were searched at the station—on Morbey I found £2 in gold, 4s. 6d. in silver, and 8 1/2 d. bronze; and on Williams 22s. in silver and 9 1/2 d. bronze—in my opinion the prosecutor was perfectly sober; he might have had a glass during the evening; he was coherent—the prisoners both said that they had no fixed abode.</p>

I am clerk to Mr. Alexander Trengrove, of 26, Paternoster Row—on 18th May, about 1. 15, I had been out to dinner, and as I was returning to the shop I saw two men at the door; one of them was looking down into the basement, the other was standing in the doorway—the prisoner was one of the two, but I could not say which—they stood there about a minute or a minute and a half; they spoke to each other—another man then came from inside the shop, and joined them—all three went away together—I then went into the shop, went behind the counter, and looked at the till, and missed £2 12s., all in silver—there was no one in the shop—I immediately ran out into Pater noster Row, and found a policeman—I saw the three men just turning into Paternoster Square—they were walking—I spoke to the policeman, and followed them—when I got round the square, I saw them again; two of them were then running; the prisoner was still walking—I stopped him and gave him in charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I speak, of £60 as their value, I do not mean the selling value in my shop, that would be considerably more—I manufacture them myself—the handles are of real ivory—they are marked different prices, from a little more than 6s. 6d. up to £2 15s.—the rough value all round would, perhaps, be about 13s. or 14s. each.</p>

Before going to bed to-night, go down and unbolt the door which communicates between the front cellar and the staircase which leads into the hall and the upper part of the house. Go to bed as usual, but don't go to sleep; we shall come about half-past twelve. My brother will get over the area, and come upstairs into the passage; he will then give a low whistle, which, when you hear, you will come down and bring the key of the front parlour. When we have got the things out we will lock the door, you take the key up, and go to bed as if</p>

On 30th April I was in the house, 57, Frith Street, in the early morning, and I saw the figure of a man coming over the railings—we waited a few minutes, and I and Humphreys went downstairs in the basement, and found Bishop, who was taken into custody, and taken to Marlborough Mews—on the same morning I saw Kendall in the passage of the Police-court, and I arrested him, and told him he would be charged with his brother, in breaking and entering 57, Frith Street—he said, "I am quite innocent, I have</p>

I was on duty in Frith Street on Monday, 30th April—I had received information about the prisoners—between twelve and one I saw the prisoners near the corner of Compton and Frith Streets; I stood in a passage—they passed me talking, and went to the corner of Bateman Street, three or four yards from No. 57—they looked up the front of the house—they separated, Kendall going into Greek Street, and Bishop through Bateman Street into Dean Street—they re turned by different streets to the corner of Frith and Compton Streets, where I saw them speaking to one another—then they separated again, and Bishop came on one side and Kendall on the other, passing me, and stopping outside the house at the same corner as before—after a few minutes I saw Bishop in conversation with a woman, while Kendall stood on the opposite corner—they stood there about five minutes, and then they separated, and I saw Kendall at the corner of Compton and Frith Streets, while Bishop mounted the railings and disappeared—instantly afterwards I heard a police whistle—I went up to the house and saw Bishop in custody—I tried to find Kendall, but could not—it was him possible for Kendall, from where he stood, to see Bishop getting over the railings; he was about 40 lbs. off.</p>

In the North Sea the mate of each smack deposits a note, saying how much fish he has put on board, and we add up the numbers before we get to Billingsgate, and the total represents the cargo of the ship—the fish is stowed away in the main hold; there is only one hatchway—I have charge of the starboard side and Meir of the port side—I exercise general supervision over the men and assist in stowing—I do not think anybody could take 2 1/2 cwt. of turbot from my side of the vessel while I was there—we were about three hours taking the fish in—there is always a watch on deck; the boatswain, Fred Coles, has one, and I the other—I do not suggest that he would be a party to the fish being removed—the cargo was undisturbed, so far as I know, till we got to Billingsgate—I went ashore at 8. 30, but did not leave till Roberts came on board—the consignees are different salesmen in Billingsgate, so many boxes—a box of haddock will weigh six stone, and turbot from six to seven stone—the boxes are not weighed—if a salesman was a considerable amount of fish short he would complain to the company—the forecastle is rather damp in wet weather—she is a wet boat, always in a state of dampness—no complaint has been made of the number of boxes being short—the boxes are covered with ice, and packed in tiers, face to face—the ice melts before we get to Billingsgate, but we have slack boxes every voyage—they would not put turbot and soles on top of haddock—we call turbot prime fish and haddock offal, and it is usual to have the prime fish slack—I have heard no complaint of soles being sent as weight.</p>

I saw Chivers in the bar, and a barrel close to the cellar door—I said, "Whose is this?" and laid my hand on it—he said, "That is mine," and wheeled it towards the door—it was full, and there was straw at the top—I could smell that it contained fish—my mistress then called my attention to the cellar door being open—I had left it locked, and the key in its usual place, on a hook in the bar, where anybody could reach it—I locked the door, but did not go into the cellar—the barrel was then gone—the police came soon after, and I went into the cellar with them; and they found one of the bags half full of turbot, and two of the other bags empty—one was missing, and all the turbots were taken away—we have not got them</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector K</hi>). I am stationed at Barking—at a quarter to 8 p. m. on 2nd May Black was brought to the station by Badsey—from information received I went to Black's shop, 23, North Street, where I saw Mr. Fergusson and a large quantity of boots, which he identified—a constable was put in charge of them—I went to the Broadway, Barking, where I saw Hollingsworth—I said to him,"Joe; do they call you Rubber?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Mr. Fergusson charges you with being concerned, with Joseph Perry, in stealing about 200 pairs of boots"—he replied, "Me! not me; he has made a mistake"—I handed him over to Badsey, and he was taken to the police-station—I then went to 23, Axe Street, Barking, the private address of Black, where I found this pair of boots (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I went to the station—I had the three prisoners put together—I told Black he would be charged with receiving a large quantity of boots from Perry and Hollingsworth"—he replied, "Yes, all right; I will tell all"—I told him I should take down in writing all he said, and produce it at the Police-court—he made the following statement, which I wrote down at the time; he signed it: "When Joe Rubber (Hollingsworth) came to my place, about six months ago, he said to me, 'Jim, do you want to buy a pair of boots?'I said, 'Yes; what sort are they, and where did you get them?'he said, 'They are a pair I bought, misfits. 'I said, "What do you want for them?'he said, '5s. 'I gave it to him, and he brought another pair. I said, 'Are these misfits?'he said, 'Yes. 'After a lapse of two weeks he brought some more; I bought them, and allowed him 5s. a pair; about six or seven pairs at different times. I lent him 1s. He never came any more.

               <p>Perry came, and he asked me if I would buy a pair of children's boots. He had a pair and I bought them. He has been bringing them ever since, and I have bought them. I have not sold three pairs a week of them. What I have sold have been my own making"—I told Hollings worth he would be charged, and that he had heard what Black said about him—he replied, "I have not been in his shop this twelve months; I own that I went with two separate pairs, one at a time, that I bought up the road at Stratford"—Hollingsworth signed that—when charged, they made no reply—I searched Black's shop, and found 296 pairs of boots (which have been identified by the prosecutor) in cupboards, drawers, and in the window—after taking Mr. Fergusson's property away there were about thirteen pairs of new boots left as his stock-in-trade, and some boots in repair—we found up the chimney a sole which had been taken off a boot.</p>

At the Police-court on 1st May Mr. Shannon said there was not a strong case against Hollingsworth, but we have more evidence to-day—the chairman said nothing about it—all the prisoners would have been allowed out on bail, but they could not obtain it.</p>

Black has been seven or eight years in the neighbourhood, I believe—he bears a respectable character—the boots have been suspiciously mutilated—I can't say if the piece of leather was put up the chimney to hide it—I found no boots up the chimney—Badsey and Mr. Fergusson were present when I took down the prisoners' statements; I wrote them myself—Black's is a small shop, about 200 yards from Fergusson's; there are other shops in the street, but no other boot-shops.</p>

Shortly before 7 o'clock on this evening I went to Black's shop—Mr. Fergusson made a complaint about boots in his possession—I asked Black where they were—he said all those in the window belonged to him—I asked him if there were any more—he said, "Let me consider for a moment; I am very nigh dumbfounded"—I said, "Any more upstairs?"—he said, "Yes, I have"—he handed me down a bundle with about twenty pairs in it—I asked him if he had any more; he said, "Yes"—I went to the cupboard and found a quantity more—those boots were all identified by Mr. Fergusson—Black said they were all Mr. Fergusson's property, and he hoped Mr. Fergusson would not prosecute him, taking into consideration his children—Mr. Fergusson said the case was already in the hands of the police, and he could not withdraw it—Black said he would give him every pair back, and would work his hands off if only he would have mercy on him, for the sake of his wife and children—I took him into custody—he was taken to the station and charged—I was present when he made a statement, which he signed—the inspector afterwards handed over Hollingsworth to me at Barking, and I brought him to the station; when taken into custody, and charged with being concerned with Perry in stealing the boots, he said, "Me! not me; I know nothing about them"—that was all he said in my presence till the statement was made.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commercial traveller, and pro prietor of the grocer's shop known as the Wolsey Stores, 50, Wolsey Terrace, Mortlake—in March, 1887, I engaged the prisoner as manager of that shop—he wrote this letter, to show the terms on which he was engaged (<hi rend="italic">In this letter he agreed to take management of the shop; to allow all goods to be charged in his name, and medicine and tobacco licenses to be taken in his name; but that he should not be liable for goods sold; he should have no claim on anything; and that he was only a weekly paid servant</hi>)—he entered on the management—I paid him £1 5s. a week, and commission of 3d. in the £ after the first stocktaking—from time to time I went to the premises, to compare the receipts and the payments—it was part of his duty to keep this cash-book, and when I went I compared this cash-book with</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188905270050"/>
               <p>the receipts and invoices—the prisoner produced receipts to correspond with every payment shown in the hook—I dealt with Messrs. Murley Brothers, cheese mongers, and from time to time I find their name mentioned in this book, as having been paid sums of money—under date 13th February I find an entry in the prisoner's handwriting, of the payment to them of the sum of £3 15s. 3d.—he produced this receipt as a payment for the money—in December his salary had been reduced to £1 a week, as the business did not pay, and he was to have one-third of the net profits, which would have been to his benefit if he had worked well—on 16th March, 1889, I went to the shop and asked to see his cash-book and invoices—he produced a bundle of invoices for goods which had been purchased apparently for the business; I knew nothing of them before—in the first place he wanted me not to see anything, but to go away; in fact, he wrote to me on the very morning, to ask me not to go there—when I got there I asked for the paid and unpaid files, and he produced them at once—I found he had not paid various amounts he represented in the cash-book to have paid—I had previously been round to the wholesale firms and gained certain information, and it was in consequence of that that I went on 16th March to look at the files—some of the invoices I had never seen before—I did not know the amounts were owing that were shown by these invoices—I said, "I only find about £50 worth of invoices on the file, you must owe a great deal more than these"—I asked him how much he owed? what bills were due?—he produced a batch of bills which came to £104 or £105, but I had found out that he owed £186 at the least—I said nothing about that to him—I said he must have been robbing me—he said he had not, but afterwards he admitted that he had lost the money—I said, "Sand well, be honest, and tell me the facts; have you been gambling, betting, or what have you done?"—all I could get out of him was, "I have lost the money"—I said, "What do you mean by losing the money? be honest; I have been a friend to you"—he said, "All I can say is I have lost the money"—I could get nothing else from him; he would not say how—after that I went with him to two of the wholesale houses whose invoices I found there, in order to see if those amounts were really owing—subsequently I found all those amounts were owing, and I have paid them—at the time of the interview on 16th March, I had been to Messrs Murley Brothers and had got this receipt in my possession; when I found they had not received the money, I considered it was a forgery, and took it from this paid file—I have looked on the receipt file for all the receipts corresponding to entries in the cash-book; I could not find them—about £80 worth are missing—if the cash-book is right, receipts to the amount of about £80 are missing from the file—those receipts have been on the file at the time I have examined the cash-book, and are now missing—after I discovered these matters I took proceedings against the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I told the prisoner on the 17th March he would have nothing to do with the stocktaking; I don't remember the prisoner complaining that it was not fair treatment—I don't think it unfair—from the 17th March the prisoner has had no charge or control over the shop and papers—only two of the invoices I found were from firms I was not aware the prisoner was dealing with; they were from Gardiner Jones, a tea merchant, I believe—I am traveller for Mr. Williams, a tea merchant—I told he prisoner when I engaged him he was to get all his tea from</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188905270051"/>
               <p>the firm I am with—I gave him full latitude to get provisions where he liked—I was very much annoyed to find he was getting tea from Gardiner Jones, instead of from our house, and he said he had only had one transaction with them, and he would not have any more—I think he would know I should be annoyed—if he had entered in the cash-book a payment of £3 15s. to Gardiner Jones, I should have found out that he was dealing with Gardiner Jones—he must have had a reason for not entering pay ments to Gardiner Jones in the cash-book—I have no idea of his making a payment of £4 6s. 5d. to Gardiner Jones on or about the 18th February—I am astonished to hear it—I never expected him to pay anybody but those he put down in the cash-book—I have heard he has made payments other than those entered into the cash-book, but I have not heard it in regard to Gardiner Jones till now—he did not ask me to go round with him to the wholesale houses from whom he was purchasing, nor did he say that he would take me to all the houses from whom he bought goods, and that the mistake that I had made would be cleared up; I swear that—I went with him to two houses to see about the accounts—I thought I might compound with them to some extent—they knew a few days before the 16th March that I was the principal; I went round openly, and said I was proprietor, and responsible—I did not ask him to go to the two firms with me—I said by his pointing out the way he had robbed me to Ward Brothers they would relieve me of part of my debt; I believed he would say he had been robbing me because he said he had lost the money—on 16th March I thought he had been mismanaging the business—I cannot say I thought he had been robbing me; I came to the conclusion that he had been robbing me on 16th March, and on going to Murley Brothers on that day I felt more or less convinced about it—I did not treat it as if he had not been robbing me—this is a letter of 26th April from my solicitors to the prisoner (<hi rend="italic">This said that they had received instructions to proceed, and that they should do so unless</hi> £15 <hi rend="italic">was paid</hi>)—I left the matter in their hands; I had not given them definite instructions to sue unless he paid £15—between the 16th March and 26th April I had at intervals asked the prisoner for pay ment of the money—I could not afford to lose the money and to pay the costs of the prosecution, and the loss of my position—he said he would pay me—he offered to give me £10, which he said a friend would give him, and his furniture, if I would not prosecute him—I said I would not allow him to move his furniture out of the shop—after that he consulted a solicitor, who told me I could not detain the furniture—he offered to give me the furniture—the business was carried on in his name; my name never appeared in it—I never told him I thought I had adopted the wrong course, that I ought to have allowed him to continue to appear as the real debtor, and he could have offered to pay 5s. in the £, and I should have got off scot free—I was too honourable for such a thing; I went round and told the wholesale people—the prisoner at the Police-court made the suggestion; that was the only occasion when I heard of it—I did not prosecute him before 8th May, because I thought with a man so deeply implicated, a great deal more might come out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I am bearing the expenses of the prosecution—I questioned him time after time as to what he had done with the money, and gave him opportunity of explanation—he did not give me the slightest suggestion as to where he had lost it—I begged him in every way to find</p>

               <p>out—I don't think there was any answer to the letter, saying if he paid £15 they would not proceed—no suggestion was made by him then that he had spent the money in buying goods from other people—I first heard that when he was before the Magistrate—I took stock from time to time—stock was deficient in the second six months, it showed a loss—I never found too much stock in the place—if goods had been bought by him from Gardiner Jones and others, over and above the amount in the book, I should have found too much—no such goods ever did come into my stock—the first time I heard that he had made payments not entered in the cash-book was from his own statement before the Magistrate—the prisoner has had nothing to do with the shop since 16th March, when the receipts were missing—three or four days before that I commenced making inquiries among the wholesale houses—some of the receipts of Messrs.

I went with Detective Nichols to 103, Stamford Street, Blackfriars, second floor front, and saw the two prisoners and a female, who has since been discharged—Marney said, "I live at 50, Grey Street, Waterloo Road; I have only just come to see my friend Bell"—he got up and was about to leave—I said, "No; I have not done with you yet; I nave reason to believe you have got some stolen property in the house"—he said, "No, I have not; all the property in the house belongs to me and my wife, except the furniture, and that belongs to the landlord"—I found in a tin box four coats, three vests, two pairs of trousers, and a lady's ulster—I said to Bell, "How do you account for these?"—he said, "They don't belong to me; the box is mine; I don't know how they got there"—I said, "You will all three be charged with being concerned in receiving the property found, and also other property missing, which has been stolen this morning, about four o'clock, from 135, Stamford Street"—they made no reply—they were taken to the station—Bell said, "This morning, about four o'clock, Marney came to my place, 103, Stamford Street, and rang the front door bell; he was accompanied by a short old man, and was carrying the property you found in my box, on his arm, he said, 'I had a row with my old woman; would you mind taking these things in for me?'I said, 'Yes; although I suspected there was something wrong at the time '"—I repeated this at the station in Bell's hearing, and Marney said, "That is not true"—Marney was then charged with burglariously breaking and entering, and stealing the property mentioned, and Bell with receiving the same—when the charge was read, and the Inspector read "Concerned with another not in custody, "Marney said, "There was no other in it; I <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it myself"—Inspector Jackson cautioned them, and then took down their statements, and they both signed them.</p>

Marney, rang my street-door bell, and asked me if I would take in his things; I mean the things found by Superintendent Ward in my box; he said he had had a row at home, and said, 'Can I leave these things?'I saw another man with him, but he did not come in"—after I read that, Marney said, "Then I will make a statement"—I cautioned him, and took it down, and he signed it; he said, "I took the things produced by Superintendent Ward, and the other things stolen, to Henry Bell's and told him I had stolen them. I told him I had got some things out of the passage of 135, Stamford Street, and he handed me a quilt to wrap them in."—I asked him to describe the quilt—he said it was a red-and-white one, red stripes and fringe—I sent Nichols to Bell's room, and he found a blue-and-white quilt. <hi rend="italic">Marney produced a written defence, stating that he knew nothing about the robbery.
