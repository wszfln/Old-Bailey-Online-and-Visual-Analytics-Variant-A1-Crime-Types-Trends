Last Saturday was four weeks my husband went out at about six in the morning; I heard a noise; I thought it was somebody come to me to buy something; I was not well; I did not attend to it; I did not get up at that time. About seven in the morning I heard the same noise repeated, turning round in my bed (the curtains being drawn I suppose the prisoner did not think there was any body in the bed,) I drew back the curtains and saw the prisoner sitting with a gown, a pair of stays and petticoat of mine in her lap; I left them in a chair by the window; there were 4 s. in money likewise laid in the chair at the time; I had asked my husband for some money before he went out, and he had laid four shillings down in the chair; I jumped out of bed and seised the prisoner; I did not immediately think of my money, but laid hold of the gown, the handkerchief, and the stays, which she dropped and extricated herself from me; she ran down stairs, but was pursued and taken; when she was brought back again I had by that time recollected my money; I charged her with taking that; she denied that she knew any thing of it; at last Timnall said he saw her drop two shillings on the stairs; then she desired to be searched; she afterwards produced the other two shillings.</p>

            ; there was a trunk which had been left at our house for four years which was to be sent for; I received a note that the prisoner at the bar was to fetch it; the trunk was emptied, and the things that had been in it which are the things mentioned in the indictment were tied up in a bundle and laid on a chair near the trunk. On the twenty first of July when I was up stairs, my mother who was below stairs called to me and said the woman who had fetched the trunk had ran away with the bundle; I immediately looked out at the window, and saw the prisoner running along with the trunk under her arm; I pursued her, but could not overtake her, and I did not meet with her till three weeks after; then I took her up; she insisted then that it was not she that had fetched the trunk, but that it was her sister, and she endeavoured to throw the theft upon her sister; her sister was taken up; nothing appeared against her sister, and she was discharged. The prisoner fell upon her knees before the justice, and owned she had done it, and begged forgiveness. I found this cap upon the head of Mrs. Reynolds, at a publick house in Broad St. Giles's; I knew it to be mine as soon as I saw it.</p>

I came down stairs, and seeing the prisoner in a part of the room I thought she had no business in, I watched and saw her take a quart pot off the upper shelf, and put it under her apron; I told my aunt of it, but I bid her not take any notice till the prisoner went away; when she went out I sent the girl after her to bid her come back, but left she should not, I went after her myself; she came back; I asked her what she had in her apron, she said some bread and cheese, which I found she had; I asked her what she had underneath; she said nothing; I felt under her apron and took the pot out of her hand; she said good lord, I did not know what I was about when I took it.</p>
               <p>(The pot was produced in court by the constable, and deposed to by Towers.)</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I asked his aunt to let me take the pot to get some small beer.</p>

I laid hold of Greenslade, and kept her in custody till a constable came; Mr. Hall took her to Clerkenwell Bridewell.

               <p>I was the constable of the night. Some people came to me, and said, that a man was robbed in George-alley; I went, and the prosecutor gave me charge of Greenslade; I sent her to New Prison. After that, the man said he should be glad to get his watch again. I went to some bad houses in the liberty, and got some intelligence where Agan had pawned or sold the watch; at last I got intelligence where the watch was; I went to the house that was Burkett's; I charged him with it, and it proved to be his man's house.</p>

               <p>How happened she to come to you with the watch? - I was at the house of a friend of a woman that was with her.</p>
               <p>What friend's house? - In Chick-lane: another woman called me out, and asked me to lend her seventeen shillings upon it; it being Sunday night she said she could not pawn it, and she wanted to go to market in the morning. I lent her seventeen shillings upon it, not knowing it was stolen.</p>
               <p>Court. Nor not caring about it? - I was never guilty of such a thing in my born days. I had known the woman before.</p>
               <p>(The watch was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. You did not see Agan that night? - I might see her, but I cannot swear to her.</p>

               <p>I was just coming out of my own house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177810210011"/> from our place, for a pennyworth of beer to my supper; this gentleman catched hold of me, and bid me give him his watch that I had robbed him of; I told him I had never seen him nor his watch; he said I was the person, and he would give a constable charge of me; I told him I would stay till he fetched a constable, if he pleased; I staid while he fetched one; I desired he would not drive me down; I went down to Mr. Hall's house; Mr. Hall asked for the watch; I said I had never seen it. The prosecutor said, if you have got it, for God's sake give it me! I will go home to my wife. I never had the the watch, nor know nothing about it.</p>

               <p>As I was coming down George-alley about ten o'clock, I trod upon something; it rattled; a woman came after me, and said she would have halves; we went to that gentleman's house, and he lent us 17 s. upon it; she had half of it; I have never seen her since; I was carried to Mr. Hall's house, and know no further of it.</p>
               <p>To the prosecutor. Can you recollect your having looked at your watch any time that evening? - Yes; going over Smithfield I did, and it then wanted about three minutes to nine; that was not five minutes before I lost it.</p>

               <p>I am the daughter of the prosecutor. On Wednesday last was three weeks the prisoner came into our shop and enquired for some stockings; she did not buy, but went out again. I missed a 'pair of stockings; Harding, the apprentice, was sent after her.</p>
               <p>- HARDING sworn.</p>
               <p>I went after the prisoner; I found her at some distance from the shop; she was sitting down, and pretended to have the stomach-ache. I made her get up, and behind her I found a pair of woman's stockings; as I was bringing her up the lane, a pair of white linen gloves dropped from her; after that another pair dropped from her; one of the pair of gloves has Mr. Lingham's marks upon them; I cannot swear to the other, nor to the stockings. I had the day before put fifteen pair of black stockings upon the counter, when we came to tell them there were only<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177810210012"/> fourteen pair; it was impossible to miss the gloves, there were so many pair there.</p>

I told her, I did not keep silk gauze, that was milliners and haberdashers goods; there was a piece of Irish lying upon the counter at the time; the women said they were sorry to give me the trouble, and turned out of the shop. I missed this piece of Irish immediately; I followed them, and stopped them within forty or fifty yards of the shop. The prisoner had a long cloak on, the other had none; therefore I knew she must be the person that had the goods. I went before them; I put my arm round her, and said, you have got something of mine under your cloak. What is it? said she; I said, a piece of Irish. I felt it slide down with my hand, and she dropped it at her heel. I kept her there, and desired a boy that was near to call a constable. I took the cloth up in my hand, and the constable came directly and took charge of her; the cloth has my own private mark upon it. (It was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.) I had only this one piece of cloth upon the counter when they came into our shop, for I had sold the fellow to it not five minutes before.</p>
               <p>Was there any other person in the shop? - Only the prisoner, and the woman that came with her; the prisoner had a large red cloak on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not three women come into the shop? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never was near his counter; I had been on an errand; as I was coming along I met a young woman that lived near me, when I lived in service in Lincolns-inn-fields. I told her I was going home towards Westminster; she said, she was going that way, but must buy some gauze to make up a cap; she said, if I would stop, she would go home with me; she went into the shop; she had got a cloak on, I had none; when we had got a vast way from the shop, she turned her head round, and said, the man of the shop is coming; that rather startled me; I stood still; she dropped something; this gentleman laid hold of a piece of cloth, and then took hold of me; he bid her go about her business. I never was guilty of any thing bad in my life.</p>
               <p>Court to the prosecutor. You said the other had no cloak? - I believe she had no cloak at all; this prisoner had a large red cloak on. I was persuaded before I stopped her that the prisoner must have the cloth; I felt it sliding down under her cloak.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you bid the other woman go about her business? - I did not say any thing to her.</p>
               <p>Court. Whether she had a cloak on or no, must be a circumstance that you must know. - She had a cloak on when she was before the justice.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He wanted a woman to swear she saw me drop it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. A neighbour came in and told my wife the circumstance that she saw the prisoner drop the cloth. When that woman came before the justice she would not swear this; she wished to avoid the trouble<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177810210013"/> of coming to the Old-Bailey, and therefore evaded the justice's questions in such a manner, that they could not bind her over.</p>

On the 10th of October I asked the prisoner to come and wash for me, which she did; I counted out the linen to her; I went out between nine and ten in the morning and returned about six in the evening, she was then gone and had locked my door and taken the key with her; I went to her lodging and found the door on the latch, but she was not at home; I got a candle of the landlady and went in and found my key on her table; I went and opened my door, and found she had put the linen in the tub and some water on it, but no soap; I did not miss any thing then; being tired I went to bed. The next morning I found my drawers open; and missed all the things mentioned in the indictment, (repeating them). She was taken on the Friday following, and some of my things were found upon her.</p>

She had a white petticoat, a pair of white silk stockings, and a white laced cap of the prosecutor's on; she said there was a flowered linen gown at one Davidson's, a pawnbroker's over the water; and that she had pawned a gown in the Minories, and another petticoat in Rosemary-lane, but they were returned to the prosecutor again; Davidson was sent for, he would not come.</p>

I sent the prisoner in to clean our room on the 7th of October, in the morning about twelve o'clock, and she stole the things mentioned in the indictment. I was near the door selling fruit. I sent her in to clean the place; she was in the room about two hours. I had given her the key to go in; when she brought me the key again I went in and missed the things from out of my chest, which was left unlocked. I found her afterwards at a public house near Stepney; she had a cloak and silk hat of mine in a bushel basket covered with straw; she had pawned the rest; she would not tell me where she had pawned them; I am sure the cloak and hat were mine.</p>

I took a fare up at the door, for they said they had got every thing out of the coach; when I had got two or three miles off, I had six people in the coach and two or three outside, a man followed me up and said, are you the coachman? I said yes; he said, there is a box in your coach. I bid him look into the coach and see; he looked in, the gentlemen said there was nothing there, he bid me go on, I came on to London. I set these people down at Bishopsgate Church, and one gentleman at Temple-bar; I carried four or five fares after that, I put my hand under the seat of the coach to feel for my hammer to knock the pole of my coach up, then I found this bundle in the coach; I took it to my own home, my mother-in law took care of this bundle in case it should be enquired after or advertised, as it must then be given back to the people; I kept it a whole week, it was never advertised, I did not know where to carry these things; I thought I had them safe when the people came for them, I asked my mother where they were, she said she had pawned them; I did not know that she had; I did not deny them, I told them they should have them again; I have lived twenty-six years in Whitechapel; I never did a misbehaviour thing in the world; I never did any fault in the days of my breath.

               <p>On Tuesday the 15th of September, between ten and eleven o'clock at night as I was coming through the Strand; I was attacked near the New Church by three women; they surrounded me and took my pocket book from me; I turned round and saw it go from me, or I should not have known I had been robbed; I saw four hands held up; I suppose it was delivered from one to another; I cried watch, and stop thief! and secured Pearce directly.</p>
               <p>Had she the pocket book in her hand? - I cannot say she had.</p>
               <p>What did you see her do? - I cannot say I saw her do any thing; she was one that surrounded me, she seemed very much frightened when I laid hold of her.</p>
               <p>Did she seem before to be in the company of the other two? - She was one that surrounded me.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether the other two prisoners were two of the persons that surrounded you? - I do not know; they ran away immediately as they took the pocket book; there were notes in the pocket book to the value of 14 or 1500 l. and many memorandums.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You say this was at night about eleven o'clock? - Between ten and eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Were there any more than three women near you? - I did not see any other.</p>

Mr. Kitchen cried out, stop thief! I am robbed. There was no other woman near him when he cried stop thief. There were five or six women standing at the corner of the church, he ran up to them, and laid hold of one, and said, I have got you; I have got you.</p>

He said, two books. She asked if he was agreeable to have the room; he said he was, and would bring his girl there by and by to see if she liked it; he said I will leave you these books till I come back again, and he never came back again.

It had a couple of tickets to it; the prisoner plucked the tickets off, and put the ring on her marriage finger; she asked the price; I said six shillings and six-pence; she bid me four shillings and six-pence, then five shillings; I would not take that; she then returned me this metal ring in lieu of the gold one; I said that was not the ring I had given her; she swore it was; I insisted upon her returning the ring; she said that she was married at St. Martin's Church with that ring.

               <p>Were the rings alike? - Very much alike; you would, not know the difference apart, but I knew the difference being a judge of the weight of gold; and besides I saw this ring concealed in her left-hand.

               <p>Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he at any time, and when apply to you for any money? - Upon the first of this month he brought me this order, together with several others, for the payment of money as a reward for apprehending of vagrants.</p>
               <p>Has that order been in your custody ever since? - I delivered it to the clerk of indictments for the purpose of drawing the indictments, but I put my initials at the back of the seal.</p>
               <p>When he delivered it, had you any suspicion that it was not a genuine order? - None. I paid him ten shillings.</p>
               <p>What are the names of the persons in that warrant? - Joseph and 
               <persName id="t17781021-37-person343">

            .</p>
               <p>I observe that they are two vagrants, yet are treated as one throughout the warrant? - The magistrates vary in their warrants, sometimes there are four in a warrant, forty shillings; sometimes ten shillings a vagrant.</p>
               <p>I see it is for apprehending a vagabond? - It is very incorrect.</p>
               <p>That incorrectness did not lead you to suspect it? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you to suspect afterwards that it was not a true order? - In passing my accounts as treasurer, the magistrates have frequently remarked upon the many sums ordered by this gentleman; I had it mentioned to Mr. Miller by an acquaintance of his that it was thought much of; and that it was thought he had acted very imprudent. He wrote me a letter that he had not signed such an order for two years. I went to Mr. Miller's, and showed him the order and he denied it.</p>
               <p>You are positive to the person of the prisoner? - Yes; very positive, because he has been repeatedly with me upon the same occasions.</p>
               <p>You take no receipts do you? - Yes, ready wrote to every one.</p>

            . My sister winds silk; I live with her; she sent me to a silk-man in Wood-street, in order to bring some silk for her to weave ribbands with; this was on a Saturday about a month ago. I was to bring them from Wood-street to my sister's house, which is in Cock-lane, Shoreditch; this happened about eleven o'clock in the forenoon. I was bringing it, and walking by myself along Aldersgate-street, which is my way from Wood-street to Cock-lane, Shoreditch; the two prisoners and another woman followed me there; they began to talk to me, by asking how my sister and my mammy did.

I agreed to go with them; they took me across the fields. When they were in the fields they asked me for my bundle; I told them I had rather carry it myself; they said I was not able to carry it; that I could not, and should not carry it. It was about fifteen ounces of silk wound upon bobbins; upon my refusing to give it to them they took it away by force and ran away; I was left alone; I did not know my way home; I fell a crying; a gentleman came up and asked me what was the matter; I told him some women had taken away my things and left me there; I told him where I belonged to, he carried me home to my sister's house. I saw the prisoners afterwards in Charterhouse-street, near Charterhouse-square; I was along with my sister; the moment I saw them I knew them again; I said then that I was positive these two were the two women, and I challenged them, and I am very positive the two prisoners were the persons that robbed me in the fields. It was white silk wound upon bobbins, and a long end row with all sorts of colours upon it.</p>

             when we met the two prisoners; my sister said those were the two women that robbed her; she was as positive at that time as she is at present; upon that they were taken hold of. The cloak that was lost was my own property. I sent her the morning she was robbed, by Mr. Cluen's direction, to fetch this silk, and to bring home this cloak.</p>

Knowing if I went into the river I should be drowned, I asked him where he would have me go to; he said draw along the lighter, which I did; and he bid us all get out of the boat; before we could get out he fired the blunderbuss; it was charged; I had seen the captain charge it, and a brace of pistols; it was in the stern of the boat. If a man, who was in the boat, had not that instant tossed the mouth of it up I believe it would have shot me, and all that were in the boat.

I was so much in liquor, I thought I was at home; I began calling for my wife; but not finding her I got up; when I came to look about me, I missed my watch, my silver buckles out of my shoes, and two silk handkerchiefs, one of which I had in my pocket, the other about my neck. I said I would not go out of the room till I had my things; Chivers still kept bullying me, and sent for the watchman to turn me out. Chivers and I charged one another with the watch; we were taken to the watch-house; the watchman discharged us both upon our promising to come back the next morning. The next morning Chivers delivered the watch to the watchman; he said he had found it; the buckles were pawned with Mrs. Smith for 6 s.</p>

I came home about ten in the evening, and found in the lower room the prosecutor, Clarke, in bed. I asked him what business he had there. I had been drinking rather free, and there might be some rough words pass between us. Clarke said he had been robbed; hearing that, I went to see after my wife, who was at the Blue Anchor, and was sitting up for me. I told her what Clarke said; she came back with the child at her breast; the prosecutor immediately said that my wife was the woman that had robbed him. I knew the prisoner very well, but did not suspect her at that time; and finding Clarke resolved to stay there, I went to call the watch, in order to clear the house of him. Spencer then came, and we both went to the watch-house. At about eleven o'clock the next day the prisoner came home to my lower room; I went to her directly; I said, what have you been doing here? you have let a man in to the room, and have brought a scandal upon the house, and the man says you have robbed him; she denied it; she said a man had been with her that had given her the buckles to pawn for six shillings, in order to be concerned with her; and had spent the evening with her; but denied that she knew any thing of the watch: the bed was let down, and the watch was found between the quilt and the blankets. Immediately after this I went and told Clarke that I had found his watch; he said he would make me find the buckles too: we went before Justice Sherwood, and there, notwithstanding the prisoner was there, he charged my wife with being the person that robbed him. I was much surprised at that; I bid him look round the room and see if there was nobody he knew; he said, no; at last I brought the prisoner to him, and asked him if he was not acquainted with her; he then said she was the person.</p>

On Monday last was three weeks I went out in the morning, towards Hackney, with my two boxes, and returned about seven in the evening. I went through Petticoat-lane in order to get to my own house; Moses, I observed, dogged me to Ebenezer-square, where I live; I did not take much notice of him at that time. I went home and eat my supper; afterwards I took my boxes up stairs, and then went to a publick house, the Gentleman and Porter. At about eight o'clock my wife went out, during my absence, so that I cannot say exactly what was the situation of the house when it was left empty. My wife and I met together, and returned about ten in the evening, which was about two hours after I left her; the door was locked in the same manner as when we go out. When I came up stairs I found one of the windows of the chamber, with the shutter broken, the bar broken, and the sash thrown up; it is a very suspicious window, for it is near a wall, to which any person could get, and might have thrown up the sash, and therefore it is the custom of my house never to open that window, for fear somebody should get in at it. When I came up stairs I missed the two boxes of things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) the box had certainly been opened in the room, for there were two watch chains found upon the wall; the box must have been broke open, for I locked them up when I left them.</p>

               <p>I live in Houndsditch, about ten or twelve houses from Ebenezer-square. On Monday was three weeks, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I saw, near Woolpack-alley, three fellows, one of whom had a box upon his head; that man is the prisoner Moses. Isaacs, the other prisoner, had a box under his arm; there was another man, who appeared to be an Englishman. I looked at them; one had a cutlass, the other had a club-stick in his hand; one said to the other d - n your eyes, why don't you bear a hand along? the other made answer, I cannot come faster it is so heavy. I was going to follow them to see where they were going to. I followed them a little way; Moses turned round and saw me; he said, d - n your eyes! if you follow me any farther I will cut your head in halves; upon which I desisted and went home.</p>

They both as near as I can recollect made the same answer; at the same time I minuted it upon the back of the draft of the receipt I kept; I wrote that immediately in their presence, and underneath I wrote

               <p>Who lives there? - Mr. Hardy, I believe, kept the house. When the three notes became due, I heard accidentally that the prisoner lived in Dean-street, Soho; I went there three or four different times to seek for him; I met him one evening at the door, that was I believe in the month of February 1777; he asked me to go into the house with him, I did, it was a publick house, the Green-Man, I think, in Dean-street,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177810210035"/> Soho. A good deal of conversation passed between us respecting these notes; I told him he had imposed a person upon Mr. Wilson who was not his brother; he for some time alledged that it was his brother who lived in Drury-lane who had signed the notes with him; I told him I was convinced it was not him, because I had presented a note to him, and he totally denied the fact; and that Mr. Wilson had likewise seen him, who said that was not the person that came and signed the notes; after some further discourse he told me that it was not his brother who lived in Drury-lane that had signed the notes.</p>
               <p>Were those the words that he said, that it was not his brother who lived in Drury-lane that had signed the notes? - I believe those are exactly the words; I asked him then who it was that he had brought that had signed the notes with him, and I said if I had been in the office he could not have imposed another person upon Mr. Wilson, for I should have known his brother; he said he knew that very well, and therefore he had watched the opportunity to see me out of the office. I asked him who the person was, and where he lived; he said he did not know who he was, for he had given him five shillings to come and sign the notes; and that he was then dead or gone to sea, and he could not tell where he was. We had some further discourse upon the impropriety of his conduct; I said he had behaved exceeding ill to Mr. Wilson, who had indulged him so far; he still persisted that he would not pay the money; I came away and he was arrested next morning.</p>

               <p>You could just make out his name; it was not a plain hand? - No. Not a plain hand; he would join his letters together sometimes, and sometimes write quite wide.</p>

               <p>After that, was this note never brought to you and payment demanded of you? - As soon as my brother was arrested Patrick went off from me, and I did not know what was become of him till he died here in the Old Bailey; they asked for my brother Patrick; he was gone as soon as Daniel was arrested.</p>

               <p>I wish you would apply yourself to the conduct of the defendant in procuring that warrant? - Being discharged, I think it was towards the middle of June, 1774, I was informed that there was a warrant, charging me with concealing my effects.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the crown to the counsel for the defendant. That warrant we have given you notice to produce; it was made special to Blackburn, one of the defendants; you have the custody of it; if you will not produce it, we must give parol evidence of it.</p>

               <p>The commission I admit, for it will be proved that it was found to be a fraudulent one, upon an issue directed to be tried in the court of King's Bench; but though it was so, the whole of the counsel for the defendants examination is to show the fraud of this commission; the charge against the present defendants, is, that they, from an over anxiety to punish the prosecutor, made use of very improper and wicked measures for that purpose, by procuring the affidavit of two men of the name of Hargrave and O'Neal, (we shall show the sort of men they are presently) they procured these men to make this charge against the prosecutor; and whatever other charge might be true against him, this was a false charge; and it subjected him to be punished as a felon; therefore the examination respecting the fraud of the bankruptcy may be spared.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the defendants. Then you admit him to be a dishonest man.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prosecutor. An honest man or a dishonest man may be charged unjustly.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the defendants. As three or four years are now elapsed, did your assignee recover this four hundred pounds of Hallinger?</p>
               <p>Rigals. I cannot take upon me to say they have.</p>
               <p>I believe you can take upon you to say they have not? - How can I say that.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Try? - Suppose I say no.</p>
               <p>Have they or have they not? - I believe no.</p>
               <p>Are not you sure no? - There is no certainty of any thing; how can I take upon me to say whether they have or have not; how can I take upon me to say whether they have wrote letters or sent any person, they may have done it and I not know it.</p>
               <p>Do you not know upon your oath that there is not a farthing recovered of him?</p>
               <p>Give an answer, is there any thing recovered by your assignees from Hallinger? - I do not believe that there is.</p>
               <p>What was the amount of the debts that you gave in as owing at the time of your commission; have you got the total amount? - I cannot take upon me to say that I have.</p>
               <p>Do you remember to make up the deficiency of those debts, how many notes and bills you gave in as owing to your estate? - I gave in 245 notes, I told the commissioners that three parts of the notes had been paid to persons who had not enquired after them; other notes were due; Mr. Bargrave, one of the commissioners cast them up, and said there was about 1000 l. that might be recovered.</p>
               <p>How many bills of exchange? - I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>I believe twenty three? - I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>You gave all these in, did you not, as being due to your estates? - Not as being due to my estate, I gave them in as in my possession.</p>
               <p>Not as due to your estate? - Not all.</p>
               <p>Which of them? - I cannot tell, if I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177810210042"/> had had the accounts I could have stated which was due, and which not due.</p>
               <p>Have any of these 245 notes and 23 bills been recovered? - Bills! I don't understand what you mean by that; they might be bills that I have been paid, they might be bills that I have paid. I have paid Mr. Wilson 600 l. a year. I gave them as being in my possession under the commission.</p>
               <p>How many of the 245 notes that you gave in were recovered; or were any way recovered? - That I cannot take upon me to say, I have recovered none.</p>
               <p>Don't you know that none of them have been recovered? - I have heard so.</p>
               <p>Why don't you know so? - I don't.</p>
               <p>Of the debts that you owe, I think there is a note that you gave to one of these men that you now think proper to indict,

            , one of your notes was given in, as owing from you forty pound to the defendant Stack? - Given into where?</p>
               <p>To the commissioners? - Yes. He had a forty pound note of me; he swindled me out of it.</p>
               <p>You was the swindlee there then instead of the swindler. Was Stack one that signed your certificate? - I don't know that he was; I cannot take upon me to say. (The certificate was referred to, his name was not to it.)</p>
               <p>There was another note, I believe, to O'Neal, another of the defendants? - I cannot say positively.</p>
               <p>Did not you give a note to O'Neal? - I cannot say whether I did or not.</p>
               <p>Because you dropped before that you might have seen him.</p>
               <p>"Did you know, O'Neal, said</p>
               <p>"the learned Counsel? Why, yes, I might</p>
               <p>"have seen him before.</p>
               <p>"Now, upon your oath, whether you gave O'Neal a note and for what money? - It is more than probable that I did.</p>
               <p>Yes; because it is certain. Now did you or not give him a note? - Yes; I think I did.</p>
               <p>How came you to give O'Neal a note when you doubted almost whether you had ever seen him before; you had no dealing with him of any sort you say? - No; he applied to me, and had a note of me, and told me he could get it discounted for me.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the Commissioners this? - Yes, I think, I did. I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Yes, you are sure you did not? - I cannot take upon me to say nay. Can you recollect what passed five years ago?</p>
               <p>Counsel. Yes; I could in so material a matter as that.</p>
               <p>Court. Answer the questions; if you don't know; say you don't know.</p>
               <p>Counsel. I ask, upon your oath, did you tell the Commissioners that he had taken it of you in order to get it discounted, or did you not give it in as one of the debts owing from you? - Not as one of the debts to the best of my knowledge, but I cannot take upon me to say.</p>
               <p>I asked you about Stack's note. Did you give Stack a note? - He had a note of me.</p>
               <p>For how much money? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did you swear that was due, because you said you knew nothing at all of Stack? - Yes; I think I made oath that he had a note of me.</p>
               <p>A note from you to him which was a charge upon your estate; do you know now that you swore that that was due to him? - I don't know that I did.</p>
               <p>Will you say you did not? - I might, probably, as he had a note of me; it was my debt to him, and I was accountable for it and liable to be arrested.</p>
               <p>Then whether this money was owing to Stack or not you don't know; or that you swore it before the Commissioners? - He was to get me money for the note, or something of that sort.</p>
               <p>So that was a swindling thing of you by Stack? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had no goods at all of him, but gave him this note to negociate? - I think I had some part in goods that he had; he had got money for the note.</p>
               <p>You say he got the money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then how came you to swear that you owed him the money? - The note was due, therefore it was a debt from me.</p>
               <p>Did you give it in as a debt due from you to him? - I very likely might.</p>

             was so obliging as to sign your certificate as a creditor for money lent for 86 l. 4 s. 8 d. do you know that or not? - I don't know that he has signed it.</p>
               <p>You don't know that he has signed it? - No.</p>
               <p>You never was at any meeting where he promised to sign it? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know that he proved a debt of 86 l. 4 s. 8 d.? - I do not know that he did.</p>
               <p>Be so good as to give us a little history of this time. I believe you was arrested at the suit of one or other of these gentlemen or creditors, either Wilson or Slater in August 1774? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe you applied to be discharged under the Act of Parliament as a fair bankrupt, claiming the same privileges that an insolvent debtor would have; did you or did you not apply to be discharged? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you make that application to the late Mr. Justice Aston? - Mr. Tew the attorney did for me.</p>
               <p>I believe that was ineffectual, you was refused to be discharged? - Certainly, or else I should not have been four years confined.</p>
               <p>Did you make a second application to the same judge? - Not that I know of; I cannot take upon me to say what the attorney did. I was not discharged.</p>
               <p>Did you not know that a second application was made to the same judge, Mr. Justice Aston? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Do you know of a third application made to Lord Mansfield? - I have been informed that it was moved in the Court of King's Bench.</p>
               <p>No; we will come to that by and by; was there not an application made to my Lord Mansfield as a judge at his chambers? - No.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. Tew has been obliging enough to do this for you unknown to you? - Only the first I know of.</p>
               <p>Do you know of the application to the Court of King's Bench? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You made a very long affidavit yourself, in order to obtain a rule for them to show cause why you should not be discharged? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether you then swore that all these were true debts; that they were fair creditors; and the debts justly due to them? - I do not think I did.</p>
               <p>You did not mean to swear so? - I do not think I did swear so.</p>
               <p>Would you have sworn so? - No, I should not; I think not; if I had read the affidavit.</p>
               <p>Then, if you have made any such affidavit that has slipped your memory, now what became of this application to the court of King's-Bench. - They granted a rule;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177810210045"/> something, I do not know what they term it.</p>
               <p>I will tell you. They granted an issue to be tried upon this simple question, whether your commission was a fraudulent one; yea or no; and it was found fraudulent, was it not? - Yes; I think so.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that? - Yes; I am certain of that.</p>
               <p>So am I, for I happened to be at the trial; then that commission was found to be fraudulent; now upon its being found to be fraudulent, I ask you whether so late as March 1777, you did not apply to the late Lord Chancellor to have this commission superseded as fraudulent? - I applied to Judge Ashhurst in 1776 to be discharged; he told the Clerk that he had seen a record of a verdict; that the commission was fraudulent, and that I could not be discharged as a bankrupt, but must be discharged as an insolvent. I waited till the insolvent act took me up to St. Margaret's-Hill; I was remanded then as a bankrupt; I could not be discharged as an insolvent.</p>
               <p>In March 1777 did not you petition to have this commission superseded, because it was fraudulent? - If I had not endeavoured to supersede the commission, I should have been confined for life.</p>
               <p>And was not that the reason why you applied to have this commission superseded, being fraudulent? - Yes; because it was fraudulent; that was the intent of my Lord Chancellor, by giving me the supersedeas.</p>
               <p>Was it not that because this commission was fraudulent, therefore your discharge was so long withheld from you; that, if you had done all fairly, you would have been entitled to be discharged between the summer of 1774, and the summer of 1777? - I could not blame the judge for not discharging me when those people went and swore that they could prove I had concealed many thousand pounds.</p>
               <p>There is no doubt now I hope that it was fraudulent? - There cannot be a doubt because there is a verdict.</p>
               <p>You was taken from the Poultry Compter before my lord mayor; I ask you whether you did not, while you was in the Compter, tear some papers, and fling them either out at the window or upon the floor? - I tore I believe two or three letters, or a letter that I had in my pocket; I cannot take upon me to say, or some memorandums, or something.</p>
               <p>It is that very something that makes the whole difference; be so good as to say whether Mr. Aiken's name was contained in that something that was tore? - I cannot say it was.</p>
               <p>Do you say it was not? - No; the whole was not bigger than that piece of paper, (about inches six square.)</p>
               <p>Was or not Aiken's name in any paper that you tore in the Compter? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>You knew nothing of him? - I gave him a bond for seven hundred pounds; his name might be on a paper.</p>
               <p>Why was it to be torn when you was taken into custody? - I have a right to tear what is in my possession.</p>
               <p>And I will answer for it you had a reason for tearing it? - I cannot take upon me to say that I had no particular reason.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that you had no reason for tearing this paper that had Aiken's name in it? - I do take upon me to say so, as far as I can learn, for I do not know that his name was there.</p>
               <p>Why did not you keep the paper in your pocket? - Because I saw that I was beset.</p>
               <p>Counsel. And so you was afraid of some innocent thing, set down upon that paper, popping out of your pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. What reason had you for destroying that paper? - I had been making some minutes of how I had been treated.</p>
               <p>Counsel. But this paper would help to defend not convict you; did not you think that there was something in them that would bite; you tore them all? - I tore them all! if you had seen the paper you would not have thought much about it.</p>
               <p>I have seen it, and therefore I do think much about it. - What I had been writing was nothing more than the minutes, and I do not know that Aiken's name was concerned about it; it was memorandums of what had passed before I came to the Compter.</p>
               <p>That was your hand writing then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177810210046"/>Court. Then will you swear whether Aiken's name was upon it, you must know that. - No.</p>
               <p>Court. This is a most shameful answer.</p>
               <p>Do the counsel for this prosecution wish to carry this cause on any further?</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prosecution. I have no wish to press the prosecution any further, now I see the nature of it from this man's evidence I am satisfied about it.</p>
               <p>Court. The man can have no credit; it is at least prevarication, and such as will take all kind of credit from him.</p>
