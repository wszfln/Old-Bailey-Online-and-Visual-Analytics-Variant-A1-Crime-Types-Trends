                  </hi>. I am meat carrier in the Metropolitan Meat Market—I knew Butcher when he kept a butcher's shop at Loughborough Junction—he now lives in a private house in the Milkwood Road—on Saturday, March 27th, about 10.30 a.m., he asked me if I would take a top piece and rump to his house at Loughborough from Messrs. Firmin and Woods—that is the name by which Messrs. Jiggens are known—I said, "Certainly, there is a cart going to them"—he said it would be ready in about two hours, and he went away—this conversa<lb/>tion was at our usual stand in the market, about twenty yards from Messrs. Jiggens's premises.</p>

Jiggens"—he said,"I know nothing about the beef"—before I had finished the first sentence he said, "I know nothing about any beef"—I said, "Can you explain it to me? but before you "answer I will tell you that what you say I am going to put down in writing, and it may be used as evidence against you"—at that moment I took out my pocket-book, and I said,"It is said that you went to a man of Cornell a carrier of meat in the market, at ten o'clock in the morning, and requested him to fetch from Messers.

Before you speak, I must tell you I shall put down what you say, and it may be given in evidence against you"—I took paper and pen, and com<lb/>menced to write—he said, "I know nothing about going to Wastall's, the carrier, on Saturday, March 27th. I am sure I did not go to Wastall's. I have not spoken to him, or to his brother, for months; neither have I given Wastall any instructions to get any meat from Jiggens's for many months. I am sure I did not speak to Wastall on March 27th. I know a man named Butcher, who lives in the Milkwood Road. I did not go in the Market Hotel the day you speak of with Butcher, or with any porter.

Nunn" is the prisoner's—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a statement sent by the firm to Croft while the prisoner was in our employment—this is the order the prisoner handed to us: "One watch, 7s. 6d."—this is the statement we sent him—this (<hi rend="italic">Another</hi>) is his writing.

On April 3rd, about three, I was at the station—I saw the prisoner there—she spoke to me, and said, "Is my little boy dead? that is all I wish to know"—I made no answer, for I knew nothing about it at the time—I went to the shop in High Street, and in the bedroom I saw spots of blood on the floor, and in the passage—this knife was handed to me; I saw marks of blood upon it—I then went back to the station, and the prisoner was charged—she then said, "Is my boy dead?I want to know at once"—she was told that he was not dead, and she said, "I am very sorry"—the charge was read over to her, and she said, "Quite true."</p>

I saw the prisoner on her reception at the prison on April 3rd—she appeared to be in a state of suppressed nervous excitement, and I was informed that soon after her arrival she had attempted to strangle herself with a handkerchief—I had no conversation with her then—subsequently I had, on several occasions—she was extremely depressed for some weeks; although her mental condition has improved, she still remained very depressed—I had a conversation with her yesterday morning—she spoke to me freely about the child—she has the idea that a conspiracy exists on the part of her husband's relations for the purpose of separating her from the child—I believe her husband is dead, but she is still unaware whether he is alive or dead—she thinks that the conspiracy is on the part of the Catholics, and that there was no alternative before her except to kill the child and then kill herself, in order that they should not be separated—she said she was sorry she had not succeeded in killing it—on the last occasion, about two or three weeks ago, I questioned her upon that point—I reported the case to the Treasury—she has become more cheerful, and sleeps and eats better, but her mental condition is the same—at times she is morose, and suspicious of everybody—when she was first brought in I formed the opinion that she was insane—she is about forty-seven years old—she stated that she was passing through a change of life; that would have a very important bearing on her mental condition.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189705030017"/>
               <p>took another base—I went there every day, first in the morning, but afterwards at night, as it was more convenient, and took various things which I got from the store—I took three of these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and he gave me 1s. 6d. each for them; the list value is 5s. or 6s.—I knew that that was not half the value—I grumbled at the price; he said that he could get the same articles at a less price—I took him about ten five-ampère switches, and got 9d. for them—I took him eight or nine dozen five-ampère switches, a dozen in a box, wrapped round with paper as they are now, and got 5s. a dozen for them—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a secret switch, it has not got a knob; here is the key—there were about two and a-half dozen secret switches not included in the others—this is a ten-ampère <hi rend="italic">cut out;</hi> there might have been half a dozen of those, not more—I can hardly recollect the price, because they were with other things—I took a wall plug and two or three other things, and he gave me 3s. for the lot, and there were some special switches from size five upwards, and I got 3s. for the lot, and for some incandescent lamps as well, of different sizes, similar to these—he gave me 2s., I think, for two or three of these—I sold him three coils of flexible wire of 110 yards' each, one wrapped up and the others not—this is what they call 7-20 cable, which means seven wires of twenty guage—they were complete coils; I think I, got 6s. a coil for them—they are new coils unwrapped, and done up with sacking—I sold him some of this cable (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in bad condition, so far as the covering was concerned—it was all in one piece, and heavy; I had a man with a barrow to help me—I got 10s. for it, and Is, for the man—the net value of the property I took to him was £40 or £45 to the trade, and the list value about £67—I got about £6 10s. for it—he quoted the General Electric Company's Hit prices—he never asked me for a receipt for the money he paid me, nor did I give him one—he did not ask who I was, or my name and address—he afterwards showed me a store and the attic, and the cellar—there were two rooms; you get access to them by a door—I thought there was a lock to the room upstairs, but I won't swear it—he kept photographic apparatus and printing frames in the cellar—I did not see much electrical stock—I also sold the box to a stall-keeper in the Caledonian Road.</p>

               <p>the same size and pattern, at 8s. a dozen; he gave me this receipt—on March 27th I bought three dozen more at the same price, and six ten-ampère switches at 1s. 4d. each, and six more at the same price, and got this receipt. (<hi rend="italic">This was headed, "G.

I am a baker, of 30, Hazlemere Road, Acton Green—on April 1st, a little after eleven, I was walking in Church Road towards my home—the prisoner Kelly, as he was passing me, asked me for the price of a drink, I refused; he began telling me that he was very hard up, at the same time I felt that he was snatching at my chain; I was looking him in the face at the time; I caught hold of him by the neck<lb/>erchief, and he went back into the road—while I held him he passed something behind him to the other prisoner, Taft—from what I could see they were coming along together—Kelly came up on the same side I was going—when I noticed Taft he was standing behind me, or rather behind Kelly—I found that my watch was gone; I valued it at 30s.—I have not seen them since—I did not pull off Kelly's scarf; he took it off while I was holding him—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the scarf—the prisoners ran away in the same direction; I did not follow them—Kelly had on a dark coat, and a lightish pair of trousers—I went to the Police-station directly and gave information—on the Friday following I went to the Police-station and saw Kelly; I picked him at once out of seven or eight men, and on Friday night I picked out Taft from seven or eight others at Notting Dale Station.</p>

               <p>and four more on Thursday—on Friday, the 26th, in the afternoon, nine more telegrams came from the two men, and on that afternoon two tele<lb/>grams relating to a horse named Ellison; the prisoner opened that, but they were all on the desk—I looked at them; they related to a race which was to be run at two o'clock—I saw the hour on them, 2.18, and pointed it out to Norton, and said that it could not be—he said, "No, certainly not," and a short time afterwards he stepped out of the office to buy a paper, or something of that kind—I remember Brown coming to the office; he wanted fifteen on Julian Fellows; I looked at the clock—he said to Brown, "It is past the time"—the prisoner said, "What shall we do? the clock is a quarter of an hour fast," and that I could trust Brown, he would be all right—Brown produced £10—I afterwards heard that Julian Fellows had started at 100 to 7, and told the prisoner to-draw out a cheque, but said that I would not pay till I got the official return—next morning Brown came to the office, and said he would take the cheque with him and get it cashed; he took it away, and I did not see it again till it was returned to me by the bank—on the Saturday after-noon a telegram arrived which had no horse's name and no sender's name—I read it; my suspicion was somewhat excited, and I spoke to the prisoner about it—this is a cheque for £19 4s.; that was the winnings—I discovered the next morning that the clock was a quarter of an hour slow—I had determined to go to Sandown Park Races on the Saturday morning, and announced that co the prisoner in the morning; Mr. Brown and Mr. Phillips, who were to go with me were there—Lawrence had been there that morning—I was at Sandown when the four races were run at 2, 2.30, 3, and 3.40—Warrington ran the first raw—this book shows the terms on which we deal with our customers—I came back to London, and went to the office, and saw the prisoner, who produced to me twenty-four delivered telegrams—there were five each way in the names of Pennant and Cath-cart, a horse being named—neither Demgen or Battenden, or two others named, had run or been placed that afternoon—I had no knowledge of sending off' those telegrams—when I found I had had a bad day I told Norton to write to Pennant and Cathcart to come on Monday—he said he would do it, and left the office, and came back on Monday morning; I asked him if he had had any answer from Cathcart and Pennant—he said, "No"—I said, "It is very funny"—he said, "It is funny"—on the Tuesday I went to Jermyn Street by myself, and found that No. 131 was a letter-receiving company, and not a lodging-house—I asked Mr. Wyckham, the secretary, whether any letters had arrived on the Monday or Tuesday, and was told, "No"—I went back to the office, and said to Norton, "Did you write those letters? they have never arrived"—he said, "I wrote them"—we went together to 131, Jermyn Street, and saw Mr. Wyckham who said that no letters had been received; Norton said that he had written them himself, and posted them—I was angry with him, and left him at some place of refreshment—I went back to the office, and did not see him again that day—on that evening I took every book I could find away, to have them examined—I have not found the book which showed the amount of "cover" deposited by my customers—it was the prisoner's duty to enter in this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) all transac<lb/>tions, whether by letter or telegram; I cannot find in it any entry of this transaction on Saturday, February 27th—on Saturday, March 6th,</p>

He called himself Radcliffe—he explained his system, and I said, "Is there any risk?"—he said, "None whatever"—I said, "Mr. Herbert Smith, a bookmaker, has published a book on the subject, and he considers this First and Second Favourite System as risky as any other"—he said, "I know nothing about him; that may he his system, it is not mine, and I assure you there is no risk what<lb/>ever"—he proceeded to prove why he could give me that assurance—he said: "I was left by my mother and father as a young man with a lot of money, and, not knowing what to do with it, I went in for racing pro<lb/>miscuously, and lost £20,000—I then invented the system, and by means of it I not only retrieved my loss, but made a good bit Asides"—I believed his statements, and that he was carrying on a <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi>, business—in that belief I paid him the cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for £25 of April 10th, 1895, payable to "G. Radcliffe or bearer"—it is unnecessarily endorsed, "G. Radcliffe"—I received the receipt of April 15th from 217, Piccadilly, for this one fourth share—on April 20th I received profits £2; on 23rd, £2 3s,; on May 1st, £3 19s.; 14th, £1 10s.; 21st, £3 15s.; and on 28th, £1 16s., by cheques on the Cheque Bank—encouraged by that, on May 22nd, 1895, I invested £100 by cheque of that date; also, on June 10th, £400; and on August 10th £100—after May 22nd I received two cheques of £3 profits—with regard to the £400, I first sent four bankers' deposit receipts of £100 each—Radcliffe answered that he could not negotiate them, and I wrote him to return them—I mentioned that Mr. George Burton's system afforded a higher rate of profit, and I received Radcliffe's letter of June 8th. (<hi rend="italic">This expresses surprise, and said that if he invested he would inevitably lose his money, as he did with Ingram, and offering to reduce the commission to five percent., so that the witness's profits would be double.</hi>) I had invested I £25 with Ingram, and lost it—the day following the receipt of that letter Mr. Radcliffe's manager called on me; the same person who was at the bank when the £400 was paid at the bank—he confirmed Radcliffe's letter—in consequence of statements made in that letter I went to Messrs. King's bank and exchanged the deposit receipts for a draft of £400, which was handed to Radcliffe—I subsequently received Cheque Bank cheques for profits amounting to £9 8s. and £20 and £5, having I invested £525—I received this letter of July 2nd. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that there had been a disastrous time at Windsor, etc., enclosing week's balance-sheet, showing week's result as</hi> £206 <hi rend="italic">outstanding, and asking for further advances for recovering losses.</hi>) I replied on July 30th, I stating I would advance another £100 only on his guarantee—he replied on August 1st, that was unfair to him, and asking whether Mrs. Taylor would join in advancing money for recovery of the losses—I had intro<lb/>duced Mrs. Taylor—I received his letter of August 3rd. (<hi rend="italic">This agreed to guarantee the witness against the loss of</hi> £100, <hi rend="italic">and regretting that Mrs. Taylor would only pay</hi> £50.)

               <p>next received this letter of August 23rd. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that Radcliffe had recovered</hi> £20 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> £5.) I had asked him for a reference, but only made use of it before introducing Mrs. Taylor—I was referred to Keith Macdonald, of Hove—I received this letter of September 4tb. (<hi rend="italic">Enclosing the weeks balance-sheet, and stating that Radcliffe had recovered</hi> £131 18s.) Also one of November 27th. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that the amount received was</hi> £187 13s. 6d., <hi rend="italic">and he would attend to the recovery as quickly as possible, but that it would facilitate matters very much if he let him have a little more to work with.</hi>) To that I wrote that he had a balance of nearly £300, and that was quite enough—about December 2nd I wrote, demanding that he should pay over what he had recovered—I got Radcliffe's letter of December 4th. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that the witness? request was contrary to the arrangement made, which was that Radcliffe was to retain the moneys till the whole capital was recovered.</hi>) I replied, demanding a return of the money first, and then said, "I will cry off the rest if you will let me have £100 and the £187 recovered," when I got a reply, showing a further loss of £179 on the week—on December 18th I received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he (Radcliffe) had been ill, that the profit and loss accounts sent had nothing to do with the capital recovered, as to which the witness had stated he did not care if the process took twelve months; that it was inconvenient to return money when he had been subject to a financial shock, but he hoped by the new year's operations to recover part of the money lost.</hi>) I wrote again, and received Radcliffe's reply of February 24th, 1896. (<hi rend="italic">Stating the jumping season was unfavourable, and he did not think it advisable to do anything before flat racing commenced.</hi>) He had said the jumping season was the best season, and that steeplechas<lb/>ing was the best business—on April 4th I received this letter from him, enclosing £5—it is in one writing (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 137)—this was represented to be part return of the capital—I wrote that it would take about twenty years to pay the amount off, including Mrs. Taylor's £100.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the City—I am independent—at the end of May, 1896, seeing an advertisement in the daily papers in reference to investments, I wrote to the address given and received a letter enclosing a printed pamphlet similar to those produced—I made an, appointment, and saw the prisoner Radcliffe at 217, Piccadilly, on June 1st, 1896—he told me he had invented a system called the First and Second Favourite System, and he was the manager, of a syndicate who were floating it; that he had worked it for five years without the slightest risk, and there was no risk whatever; that, by giving notice at the begin<lb/>ning of the week, I could have my capital back at the end of any week—I believed his statements, and what I read in the circular—I handed him this cheque for £10, and he gave me this receipt—I saw him write it. ("<hi rend="italic">For 10th of share in Syndicate, repayable when in hand.</hi>") I said, "What does 'repayable when in hand' mean?"—he explained that if I gave notice at the beginning of a week, he would have the capital in hand at the end—I am Swiss-Irish—I was born in Ireland—he said, "You must ask for it at the beginning of the week," and that I could give notice in the middle of the week—I received this letter of June 9th, enclosing cheque for 15s. as my profit, and the balance-sheet for June 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th—I wrote him for an explanation, and received this letter of June 10th. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that where the witness made a mistake was in the com<lb/>mission charged on the gross profits as the expenses were so large, but if he would increase his investments, he would charge half commission, in which case he would be getting over</hi> 1,000 <hi rend="italic">percent.</hi>) The postscript is: "In addition, as a new investor, you do not participate in the £13 left out in the profits of the week, and carried on into this. That applies only to investors of that sum"—I then decided to make a further invest<lb/>ment of £15, in consequence of having received two cheques for £1 and 7s. 6d. profits—I got a receipt for my £15, and a balance-sheet for the week beginning June 30th, which shows a win on the week—I was told that profits were so small, but that I would get within a week my share of a profit of £19 12s.; I never got it—on July 13th I received a balance-sheet for the next week, a cheque for £2, and a postal order for 5s.—I also got a letter enclosing cheques for £3 and 7s. 6d.—he asked me to make up my share for Goodwood—he sug<lb/>gested I should increase my share, as Goodwood would be such a good week—I declined to increase it—then I got this letter of July 24th. (<hi rend="italic">This stated;</hi> "I regret that you do not wish to make up your share for Goodwood, as I am afraid after this you will not be able to, as my capital is nearly all subscribed, and I shall not be able to take any more when it is all gone.") I next got this letter of July 27th, with this balance-sheet. (<hi rend="italic">The letter stated that Saturday had been a very bad day, and that the balance-sheet showed a loss on the week of</hi> £24 8s.)

               <p>£105 on each £100 share in consequence of a loss on the first favourites, and an "advance of capital to recover your portion of the same"—I then wrote him, suggesting that I should send an accountant to examine his books, and received this reply of August 10th. (<hi rend="italic">This stated</hi>: "The accounts you receive from week to week are exact replica of my books"; <hi rend="italic">that he could not expect to recover his capital without expense, and</hi> "If you do not care to accept my proposal you must put up with the fortune of war.")

I am an accountant at the Cheque Bank, 119 and 120, Bishopsgate Street—I produce cheques in the female prisoner's writing—she opened an account in the name of Grace Radcliffe, 217, Piccadilly, in 1894, which was continued till February last—I do not know the male prisoner—I only saw her in connection with the account—I produce a certified copy of the account—this is a copy of the regis<lb/>tration of the Cheque Bank Company—on June 10th, 1895, £410 was paid in—this banker's draft for £400 (Wheeler's) formed part of the £410—we credit the amount, but do not allow a withdrawal till the cheque is cleared—then a withdrawal of any sum not larger than the-cheque is perforated for—on June 12th £310 was withdrawn, including</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at 21, Rope Yard Rails, Woolwich—on April 20th I was in the lodging-house kitchen where I live—two days before, on Sunday, the 18th, the prisoner said to me that his mother in-law had told him that I had had connection with his wife before she was married; I denied it, and said I would face it with her—he said, "Can I speak to you a minute?"—I said, "Certainly, Jack"—he said, "Will you come up home? Nance and her mother will be there"—I said, "All right"; he opened the door into the kitchen, and his wife was there at the other end—he said to his wife, "Go upstairs"—she said she would not; I said to her, "Go upstairs, Nance, and we will hear the rights of this"—the prisoner turned suddenly round, got hold of the back of my neck, pulled me down, and drew something across my neck—I could not see what it was; it caught the bottom part of my ear, which was hanging down; I felt it against my check—I broke eway from him, got away, arid went out for a doctor, who attended to me, and as I came from the doctor I saw a constable, and told him what had taken place—I saw the prisoner half-way down the street; he came across, and said,'I done it,"and he was taken into custody—as he was going along he tried to get away from the police, and said, "Let me go, and I will finish him"—he was taken to the station.</p>

I am a surgeon, of Rectory Place, Woolwich—on this evening, about twenty minutes to eight, I was called to the station to examine the prosecutor—he had an incised contused wound three and a—half inches long, from left to right, across the neck; the lobe of the ear was hanging by a thin flap, and the muscles were exposed; that might'have occurred in the struggle, after the first blow—the wound behind the ear extended about a quarter of an inch below the angle of the jaw—the wounds might have been caused by one blow from a sharp instrument—all wounds may be dangerous, from hemorrhage—no important vessel was injured—he will be completely well in another week.</p>

I live with my mother at 66, Cranham Road, Berraondsey—I am employed as a machinist in the City—I became acquainted with the prisoner three years ago, and we became en<lb/>gaged about eighteen months ago—he used to visit at my mother's house, and I at his house—our engagement continued until February 14th last—I then broke it off, as he attempted to commit suicide—I saw him take a razor off the dresser, and I ran upstairs—we had had a quarrel that day—he ran upstairs with the razor—I asked him to come down again, which he did, and brought the razor with him—I broke the engagement off the next day—he then wanted me to be good friends with him again, and make it up—would not—he said I should be sorry in a week's time—I said he was not going to frighten me with his big talk, and he went away—I saw him again on a Sunday morning about a fortnight after; he came to see me, and wanted me to be friends with him, because he was going to sea—I would not be friends with him; I refused to make it up—he then wrote a letter to me—I read the letter, and sent it back to him; that was on the 25th—I had been with him all the afternoon; we were not on very friendly terms—I saw him the next evening, when he came to the house</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189705030056"/>
               <p>I told him I did not want anything more to do with him, and I wrote to his mother to say so—I did not see him again for three weeks; after that I saw him at South Bermondsey Station; he came to meet me there as I came home from business—my sister Emmy was with me—on Friday, the 27th, I was out with a young man; I did not see the prisoner then—on the following morning, the 29th, I left home at half-past nine with my sister to go to business, and I saw the prisoner in Cranham Road, where we live, about twenty houses from our house; I did not notice him till I was right close to him—he met me, and he said, "Ethel, won't you speak to me?"—I said, "I have not time to stop and speak to you this morning; I am late," and we passed on—the next thing was that I felt a shot in the back of my neck; the prisoner was then about three or four steps behind me—I staggered against the railings, and then felt another shot in the arm—I then ran across the road—I do not remember hearing any more reports—I had got a little way from the kerb when he put his hand up to his own temple; I did not see anything in his hand, but I heard him fire—I was carrying this umbrella at the time, and I afterwards found four holes in it—I was carrying it in my left hand by the handle—I was taken into the house of Mrs. King, a doctor came, and I was taken to Guy's Hospital, where I remained for nearly a month—a bullet was extracted from my arm there, but the one in the neck is there now; it has never been extracted—I have had letters from the prisoner; I know his handwriting; I believe these two letters are in his writing, in pencil.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first met the prisoner at a mission room on a Sunday evening, and shortly after I went out walking with him—I broke off the engagement soon after, twice, and the third time he came and asked me to make it up, he gave me two rings, and he had given other presents—I did not send him back the rings—he told me that he had made up his mind to go to sea, and asked me to shake hands before he went; I refused—the morning this happened, when he spoke to me, I did not mean to speak to him—I know a girl named Florrie; she was a friend of mine—she is now married—the prisoner said that she was the cause of our parting—there was no trouble about money between us—I do not remember very clearly what happened after the shooting—I think he was only three or four steps behind me at the time—I was holding my umbrella down at the time—I had no reason to think that he was not fond of me—I am twenty-two years of age, and he is twenty-one—when he told me that it was Florrie who parted us I told him that it was not her.</p>

               <p>I cannot speak because we are late for work," and we walked on—we got about three or four steps when he fired at my sister—I heard the reports, and just turned my head to see him on the pavement—he had a revolver in his hand, pointing it towards us—after the first report my sister began to run—I think she put her hand to her neck, and he fired at her again—I did not know where the shot hit her—when I looked round again he walked out into the road and put the revolver to his own temple and fired, and he fell down in the road—I think there were three shots altogether, but I am not sure—my sister was taken into the house of Mrs. King.</p>

I am the wife of a milkman, at 18, Cranham Road—I know nobody connected with the case—on the Monday morning in question I was in my own room—I looked through the window, and saw two girls and a man, his hand touching the back of her neck, and imme<lb/>diately after that I heard something like a bang, I think—I saw the elder sister stagger towards the railings—the man went against the kerb, and held a revolver in his right hand, and put it to his own temple, and while I was rushing out of the street-door I heard the revolver go off; but before that I heard it several times, I think four times altogether—I went out, and got hold of the elder girl by the wrist, and took her into my passage—at that time I heard another shot—after the fourth shot I saw him lying on the ground—I put the girl on a sofa, and went for a doctor, who came quickly—I heard four reports altogether; the first was when I looked out of the window, the second while I was running to the front door, the third was as I was holding her wrist, when the bullet went into her arm, and then I heard a fourth shot, and the man was lying about six or seven yards away from the girl at the time I heard the third shot—the prisoner is the man—he has grown a beard since then.</p>

I am shot in the arm"—I was holding her by, the wrist at that time—then I heard another shot, and saw him lying in the road.</p>

I answered that, and received this letter: "I am prepared to carry out loan on your completing the insurance. You need not mention that you are borrowing money, as in loan cases they are apt to charge extra premium"—I received an insurance proposal, filled it up, sent it to Mr. Wood, was examined by a doctor, and paid, £11 17s. premium—my age is forty-one—that covered the period till I was sixty-five—I wrote again to Mr. Wood, and got this reply: "Your letter to hand; in the case of 
death I should only claim balance due.—J.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Among others, we received a proposal from Mr. Hunt, on which £11 17s. 4d. was paid, and I paid Xing £4 14s. 11d.—the amount of commission I paid King was just under £100.</p>

                  </hi>. I am resident secretary of the Life De<lb/>partment of the Imperial Life Assurance Company, 22, Pall Mall—in December, 1895, King came and asked for a prospectus; he said he was contemplating giving his whole time to insurance business, and wished to select an office—I put the claims of my office before him; he left me, and returned in alxmt two hours, and said that he had selected my office; the terms we arranged were 30 percent, commuted commission; that is £1 10s. on a £1,000 policy—he mentioned the name of Wood; he said he had a friend who would pass his business through his hands, and that he was a great friend of his, and was doing it because he was hard up—on January 2nd I wrote him this letter, addressed "Cecil King, Esq.," in which the terms were embodied—he said he was not in a position to speak posi<lb/>tively as to the insurers, as they were introduced to him by Mr. Wood—he remained with us a little over a year until he was arrested; there were 196 proposals, 76 of which were completed, and I paid £175 4s. 6d. commission; they were nearly all small sums, mostly £100—a few were higher; one £1,500—the total assured was £23,325—he said Mr. Wood was a clever man, and knew how to protect himself—he handed me this letter, addressed to me by Wood from his employer—I considered that satisfactory, and returned the premium paid by a Mr. Tomlin—nearly one-third of these seventy-six policies were renewed.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant, L</hi>). On Sunday evening, April 4th, I went to Kennington Park Road, and saw Mrs. Duckett, and went up to the room which the prisoner had occupied—I found nothing par<lb/>ticular there—in the front kitchen I found a bundle of clothing tied up, and in the evening I received this blue skirt from the people at the mortuary—I took it to the house, and Mrs. Lester identified it as the prisoner's—I afterwards accompanied Inspector Hayter to 15, Gordon Street, Westminster, where he arrested the prisoner—I afterwards saw her at Kennington Lane Police-station—I said to her, "Have you the key of your trunk?"—she said, "Yes," and handed it to me—I then went again to 141, and unlocked a trunk which was pointed out to me by Mrs. Duckett as the prisoner's—on the top of other clothing I found this blue bodice, which Mrs. Lester identified as the property of the prisoner—I found no baby linen, or any preparation for a child.</p>

On Monday, April 5th, I went to 15, Gordon Street, and there saw the prisoner—she was dressed, and came downstairs—I said to her, "We are police officers; I believe you are Florence Clark, lately a servant at 141, Kennington Park Road"—she said, "Yes"—I said, "From information I have received, I shall arrest you on suspicion of killing your male child, of which, I believe, you have been recently confined, the body of which has been found in Prince's Square, Kennington"—she replied, "I don't know what you mean; it is not my child; I did not put it there"—I conveyed her in a cab to Ken<lb/>nington Station, where she was charged with the wilful murder of hep child, and depositing its dead body—she said, "You will find it belongs to someone else; I don't know what you are going to do with me."</p>
