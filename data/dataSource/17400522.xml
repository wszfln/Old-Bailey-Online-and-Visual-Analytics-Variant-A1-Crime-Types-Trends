               <p>Hen. Hales. Josias Brain called me up Stairs at that time, and told me his Wife suspected the Prisoner had taken a Spoon. I put one Hand down her Bosom, and the other Hand up her Petticoats, and took the Spoon from under her Petticoat- Strings, between her Skin and her Smock, and the Tightness of her Petticoat-Strings had bent it. This is the same Spoon I took from her, and which Brian own'd to be his. She deny'd the Fact, till I found it upon her; then she said she was sorry for it, and when she was before the Justice, she begg'd for Mercy.</p>

            . I am the Wife of the first Witness. The Prisoner on the 6th of May sent to desire me to come to her, and she would inform me that I might have a Child to nurse, of one Mr Foster in the Temple. But I had some Milk then boiling on the Fire, so I desired her to come to me for an Answer. She accordingly came, and while she was in the Room, I missed the Spoon from a little Stand at the End of the Chimney: I was sure I laid it there while the Milk was boiling, and therefore I taxed her with taking it. She denied it, and said she would make me suffer for challenging her upon such an Account, and told me I had only mislaid it: But I sent for my Husband, and the Prisoner was taken by him and Hales, into another Room, where (they told me) they searched her, and this is the Spoon which I missed, and which (they said) they found upon her. When I first charged her with taking it, she threatened me, and said, - whoever took it away would certainly have taken the rest, for there were two other little Spoons lay by it.</p>

               <p>Mr Tarrant. I was not present when the Goods were taken: I was invited out on the 22d of April to spend the Evening; and apprehending the Business of the Day was over, I went out about 8 o'Clock, and bid my Servant shut up the Shop: but I was immediately sent for, with a Message,. that my Servants had got two Shop-lifters; upon which I returned immediately, and they told me they had taken this Piece of Linnen from the Prisoners; it is my Property, and here is my Mark, and Number upon it: I am sure it was in the Shop when I went out, and I value it at 17s.</p>

            . I am Servant to Mr Tarrant, and know this Piece of Sleezy to belong to him, there's his Mark and mine upon it, and it is numbered. The two Prisoners came into the Shop on the 22d of April, under Pretence of buying some Printed Linnen; I shewed them several Pieces; they did not like any of them, but desired to see more. Accordingly I brought more forward, and at last Towers pitched upon one Piece, and gave me Six-pence earnest; telling me, she must go and fetch her Mother, and if her Mother liked it she would have it, but if she did not she must have her Money again in a Quarter of an Hour. Then they were both going off, but from their Actions I mistrusted they had got something which did not belong to them, so I called them back again and searched them; and this Piece of Cloth I took from under Bannister's Cloak, and I am sure it was in the Shop when they came in. I asked Bannister when I called her back, what she had got under her Cloak? Towers replied, - whatever she has got, it is none of yours. I desired to see it, and found it was ours, with our Marks on it. I shewed my Master (when he came home) the same Piece, which I had taken from under Bannister's Cloak.</p>
               <p>Bannister. I had been out that Day in the Morning, with a Hundred and Half of Herrings, and in the Afternoon I was out with Raddishes: After which, Towers came and asked me to go with her to buy a Bit of Linnen. I told her I was too dirty to go to a Shop; so she borrowed a Cloak for me, and while we were in this Shop, she gave me this Piece of Linnen to hold for her, and I thought she had paid for it. I had Opportunity enough to have gone off with it, if I had known she had not paid for it.</p>
               <p>Hind. The Piece of Linnen which I took from Bannister, was not the same she gave me earnest for. It was printed Linnen she pretended to buy. Both <rs id="t17400522-2-verdict11" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Richard Price. The Prisoner and her Husband worked Journey-work with me; they lodg'd in my House, and had a Room at 2s. per Week. My Wife gave the Prisoner the Things mentioned in the Indictment, for her Use; and she carried them away and pawned them, unknown to either her or me. When we asked her for them, she first said she knew nothing of them; afterwards she said the Things were full of Milk at her Nurse's. But when I bid her Husband get my Goods, he told me his Wife had pawned them. Upon this I called her down into my Parlour, and charged her with having pawned them, and she down'd on her Knees, and confessed she had pawn'd some of them at the Anchor, in White Cross-Street, and some in Barbican. This Confession she made last Sunday was a Fortnight, but, as she had Children, I was tender of prosecuting her; and she took hold of my Coat, and said she would die by my side, if I was resolved to prosecute her. Afterwards, when she found I did not prosecute her, she told me she would prosecute me, and came several times to my Door, and called out - Dicky Price, why don't you prosecute me? I was forced to come from the Tavern one Night, to get her away from my Door. The Goods are in Court, and here are the Pawnbrokers, to whom she had pawned them. I was present with my Wife when she lent the Goods to the Prisoner, and she has used them an Hundred and a Hundred Times in my Sight</p>

I went thither, and found four Books of the same Title; I believe they are mine, but I have no private Mark in them, so I cannot be positive to them. I am sure I had four such Books in my Shop when I went out; and when I returned, they were gone.</p>

            . I live at Mr Stone's, the Pawnbroker. On Saturday the 26th of April, the Prisoner brought me these four Books to be pawned, and I took them in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I do not disown that I pledged them.</p>
               <p>Balderstone. These are the Books the Prisoner brought to me.</p>
               <p>Rial. I believe they are mine, but I am not positive to them, because there is no private Mark in them.</p>
               <p>Balderstone. The Prisoner pawn'd them to me for 7 s. I asked him whose they were, and he told me they were his own. After I had taken them in, I had some Information that they were stole, and the Prisoner coming again, to pawn another Book, I stopped him; and the Book he brought the second Time, belongs to another Man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Day before I pawn'd these Books, I met a Man, who hawks Books about the Streets, and bought the odd Book of him: Then I asked him about these 4 Books, and he brought them to me the next Day, at an Alehouse, and I bought them; but afterwards wanting Money, I pledg'd them. As to bringing my Friends to my Character, - the Prosecutor lull'd me up, in Hopes that I should not be prosecuted, and I did not care to disgrace my Family, by letting them know of this Misfortune. When I was sent to Newgate, the Prosecutor maintain'd me, and I was remov'd from the Common, to the Master-Side, and should have had nothing but the Prison-Allowance, if the Prosecutor had not given me Money.</p>
               <p>Rial. I did go to see him in Prison, and gave him a Shilling.</p>
               <p>The Titles of the Books were read, and agreed with the Description in the Indictment. <rs id="t17400522-4-verdict21" type="verdictDescription">

I was about half an Hour from my Stall, and when I return'd I miss'd the French Dictionary, and got a Porter to look after my Stall, while I went about among the Trade, to desire them to stop it, if it should be offered to Sale. On Monday Morning Mr Wright, a Bookseller in Exeter-Exchange, inform'd me, that he believed my Book was at Mr Stone's, the Pawnbroker's. I went thither, and saw it, and told him it was my Book. The Book which I lost, I found at Mr Stone's. This is the Book, I believe 'tis mine; there were two Marks in it, when I lost it, which were made with a Black-lead Pencil, on the 2 Covers, at the Beginning and End of the Book; but they are now rubb'd out, and so they were, when I saw it at the Pawn-broker's. I can't swear positively to it, because the Marks are rubb'd out; but I believe 'tis my Book.</p>
               <p>Balderstone. The Prisoner brought this Book to me to pledge, on Friday the 25th of April. He<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174005220005"/> pawn'd it for 3s. and told me it was his own. I can't say I looked on the Covers of the Book, but it has been in my Custody ever since that Time, and I rubb'd out no Marks. Mr. Warr found it at my House, the Monday after I took it in.</p>
               <p>The Title of the Book was read, The Royal Dictionary Abridg'd, &amp;c. which not agreeing with the Description of it in the Indictment, the Prisoner was <rs id="t17400522-4-verdict25" type="verdictDescription">

How does your Master do? says the Prisoner, - I am just come from him at the Queen's-Head. After this, they desired me to walk in with them; and we went into the Back-side of Spencer's House, and sat down under the Back-shed. Then the Prisoner laid down his Hat, and desired Leave to go to the Little-house: When he returned, he brought in another Man, and this Man would lay a Wager of a Shilling, (to make the Company drink) that he caught the Ball in the Catcher, oftenest in 5 Times; and one of them asked me to give him 2 Sixpences for a Shilling: I pull'd out a Guinea, and four Shillings, and gave him 2 Sixpences, and immediately one of them snatch'd the Guinea out of my Hand, and then they push'd me out at the Back-Gate. I went away, and thought it was best to get from them; but they all 3 followed me, and when I had got about 500 Yards from Spencer's House, and about a Hundred Yards past the Corner of Fig-Lane, they made a full Stop upon me, and demanded my Watch. - They saw I had one, when I pull'd out my Money at Spencer's. One of them drew it out of my Pocket, and gave it to the Prisoner, who ran away with it over the Fields. They did not threaten me, but only laid hold of the Skirt of my Coat, and bid me give them my Watch: and one of them at the same Time drew it out of my Pocket, with the Cornelian Seal, set in Gold. - They first asked me, Where my Watch was? One of them stopped me, by getting before me, and the others came up, one on each Side of me; I was in such a Surprize, when they asked me for my Watch, that I could make no Answer. - 'I was the Man who caught hold of the Skirt of my Coat, that took my Watch out of my Pocket, and gave it to the Prisoner; I have not been able to find him yet; but I know his Face well. - To be sure I was afraid, when they follow'd me, and demanded my Watch: And upon my Oath, the Prisoner was the Man, who got before me, and stopped me, when my Watch was demanded. After they had got my Watch, I went back to Spencers<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174005220006"/> and asked for the Boy of the House, in order to be informed, if he knew any of these Persons; but the Boy was not to be found, and there was nobody in the House would give me any Answer at all. Spencer (the Landlord) was not then in the House (they said) but I saw his Wife, tho' I could not have a Sight of Him. I went a second Time to Spencer's, and saw his Wife: She desired me not to make a Noise in the House, but to step into the back Yard with her, and there she told me, - If I would come again the next Day, and bring an Officer with me, I might take the Men, for they were then to come again to her House. Accordingly, I went thither the next Day, with an Officer, but no Person was to be seen, except Mrs Spencer, and she told me, I might have my Things again, if I would be easy. I let her know, that I did not want to have them again, upon which she said. - Lord! Why my Husband has made up several of these Things, and the People have had their Goods again. When we found it was to no purpose to expect to take any of the Men at that House, we came away, and saw nothing of them, 'till the Day the last Prisoners were hang'd; and then I saw the Prisoner at the End of Parker's-Lane, as I was going up Holborn, I knew him again, and said to a Man, who was with me, - That's the Man who ran away with my Watch. My Friend did not think proper to take him then, left we should be knock'd on the Head; but in the Evening of the same Day, we took him at a House, by Covent-Garden Playhouse. - I never got my Watch again from that Time to this.</p>
               <p>Jury's Q. Did you play with any of the Men for the Watch?</p>
               <p>Mason. No; I did not play at all; neither for the Watch, nor Money.</p>

            . I am a Headborough, and went with the Prosecutor to Spencer's at Pancras, to see for the Men who had robb'd him, but not finding any of them, we went to several other Places, without any Success. But on last Execution-day at Night, we concluded to go to Covent-Garden Play-house to look for the Prisoner; and there we met with one Purvis, who told us he had seen him about 5 Minutes before we came; so we went to a Publick-house in James-Street, Covent-Garden, and there we found him; I knew, and seized him, and told him he was my Prisoner. I think it was at the Sign of the One Boot. He asked me on what account I seized him? I told him, it would be time enough to inform him when he came before Colonel De Veil. '' Why (says he) I know '' I must go to Newgate, and I am as well acquainted '' there, as I am here. I know what it '' is for: it was not me, who took the Man's '' Watch, - it was another Man took it, and '' that other Man gave it to me, and I ran cross '' the Fields with it.'' I had not mentioned one Word about the Watch, when the Prisoner said this to me; but we had been at Spencer's about it, and Spencer offered Mason his Watch and his Money again, and I believe the Prisoner might have been informed by Spencer, that we were looking after him on Account of this Robbery. I do not know what he had about him, when he was taken, for we detained him at a Publick-house, till the Prosecutor came to us, and did not search him. When the Prosecutor came to us, he denied the Fact, and shammed drunk, and mad; but I am sure he was sober when I laid hold of him, and he drank nothing at all afterwards. He behaved in a very insolent Manner before Colonel De Veil, and we were obliged to hand-cuff him: and as we were carrying him down Holborn, to Newgate, he told us, - if he had a Pistol, he would blow our Brains out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When this Man took me, there was one Mould with him; and Mould pulled out a Pistol, and held it to my Breast, and said he would shoot me, if I did not come along. The Prosecutor said he sent me the Guinea, and lost his Watch at Play; but they bid him swear it, - swear it; and knock'd me and my Wife down.</p>

            . When we took the Prisoner at the Publick House, I told him I had Colonel De Veil's Warrant against him for a Robbery. Says the Prisoner, - '' I did not do it, - I '' was not the Person that took the Watch: there '' were three of us together; and it was another '' who was in the Company took it, and they ran '' across the Fields with it.'' I cannot swear that he said another Man delivered it to him, but the former Witness had been with the Prisoner two or three Minutes before I came in. - The Prosecutor was not present when the Prisoner said this.</p>

            . On Friday the 16th of this Month, I went to Mr. Coster's to drink a Pint of Beer. The two Prisoners were drinking in the same Room, and sent for some Salmon, and asked us to eat some. About 12 o'Clock Mr Coster invited me to dine with him; and I went backwards with him into his Kitchen. While we were at Dinner, we heard the Door open, and the Prisoners being left with a Silver Tankard before them, Mrs Coster asked her Husband if he had taken Care of the Tankard, and told him the Creatures were gone. He went immediately from Table, and missing the Tankard, he ran out into the Street and took West. She was carried before Sir John Thompson, who committed her: and before we got away from Guildhall, the Gold-Smith brought Armstrong, and the Tankard, which was directly own'd by Mr Coster.</p>
               <p>Mr Bennet. The Prisoner, Armstrong, came last friday Morning to my Shop, and offered this Tankard to Sale. I asked her whether she sold it for herself, or for another Person? She told me it was her own. How long have you had it, said I? She said her Husband bought it about 4 years ago; but now she was necessitated to sell it. I desired to know what I must give her for it? She told me, she supposed, I could not give less than<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174005220008"/> 5 s. an Ounce. Why you undervalue it, says I, - 'tis worth more: If I buy it, I will give more; but what is your Husband's Name? She said his Name was Armstrong. I had got the Handle of the Tankard in my Hand, and having look'd at it, I told her, there were no such Letters upon it. My Husband (said she) bought it at Second-hand, and there are not the Letters of his Name upon it. I bid her tell me what the Letters were, upon the Handle: She turn'd herself round, but could not recollect what they were. Then I asked if she knew any body hereabout? No. Can you send for People of Credit, who will satisfy me 'tis your own? If you can, you shall have it again. Why, says she, will you stop my Tankard? I told her I would. Then she began to make a Noise, upon which I told her, I would stop her and the Tankard too; and I sent my Servant for a Constable, and carried her and the Tankard to Guildhall, where I met with the Man who had lost it: He own'd it, and the sitting Alderman being gone, she was carried before the Lord-Mayor who committed her.</p>
               <p>West. I had been drinking with this Armstrong at the Prosecutor's House, and went home. The Prosecutor came after me, and took me in my own Yard.</p>
               <p>Coster. I pursu'd her, and took her in her own House, and there are but two Doors between the House where she lives and mine.</p>
               <p>West. I own I was drinking with her, but I know nothing of the Tankard.</p>
               <p>Armstrong. Yes; we had both been drinking plentifully; but I know nothing of the Tankard.</p>
               <p>Jury. How long was it after you miss'd the Tankard, before you took West?</p>
               <p>Coster. I took her in 2 Minutes after I had miss'd it; but I saw nothing of Armstrong, 'till she was brought to Guildhall.</p>

I was sensible of what they were doing; I felt them, and strove to save my Pocket, as much as I could, for it was done with Force. When they had got my Money, and had tore off my Pocket, they flung that to me again, - here it is to shew. - Then they ran away, and I ran after them, and call'd the Watch, - here's my Pocket. I had been out with my Cart to do some Business, in Gravel Lane, in Petticoat Lane, and when I had unloaded the Cart, I sent it home by another Man, and staid drinking in Gravel Lane, 'till towards Morning; then I set out in Order to go home, and as I came through Hand Alley into Bishopsgate-Street, I saw a Man before me, and two Women a little before the Man. The Man asked me, Where I was going? I told him, I was going home to the Three Cranes: But he desiring me to go with him and drink a Pint of Beer, I went with him; and while we were drinking the Beer, in came the 2 Prisoners, and called my Companion their Brother. When the Reckoning came to be paid, he had got no Money, but yet he called for another Pint of Beer, and I paid for all. Then they carried me into Half-moon-alley, and robbed me. I had no Familiarity with them at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. Ask him if either of us were near him, for I never saw him before?</p>
               <p>Pepper. They were the Women, and none else, I know them very well; but I never saw them before that Morning, and I never desire to see them any more.</p>

Last Wednesday Morning was se'nnight, between 3 and 4 in the Morning, the Prosecutor came running out of Half-moon-alley, as hard as he could, and complained that two Women came up to him, one on each Side, and had pulled out his Money, Pocket and all, and had flung his Pocket at him again. The two Prisoners came out of White Hind Court, (while the Man went back to see for them,) and they went round some Ruins into Three Tunn Alley, and so into White Hind Court again.

They fell to swearing and damning, and said they had none of his Money, not they; - they had no more than a Penny or Three half pence about them, which they would lay out for a Dram to make us drink. But the Prosecutor being positive to that, we carried them to the Watch-house, and by the Constable's Order, I searched that Creature (Harding) as far as Modesty would let<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174005220009"/> me (for I am a little modest) and then I searched Bowling; she gave me a Tap with her Toe, upon the Small of my Leg, (which I did not understand the Meaning of) and not finding any Money upon them, Whaley went to see, if we could find any had been dropp'd among the Tubs in White Hind Court, or in a Vault there, into which such Creatures as these often retire. Not finding any we returned to the Watch-house, and the Constable bid us search the Prisoners again, and accordingly I pulled off Bowling's Shoes, and felt from her Knees, all over her Stockings. Then I would have searched Harding, but she resisted, and we were forced to get three Watchmen to hold her; then I got one Leg over my Knee, as the Farriers shoe Horses, and just by the left Side of her Ancle-Bone, I found Half a Crown, a Shilling, and Three-half-pence. Here is the Money, and one of the Half-pence is whited on one Side, as the Blind-man in Moorfields whitens Buckles.

            , and I, followed him, - we all three followed him out of the House. He was not above 2 Minutes in the House, before he went out, alone, and we went after him directly, and in Short's-Gardens, Bethell knock'd him down, took his Watch, and gave it into White's Hand, and she put it into her Pocket Apron. After this he told us, He had as good be hang'd for an old Sheep, as a young Lamb, and he would follow him again. He did so, and in Drury Lane, at the Corner of Short's Gardens, he knock'd him down again, and took 3 s. and some Halfpence from him, which he likewise gave to White; and we had each of us a Shilling a-piece, but the Halfpence were not divided. Then we all came back to Bethell's House, and we looked at the Watch;

                  Martha

             took off the Seal, and the Green Ribbon, which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174005220011"/> was in the Watch, and pull'd off the Ribbon which was-upon her Head, and put into it. We then all went into Oxendon Street, to a Pawnbroker's, and Bethell went in with the Watch, while we stood at the Corner of the other Street, and pawn'd it for 22 s. (as the Pawnbroker tells us) tho' he brought us but a Guinea. As soon as the Watch was pawn'd, we went to a House at the Corner of Oxendon Street, and had 2 Pints of mull'd Wine together: Bethell changed a Guinea there, and gave me a Crown out of the Money, besides the Expence; the rest of it He and White kept to themselves. When the Man was knock'd down, he did not cry out, for he was so much in Liquor, that really he did not mind it, nor who did it, but seem'd glad to get away as he could. We all 3 went after the Prosecutor upon this Design, and were to have assisted him, had there been any Occasion. White heard Bethell say, he wanted, and would have Money, before we went out, and she was nearer to him, when the Man was robbed, than I was. She was not with me, when I first pick'd the Man up; but when I brought him to the Prisoner's House, she served us with the Gin. This is the same Watch, and this is the String White pull'd off her Head, and put into it.</p>
               <p>Bethell. Had you no more than one Quartern in our House?</p>
               <p>Casey. No, not a Drop, 'till we came home from pawning the Watch; we then had more Liquor together at Bethell's House, and I went in Liquor to bed with him and his Wife, (White.) I had been acquainted at the Prisoner's House before this Time, and have drank Drams in it before. I can't tell whether the 2 Prisoners are Man and Wife, or not: Col. De Veil committed them when they kept a disorderly Night-Cellar, for not being Man and Wife; I know they live together.</p>

            . Bethell brought a Silver Watch to me, on Saturday Night, the 26th of April, and borrowed 22 s. upon it. They have said it was about 11 o'clock, - I can't be positive to the Hour; I thought it had been sooner. This is the Watch, and I then took it in from him, but he had it again from me on the Monday following. I know it again, and describ'd it when Col. De Veil sent for me: And I told him I could swear to it, if I could see it. When Bethell brought it to me he was in Mourning, and had been with me, (2 or 3 Days before he pawn'd this Watch) to cheapen one for himself; and told me that an Aunt of his, in Jermyn-Street, had left him 20 l. When he came to pawn this Watch on Saturday Night, he told me, he had bought it of one Johnson in Holbourn; but it seems this Johnson is the Man to whom he sold it, after he had redeem'd it from me. I had seen him once or twice, before he came to cheapen the Watch; and when he came to pawn this, I thought it was his own, and believed he had bought one.</p>

               <p>White. Did I carry it?</p>
               <p>Bethell. Yes, you carried it in, and the Man paid 6 d. for it, and went out of the House. He wanted to go to Bed, but we could not let him, upon which he went out of the House, and Casey staid behind him 3 Quarters of an Hour; and after that she went out, and returned with a Watch, which she said was her Husband's who was in Gaol, and I, being in Liquor, pawned it for a Guinea, 22 s. and she had every Penny of the Money. On the Monday following I heard she had picked this Man's Pocket, so I went and redeemed it.</p>

            . I am Servant to Mr Richards, who keeps the House in Covent-Garden, where the Prosecutor came to call for a Pot of Beer; the Evidence (Casey) brought him into the House, but I do not know what Day it was; I know her to be a Pick-pocket, and my Master bid me turn her out of the House. Then I asked the Man if he had lost any Thing? He said no; and turning the Flap of his Wastcoat aside, I saw his Watch was safe. After this, He and Casey went out together, and no one else was with them. I saw no Woman with the Prosecutor, but Casey; she brought him in, and she went out with him. I remember his coming in, and going out; and I know the Prosecutor again. - That is the Man, and I saw no Woman with him, but the Evidence.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did they drink together at your House?</p>
               <p>Eager. No; not as I know of; they did not stay half a Quarter of an Hour in our House, because my Master saw him in Liquor; and so he bid him go home. When I first saw him, he was going up Stairs with Casey, but I pulled him down by the Coat, and then they both went out of doors together. Next Morning he came, and told us he had lost his Watch. I never saw either of the Prisoners before.</p>

               <p>Patrick Cannon. I know this Paper, 'tis a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174005220013"/> Draught on Knight and Shuttleworth. I had it for a Security, and I was taken up last New-Year's Day was Twelvemonths, on Account of this Note, at Messieurs Knight and Shuttleworth's, in Change-Alley. I went thither to get the Note accepted, and tendered it to Mr Shuttleworth himself: He desired me to stay a little, and told me he thought Mr Lutterel was not then (a Trader) in Company, but he said he would send for him, and accordingly he did, and asked him if the Name Richard Lutterel and Company was his Hand? He told him it was not; upon which I was taken up, and carried before the Lord Mayor; but was discharged, because I only came with it for Acceptance. I had it from the Prisoner; he came to my House, the Sign of the Cannon in Suffolk-Street, with two Bailiffs, and desired me to Bail him in a Action for 6 Guineas. I told him I did not care to be bail for him, because I had suffered before, by being bail, and had paid the Money. He said, - because you shall not be under any Apprehensions of losing by me, here's a Note, (but the Money is not yet due,) take it for your Security, and I shall be obliged to you. So I took it as a Security, and had it 6 or 8 Days, in my Pocket. 'Tis now in the same Condition as it was when I received it from the Prisoner, and when I tendered it for Acceptance, excepting that my Name Pa. Cannon, is wrote upon the back. I have known the Prisoner 2 or 3 Years; and I know his Hand-writing: I have seen him write several Times. I take the Words Lutterel and Company, to be the Prisoner's Hand: All the Note I think is the Prisoner's Hand-writing, and I have seen him write several Times.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. You speak of something on the Back of the Note; - What was wrote on the Back?</p>
               <p>Cannon. When I tendered the Note for Acceptance, Mr Lutterel was sent for, and he asked me my Name, and where I lived? I told him, and he wrote it on the Back of the Note. I did not examine the Note when I took it, but thought it a very good one, seeing it drawn on checqu'd Paper, and I read it, at the same Time; and thinking it was a good Note, I did not take much Notice of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. Did you take it to be my Handwriting, when you received it from me?</p>
               <p>Cannon. No; I did not. I did not know but it might be Mr Lutterel's Hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. Was not you acquainted with my Hand-writing before?</p>
               <p>Cannon. Yes; but I could not then tell whether 'twas his, or no: If I had taken it to have been the Prisoner's Hand-writing, to be sure I should not have carried it to the Bankers for Acceptance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. Was not I arrested that Morning; and had not I some Discourse with you (before this Note was given you) about your being Bail for me?</p>
               <p>Cannon. Yes: He was arrested that Morning, and I did not chuse to be Bail for him. He had sent for me before this, to be Bail for him for 32 l. which I refus'd; but this he said was a Trifle, 'twas but for 6 Guineas.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. Did not you say, you did not care to be Bail, because you should disoblige your Wife?</p>
               <p>Cannon. I can't tell whether there was any Discourse at all, about my Wife. I never consult her about these Things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. How long was it, after I came in, that you bail'd me?</p>
               <p>Cannon. In about 8 or 10 Minutes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. Was the Note given, before you bail'd me, or after?</p>
               <p>Cannon. I can't resolve that Question: I think it was given me, for a Security, if I would bail him. I told him, I did not care to be Bail for him, and he gave me this Note, as a Security, and said it would be the same as Money. He told me, it was not yet due, and therefore, he could not then command the Money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. Did not you say, you must have something to shew your Wife, before you could give Bail.</p>
               <p>Cannon. I never mentioned a Word about my Wife, when he talked about my being his Bail, as I know of. I think the Note was given me, after I had bail'd him. I was not willing to be bail for him, but when he offered me the Note for a Security, I agreed to be his Bail. The Note was read, as inserted in the Indictment, and on the Back thereof was wrote, - Pa. Cannon, in Suffolk-Street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. You say, you was taken up, on New-Year's Day was a Twelvemonth; When did you see me after that?</p>
               <p>Cannon. The next Day; and several Times afterwards, but he was not taken up on this Account. The Prisoner came to me the next Day after I was taken up; and asked me, if I had not been in the City, with Mr Lutterel? I said, No, I have not. He reply'd, I thought I had seen you with him. And at that very Time, I sent for Mr

            , and told him I would not let the Prisoner go, 'till I was satisfied for the Money I had bail'd him for. The Prisoner then said, he was sorry for what he had done, but Mr Lutterel<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174005220014"/> (he said) had given him Liberty, to draw upon his Checques. He farther told me, he had been with Mr Lutterel, and had desired him not to give the Note out of his Hands.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. Had not I surrendered myself, in Discharge of my Bail, at that Time?</p>
               <p>Cannon. No, for on Saturday after this, he came to my House, in the Afternoon, and said, he had paid the Debt, or made it easy; but on the Monday following I had Notice, that if I did not come and pay the Money, I should be sued; so I went and gave in Bail above; which cost me 8 s. After this he gave me his Sword, and two Guineas for my Security.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. Have not I been often at your House for these 8 Months last past; and have not I been visible, and publick, in other Places?</p>
               <p>Cannon. Yes; I believe he hath.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. Have you not declared, that at the Time the Note was given you, you knew it was my Hand Writing, and that it was deposited with you, only to make your Wife easy.</p>
               <p>Cannon. No; I swear I never did.</p>
               <p>Mr Lutterel was called, but the Prisoner's Counsel observing that the Indictment charged the Prisoner, with intending to defraud the said Mr Lutterel, the Court were of Opinion he could not be permitted to give Evidence, because he was concerned in Point of Interest.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Q. After this Note was given, was not I visible, and to be seen?</p>
               <p>Mr Masters. Yes; I have seen him at Can non's House, after the Note was given, and after Cannon had been carried before the Lord Mayor: I cannot tell how often I have seen there; I have met him in the Streets, within these three or four Months, but have not seen him at Cannon's House, within these 8 Months last past. Formerly I have seen him in Mr. Lutterel's Company, but not since the Date of this Note.</p>
               <p>Couns. But when you advised him to go abroad did he not take your Advice?</p>
               <p>Mr Masters. He went abroad some time afterward, - 'twas some Time in the latter End of January; how long he staid abroad, I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Mr Shuttleworth was called, and as it appeared that he refused to accept the Note, he could not be concerned in Point of Interest, therefore he was admitted to give Evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr Shuttleworth. Tho' the Note was brought to me, I was not liable to pay it, unless I had accepted it. I had Money of Mr Lutterel's in my Hands, and had the Note come from him, I should have paid it. This Note was brought to me, by Cannon, on the 1st of Feb. 1738, for Acceptance. I knew it was not Mr Lutterel's Hand, but if I had not happened to have seen it, I do not know but our Servants might have accepted it.</p>
               <p>Couns. When you saw it was not Mr Lutterel's Hand, did not you give him Notice?</p>
               <p>Mr Shuttleworth. Yes, I sent for him.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did you ever pay any Draught to the Prisoner, in Mr Lutterel's Name?</p>
               <p>Mr Shuttleworth. No, never in my Life, as I know of. We had had several Draughts forged upon us; one in particular for 154 l. which made me the more careful at that Time.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did not Mr Lutterel's Draughts used to be in the Name of Lutterel and Company?</p>
               <p>Mr Shuttleworth. Yes, formerly they did, but not lately: not when this Note was made.</p>
               <p>Couns. Was not the Note shewn to Mr Lutterel, at the Time it came to be accepted?</p>
               <p>Mr Shuttleworth. Yes, it was, in order to be carried to my Lord Mayor's; and it has been either in his Hands, or mine, or the Attorney's, ever since. We gave it to the Attorney, that he might take out a Warrant for the Prisoner; but he was not taken up, for he fled; as I was told by Mr Barnard the Attorney.</p>
               <p>Couns. [to Cannon ] Was you acquainted with Mr Lutterel's Hand-writing, as well as the Prisoner's?</p>
               <p>Cannon. I cannot say I am; I never saw him write in my Life.</p>
               <p>Defence. Cannon says I came to him with two Officers, - I had been with him to tell him that I had had the Officers with me, on Account of a Debt which was not my own; and not being willing to pay it, I desired him ( Cannon ) to pay it, and I appointed the Officers to come to his House, and I would meet them there. Accordingly I went thither and drank Frontiniac above Stairs, and told him I had been arrested, and by whom; and I desired him to be Bail for me, telling him I should have Money in a few Days. He made no Objection to it; but said, he had no kind of Doubt that he should suffer by me, I having often owed him more Money and paid him. Afterwards he told me, he apprehended it might occasion some Family Disturbance, and begged to be excused from bailing me, unless I could contrive to silence the Family Disturbance: upon which I took this Piece of chequed Paper<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174005220015"/> out of my Pocket, which I had from Mr Fitzgerald, who is Mr Lutterel's Clerk, to make some Draughts upon Mr Lutterel, by Order of a Gentlewoman who had Cash in his Hands, and upon a Piece of this chequed Paper I wrote this Draught, desiring him not to use it; and telling him, I gave it him to silence the Disturbance in his Family, till I brought him the Money, or the Plaintiff's Discharge. And in this Confidence in him, that it should not be made Use of, I gave him this Draught, and made it payable not till 14 Days after Date. But the Day after, he being pressed for Money, goes into the City and offers the Note, telling me I was a good-natured Man, and he believed, that as I was intimate with Mr Lutterel, the Sanction of my Name would have influenced Mr Lutterel to pay it. What I have farther to offer, is, that I had at that time several accepted Notes of Mr Lutterel's in my Possession, and therefore it is not to be supposed that I should do this with an Intent to defraud him, and I put the Word Company to his Name, left it should be made an ill use of. Mr Lutterel told me, (being married to one of his Family, and being often at his House, and seeing his Letters, and being conversant in his Counting-house, and in his Business) that he was assured I did neither intend, or mean, to injure him or Mr Shuttleworth f, but that I had done an imprudent Thing; therefore (says he) go and discharge Cannon from any Demand he has upon you. Accordingly, though I never intended to have paid this Debt of 6 l. yet as I had done so imprudent a Thing. I went and paid it; and yet after all this, Cannon (being spirited up by some People who are pleased to have some little Jealousy of me,) goes before Colonel De Veil, and makes an Affidavit of all this, upon which there was a Warrant taken out against me, and I was advised to step out of the way: I refused to go, at first; because that would look like Guilt; but afterwards having 157 l. due to me at Dunkirk, I applied to Mr

But since my coming back, I have been several times at Mr Lutterel's, and fifty times at Cannon's House; and I have dined there often, I imputed this Transaction to his Ignorance rather than to any Design; but being there one Sunday Evening playing a Game at Cards, Cannon, who served the Wine, was pleased to make some Observations on the Game, which since has subjected me to another * Indictment: He alledging that I subjected the Gentleman (my Partner) to the Loss of the Game, that I might come in, for a Share of his Money which he was to lose. I intended to have prosecuted Cannon for this Aspersion, and so he brought this Prosecution against me.</p>

Cannon had been applied to before, to bail the Prisoner, in an Action in the Sheriff's Court for 30 l; but his Bail was not thought sufficient at that Time. In this Action for 6 Guineas,

            . I went to Cannon's House when the Prisoner was arrested: Cannon told me Fitzgerald was arrested for 6 Guineas, and was above Stairs with two Officers. Before I went away, Cannon went up Stairs, and when he came down again, he told me, he had bail'd him, and he had a Note in his Hand. I looked at it, and said 'twas a Draught on Messieurs Knight and Shuttleworth. No, says Cannon, 'tis his own Hand-writing. Why says I, do you think the Man would be such a Fool to do such a Thing? Cannon immediately put his Hand in his Pocket, and pulled out a Letter, which he said was his Hand-writing too. I laugh'd at him, and said it was a Joke. I told him, 'twas a good Note on Messrs. Knight and Shuttleworth: No, said he, 'tis his own Handwriting: I know it as well as I do my own. I insisted upon it, that no Man in his Senses would do such a Thing; upon which he put his Hand in his Pocket, and pulled out the Letter; I compared the Note and the Letter, and never saw two Things so much alike in my Life; and then I believed it. This was 5 or 10 Minutes, or a Quarter of an Hour before the Officers went out of the House. When he shew'd me the Note, he said to me, I would have bailed the Prisoner, had he given me nothing; but he gave me this, and I know 'tis his Hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did he give you no Reason why he took the Note, when he said he would have bailed me for nothing?</p>
               <p>Lawn. No; he did not. I might think what I pleased, but he said nothing to me about his Wife. I never saw the Prisoner above once or twice, before he came to Cannon's to be bailed. I thought it was done to satisfy his Wife, as such Things are often done to make a Family easy; but he did not say any thing about his Wife.</p>
               <p>Couns. And would you see a false Note produced under a Gentleman's Hand, and not complain of the Fraud.</p>
               <p>Lawn. Am I to be busy, and complain, when the Man (Cannon) told me himself, that he knew it was Fitzgerald's own Writing? I think I should have done very ill, if I had told of it, in any Company. I was glad to see Fitzgerald out of Custody.</p>
               <p>Couns. Where did you learn such Principles? Of Wreatbock?</p>
               <p>Lawn. I knew Mr Wreatbock, but what's that to me! Since the Prisoner came from France, I have been in his Company; and have seen Cannon with him; and so I have after Cannon had been taken up about this Note. I was with, him when he left his Sword and 2 Guineas with him as a Security for the 6 Guineas, after the Note was discovered. 'Twas easy for him to have taken him up before he did; for after he came from France, he appeared as publickly as any Man in the World. I have seen him at Randall's Coffee-House, and at the Royal Exchange, Fleet-Street, and all Parts of the Town.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him whether Mrs Cannon did not come into the Room, at the Time he was shewing him this Draught? and telling him it was my Hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Lawn. I think that was the Thing that stopped our Discourse. I can't remember particularly, whether she came into the Room; but when the Door was open, she might hear every Word we spoke. I think I saw her, and that that hush'd our Discourse. I am a Marshalsea-Court Officer, and have been so these thirteen or fourteen Years.</p>

            . I know the Prisoner; and have seen Cannon once or twice: This Note was given him about 18 Months ago, but I have seen him and the Prisoner in Company together after that. Fitzgerald the Prisoner owing me 6 Guineas upon a Note, I got him arrested, and my Attorney told me, he had put in Bail. A fortnight afterwards the Attorney told me, that unless the Prisoner surrender'd, the Bail would be fix'd for the Money. About a fortnight after this, the Prisoner call'd at my House, and proposed to pay me 5 Guineas: I went with him to a Tavern, and there I saw Mr Masters, a Wine Merchant, and Mr Cannon, and I received 5 Guineas, 4 of which, Cannon gave to the Prisoner, and he (the Prisoner) adding one to it, gave it me, and he was to pay the Attorney; at the same Time, Cannon returned a Silver-hilted Sword to the Prisoner, and the Bail was discharged, upon the Prisoner's giving me a Note for the remaining Guinea. Mr Masters told me, the Prisoner had made a fine Jobb of it; for in order to get Bail to my Action, he had forg'd Mr Lutterel's Name to a Draught upon the Bankers. Why, says I, what was the four Guineas and the Sword for? The Prisoner said, he gave him them to induce him to be Bail for him; and Cannon was by, and seem'd to own it: But he made some Difficulty in giving back the 4 Guineas, because the Prisoner owed him 35 s. for Wine, and Reckonings unpaid. I asked the Prisoner, how he could do so imprudent an Act, as to sign a Man's Name to a Note? He told me he did it, to let Cannon see he did not want Money; for he intended to make up the 4 Guineas, which he had given Cannon, 6, and to have paid me. But Cannon's calling at the Bankers with the Note, had discovered it to be bad. I never saw the Prisoner from that Time to this, 'till the Affair at the late Masquerade, and then I happened to dine with Mr Lutterel, and heard he was about prosecuting him for this Draught.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did Cannon hear the Prisoner say he had deposited 4 Guineas with him, to induce him to be Bail?</p>
               <p>Mr Fitzgerald. Yes, and Cannon own'd it; and with Relation to the 30 s. which Cannon would have stopp'd, the Prisoner told him, he need not talk so much about 30 s, for his Reckonings, for he had made his Wife a Present of Something, of much greater Value. I thought it was an odd Way of reproaching Cannon with his own Gallantries, but I was very glad to get my 5 Guineas. I have heard the Prisoner's Defence, and that he says he gave Cannon this Note to pacify his Wife; but I heard nothing of such a Pretence then. I asked the Prisoner what need he had to give him a Note, when he had left 4 Guineas and his Sword with him? He told me, he did it because I would not have him think he was under any Obligation to him. I understood that the Prisoner drew this Note before Cannon's Face, and I told Cannon, he was a Fool to take a Note wrote before his Face. Mr Masters said something, that Cannon was a Blockhead, but I do not know whether Cannon was in the Room when this was said. I was there about 10 Minutes, or much about that Space of Time; and the Prisoner then insinuated as if Cannon had seen him draw the Note. I have seen Cannon once, since that Time, at Mr Lutterel's, and it was the Day after the Masquerade. He insisted upon it that the Prisoner took it out of his Pocket ready drawn, and if he has sworn so now, I do not doubt but it is true.</p>

            , Mr Lutterel's Book-keeper, deposed, that the Prisoner and his Master were acquainted, but had no Dealings together, as he knew of; except that sometimes Mr Lutterel used to give him a Draught on Messrs. Knight and Shuttleworth, for Money due to Mrs Rookes, who received an Annuity of 50 l. per Annum from Mr Lutterel. He added, that sometimes the Prisoner came for the Money; sometimes Mrs Rookes; and that Mrs Rookes and the Prisoner kept Company together, but he did not take them to be Man and Wife. He farther said, that he delivered 2 or 3 of Mr Lutterel's Checques to the Prisoner, because he told the Witness he wanted to go to the Play, and he gave him these, that he might write upon them, to the Box-keeper, in order to get Admission for himself, or his Friends.</p>

He gave me 2 36 s. Pieces, a Moidore, and a Guinea and Half, and 16 s. and 6 d. in Silver. The Gold I put in one Pocket, and the Silver in another. Then I went to see a Friend in St John Street, and as I was going from thence, to the White Horse Inn, in Fleet-Street, I met a Man, about 6 in the Evening, in a narrow Passage, (<placeName id="t17400522-22-crimeloc116">White Horse Alley</placeName>

At the same Time a Woman came up in a black Hat, like a Country-woman, and clapp'd me on the Shoulder, and said she must speak with me. I told her I did not know her, and just as I was speaking these Words, the Prisoner came up, and without speaking a Word, thrust her Hand in my Pocket: I clapped my Hand upon my Pocket, but yet I saw her draw out 2 Pieces of Gold with her 2 Fingers, a Moidore, and a 36 s. Piece, I immediately felt in my Pocket, and missed 2 Pieces out of the 5. The Prisoner upon my Oath is the Person. After she had robbed me, she made the best of her Way into a House, about 30 Yards off, and the Door was fastened after her. I knock'd, but nobody would hear; at last some People opened a Window above Stairs, and called Harry, Jack, Tom, and raised a hundred People about me; and some of them bid me get away, for they were all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174005220019"/> Thieves, and if I had any more Money left, they would have it all. After this a Woman came by, who said she would help me to secure them, and I went with her to St Luke's Head, and sent for the Watch: A Watchman went in Pursuit of them; and about 10 o'Clock we were sent for to the Watch-house, where I saw the Prisoner, and gave the Constable Charge of her. He secur'd her that Night, and next Morning she was carried before Justice Poulson, where she was searched, and a 36 s. Piece dropping out of one of her Stockings, she owned it was my Money, but said the other Woman robbed me, and gave her this Piece.</p>
               <p>Mr Whitesides confirmed Mr Percival, in his Account of the Money he received, and said he believed, and could almost swear to the Piece, which was found on the Prisoner, while he was with her before the Justice; because there was a black Spot upon it, which he had before observed. He gave the same Account of the Prisoner's Confession.</p>

I live in the Strand, and as I was coming along the Strand, those Ladies met me, and I being a little warm in Liquor, they both took hold of me, and said, I should give them a Pint of Wine: I being a little merry, went with them, to a private House in Benner's Court, over against the <placeName id="t17400522-29-crimeloc147">Fountain Tavern</placeName>

They told me, that I had Six Shillings more to pay, so I threw down 6 s. upon the Table, and they took it up among them; for if they had demanded a Guinea, I should have given it them, because of the Danger I was in. Then I went to the Door, and the Man of the House came up, and looking at me, he cry'd, - Why you have 4 s. more to pay! Pray let me go out, says I, and I'll give it you, and pray go home with me; for I was not far from my own House. Upon this he let me out, and followed me; presently I heard the Women say, - d - mn him there he is. Seeing no Watchman near, I thought my self in Danger, and went to the Watch-house in Strand-Lane, but missing the Door, the two Prisoners came up and caught me (on each side) by the Collar, and the Man fell to beating me on the Stomach at the same time. I called out Murder as long as I could speak, and the Man hearing somebody coming up, gave me a Slap on the Face, and said, d - mn you, take that, and one of the Women cry'd, - take what you can get; so some of them took my Hat and Whip, which were given to the Man, and he ran away with them. I am positive to the Prisoners; for Pooley I held till<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174005220020"/> the Watch came to my Assistance, and the other I described so well, that she was taken next Morning, when she came to bring Pooley a clean Gown.
