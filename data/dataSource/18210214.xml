On the 26th of January, about half-past five o'clock in the afternoon, I went into the house-keeper's room, which is the front of the house - it was quite dark - I found the cupboard door wide open, and two napkins on the ground - the window was also wide open. I missed the napkins, and immediately went to the pawnbrokers to enquire, and there found Wales and Clements, the officers I informed them, they came to the house, and examined the room. The window was shut before, but not fastened.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was at the pawnbroker's, with Clements, Watts came in, and informed us of the robbery; we went to the house, but found no marks of violence. On returning we called at a pawnbroker's in Duke-street, Manchester-square, and as I came out the prisoners passed me - we followed and stopped them about thirty yards off; Skordy had a bundle at his back - Clements was pursuing Grady - I took him into a shop, and secured the bundle; it contained the things described to us by Watts. About ten o'clock I saw Grady in Calmall-buildings, playing with another boy; I ran and got Clements, we enquired where he lived, describing him as lame, and found him in a back attick in the buildings. I knew him to be the boy. I asked him if he had been out - he said he had not been out of the court. I said he had been further - he denied it. I said he had been in Duke-street - he denied it, but afterwards admitted it, but denied being with Skordy, or any knowledge of him. I am certain we saw him with Skordy - he walked on crutches. Clements not seeing him at first, followed another boy.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was with Wales at the pawnbroker's, Watts came in, and gave information. As we were coming out of the pawnbroker's, in Duke-street, Wales pointed out the prisoners - we secured Skordy. I went after Grady, and laid hold of another boy, who was near them, but let him go - I did not mistake him for Grady. I afterwards went with Wales to his lodging. I found in the room two tablecloths and a pillow-case, wrapped up, which Watts claimed.</p>

            . I am a constable. I searched the prisoner when I was bringing him from Southampton. He said he knew what I came after him for, it was for robbing Mr. Cerf of his plate; I told him to say nothing to convict himself. He said he hoped he should see his brother in his place, as he was the person who stole the plate and gave it him, but he kept the money because his brother kept his wages. His brother is gardener to Mr. Cerf.</p>

I used to pay his brother his wages, as he lived with his brother. About a fortnight after he went the plate was missed; I heard the prisoner was seen in the pantry, dressed better than usual with a watch in his pocket. I took out a warrant against him immediately I missed it; his brother is still in my service as a labourer, but not as a gardener.

             re-examined. I missed the plate in the month of August, the prisoner had not left the service a fortnight when it was lost; I think I missed it about ten days after he left. He left on Saturday night, came again on Sunday morning and on Monday, and helped me clean the plate in the pantry; next day I missed it - he was in the pantry alone for four hours. It could not all be taken away at once without my missing it.</p>

I saw the prisoner and another in the road, about seven o'clock on the night of the 20th of January, each having hold of an end of the portmanteau; I asked them what it was? they threw it down and ran off. The prisoner was stopped by the crowd, without my losing sight of him - I am certain of him. The portmanteau was gone when I returned - it was found next day.</p>

When I went to bed I left 25 s. in copper, and next morning I found it safe. I missed another paper half an hour after, and asked her for the copper she had taken; she denied it. I and the officer searched her box, and found 7 s. 6 d. in penny-pieces tied in her apron. She said she would shew where she put the other 5 s. paper, she took him to the other end of the larder, and shewed it to him, hid under the knife-box. We found the brown paper which had inclosed the penny-pieces, in her pocket.</p>

We were watching, about one o'clock in the night of the 16th, saw the prisoner come out with the truss of hay on his shoulder and put it in a ditch. He then brought out a second truss, and afterwards brought out his allowance hay, which is half a truss, for his horses. He then brought his horses out, and was putting them in his cart, I went and examined the hay and concealed myself. He brought his cart in the road, then took the two trusses from the ditch, put them in the cart, and drove on.

On the 31st of January, I locked the poultry in the stable, which is enclosed with the dwelling-house by a fence; I locked both locks, and took the keys into the house; the cock and turkeys were then safe. I afterwards saw the cock in the possession of the constable, one of the turkeys was old and the other young. About half-past seven o'clock next morning, I found the door open; it appeared to have been done by a crow or chisel. There were also traces of footmarks, which lead over a fence six feet high. I can swear to the cock having seen it from a chick; it was whole with the feathers on. The constable also had two turkey's heads, and some fowl's feet.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Friday the 2d of February, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I went to the prisoner's house, and in the coal-hole found a hamper containing two hen turkeys picked, one was bigger than the other. I asked the prisoner who they belonged to; he said they were his, and were sent from Suffolk by his mother. I asked him if there were any more poultry there; he said No, I felt there was, and brought it up. I gave it to a person at the door, charging him in the King's name to take care of it for me. Mrs. Wilson who keeps the house was fighting to get the prisoner from me. I found the cock in the same basket, and a great quantity of feathers; the cock was not picked. I also found two hens in the basket, which were picked. I took him to the watch-house, returned to the premises with Cadby, and on taking up a board in the privy floor, I found a quantity of fowl's heads and feathers, the quarter of a fowl cut up, and the remains of several fowls.</p>

               <p>MISS WEEKS re-examined. I know this to be the head of my cock, the comb was cut off when it was a chick in a particular manner, and the spurs were sawed off; it is a game cock; we lost twenty-six or twenty-seven fowls that night.</p>

            . The prisoner lodged in my house with his wife. I am a laundress; I remember the Wednesday, which was two days before the officers came, the prisoner was at home on that night, I saw him at tea between four and five o'clock, he was up and down stairs all the evening; he lodged in the first floor front-room. I saw him at ten o'clock, and he wanted to go to bed; I made him up a bed in the kitchen as his sister-in-law slept with his wife. I saw him next morning about ten minutes before seven o'clock, getting up; he went out a little before eight o'clock, and not before. He bears an honest sober character.</p>

I went up and told him his bed was ready; his wife and her sister were there; he had the head-ache, and was eating bread and cheese for supper - it was ten o'clock - I had seen him at five o'clock, and after that. About ten o'clock I gave him a light to go to bed.

            . I am servant to Mrs. Kent. On the night of the 23d, Mr. Kent went out about half-past six o'clock; a knock came at the door, and a lad asked if Mr. Watson lived there, (I afterwards saw a lad answering his description apprehended with Billet) a knock came to the door at half-past seven o'clock, on my going to the door Doling was there, he gave me a note and said he had brought it from Mr. Williams; part of Mr. Williams's family had been out with the Miss Kents that morning, and as I had never seen him before I asked him if he lived with Mr. Williams? he said No; I asked him where he brought the note from? he said from Mr. Williams, of Hart-street - I am certain he is the man - he requested an answer. I observed two great-coats hanging in the passage as I took the note into the parlour, and as I delivered it to Mrs. Kent, the street door slammed too; I instantly ran out, opened the street door, and shut it after me; Billet stood in front of the area rails; I asked if he had seen any person run out with something on his arm? he said</p>
               <p>"Yes, he ran up that way," (pointing towards Russell-square) I went that way, and asked an old gentleman if he had seen any body; I was in the act of returning when I met Billet walking towards me with his hands behind him. I accused him of being concerned in stealing a coat, and sending me the wrong way; he denied it. Plaistead came up, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182102140009"/>said he had met a man running towards Bloomsbury-square with a coat on his arm. I went with him, but did not find the man. I returned and missed the coat from the passage, it hung there when the note was brought. I saw Billet in custody next day with a lad answering the description of the one who first knocked. I went with Jefferies to the Falcon, public-house, in Sutton-street, and immediately pointed out Doling in the tap-room from among twenty others.</p>

            . I went to my mother's, (Mrs. Kent's) with my husband about seven o'clock that night; a great coat hung in the passage, and my husband hung his up also.

He had a great coat on his left arm, and ran against me; I am certain of his person. I went on past Mrs. Kent's, and about five houses down the servant asked me if I had seen any one running, he was talking to Billet; we pursued Doling, but did not catch him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there a light for you to see him - A. Yes there was a lamp just by the corner of Bloomsbury-place. I looked him full in the face; he was running as from Mrs. Kent's. I saw him again a week after.</p>

               <p>MR. KENT re-examined. I know there was a lamp at the corner of Bloomsbury-place; it has been removed within the last few days. I heard Doling tell the Magistrate a young man at the corner delivered him the note; the Magistrate asked him if he was to wait for an answer? he said Yes; the Magistrate said,</p>

               <p>"Then you ran away without one."</p>

            . I am an oilman, and live at No. 54, Southampton-row, two doors from Mrs. Kent. I know Billet. On the 23d of January, about a quarter or half-past seven o'clock in the evening, he came to my house, and enquired the name of the people who lived at No. 52. I told him Mrs. Kent.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. I went with Eames to the Falcon, public-house, he immediately pointed out Doling. I took Billet at his father's in Tucker's-rents, Somer's-town. I took his brother at the same time, he was afterwards discharged.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you fetch the servant to the Falcon, public-house - A. No. I took Doling on the 25th. There were sixteen or twenty people there.</p>

The boy who was taken with Billet appeared, in height and size, the same as the first who came to the door, I am sure Billet is the man who spoke to me at the area rails; there is a lamp at the next house, it is not a gass light.

On the 23d of January I was coming down from the dining-room to the pantry, on the area floor, between one and two o'clock in the day, and as I crossed the passage, I saw a man going out of the door into the area with a large bag on his back - when he saw me he dropped it on the threshold of the door, and ran up the area steps; I pursued him, and in running up the area steps I lost sight of him for a moment; I then saw him running towards Bedford-street, nobody else was within sight. I collared him and asked what he was going to do with the things? he said</p>
               <p>"What things? don't say I want to steal your things, I have not been down your area, go to No. 27, where I work and enquire my character." I said come with me and answer the charge; he resisted and struck me. I brought him back and took him into the house. I had a full view of his dress and person, and had he been longer out of sight I could have recognized him; I am perfectly certain of him. The bag contained the articles stated in the indictment - they were in the bag before he took it - it was laying on a table in the passage, two yards from the door, ready to be taken in the country to wash; they are worth between 15 l. and 20 l. I am confident he is the man.</p>

            . I live in the parish of Heston, and keep the house; the prisoner Looseley lived with me. On the 19th of January we went to bed a little after nine o'clock. I had seen the house fastened myself, the doors were locked and the windows shut. I heard nothing in the night. I get up between five and six o'clock, it was then dark; I had a candle, and missed a flitch of bacon, which had laid under the kitchen window. I found the shutter unkeyed, inside, and let down; the casement was taken out and lay two or three yards from the window. I found Looseley at home in bed; I sent for a constable and took him. When we went to bed we latched his door, and in the morning it was open, which rose my suspicion. I charged him with it, he said he had not been out of his room. I asked him how his door came open? he said he had not been down. I found the bacon the same day at Burr's house; he was taken in about half an hour.</p>

There is a casement window in the shop, which was nailed up, and there are three bars across, inside, it does not open. I fastened the door and the other shop windows, which have shutters. Next morning about six o'clock, or half-past, on getting up, I missed the cheese from the window, and two sides of bacon from the front of the counter, which were in the shop the night before. It was dark, and I had a candle to examine; I found the door a little way open and the casement window broken all to pieces, and hanging outside; a man could squeeze between the iron bars. One side of bacon was very long and thin in the neck part; I had bought it in London, on the 1st of January, and on bringing it home in the cart I sat upon it, the corner stood out, I rested my shoe upon it, and it made a mark on the corner very black and dirty. I saw it again in possession of the constable, and know it to be the same; I am quite positive of it. I also saw 4 lbs. of cheese, the same sort and quality as I lost. I lost 40 lbs. and 2 cwt. of bacon; I found 50 lbs. I locked the door at night, and left the keys inside; if a person broke through the window, they might get out by opening the door.</p>

            . I am constable of Feltham, about a mile from Bedfont. I have known the prisoner some years, I had occasion to go to his house on the 17th of January, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, and found him there - it is about a mile and a quarter from Gamble's. I found a quantity of bacon and cheese there. I got a warrant, and went again in about three-quarters of an hour, and found the house shut - I knocked - there was a padlock on the door. I broke it open, but he was gone. I found 50 lbs. of bacon and 4 lbs. of cheese. I also found some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182102140011"/>instruments, a chisel, pickaxe, a saw, crowbar, and some other pieces of iron. I could not see him again till the 5th of February, I then met him in a lane between Chelsea and Kensington, near twelve miles from Feltham. I had not been particularly looking for him. I told him he was wanted for a burglary committed at Gamble's; he said he knew nothing of it, and wished me to let him go. I know the house was his, he lived there from the 9th of September, till the day I searched his house - he is a single man, and knew I was a constable. I went to enquire for his father.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was he in any business in which he might use the instruments - A. I never saw him do a bit of work.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought it at Brentford-market, thirteen or fourteen weeks ago; there was 110 lbs. of it, at 6 d. per pound, it came to 2 l. 15 s., and I bought some cheese there.</p>

On the 2d of February, about two o'clock, I saw him Everett-street, Brunswick-square, with the harness; I turned back to my master's house, and told him I suspected the prisoner - he desired me to go after him. He was not out of my sight. I went and asked him if the harness was for sale - he said Yes, and asked 25 s. for it. I saw there was no bridle, and noticed it. He said he had not got it. I asked him if he was disturbed, and could not get it? He said he did not know what I was talking about, it was given him to sell by a groom. I said it was odd a groom should have such harness to sell, as it was new. He said he was well known about the neighbourhood, and went with me to No. 51, Great Guildford-street - they knew nothing of him. I let him go, and took it to my master's, and in the evening I took it to Bow-street. He called at my master's that evening for it. I refused to give it up till he went before a Magistrate, and gave him in custody, and delivered the harness to Pitcher.</p>

Believing his account to be correct, we agreed to supply him; he wished to have them immediately, as he was going to Bishop Stortford by coach next day. We promised him part if we could not get all ready. I made out a list of them, and our young man packed them up - they amounted to between 8 l. and 9 l.</p>

            . I live at Bishop Stortford, am a clock and watchmaker, and a member of the Baptist church; the prisoner was not pastor there, had no salary of 50 l. a year, nor did he live there - it is all untrue. He preached there a few times, occasionally, but never a fortnight together; they gave him 1 l. for preaching on a Sabbath. He slept at my house two nights, and said he was a painter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is with feelings I cannot describe, or express, that I stand here; little did I think a few months ago that I should be placed in such circumstances. I am not able to employ counsel, but if I was I should not, as I know your Lordship's known humanity will mention to the Jury every favourable circumstance in my case. I gave them information where to find the goods; for after I got them my conscience would not let me part with them. The moment I saw Mr. Dean, (my prosecutor in another indictment,) I told him I had injured him. As to my altering my name, it was because I was ashamed of what I had done. I am glad they have got their goods back, Nothing but the greatest distress caused me to do it.</p>

On Saturday, the 27th of January, I went down to sleep there, and got there about six o'clock, and fastened the doors myself about half-past eleven o'clock. Mrs. Manton's two daughters, and one son, were at home. I got up at half-past seven o'clock next morning - it was light, and had been so about twenty minutes. I found the kitchen door open, which I had fastened the overnight, and a square of glass was broken out of the kitchen window, large enough for a man to get through. I looked about, observed a candle had been used, and saw the droppings of tallow where they had stuck it in the kitchen; I missed the linen from a basket, and the drawers were open. The linen was safe overnight. I found a hat left behind, on the dresser, some pieces of paper were in it, and concealed under the lining was a duplicate; the name of Parker was in the hat. I went to town to Lightfoot, and shewed him the duplicate.</p>

I served the last service at Southall-green, with Mr. Parker, the pawnbroker. Between nine and ten o'clock on Saturday evening, the 27th of January, I set off from London, on foot, with a young man named James, a baker, for Southall - we had agreed to rob Mr. Manton's house there. - we got there between eleven and twelve o'clock. On Sunday morning we broke a bar in the kitchen window, and a pane of glass, got in, and opened the door of a room in a passage by the kitchen and saw a man in bed - he appeared awake, but never spoke. We found sixteen or seventeen shirts in the kitchen, two tablecloths, a pillow-case, and two glass cloths. We took a tinder-box and a candle with us, and struck a light before we got into the house. The man with me took a hut from the kitchen, and left his own. The moment we saw the man abed we made our escape, and returned to town; we went to my lodging, No. 1, Baker's-court, East-street, kept by Mrs. Thompson, where I lived with (

I asked her if she was waiting for any one? she said No. I took her into Lightfoot's, and found the bundle under her cloak - which was four shirts all marked, Manton. She said</p>
               <p>"There is another woman here, she and I were together last night in Oxford-street, and met two well dressed gentlemen, each had a bundle, we went with them to a house where we slept, and in the morning they gave us these shirts instead of money;" and they were going to India. I asked her if she had any more shirts, or had pledged any? she said No. I then saw Williams in another room there, and shewed her a shirt, which I received from the pawnbroker. I asked her if that was the shirt she brought to pledge? she said Yes, and gave the same account as the other woman, and mentioned the house they went to - she said it was in Woodstock-court. I asked her if she had pledged any of the shirts before; she said she had not, and that she had no lodging. Jones heard her mention Woodstock-court and agreed that they slept there. I left Jones in the watch-house, and took Williams to point out the house; she shewed me No. 3, Woodstock-court. and herself asked the woman if she had not slept there last night. I told the woman to answer truly as the girl was in custody for a robbery; she said,</p>

               <p>"That is impossible, there are two persons in bed there now, who have been there all night." I took her back to the watch-house, and took Jones there, she would not be possitive that was the house, and the woman denied her having slept there. Jones gave me her residence, No. 4, Simmon's-buildings, but said she had not slept there that night. I was present when Robinson and Powell were brought in, and the shirts taken from them. I searched Williams's lodgings on the evening of the 30th of January, and found a shirt, tablecloth, two napkins, and a towel - it was at No. 1, Baker's-court, East-street; she there went by the name of Jones. I learnt from her and Robinson that they lived together there by the name of Jones. I asked Powell when Wales took the shirt from him what he had done with the shooting jacket as he had one on yesterday; he said he never had one, and never wore any such thing. The same evening Wales and I went to M'Grath's, and found the shooting jacket. On the Thursday following, the 1st of February, I went again to M'Grath's, and she gave me a bundle.</p>

I was not alarmed, and got up about half-past six o'clock - it was dark, and about half-past seven o'clock I went on the lawn, and found a ladder standing against my master's bed-room window, which was broke and the shutter cut; some person had let down the top sash, and got down into the room - the drawers were broken open. I sent to town to my master, and the things remained as I found them till he came - it was daylight when I discovered it; I had a candle when I got up. I heard no noise after I was up, if it had been done after I rose I might not have heard it, as the window is in front of the house.</p>

We went on foot, and got there between nine and ten o'clock at night. We found a ladder in the rick-yard, and got in at one of the bed-room windows by breaking a pane of glass. We forced and broke some of the drawers open, in Mr. Parker's bed-room (no person being therein), and took four pistols, a silver tea-pot, a small silver waiter, some table and tea spoons, two pair of salt spoons, a flannel-gown, some stockings, and some handkerchiefs, a white connterpane, a man's silk hat, and a pair of leather breeches.

            , public-house, in Oxford-street. On the previous evening, I went there, and enquired for Powell, the baker, he promised to give me all the information he could about him. I told him I wished to take him respecting a robbery. In consequence of information, I and Wales went there again, we said we had come on an unpleasant business, and had a few questions to ask him, and begged he would take time before he answered, as it was a matter of consequence to him. I asked if he knew Robinson, (describing his person) and said I supposed him to be a companion of the baker; he said he knew no such man, either by name or description. I asked him if he had any boxes, bundle, or property left there by any person, or if he had bought any plate, and named a silver tea-pot. stand, and spoons? he said he had seen nothing of the sort; I said that was not true, and that I had a warrant to search his house, and again entreated him to tell me if he had any thing of the sort; he said he had not, but when I was about to search the house, he said there was a trunk left there by a man. I told him I would look at that presently. His wife in his presence gave us a key of a cupboard, in which I found four table-spoons and one gravy-spoons. I said those were the very things I wanted, and questioned him about the tea-pot and stand; he said</p>
               <p>"I will tell you presently." I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182102140017"/>said</p>
               <p>"I must know immediately;" he then said they were at Danell's, a silversmith's in Oxford-street, to have his name engraved on them. I asked how he got them; he said he had them of Robinson, and to whom the box belonged, in payment of a score of 3 l. 15 s. He said he had nothing else from him. I took him up to his bed-room, and there we found four silver salt-spoons, plain; he said they were his own, and I left them there. There was a cloth marked P.P. he said he did not know how it came there. The prosecutor and I went next morning, and found the salt-spoons and took them away; Wales took the box. I went to Danells, and found the tea-pot, stand, and seven tea-spoons.</p>

I pushed up the library window, cut a hole in the shutter with my knife, and we all got in. We took some books from the book-case, and a silver ink-stand from off the library table. We then went into a little room adjoining, and took a cloak, two pair of boots, a pair of shoes, and a new hat. We then went into another room, and took another silver inkstand, and a clock from a little room near the dining-room; we put the silver and other articles (except the clock) into a bag, and took a tinder box and candle with us and struck a light after we got into the library. We left about half-past two o'clock, and came on the road to town: we arrived about nine o'clock, and went to the General

He had four volumes, one pair of shoes, and an ink-glass silver mounted, which he agreed to purchase, but we had not agreed for price, and not having seen him since, I have not been paid for them.

I said we had not a piece at that price, but we had some at 8 s., and 9 s. I gave him back the order, and in about an hour he brought this order. On the credit of the order I delivered him one piece sixteen yards long, at 9 s. per yard, and another twenty-three yards, at 8 s. 9 s., in all 17 l. 5 s. 3 d. He said his name was Groves, which I entered in the book. I afterwards heard that the prisoners were taken, and saw them at Worship-street. Harrison said he had the order from Jones, and Jones confessed giving it him, but denied writing Mr. Steadman's name.</p>

            . I am a servant. I was out of employ just after Christmas, and lodged at the King's Head, Albemarle-street - Parsons used the house, and I became acquainted with him; I did not know Dawson. Several days before they were in custody, Parsons came to me at the Blue Posts, Bond-street, and said a person wanted to see me outside. I left him in the house, and went out and saw Dawson, who I never saw before. He asked, if I would pass a forged note; I said, I never did, and should not like to do it - he said, he would pay me if I did; and asked me to meet him next morning in Oxford-street, at nine o'clock. I made no answer and came away - he mentioned no place in Oxford-street. I met him three days after in Oxford-street, and he asked me to do the same. I had seen him before that, and he asked me, why I did not come according to appointment? I said,</p>
               <p>"I made no appointment." He then asked, if I would pass them? I refused. He said, I could get a very good living by it - that he had passed above one hundred in the country. I left him.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you here - A. Mr. Christie, the inspector, fetched me here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When were you in place - A. I lived with with Captain

               <p>COURT. Q. How soon after you were called from the public-house, were you questioned about this - A. About a fortnight after. I have lived with Sir

            , I am a potter, and live in Harrow-road, Paddington. I was at the King's Arms, Edgeware-road, in October or November, and saw the prisoner there, he was asking the landlady to change a 1 l. note for a pot of beer, she said she could not. I had silver and gave it him; I am sure he is the man, I had not seen him before. He gave me the name W. Messenger, and referred me to Adams's eating-house at Paddington, (looks at a note) this is it. I then left him. I paid the note for a bill, it was returned a fortnight after, marked forged. I then went over to Adams, they knew him, but could not tell where he lived, but said they would mention it to him when they saw him. I never saw him about it. I do not know when it was returned; I am certain he is the man. I understood them to say he had lived there.</p>

I saw him looking over the glass of the door into the tap-room, the prisoner was there that day, but was gone then, he could not have been gone more than a minute; he had been sitting in a box by the side of the window, and got into the street through the window; I did not see who lifted up the sash, it was down before.

Five minutes after, another man bought meat which came to 1 s. 3 d. and offered me 1 l. note - I marked the address as he gave it me (looks at one) this is it. We gave him 10 s. having no more change, I watched him, and saw he went a different way to Whitehead's Buildings (which address he had given me) I followed him and saw him join the prisoner, they went together 200 yards from my shop, I followed them up North-street into Sloane-street, suspecting them I went over to the constable, but as they turned, I followed them into the Cock public-house, I beckoned the landlord out, and saw them both together over a pint of porter; I fetch'd a constable who came at last, and I gave them in charge. I had before that sent to enquire at Whitehead's buildings. I saw them together for ten minutes before they went into the public-house.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went to the Cock, and found the prisoner in company with another. I searched them and found 19 s. 4 d. on the prisoner, and two pieces of mutton, I asked where he lived - he said I believe any where. As I took them down Sloane-street, the prisoner tried to get out of the handcuffs; I got assistance, and took them to the watch-house - he said he found the note in this pocket-book, which the 19 s. 4 d. was in. The mutton was inside his smock frock.</p>

They asked again, and I refused; in five minutes after the shoes were missing; I heard nothing of them till next morning.</p>
               <p>THOMAS M'GEE. On the 20th of January, the prisoners were given into my charge for stealing bacon, they had an ass. I found the shoes in one of the panniers; Webb said he got them in exchange for herrings near Brentford, he drove the ass. I enquired, and found they belonged to the prosecutor. Hawker also said they bought them, all three of them being in company together.</p>

            . I am an officer. I met the prisoner in Panton-street, Haymarket, on the 25th of January; I saw he had a bridle under his coat; I followed him into a saddler's shop, and waited outside the door - he came out without the bridle. They informed me at the shop that he was to call again in a quarter of an hour. I waited, and when he came I represented the master, and asked him what he wanted; he said he called about the bridle he left there, that he wanted to sell it, and asked 9 s. for it; he said it was his own. I told him I doubted it, and should take him to Marlborough-street. He said he bought it of a servant of Mr. Smith's, at a mews near Park-lane. I found he was not known there.</p>

I went out about ten minutes before nine o'clock, after putting the plate safe away, and returned about half-past nine o'clock. I had told him not to go out whilst I was out. I did not see him again, till he was apprehended.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182102140025"/>I gave information at the office - none of the plate has been found.

When the butler went out, the prisoner sat by me in the kitchen; after that, he left the kitchen and shut the door - I did not see him again, nor hear him go out. Nobody came to the house, until the butler returned; I let him in. I knew the prisoner was out, as the parlour bell rang half an hour after the butler went out, and the maid answered it.

            . I am a police officer of Gloucester. In consequence of a description in the newspaper, I apprehended the prisoner at the Crown, at Gloucester. I found his waistcoat and one cotton jacket at his lodgings; and he had his hat on. I found a coat and jacket, at the pawnbrokers; there are stiches on the shoulder of the coat, which appeared as though the epaulette had been taken off. He told me, as we came up on the coach, that he heard the bell ring: went to the door, and saw a girl whom he knew, he took her to the butler's pantry, and asked her to have something to drink - that he went across the square, and fetched a pot of porter - when he returned, she was gone, and the plate missing. He went to look after her, and not finding her, he was afraid to return.</p>

             re-examined. The clothes look like the same that he had - the shoulder of the coat has marks of the epaulette. When he left, he had his black livery on; the hat has the same maker's name in it, and is like his. I heard no bell ring, nor any girl come down. I should, if it had happened. We found no porter pot about the pantry. I never saw him after he left the kitchen - he then had his black livery on. I must have heard the bell ring, as it rings just over the kitchen door. A person can go into the pantry without going through the kitchen. He did not have two jackets on.</p>

             re-examined. The clothes are the exact pattern and colour; I believe the coat to be the same, and the hat - the jackets are only worn in the morning; the waistcoat is what he wore with the black coat. I found no porter pot about; he was washing up the tea things when I went out - the plate was worth above 50 l.; and the clothes were worth 9 l. when they were stolen, and the hat 23 s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The butler said he was going out; there came a ring at the bell, which I answered. I found it was a woman whom I had seen at a public-house, and who had told me she was a soldier's wife, and asked if I wanted any one to wash for me? I had told her where I lived, and said she might call; she called that evening - I took her into the pantry, and took a jug to get her the porter, from the Bedford Arms. When I returned, I found the door wide open and she gone: I went in pursuit, and was afraid to return. The coachman swears, that the bell did not ring - it is well known, there is a hell which must ring every time any one goes out; it rung when I went out, and when the woman came in.</p>

A chest and pair of drawers were in his room, he had the use of them, except one drawer, which was locked, and I kept the key. I opened it on the 18th of December, and missed some black silk; I afterwards saw him with a waistcoat, which I can swear was off the same silk. He stopped three or four weeks after, and then something occurred. I told him to leave, and he must pay for the silk; he refused, and said he bought it of a man who worked with him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182102140026"/>at Ratcliffe-highway, whom he would try to find - he never found him. After he left, I missed a blanket which was on the bed, where he and his wife slept - it was worth 20 s. I never recovered it; I found the prisoner near Whitechapel. He went by the name of Frazier then. I discovered a key in his drawer, which opened my drawer, easier than my own.</p>

On the 16th of January, about a quarter past five o'clock, I was sitting at tea in the back room, and heard a noise in front, which I thought was my boy shutting the shutters, but hearing a rumbling, I got up and opened a door leading to the front room; I saw a man standing in the middle room, by the light of a butcher's shop opposite, and at the same time saw Harrison come from the dark part of the room, ran towards the window, and jumped on the table, then over the upper part of the sash, and the other immediately followed him the same way. I knew Harrison before, and saw the side of his face; he had a pair of trowsers and a ragged coat on; I am certain he is the man. When the second jumped on the table I got hold of his gaiter, but he got from my hold. I jumped out of the window and pursued - it was dark, and I could not see their faces without the aid of a light. I saw the front window safe one hour before; the lower sash was fastened, but the other has no fastening - it was shut. I usually shut the shutters about dark, and generally before that time - it is a private room. I secured Haynes about five or six yards off; he was never out of my sight, except as he turned the street; as he turned he began to walk, and was going as from my house. I saw Harrison running fifteen or twenty yards further; I saw nobody else in the street. Brock came up behind me, and I got him to hold Haynes. I then pursued Harrison, who was not then in sight, he had turned the corner of Baker's-row towards Church-street. I passed the door of a public-house, seven doors down, and he immediately came out; I turned round and seized him as he made towards the opposite street; I said</p>
               <p>"You are the man," he said,</p>
               <p>"No, by God it is not me, I have just come out of the Red Lion, Whitechapel-road." (which is 200 yards off) He denied being at my house, and began fighting, and it was with difficulty I got him to the watch-house. I saw him five hours before, and I am sure he is the person. The room had furniture in it.</p>

On the 8th of January, the hen-house door was spiked up, and the window fastened with rails. About eleven o'clock at night an alarm was given; I and two young men got up, and pursued two men who were running. When we returned we picked up some dead fowls, there were feathers where they had killed them, and blood upon the fowls; a coat and hat laid five or six yards from the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. How is your house enclosed - A. It is enclosed all round by fences and sheds, the hen-house is within the enclosure. The hen-house is connected with the dwelling-house by a gate, when it is shut. The prisoners came up to me in the road; I said they looked like the men, and as I knew Frencham, I told him to go home as I knew where to find him; he would go back to the house with me, and I then detained them, but let them go in the morning on their promising to pay 10 s. each, being neighbour's children.</p>

            . I am nephew of the last witness. A five bar-gate joins the dwelling-house to the hen-house, and shuts the cart-way. I was called up, and found the hen-house broken - it was fast the night before. I picked up two fowls in the road, and three more in the field. I stood under the hedge when Mills came up. I asked him where he was going; he said to Edmonton; he had no coat or hat, but a short smock-frock on; we let him go. We got a lanthorn, and went down the road; he came back, and my uncle said he would take him. Frencham came up without a hat, and asked what the row was. He was asked where his hat was; he said be neither knew nor cared. They were detained till morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not the hen-house separated from the dwelling-house - A. Yes, a rail and gate goes across the cart-road, which separates it, you cannot pass from one to the other without going through a gate.</p>

He claimed the coat, and said</p>
               <p>"It is mine, find it where you will." The cart-way which is railled off, separates the hen-house from the dwelling-house. Frencham came up, he had feathers about him, and a spot of blood on his shirt. The hat was brought to him, he said</p>

            . I am a broker, living in Wheeler-street, Spitalfields, about a mile from the prisoners. On the 6th of January, the prisoners came to my shop, and offered to sell some blue and white plates. Richard said his father gave them to him, and that they had been in the family some time; I gave him 2 s. 6 d. - there were about eleven of them. He said, he had three or four articles in the furniture line, if I would walk home and look at them - he asked me 2 l. for them. He assured me his father gave them to him, as he was about to be married; but he was obliged to sell them to go into the country to his uncle. I offered one guinea and-a-half for them; he refused - I returned, and offered 2 s. more, which he refused. He took me to a house, which he called his own, near Shoreditch Church - both went, but Richard was the man I dealt with. About two hours after, he came and asked me to buy some books; he had them in his hand - I declined. He said,</p>
               <p>"Can't we agree for the other things?" I refused to give more, but gave them 1 s. to bring them, which they did that night. I paid them 1 l. 12 s. 6 d. for a chest of drawers, four chairs, and one wash-hand-stand table - it was twilight when they brought them. I sold all the things. I sent Mr. Swan to where I sold the drawers. I do not know who bought the other things.</p>
               <p>MR. SWAN re-examined. I can swear to the drawers; I have had them four years, and gave 50 s. for them - the plates were blue and white.</p>

               <p>MR. MALTBY. I have compared the account in the schedule; most of them tally with what I lost - they are cut about the lengths I should sell them in my shop. I have every thing entered that is sold, and appoint a young man to receive the money. I have not taken stock for twelve months. The prisoner sent me a pair of scissars which he used to trim the lamps with, and said he should not be able to return so soon, and I must look out for another porter. When he left in December, he said his father was ill; and in January, he said he was dead. I do not think the trunk which contains the property was ever in my house. The shop is part of the dwelling-house; I sleep there only - it belongs to the firm.</p>

Mr. Doughty, and three other gentlemen, stood in the street; and as we passed them, Mr. Doughty took her bonnet off. I asked his meaning; he made an evasive answer, saying, he would serve me the same, if I troubled my head about him. I gave him in charge - they all ran - I pointed him out; and insisted on his being taken, the other gentlemen held the watchmen, to prevent his springing his rattle. Some officers came up - Courtney Philips struck one of them. They were taken to the watch-house.</p>

On the 18th of January, between seven and eight o'clock the prisoner called, and stopped twenty minutes - I have known him twelve months - he gave me 1 s., and sent me to fetch some liquor; I refused, but afterwards gave him the child to hold while I fetched it. I went two doors off for it, and we drank it; he was standing, and said he was in a hurry, as he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182102140032"/>to meet a young man at eight o'clock. I lit him down stairs directly, and we stopped some minutes at the door. When he left I went to the mantle-piece, and missed the watch. I left only him and the child in the room. My cousin was with me when he came, but she left me then. I left a child three years and a half old in the room.</p>

I had told Robinson, the day before, that he was to go, and ordered Humphreys to deliver them to him; a quarter of barley meal was also to go to Mrs. Day, at Hammersmith. I told him that there were twenty-three sacks in the mill, and to take twenty from them. Humphreys took the sacks, and Robinson received them into the waggon. I stood near the waggon, and was too and fro; we always pitch the sacks on an end, and can then tell by looking at the waggon the exact number in in the waggon; I counted seven on each side, and six in the middle, which made twenty. I went to the tail of the waggon, and found they had put a quarter of pollard in instead of barley meal; while he was gone to put it back, I looked under the tarpauling, and found a sack of flour, laid across the head of the waggon, covered with loose hay and a cloth; I covered it over, and got down. Robinson came and put the barley meal in, and came to me in the counting-house for a delivery note. I said,</p>
               <p>"Now, John, what have you got?" he said,</p>
               <p>"I have got twenty sacks of flour for Hawkes, and a quarter of barley meal for Mrs. Day." He then took the team, and went off. I followed him in my chaise, and passed the waggon at Hammersmith. I called on Gammon, at Turnham-green, and informed him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. They were to take twenty sacks from twenty-three - A. Yes. There was nothing the matter with the tail-board.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. I believe the three sacks remained in the lost, therefore the sacks in question must have come from another part of the mill - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am high constable of Kensington. On the 29th of January, about ten o'clock in the morning, the prosecutor called on me. I first saw the waggon on the road, about the five mile stone. I could perceive twenty sacks of flour in the waggon, but I could not see what was under the tarpauling. I let him pass' and followed him to Mr. Hawkes's, at Kensington; he backed the waggon under a gateway. I told Edgson, who was with me, to look at the front of the waggon, while I went into Mr. Bird's, the adjoining house, where I could observe what passed under the gateway. I saw Robinson take ten sacks in, and a man who assisted him, took eight; Robinson then got up into the waggon, before the waggon was drawn from under the gateway. I saw two other sacks laying across the front of the waggon, under the tarpauling; he moved these two sacks into the middle of the waggon, then he took a great coat, opened it, and laid it over them, and put the tarpauling over that. The two sacks of barley-meal remained where they where, and the other two sacks which stood upright were taken into Hawkes's. The horses were put too; I followed the waggon to Mrs. Day's, and saw the barley-meal delivered, and twenty or thirty empty sacks were put into the waggon for Mr. Stanbrough; the two sacks of flower still remained under the tarpauling, he then turned his horses round, got in, and the prisoner Frearson got in with him, and they drove away.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that, had you seen Frearson with a bundle. - A. Yes, at Hammersmith, he threw a bundle into the waggon, it was large enough to contain two sacks, they were tied up in a handkerchief. They then drove about twenty yards from Mrs. Day's, they then stop a short<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182102140033"/>time, and Robinson lifted one of the sacks from under the tarpauling, upright, untied the mouth, and Frearson held an empty sack, while Robinson shot part of the full sack into it; they were then laid down on the bottom of the waggon, but not under the tarpauling. Instead of going into the regular road, they turned to the left, into a bye lane, where the waggon stopped again; Frearson held up another sack, while Robinson shot some of the flour into it, he quite emptied it; it was put down among the other empty sacks. Frearson tied one of the sacks up, and the other was only twisted round. The waggon went on to the Coach and Horses, public-house, at Hammersmith. Robinson got out, and then Frearson went into the house; he got into the waggon again, and pulled the tarpauling over the flour, and got out again. I believe they saw me there. Frearson got off, and I did not see him again for two days. There were several people about, and being well known about there, I left. The waggon and Robinson went on. I followed him to Mr. Stanbrough's yard. He drew the waggon into the yard, and called out</p>
               <p>"Humphreys take this flour out of the waggon," (it was then in three sacks.) I said,</p>
               <p>"No, no, that flour must not be moved till either Mr. Stanbrough, or some of his family come to see the sacks it is brought home in." I asked Robinson, whether Mr. Stanbrough sent out skotches of flour in that way (meaning parts of sacks) he said,</p>
               <p>"he had taken two sacks of flour by mistake, he had got two more than he knew of." I asked why he did not bring it home in the manner he took it out, he said,</p>
               <p>"The sack had burst." I asked, why he and the man that was in the waggon, did not put it into one of Mr. Stanbrough's sacks, as he had twenty or thirty there; he made no answer to that. These two sacks were corn, and not flour sacks, and marked T. F. Mrs. Stanbrough came out and saw the flour. I saw it moved into the dwelling-house. Robinson was taken into custody that night, when Mr. Stanbrough came home, and Frearson was taken on the 1st of February. He keeps a chandler shop at Brentford. I took him myself, at twelve o'clock in the day. I told him I had a warrant to search his house. I found two sacks in his shop, and part of another, marked T. F, the same initials as those in the waggon. In the kitchen, I found two sacks and a half of barley, with the same initials; and in his bed-room, seven sacks of flour, with the same initials: none of them tied up. He said he could prove where he got them. I took him into custody. He said,</p>
               <p>"Let me go up stairs, to put on more clothes." He did so, and when I first saw him, he had the same jacket on which he wore in the waggon. I told him so; he said,</p>
               <p>"I seemed to have a fancy for it, he knew nothing of the waggon, he was not there," and when he was before the Magistrate, (what he said, was not taken down) he said, he got up into the waggon to ride, being tired - this was after I had sworn he was there. As I took him to Newgate, he said, he expected some more would go with him, he little thought of going by himself. I produce the sacks, the flour was emptied into. When the waggon got home I found no bundle in it. Frearson took nothing away with him.</p>

Having frequently been robbed, on the 25th of January, I went into Mr. Gough's room, which commands a view of my stable. At seven o'clock I went into the stable, and asked the prisoner about the horses; he said they were all well, except the mare. While he was gone to water the horses, I saw an empty sack in the corn-binn - it was not mine, and there was no name on it; the people I buy my corn of, have their sacks marked. I told him to do the horses up, and let them go to rest. I left the stable. went into the garden, and looked through a crevice; I saw the prisoner take the candle and the sack, and go into the loft, which joins the granary. I climbed up a pear-tree, and could see what passed in the lost and granary; he put some hay down the rack for the horses, then went into the granary, mixed some oats, beans, and chaff, and put it in the corn-binn for the horses; he then opened the loft window, and threw a truss of straw out; he then scraped a quantity of oats into the sack, from the rack, twisted the mouth of the sack round, and threw it down after the straw. I then went to Gough's window, saw the prisoner come out of the yard, and go into the Roebuck, public-house, next door. He soon after went into the stable-yard, and came out with the sack on his back, covered with a dark great coat; I followed him about 100 yards, then collared him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Halloo, Robert! what do you call all this? it is some of my corn;" he said</p>
               <p>"How do you know that?" I said,</p>
               <p>"Because I saw you take it, and you have not been out of my sight." He said</p>
               <p>"If it is your's, take it," and let it fall. I picked it up, and he went off. I had him secured about five o'clock next morning.</p>

I stood drinking with them for half an hour - we had two pots of beer between us three and a companion of mine. My companion left, and I went with them to a house in Rosemary-lane; I got there about half-past eleven o'clock. The other girl took me up stairs, and I gave her 3 s., and 6 d. to get a pot of beer, she did not return for a quarter of an hour. Johnson stood at the door with me waiting for her to return. Holland and another man came into the street, and asked what was the matter; Holland said he would try to find her. She came back; the two woman and the two men then took me to a coffee-shop, a good way off; we had some coffee, which came to 8 d. - all sat in the same box. Holland took his watch out, and shewed it to me; he then asked to look at mine; I took mine out, he opened and examined it, shut it again, and returned it to me. Then Johnson asked to see it, but I said No; she then snatched it out of my hand, and away she ran out of doors. I followed her, but two men in the passage prevented my getting out, and when I did get out they directed me the wrong way after her - I do not know who they were. I was quite sober.

            . I am a watchman. I was nearley opposite the coffee-shop, saw two women rush out, and run down Crown-court, into the privy. When we took them we found it was Johnson and Williams. Holland came to the door not a moment after them. I heard him tell Dodds to turn a different way to what they were gone.</p>

Johnson and others told me of it; it was first proposed to steal some-lead, that was gone, and Johnson said we could have some saltpetre, and that would pay better. He told me so a week or a fortnight before Christmas. Howard was not there then. Painter and Herbert asked if we got it - whether I knew any one who would have it. I came over to Howard, and asked, if he would have some saltpetre - he said, Yes, and told me to bring him a sample, and asked where it was to come from; I said, from Mr. Brandram's, I asked where it was to be landed if I brought it; he said, at St. Catherine's-dock. (which is in Middlesex). I told the other two men that he must have a sample, and in two or three days, they gave me one. I took it to Howard, he was not at home, and I left it with his wife. I went over two or three days after and saw him. He said he had got a customer for it, and I might bring it when I liked. Previous to that, Johnson had told us we were to get in at the shutter, which he would leave open, then we could get in at the window, and find the keys of the warehouse gates. On the Thursday before Christmas, I and the other two were standing at Dockhead, we took a barge, and put it under the prosecutor's warehouse, which joins the river, and when the tide was down, we walked down, and got in at the window, and I found the keys hanging in the counting-house; we took twenty bags of saltpetre, one was sweepings and dirty, we chucked that overboard, and had nineteen left. We went over to Howard, and told him we had got the saltpetre, and was going to bring it over when the tide was up, he said he wished he had known it sooner, as he did not know where he would get the keys of the wharf at St. Catharine's-dock. We went with him to some street in the Minories, he went into a house, brought me the keys, and told me to put it into a wooden counting-house, on the wharf, and bring him the keys in the morning. We went home and brought the barge to St. Catharine's-dock, and put the bags of saltpetre in the counting-house, as he desired, and next morning I took him the keys. We went to a public-house kept by Avel, he told me he had got a man that would have it. I asked him for some money towards the saltpetre. He gave me two half-crowns and 1 s., and said he was going to Smithfield, to buy a horse, and said he should be at home in the evening. I went over in the evening and saw him at the public-house again. He said he had got a person who was coming to look at it. We went home and saw him again on the Saturday morning. I asked for some money. He said he had seen a wine-merchant, who was coming to look at it, and was to bring 10 l. or 15 l. and when he took it away he would bring the rest. I do not know when he was to pay for it. We waited till between eight or nine - no one came. I asked him for 1 s. to get some bread and cheese, he gave me one; we had three or four pots of beer, at the public house, which he said he would pay for - nobody came. I told him we would take the saltpetre away, as I thought by his manner, he had taken it away from us. He gave me the keys; I went to the wharf and found it was gone. I went and accused him of taking it, he said he had not. He went down to the wharf with us, we made inquiry, and heard it was gone to the Thames-police. I was apprehended at his house the day after Christmas day, and had two hearings when I told this to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. Howard was taken before you - A. Yes, I was not promised a light punishment to plead guilty. I never said I would be revenged on Howard. I said it was through him that I was taken, and called him a rogue.</p>

            . I am a wharfinger, and live in Vine-street, Minories; my wharf is at St. Catherine's Dock. On the Thursday before Christmas, about ten o'clock at night, Howard called on me, and said a friend of his was going to unload a barge of goods at my wharf - he said part of it was saltpetre, and asked if I would be down there at three o'clock in the morning, which was high-water time? I said No; that Smithers had the keys of the barge gate of the wharf, and he had better get them of him that night, in case he should not be there early enough for him to cart them. He said he wanted the key of the small shed, as some of the goods might be damaged if it was wet. I gave him the key - that shed is a counting-house. I was afterwards fetched to the office about this, and was detained until an explanation was given.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What goods came to the wharf - A. I do not know, I never saw them. I went to Howard's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182102140038"/>and left a message for him to appear at the office, and he surrendered himself.</p>

I did not walk very steady." He asked how far I was going; I said,</p>

He said, he would take off his watchman's coat, as he was rather behind time, and did not wish to be known - he had a glass of rum, and I gave him 1 s.; and when we got to <placeName id="t18210214-92-crimeloc585">Hyde Park gate</placeName>

I met the prosecutor; he was followed by four men - I looked round, and saw one of them pick his pocket; the book fell on the ground, and the prisoner picked it up - I pointed him out to Captain Wallace, who seized him, and it fell from his breast - he said, he picked it up, and would be glad to restore it; but before that, he had been making off with it.</p>

The prisoner came into my service, on the 2d of February, and next day as she was going to bed, she was intoxicated; I was up in her room, a silk handkerchief, and a duplicate for a table-cloth and silk petticoat dropped from her person. She said she took the handkerchief to dust the drawing-room - I had left it in the kitchen. I gave my daughter the duplicate, this was on the Saturday, and on the Monday I went to the pawnbroker's, and found they were mine, and had been taken from my wardrobe. I had told the prisoner on the Saturday that she must be very clean in my service, and I believe she was distressed, which might induce her to do it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. In what language did you desire her to be clean - A. I said she must be clean in her person, as single gentlemen were very particular, and she being an Irish girl, whom I knew were not particular. I never suggested that she should be smart and wear frills. She acknowledged to the officer that she had robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do your daughters dress smart - A. They are children, one is fourteen years old, and the other fifteen.</p>
               <p>Q. Do single gentlemen stay for a night or so - A. Mine generally stop weeks and months.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know one Samels - A. The last time I saw him was on the steps of the Sessions-house at Clerkenwell. He was never employed by me in this business, or any other; I first knew him by seeing him at Mr. Martin's, a paper-hangers, in the Strand. I never authorized him to say I would prefer no bill if I received 8 l. The bill was taken out on the last day of the Sessions; we went there three times.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Sunday morning, between eleven and twelve o'clock, Mrs. Gale came to me, and I took the prisoner in charge at her house. She admitted pawning the things, and said she had torn the duplicate that they should not find it.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When Mrs. Gale hired me she ordered me to have dinner ready by the time she came home. She keeps different houses of ill-fame, and went out at eleven o'clock to receive the money from them, returned at half-past five, very much in liquor, and found fault with me and the other servant for not getting the work done. She went out again, returned at half-past eleven o'clock, used very improper words and swore. On Saturday she said gentlemen and ladies resorted there, and I must have better clothes, or not continue with her. I said I had been a year and a half out of place, and what few things I had were in pawn. She said, so help her God, I should not remain in her place any longer, as I had bad shoes. I said I should have another pair at night, and would keep myself as clean as possible. She said she did not particularly wish me to have good clothes, but to go dressy, or she should loose the custom of her house, as it depended on the servant. Herself, her daughters, and servants, were in the habit of seeing gentlemen, that she saw one gentleman three times a week, and ordered me to have wax candles up ready. When she went out, I took and pawned these things, and redeemed some of my own to appear decent. She has detained my box which has three yards of ribbon, and twenty-four duplicates. A respectable servant will not live with her.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's sister-in-law. I saw the prosecutrix with Samels at a public-house, by the Sessions-house, Clerkenwell - they met us there. Samels said, in her hearing, that if I would bring the jink with me, the bill would be done away with, and it should all be settled; and if I did not bring 8 l., my sister would be prosecuted. I said, it was a deal of money; that my husband was only a labourer, and asked what it was for, as I feared I might be doing wrong. I asked it he was a constable; he said, No, he was a higher post. I was to meet him next morning, at the Plough, at Whitechapel, with the money, (this was Wednesday). I met him there. Mrs. Gale was not present. I saw her on Friday, at the same public-house; Samels was with her, he asked if I had brought the jink. I said, No, it was a deal of money. He said, well then, Mrs. Gale must go and take out the bill immediately; and asked her if she would, she said, what he said she would apply to. I said 8 l. was a deal of money, he said,</p>
               <p>"Why Mrs. Gale's money is 5 l." Mrs. Gale wished us good day, and left. He said, what he said was law with her, he could do any thing with her. I went to borrow the money - thought I was doing wrong. I enquired at the prison, and happened to meet the Reverend Mr. Cotton. He took me to Mr. Sheriff Williams, who advised me not to pay the money.</p>
               <p>COURT. - Q. The proposal was first made on Wednesday? - A. Yes, I am sure Mrs. Gale heard the proposal, but on Friday, they would let nobody hear what passed; she said what he said she would apply to. I told her, I expected, that if I paid it, she would receive it with her own hands, and give me a receipt for it, that I might have no trouble hereafter. I live in Alfred-street, Poplar.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's sister. I heard the last witness examined. Her statement is correct.</p>
               <p>COURT. - Q. Did you hear this man propose to do away with the indictment for 8 l. - A. Yes, at the bottom of Clerkenwell, in the street, which leads to Mutton-hill. Mrs. Gale was not in hearing; at first he talked to us about half an hour, then he fetched her. He took us into a public-house. Mrs. Gale took a drop of brandy. I believe this was on a Thursday, it was the first day that we met him. He asked Mrs. Gale what she would do, she curtsied and said, what he said she would apply to. I saw them together on the next day, (Friday). He would let nobody but my sister-in-law hear what passed then. He proposed to have a private room, but could not get one; he came and staid outside in the street. I went out and heard him say if the 8 l. was brought up to-morrow morning, it would make it up, and prevent the bill coming into Court, and pay Mrs. Gale and the officers.</p>

               <p>Q.- I thought he would not let you hear. - A. No, not at first, but my sister-in-law asked if I might; he said on the first day, that he should have to give the officers 3 l. for taking my sister, and 3 l. for Mrs. Gale, and 2 l. for his trouble; as we were poor people, he would charge no more. I said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Gale, if the money cannot be made up, I hope you will punish my sister as little as possible;" she said she would do whatever Samels wished - he said, if it was not made up, she must take the bill out immediately.</p>

             re-examined. - Q. Do you know of any delay, in taking out the bill. - A. We were sworn on the Wednesday. Samels said he did not think it worth while to put in the bill that day, as we should not get it out, he wanted to put it off till Saturday. I said, I could not come then, we agreed to meet on Friday, at eleven o'clock. On Wednesday, Samels and Mrs. Gale went away together. On Friday I went, and understood they had put it off, and attended on Saturday; the bill was put in on Saturday, about eleven o'clock. Samels would not let the officer take the bill, he gave it to Mrs. Gale.</p>

Furzeman applied to me to assist in detecting the prisoner, and on Saturday morning, the 21st of January, I went to deal with her - one Williams introduced me to her, at No. 39, Charles'-street, Drury-lane, on the first floor. Ellis had given me a half-crown. I saw two bad shillings on the mantle-piece - Williams said,</p>
               <p>"This is a friend of mine; you may trust him, the same as me." She said, if he was agreeable, it should be so, and put a new shilling from her pocket into my hand, and asked if they were not a very good die; I said they were; and asked the price - she said, they ought to be 4 1/2 d. each; but as I was a friend of Williams's, I should have them for 4 d. I agreed to take four, which she gave me, and I paid her for them. When she shewed them to me, they were not coloured; she took the poker out of the fire and coloured them; wrapped each in a peice of brown paper, and gave them to me. I left, and in the evening met Furzeman and Ellis, by appointment, at a house in Short's-gardens; I gave them the shillings - they marked them, and gave me three good marked shillings, and two sixpences to purchase more. I went to her at seven o'clock that night, alone - two children were in the room; they fetched her, and I asked if she could let me have more; she said,</p>
               <p>"Yes - how many?" I said twelve. She said she could only let me have six. She took them out of a paper which she had in her lap, and put them on the poker, and then gave me six. I gave her 1 s. and two sixpences for them. She said, she had had good success, and had passed seven that day. I sent the little boy for something to drink; and as he went out, the officers came in, and found six bad and two good marked shillings on me, and asked, who I bought the bad ones of; I said, of the prisoner. She was in great confusion, and put the paper under her person, as she sat on the chair.</p>

I gave him a good half-crown, not marked, and met him at five o'clock, he produced four counterfeit shillings, which we marked - I produce them. After searching him, I gave him three good shillings and two good sixpences all marked, and six penny-pieces to send the children out for gin, as a signal to us. At seven o'clock we went into the Coach and Horses, opposite the prisoner's house, and sent him over to purchase more. I saw a child come out, and went up into the room. I took Heath, and found on him six counterfeit shillings, wrapped in brown paper, and two of the good shillings, which I had given him; he said he had the bad shillings from her; she denied it, and made a howling noise. I saw Furzeman take from her pocket one shilling and two sixpences marked, and which I had given Heath. She drew her chair to the fire, and threw something under the grate; Furzeman picked it up - it was twelve bad sixpences and five bad shillings.</p>

The prisoner was there, and had this picture-frame behind him in a handkerchief. I asked what it was, he said he bought it of a man, who was dressed in black, in Holborn, for 15 s. I secured him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. - Q. Nobody claimed it at his first examination, and he was let go - A. Yes, on his father's recognizance. He came to claim it afterwards. I told the Magistrate I had found the owner.</p>

On the morning of the 3d of February, I was informed, two men in a boat had taken a spar, I went down and missed one from the raft. I went down in the Thames-police boat, and boarded a lighter in which were the prisoners and some chips, which corresponded with my timber. One of them said, they must have fallen on board from some vessel that was alongside. They appeared recently taken off the wood. We found an axe on board which corresponded with the chips, the notches in the edge of the axe corresponded. A bargeman came up and said, a waterman had picked up the spar, we sent a boat down and found it: it is above thirty feetlong. I should know it from a hundred. I have cut off one end of it to bring here. I cannot swear to the chips, but are the same quality of wood.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. - Q. How far was the lighter from your premises. - A.Three-quarters of a mile.</p>

             were visiting there; they gave me the articles stated in the indictment to be washed. On the 7th of February, I put them in a bundle on the pantry table, near the area-window. I was sitting in the kitchen about four o'clock in the afternoon, and heard the window slap down. I immediately ran into the pantry, and saw the prisoner turning from the window, and getting over the rails, and another standing by him. I ran out and pursued the prisoner a little distance. He then turned and met me (the other had the bundle). He said,</p>
               <p>"What is the matter." I tried to take hold of him, and said,</p>
               <p>"You know what is the matter." He ran away, the same way as his companion. I followed, calling, Stop thief! Some gentleman in the field stopped him, without my losing sight of him. The other threw the bundle down.</p>

            . On Wednesday, the 14th of February, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was in Portland-road. I went down Norton-street, and saw the prisoner with two others; I passed them, and returned, took the prisoner, and Davis took the others; in the prisoner's hat I found this veil, and in his pocket a latch-key, which opens the prosecutor's door. He said the veil belonged to a young woman,</p>

I asked him if he had taken any iron from the premises; he said he had, and had taken it to Wapping dock-stairs; that he and the female prisoner (who he called Homan's wife) carried it from the boat to a house there. I took him there, and he pointed out a house in King Edward-street, where he said he left it (it is Kean's house). I found the iron there.</p>

            . I am foreman to the prosecutors. The iron is their property. I have known Dove some time, Pike is his brother-in-law.

            . I live with Mrs. Ruddell, in Tottenham-court-road. I was going to my place - I had left my box in the country, and wrote for it to be left at the White Horse-cellar, till called for. On the 12th of February. I called a chariot to drive up to the White Horse-cellar - the prisoner drove it; I got in with my trunk, and told him to drive to my lodgings in <placeName id="t18210214-116-crimeloc724">Castle-court, Oxford-market</placeName>

I got out, and was not four minutes going up with my band-box - when I came down, he had drove off with the trunk. I went to the stand in Piccadilly, and told the waterman of it; and next day he gave us information. I have lost all my clothes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. What time was this - A. About twenty minutes past eight o'clock.</p>

            . I am a waterman. This chariot was on my stand in Piccadilly twice on this night - two man were with it. I do not know the number. Another man, besides the prisoner, then got on the box: in about half an hour, the same chariot came into the ranks with the two men; one got down - he had a drab coat and top boots on; and when the chariot was called, he led the horses to the White Horse-cellar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. One Tuxford drove - A. He led the horses down. I know nothing of the prisoner - I did not see him there. I cannot say he is, or is not the man; but if he was there, I did not see him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does not the prisoner drive a chariot - A. Yes; a yellow bodied one. Whether he is one of the men I do not say.</p>

            . I am an officer. The waterman came to the office with the prosecutrix - he said, Tuxford pulled down the chariot, and Stevens was the driver. Next morning I enquired, and found Stevens drove to one Lukey, on the other side of the water. I went there, and found four brothers, named Stevens; and asked who drove the chariot that day - the master said, one of them had been asking him leave to go to Bow-street. I took the prisoner and his brother William; the prisoner's chariot was ready, and I took them both to Bow-street. The prisoner then drove me to Marlborough-street, as we could not find the prosecutrix; he then drove me to her lodgings, and found she was gone to Bow-street. I took them both there - the prosecutrix said the prisoner was the man; she had no hesitation about it.</p>

               <p>ROBERT BANKS. I am an auctioneer. On the 12th of February, about seven o'clock, I put an old gentleman in a chariot, in Leicester-square, to go to Titchfield-street. I cannot say that the prisoner drove: I know his family, but not him. The coachman said,</p>
               <p>"How do you do, Mr. Banks;" but it being dark, I will not say it was him; and an explanation has since been given, by which I recollect his family.</p>

About eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner drove him home in his chariot to Titchfield-street, Oxford-market; he was sometime getting out of the chariot, which made me notice the prisoner.

             re-examined. A man drew the chariot down. I do not know whether that was the prisoner, as I went into the office while the porter looked for the trunk; in the meantime, two men came to the horses' head, when the chariot came out, the other man left, and the prisoner asked the porter to assist him with the box. I am certain the prisoner drove me - he had a large blue top coat with capes.</p>

               <p>THOMAS DAY. On the 14th of February, I took a coach at Charing-cross, the prisoner drove it. I sat on the box with him; he drove me to Westminster-bridge, I ordered him to turn and drive to Chandos-street. I was not sober. We got down at the wine vaults at the corner; but before this, we were in the Ship, public-house, and I felt a hand in my breeches pocket. We went again to the Ship and stopped there. I called for two half-pints of pearl. I asked his demand, he said a guinea, but as I had been good to him, a 1 l. note would satisfy him. I took three 1 l. notes from my breeches pocket, which I deposited with the landlady; she gave the prisoner 1 l., and returned them to me: she put them into my breeches-pocket. I went into the tap-room; I again found his hands in my pocket; I felt, and told the landlord my money was missing, he felt, and it was gone; the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"it cannot be gone, let me feel." He took the two notes from his own pocket, and put them into mine, then took them out, and put them on the table; the landlord put them again into my pocket, and went to look for a friend to take me home, and during that time, the prisoner went away. The landlord returned, I told him my notes were gone. When I first went out, I had eight 1 l. notes, and 18 s., I changed two notes, and lost six. I felt his hand in my pocket twice.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. - Q. Did not you give him two notes. - A. No, nor did he give change for a note. I took the coach at nine o'clock, and kept it till half-past ten. I recollect very well what passed, after I got to Chandos-street.</p>
               <p>JOHN PARKER. On the 14th of February, about half-past ten o'clock, the prisoner drove to my door, (the <placeName id="t18210214-122-crimeloc753">Ship, in Chandos-street</placeName>

I advised him to go home, as he was rather tipsy; he asked the prisoner his demand; he said it ought to be a guinea, but a pound would do. Day gave my wife three notes; she gave the prisoner one, and returned the rest - he put them in his pocket. I went out and took the number of his coach, as I thought he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182102140048"/>charged more than he ought. When I returned, Day missed his notes: I also felt and missed them - the prisoner felt, and pretended to find them; he produced them; I put them into the prosecutor's pocket - he sent me for a friend - when I returned he missed them again.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you contribute towards the expences of this prosecution - A. No, not one farthing. Peart is a finisher in the morocco line.</p>
               <p>Q. You first complained of the prisoner when she found fault with you for frequenting the free-and-easy club - A. I never did; I believe she said so. I went once as I knew a person there. She never fetched me from the public-house - I seldom go there. I do not live with my father; I am in business for myself.

               <p>MR. ANDREWS. - Q. Has she conducted herself to you, as a truly good wife. - A. She has, I have had ten children; she has acted to them as a tender parent. She complained of the conduct of my eldest son; he has left me two years. This prosecution is not at my instance, my desire is to live with her all my life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence written. About twenty years ago, I married my first husband; all the time I lived with him, I experienced nothing but distress, trouble, and misery. In 1817, he left me. I was obliged to apply to the parish for relief, they issued a warrant against him; both the officers and I, used all diligence to find him, but could not. During the two years of his absence, it was reported that he was dead, which I believed, and in 1820, an altrecation took place between me and my second husband's son; I fetched him from the public-house, and told him of the impropriety of his conduct, in going to a free-and-easy club, and beating his father. It was then I became the victim of his vengeance; he got his father served with the copy of a writ, and then caused me to be prosecuted.</p>

I have had no conversation with him about this affair.</p>

               <p>"What do you want with him - it is my property;" that his master gave it him to make aprons of; that his master was Mr. King, a linen-draper over the water. The prosecutor is not here to swear to it - he has himself been convicted of a robbery this Sessions.</p>

On the 2d of February, I was at work at the border of my garden, where some Sweedish juniper-plants had been growing for three years, and a little after five o'clock in the evening as I left work I passed them again; my man observed to me what fine plants they were - there were twelve or fourteen of them. Next morning at eight o'clock I went to the same place, and missed them all, they had been plucked up, and taken away with a quantity of others. There were footmarks across the fresh mould, which had been dug the day before, clear from the hedge to where the junipers grew. Next day two officers came, and enquired if I had lost any plants; I said I had lost junipers; they took me to Mr. Lees, at Hammersmith, where I saw my plants - there were junipers, hollies, and arbavites, which were all mine. I have known the prisoner ten years, he is a gardener, and lived with Mr. White, just opposite my garden.</p>

On the 1st of February, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoners pass the window, they were large loose cloaks; they snatched at some handkerchiefs which hung at the door-post. I immediately went round the counter, and secured them two houses off. Williams then dropped a white handkerchief from under her child which was in her arms, and at the door a white handkerchief fell from one of them; I have not got the third handkerchief. I lost three, which were all pinned together. I gave them in charge.</p>

            . I live in Homer-street, New-road, and sell thread, tapes, and things. The prisoners Twine and Norman, came and asked me to buy a box; she said, they were in distress, and wanted 1 s. for it. I said I had not got one - they said they would leave it till to-morrow; I said, they had better sell it. I gave them 6 d. and said, they should have the rest in the morning. I found a pair of scissars in it after they left. Next morning they came for the money - I said, they had better take the box back and not bother me; they said, they wanted money for breakfast - I gave them 3 d., and they bought 3 d. worth of things, and said their sister gave them the box.</p>

               <p>JOHN DAWSON. I am the prosecutrix'e father. The prisoners all three came into the house, and asked for some coffee, which my wife sells to the working people. A parcel of boys came after them, and I ordered them out. Norman and Twine were near the fire-place - she said her petticoats were untied. Norman afterwards surrendered herself and said, they took the box to an old iron shop and got a key to it for 2 d., and sold it to Clendon. I went to her - she said, she had not seen the girls, or the box.</p>

On the 6th of February, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, one of the young ladies was called down; and as she stopped some time, I went to see what detained her, and found the prisoners in the shop. The young person said, she laid four cards of lace on the counter, and one was missing - they said, they had not taken it, and she must have made some mistake. I said, if they had it, they had better give it up, and go about their business - they refused and said, they were willing to be searched. I took them into the parlour, and found it on Houtching.</p>

             delivered the decision of the Twelve Judges on his case, as follows: -</p>
               <p>"In this case the prisoner was indicted for that he (stating the indictment) vide Sessions Paper, Bridges's Mayoralty, 1820. page 519. The prisoner was tried at the last September Session by Mr. Justice Best, in the presence of Mr. Justice Richardson, and myself. It appeared in evidence, that on the day laid in the indictment, the prisoner had applied to Messrs. Hoods, ironmongers, to supply him with a quantity of iron, for the use of Dover, the acceptor, and gave at the same time this bill to T. E. Hood, one of the partners, and from the nature of it, we take it as a fact, that he endorsed the bill to Mr. Hood, and gave it to him in payment for the iron. The prisoner received from Messrs. Hoods only 20 l. worth of iron, but was to have as much as came to the full amount of the bill. Charles<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182102140055"/>Dover, the acceptor, named in the bill, was called to prove that his name was forged. Messrs. Hoods had released Dover; still it was objected that Hoods had only an interest in the bill to the amount of 20 l., and that Dover could not be a competent witness without a release from the prisoner in respect of the residue of the value of the bill. The learned Judge thought that a release from the holder of the bill, completely discharged the acceptor, and Dover was examined, also T. E. Hood, and on their evidence the prisoner was convicted; and the learned Judge at first only reserved the question as to Dover's competency, but it afterwards very properly occurred to him, that doubts might be entertained as to the competency of Hood's evidence, and particularly as to the effect of the release on his testimony, and both points were reserved for the opinions of the Judges.</p>
               <p>As to Dover, I think I may say that the Judges were clearly, and unanimously of opinion, that the release, by the holder of the bill, was a complete discharge of the acceptor: Hood's having the full, legal right to dispose of the bill; and that their release was equivalent to an actual receipt of the money.</p>
               <p>But the question as to Hood's competency, was not so easily disposed of. Let us first consider how T. E. Hood stood affected, before he executed the release; and how he stood after. Before he executed the release, it is clear he had no interest to destroy the bill, by assisting to arrive at the proof, that it was forged. On the contrary, it was his interest to prove it a good bill; for if it was forged, he lost his 20 l. worth of iron; but if good, he was sure of being able to pay himself. But when he had executed the release, he stood in a different situation, in point of interest; for it may be very plausibly argued, that having taken upon himself to discharge the acceptor, he had made himself responsible to the prisoner for the residue of the bill, beyond the 20 l. worth of iron.</p>
               <p>It occurred to several of the judges, that being before the execution of the release, unexceptionable as a witness, he could not by a subsequent act of his own, deprive the King of the benefit of that testimony , which he owed to the interests of Justice; as in the case of a wager laid by an essential witness, after a party had acquired an interest in his testimony, but I believe all the Judges wished that there opinion, should not rest on a broader ground.</p>
               <p>Some Judges thought that this was not the case of a witness, who was called to extinguish, or destroy that instrument , which on the face of it, charged the witness himself . I am not sure , that this ground was generally adopted , for the his evidence, did not directly impugn the instrument, it formed a necessary step, together with his release, to enable another witness to do the same thing , but all the Judges concur in the opinion, which it is essential for the public to know, that under all the circumstances of the case, the witness was competent.</p>
               <p>In stating therefore, what I have further to say , I mean only to explain the grounds of my own opinion, taking to myself alone, the responsibility of error, if I have mistaken the grounds on which the Judges went. Before the witness opened his mouth to give testimony, he had incurred the whole responsibility, by executing the release, and that he had done under the assurance, and of his own persuasion, that the acceptance was a forgery, still it must be inferred, that the witness was more secure, by assisting to convict the prisoner. But supposing the prisoner to be acquitted, the verdict of acquittal, cannot help the prisoner in an action against the witness; for the prisoner must begin by proving that he gave the witness a valid bill, and this the witness is prepared to disprove. If the liability of the witness was the certain consequence of the acquittal, I should decide otherwise; as in an action againt the master for the negligence of the servant, the latter is incompetent, because the verdict against the master is a direct and certain charge against the servant, and is evidence to prove the whole damages which the master has sustained through the servant's default.</p>
               <p>In this case, the verdict is no evidence in an action or suit by the prisoner to call upon the witnesses for the residue of the value of the bill - such an attempt is therefore uncertain, improbable, and capable of being met by a clear disproof. But the witness is called to prove the utterance only, and if this objection were to hold the ends of justice, would nine times out of ten, and in a greater proportion be defeated? For in most instances, bills of exchange, or more commonly Bank notes are tendered to one person alone; and when a bill of this sort is with-held or impounded, the party does it at the risk of an action, such as this witness may be said to be exposed to. Every prosecution may be said to be at the risk of an action for a malicious prosecution; and in strikes me, that in order to incapaciate a witness, the verdict must either give to the witness a direct and certain benefit, or fix upon him a direct and certain loss. In this case, before the witness gave the release, he might have been satisfied to demonstration, that the acceptance was forged - as for instance by seeing or knowing the acceptor's hand-writing, his character for credit or veracity, rate of knowledge and education, so as to make it plain, that he would not have written two for to, or excepte instead of accepted; and being so prepared, he must not only stand indifferent as to any risk of being called upon to account for the bill; but must be able to set every such attempt at defiance.</p>
               <p>And therefore the Judges are unanimously of opinion, that notwithstanding the release given by Messrs. Hoods , that Mr. Hood is a perfectly competent witness in point of law, though there might be a bias in his mind, he may be said to be under no risk at all ; in consequence of his being prepared to prove the bill forged, and the prisoner must prove what is impossible , viz. - That it is a valid instrument .</p>
               <p>THE JUDGES are of opinion, that the conviction is LEGAL.</p>

                delivered the decision of the Twelve Judges on his case, as follows: -</p>
                  <p>"In this case the prisoner was indicted for that he (stating the indictment) vide Sessions Paper, Bridges's Mayoralty, 1820. page 519. The prisoner was tried at the last September Session by Mr. Justice Best, in the presence of Mr. Justice Richardson, and myself. It appeared in evidence, that on the day laid in the indictment, the prisoner had applied to Messrs. Hoods, ironmongers, to supply him with a quantity of iron, for the use of Dover, the acceptor, and gave at the same time this bill to T. E. Hood, one of the partners, and from the nature of it, we take it as a fact, that he endorsed the bill to Mr. Hood, and gave it to him in payment for the iron. The prisoner received from Messrs. Hoods only 20 l. worth of iron, but was to have as much as came to the full amount of the bill. Charles<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182102140055"/>Dover, the acceptor, named in the bill, was called to prove that his name was forged. Messrs. Hoods had released Dover; still it was objected that Hoods had only an interest in the bill to the amount of 20 l., and that Dover could not be a competent witness without a release from the prisoner in respect of the residue of the value of the bill. The learned Judge thought that a release from the holder of the bill, completely discharged the acceptor, and Dover was examined, also T. E. Hood, and on their evidence the prisoner was convicted; and the learned Judge at first only reserved the question as to Dover's competency, but it afterwards very properly occurred to him, that doubts might be entertained as to the competency of Hood's evidence, and particularly as to the effect of the release on his testimony, and both points were reserved for the opinions of the Judges.</p>
                  <p>As to Dover, I think I may say that the Judges were clearly, and unanimously of opinion, that the release, by the holder of the bill, was a complete discharge of the acceptor: Hood's having the full, legal right to dispose of the bill; and that their release was equivalent to an actual receipt of the money.</p>
                  <p>But the question as to Hood's competency, was not so easily disposed of. Let us first consider how T. E. Hood stood affected, before he executed the release; and how he stood after. Before he executed the release, it is clear he had no interest to destroy the bill, by assisting to arrive at the proof, that it was forged. On the contrary, it was his interest to prove it a good bill; for if it was forged, he lost his 20 l. worth of iron; but if good, he was sure of being able to pay himself. But when he had executed the release, he stood in a different situation, in point of interest; for it may be very plausibly argued, that having taken upon himself to discharge the acceptor, he had made himself responsible to the prisoner for the residue of the bill, beyond the 20 l. worth of iron.</p>
                  <p>It occurred to several of the judges, that being before the execution of the release, unexceptionable as a witness, he could not by a subsequent act of his own, deprive the King of the benefit of that testimony , which he owed to the interests of Justice; as in the case of a wager laid by an essential witness, after a party had acquired an interest in his testimony, but I believe all the Judges wished that there opinion, should not rest on a broader ground.</p>
                  <p>Some Judges thought that this was not the case of a witness, who was called to extinguish, or destroy that instrument , which on the face of it, charged the witness himself . I am not sure , that this ground was generally adopted , for the his evidence, did not directly impugn the instrument, it formed a necessary step, together with his release, to enable another witness to do the same thing , but all the Judges concur in the opinion, which it is essential for the public to know, that under all the circumstances of the case, the witness was competent.</p>
                  <p>In stating therefore, what I have further to say , I mean only to explain the grounds of my own opinion, taking to myself alone, the responsibility of error, if I have mistaken the grounds on which the Judges went. Before the witness opened his mouth to give testimony, he had incurred the whole responsibility, by executing the release, and that he had done under the assurance, and of his own persuasion, that the acceptance was a forgery, still it must be inferred, that the witness was more secure, by assisting to convict the prisoner. But supposing the prisoner to be acquitted, the verdict of acquittal, cannot help the prisoner in an action against the witness; for the prisoner must begin by proving that he gave the witness a valid bill, and this the witness is prepared to disprove. If the liability of the witness was the certain consequence of the acquittal, I should decide otherwise; as in an action againt the master for the negligence of the servant, the latter is incompetent, because the verdict against the master is a direct and certain charge against the servant, and is evidence to prove the whole damages which the master has sustained through the servant's default.</p>
                  <p>In this case, the verdict is no evidence in an action or suit by the prisoner to call upon the witnesses for the residue of the value of the bill - such an attempt is therefore uncertain, improbable, and capable of being met by a clear disproof. But the witness is called to prove the utterance only, and if this objection were to hold the ends of justice, would nine times out of ten, and in a greater proportion be defeated? For in most instances, bills of exchange, or more commonly Bank notes are tendered to one person alone; and when a bill of this sort is with-held or impounded, the party does it at the risk of an action, such as this witness may be said to be exposed to. Every prosecution may be said to be at the risk of an action for a malicious prosecution; and in strikes me, that in order to incapaciate a witness, the verdict must either give to the witness a direct and certain benefit, or fix upon him a direct and certain loss. In this case, before the witness gave the release, he might have been satisfied to demonstration, that the acceptance was forged - as for instance by seeing or knowing the acceptor's hand-writing, his character for credit or veracity, rate of knowledge and education, so as to make it plain, that he would not have written two for to, or excepte instead of accepted; and being so prepared, he must not only stand indifferent as to any risk of being called upon to account for the bill; but must be able to set every such attempt at defiance.</p>
                  <p>And therefore the Judges are unanimously of opinion, that notwithstanding the release given by Messrs. Hoods , that Mr. Hood is a perfectly competent witness in point of law, though there might be a bias in his mind, he may be said to be under no risk at all ; in consequence of his being prepared to prove the bill forged, and the prisoner must prove what is impossible , viz. - That it is a valid instrument .</p>
                  <p>THE JUDGES are of opinion, that the conviction is LEGAL.</p>
