When I first called about eleven o'clock, the prisoner desired I would go with him, and view a piece of ground, and a house in the neighbourhood that he was thinking of renting; I accompanied him to the ground, and the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in company with him - A. Perhaps two hours and a half; he looked at the house; he appeared very auxious to take it, he persisted in taking it; I thought it objectionable for many reasons; when I returned home with him, he requested I would go back again, taking a portuguese servant with me that understood the English language to speak with the landlord about taking the place; he at the door left me without any reason assigned, and went up stairs; I remained at the door some time; I went up stairs, and asked him if he was going; he said, no, I will not go now; I went away.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after, did you see any of the parties that lived in that house - A. About eight o'clock, Mr. Ricord and Mr. Green came running into the my house, very much agitated; Mr. Ricord required I would repair to his house, that Harriet and the prisoner had murdered each other; I went immediately to the house; I found the prisoner laying on the floor in a room in Mr. Ricord's house with his throat cut, and a wound in one of his temples.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she there - A. No. I remained there some time; I washed him, and dressed the wound, and had him removed into another room. In the room in which I first found him, the parlour, there was a paper which he had been writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your first going into the room, and you finding him on the floor, state what passed - A. Upon my enquiring for the female, he desired the paper might be handed to him, it was half a sheet of footscap paper, and pen and ink on the table; he wrote upon my enquiring, that she lay in the garden, at the back of the house, in the first lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to go and find that was a true description - A. Yes, I did, and found the body, she lay on her side in the front of the seat where she had been sitting, as it appeared; I saw a ball had passed through one temple and out of the other; I caused the prisoner to be washed, and placed upon a sofa in the drawing-room; about eleven o'clock Dr. Donnally came to dress him; I remained till two o'clock in the morning; the doctor dressed the wound; nothing material passed that evening. On the next morning I called again at eleven o'clock, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181504050005"/>found him in bed; there were several gentlemen of the department of the prisoner in the house; we judged it adviseable that he should give an account of the transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner was that communicated to him - A. I wrote it from my own and joint sentiments.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you write it by the prisoner's dictation - A. No; I wrote it from certain facts and accounts that I collected from him, and the general reports in the house, and from what I saw after I had written it. I went into the room with it to Mr. Sawyer; I stated to him, that it was agreed by all the gentlemen, that he should state or avow the particulars of this unfortunate circumstance, and then read over this paper to him; he asserted to the truth of this paper; I read it distinctly over to him; he asserted to the truth of this paper, by writing and by words, he signed it, Dr. Donnelly witnessed it,

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A severe wound in my throat renders me incapable of distinctly articulating; I have therefore reduced to writing a few observations; no man could feel a greater regard for the young woman; never for a moment had I a thought of killing her; I have but a confused recollection of this melancholy event; I very much regret the absence of Mr. Ricord, he would have been a most important witness in my behalf, as he alone is acquainted with all the circumstances of this case; the gentlemen who conducts this prosecution, have done every thing in their power to obtain his presence; I understand their applications have been ineffectual; I express my acknowledgement for the endeavours they have used, I leave my case to your lordship and the gentlemen of the jury.</p>

            . I live in Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Q. In May, 1813, had you a black mare in your possession - A. I had; that I was disposed to part with.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 21st or 23rd of May, did the prisoner call upon you - A. It was on Saturday, the 22nd, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. You were called upon by the prisoner - A. I was; he said, his groom said, I had a horse to dispose off, which his groom represented likely to suit him, as he was very anxious of putting his little niece that he had, upon a safe animal, that he had ten or eleven horses always, that he would profer buying one of me than a dealer; he then gave me his card of address, which I had previously learned from the person that came before was in Park-lane; the card was in writing; his address was in Park-lane, the next door to my Lord Petre's. He requested I would give my servant leave to bring the animal the next morning to his house to try her in order that he might ascertain her paces in the opposite riding house; I did so, but I did not give the servant any caution not to leave it if in the event it should not be convenient to him to try her at that moment; I think he asked the price, but the groom had asked the price before; the price announced was twenty-six guineas. I accordingly sent my servant the next morning at the hour appointed, ten o'clock on Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181504050006"/>Q. Did you in any way commission or instruct your servant to sell the horse - A. No, decidedly not; it was sent there to be tried in the riding house, and for no other purpose; the servant was sent with the horse to let it be tried, and nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. After the horse had gone there, did you see it again - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive these papers on the Monday - A. They were left at my house on the Monday morning early.</p>
               <p>Q. The horse was sent for trial on Sunday morning - A. On the Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. After receiving the note in the letter, did you go to the house in Park-lane - A. Immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner there - A. No, nobody was to be found there, but the creditors. On Monday my servant who had delivered the horse at Park-lane, took me there; I went on receiving that letter immediately; that letter opened my eyes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go immediately with your servant who delivered it - A. I did; we found nobody in the house, there was a servant left in the house; we found nobody but the servant; I found a person there; the prisoner I did not find; I have never seen him since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. When the price was mentioned on Saturday it was agreed to - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You stated the price, it was settled - A. Yes, certainly, on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Q. Was there any sale affected for the price mentioned - A. There was no sale certainly; our conversation was then in that sort of a way, believing I was talking to a gentleman, I sent the horse for trial, which would lead to a sale in all probability.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If the price had been paid to your groom, you would have taken no further steps - A. Certainly not; I do not recollect that ever I told the groom what the price was. I should not have considered it a robbery if he had sent back the money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Q. You sent your horse with a bridle - A. Yes; I received the bridle back four or five days afterwards, after I received the first letter, another letter accompanied it, and a brown paper parcel.</p>

               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Q. Who took it away - A. Mr. Naylor, he took it away himself, he led it away with the bridle; I thought it singular the horse having no saddle; I watched him; he led it up into Upper Brook-street, Park-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see that poney again - A. I never<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181504050007"/>saw saw it before or since to my knowledge; nor I never saw Mr. Naylor before or since to my knowledge; he told me he would send another horse that afternoon.

               <p>Q. Were you at home on the 6th of March - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the evening on which your attention was called - A. Yes; after having lit up the shop, I went into the parlour to tea, I went back into the little parlour, which is detached from the shop; after having had my tea I came out again into the shop; I looked round the shop; I found a great draft; I looked up, and found a window down; when I was in the parlour I left the windows closely shut, I had observed it.</p>
               <p>Q. How were they secured - A. By pulleys, that pull them down; I had suspicion that I had been robbed; I looked round the shelves; I found two or three hats gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the evening do you suppose it was - A. About half past seven; I am sure it was half past seven, it was nearer eight than seven; it was quite dark; no remains of day-light left.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no other fastenings - A. No, only the shutters; we do not shut up before nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How high was this window - A. About nine or ten feet from the ground, or more, it is about eighteen feet to the top of the window. I saw the prisoner get upon the top of the brick wall; it was the upper sash that was pulled down; I perceived that two or three hats were gone; I then went out of the passage door to this window, to see if I could observe any person thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. You went round to this window - A. Yes; after being there about a minute, I saw the prisoner come out of a very dark court, where there was no thoroughfare; he appeared to me to be waiting for an opportunity to get at this window again; I then suspected that he might be the man that opened the window; I did not think it proper it being a dark street to attack the man by myself; I went to an opposite neighbour, and asked him to assist me; I got my neighbour to assist me; my neighbour and I went round, and in about two minutes, he made a dash on the top of this brick work, he jumped upon the brick work at the corner of my house, which is built to keep off nuisances; he threw his head and shoulders into the window, and took another hat; I saw him do that; they were within his reach by putting his head and shoulders in and half his body; then me and my neighbour secured him, with the hat in his hand; we took him to the watchhouse; I there saw him searched; we found upon him the papers containing the former hats, the papers and string that tied them up.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know it to be the paper and string that tied them up - A. By the marks; they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181504050008"/>were the shape of a hat as it lay upon the shelf; I knew it by the marks, and by the appearance; I knew the hats that were gone.</p>

            . I am the neighbour to the last witness. Mr. Joseph called to me for assistance on the 6th of March, between seven and eight in the evening; I went into the street with Mr. Joseph, he pointed out the prisoner to me. I saw the prisoner stand upon this brick work at the window; I saw nearly half his body in the window, he was half hanging over the sash; Mr. Joseph said, this is him; I ran, and seized him with the hat in his hand; he made a blow at me with the hat; he was taken to the watchhouse immediately, and the hat was delivered to the beadle.</p>

            . I am beadle of St. Ann's parish. On the 6th of March last, I was sent for to the watchhouse to take care of the prisoner, and to search him; I felt in his pockets; I took out this paper; Mr. Joseph said they were the papers of the other two hats that were lost. This hat was in the watchhouse; Mr. Joseph gave me the hat; I have had it in my possession ever since.</p>

             I am a constable. On Monday morning the 20th of March, I went to Mr. Dines's, I went to the Attic story, I found Mr. Dines and the prisoner there, Mr. Dines said, these articles that lay here in the first parcel, they were then laying on the floor, he told me that he gave me that property and the prisoner into custody; he said he found the laees in the prisoner's box. I searched the prisoner, in her pocket, I found nineteen lengths; I likewise found in her pocket this small key, on trying it, it fitted a piece of musick, that Mr. Dines had in his room, I took the prisoner and the lace into custody, the key I found upon her opened the table drawer I enquired in what room she laid the night proceeding, he said in the kitchen, in one of the beds, the feathers began to issue out, Mr. Dines said, here is a creek here, we began feeling about the bed, I found four pair of silk stockings about the feathers in the bed, and likewise this bugle lace wrapped up in paper, and this paper of pins.</p>
               <p>Q. To Dines. Look at that property - A. The stockings have got my mark upon them; the sattin had been used by the work people, a bonnet had been made by the work people; they cut it off with a slope, the prisoner cut it off with a slope to prevent detection. I compared the sattin before the officer, it tallied exactly, I can swear to the whole of the articles produced.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your house situated - A. In the parish of St. Andrew's Holborn.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the house of Abbey and Cook, wholesale tea dealers. On Wednesday, the 8th of March, as I was walking along Pancras-lane, about half past nine o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner in company with another lad, they were a short distance before me; one of them made a sign by which one went on one side of the way, and the other on the other side of the way, when the person that took the goods he came to the warehouse, he made a sign sufficient for the other to know that that was the place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner make the sign - A. No; the one that took the goods when they got to the house of Joshua Noble.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mr. Noble - A. He <rs id="t18150405-11-viclabel60" type="occupation">keeps a manchester warehouse</rs>

The man that took the goods made a sign to the other, that, that was the house; he walked on three or four steps, returned, and went immediately in, which the prisoner observed, went across to the door where the other had gone in, he looked in, opened his coat ready to receive something when the other came out, and popped it under his coat; then they went down Size-lane. I went into the warehouse, and informed the prosecutor that he had been robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body in the warehouse - A. There was a person in the warehouse; he locked the doors and went in search of him; I went with him; I saw which way he went, he went towards the right to Queen-street, and I fearing he might miss him, I went to the left; the person from the warehouse overtook the prisoner, and took him with the property. The prisoner was the man that received the goods at the door, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am warehouseman at Mr. Noble's; he keeps a manchester warehouse; he has no partners. Mr. Place called at the warehouse, and informed me the warehouse had been robbed by two boys, one of the boys had a loose coat on, and the other with a close body coat; one handed the goods out of the warehouse, and the other received it them; according as he described the persons, I pursued down Size-lane, into Queen-street, and at the top of Queen-street in Chepside, I saw the prisoner with a bundle under his left arm; I seized him, and found two pieces of printed shawls; I took him into custody, and delivered him up to an officer; what became of the other man I cannot say; he must get into the passage to go into the warehouse; the warehouse belongs to Mr. Noble; the upper part of the house belongs to another person; Mrs. Palmer is landlady to Mr. Noble; she rents the house.</p>

I cannot tell that they are; the shawls were wrapped up in this hessian when I found them; the shawls were loose in the warehouse piled up in a heep; there is no private mark to them; they are the exact patterns that Mr. Noble had.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt - A. I have a doubt; I cannot swear positively; there are other goods in the market of the same pattern.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost such goods, did not you - 
               <persName id="t18150405-11-person156">A. </persName>
            They are of the same pattern and the same quality of cloth as were left behind; the mark on them is fifty-eight shawls in two pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. To Place. Did you see what was taken out of the warehouse - A. I saw a blue parcel done up in a square form; I saw the prisoner take two pieces of goods of that colour.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming along Queen-street about nine o'clock in the morning, a young man of genteel appearance asked me which way I was going; I said towards Cripplegate; he asked me to carry these parcels for him; at the corner of Queen-street this young man tapped me on the shoulder, and asked me what I had got; I looked round for the other young man, he was absent.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. John Frederick Robinson; he lives in Old Burlington-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at home on Tuesday, the 7th of March - A. Yes; on the evening of that day there was a great assembly in the street; I could not see them; I could hear a great mob in the street, about half past eight or nine in the evening, as near as I can say.</p>
               <p>Q. What prevented you from seeing what passed in the street - A. I could not get at the windows to see.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any expressions made use of by the people in the street - A. I heard the mob say, if they could get in, they would murder every servant in the house; this was after the mob had been some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the house for its protection - A. Six private soldiers and a corporal, besides me and my fellow servants, The mob began attacking the house in pulling down all the pallisadoes on Monday night, and on Tuesday morning a door was broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. On Monday night or Tuesday morning, were the soldiers sent for - A. On the Tuesday; on the Monday the mob was there; on Tuesday they forced open the door of the house, and threatened to murder every servant if they did not tell were their master was, they would murder us; they forced open the door, and took away a chair, table, and other fixtures of the hall; they threw a large ball at me, saying they would murder me if I did not tell where master was; they forced the railing down on Monday night.</p>

               <p>Q. Were these outrages the occasion of sending for the soldiers - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard the mob threating - A. Yes, and I heard the corporal address the mob,</p>
               <p>"that if they would not be quiet, they must take the consequence of it."</p>
               <p>Q. The corporal is

            , is it not - A. Yes. I heard the people say they would pull the house down if they could not murder us all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear them say any thing about the soldiers firing - A. I heard them say the soldiers dare not fire, any thing but powder.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any firing take place, and how soon - A. There was firing took place; they fired blank cartridges, as they told me, when they forced open the windows that were nailed up; that firing was from the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any pistols taken possession off - A. My fellow servant, the butler, he had a pistol; I saw him go to the window, and discharge it. The mob were coming in very rapid at the time; he drew back, and told me he had discharged the pistol in the direction of the area door; he told me he thought he heard them breaking in below; I, myself, thought I heard the same. I heard the reports of several guns firing, and the mob attacking the door: after the discharge of the pistol, they did break open the door; they threatened they would if they could. The pistol was loaded again; I saw it loaded, it was loaded with shot; me and my fellow servant loaded it together; one of the soldiers as the mob were so very rapid, took the pistol from my fellow servant, Ripley's hand, he took it, and discharged it; one of the soldiers asked me for shot; I gave it him; it was the same soldier that took the pistol from my fellow servants hand, his name is Mathews; at the time that he discharged, there were several pieces discharged, and after they were discharged, I heard say, there was some body killed or wounded; that was the last firing.</p>
               <p>Q. Were was it you got the pistol and the shot - A. The pistol from Lord Buckingham's servant; Ripley, my fellow servant, sent me for it; as we had nothing but one pistol to protect ourselves; he said we were left open to the street.</p>
               <p>Q. During this time you had no opportunity of seeing the mob so as to know their numbers, or to know their persons - A. No, I could not; I heard some of the soldiers say they hoped some body was gone for the horse soldiers; if not, they should not be able to protect my master's house, and their lives; I know the pistol I brought from Lord Buckingham's servant was loaded when I brought it; that charge was drawed, and some of the shot fell on the ground in drawing it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. Q. What hour was it when the mob first attacked your house - A. About half past eight, or nearer nine; I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master was at that time attending his duty in Parliament - A. He was away from home, and I believe him to be there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it upon the first attack that the mob tore up the iron rails and used them as instruments to break into the house - A. Yes, and they did get in at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. You spoke of some of them throwing a large ball at you - A. The ball was from a large lamp in the hall, it has two large weight to pull it up and down; they threw that weight at me, and threatened they would destroy me if I did not tell were my master was. On Monday and Tuesday I was confined at home very much for the protection of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know whether you saw chalked on the wall an exhibition of your master upon a gibbet - A. Yes; I had seen that in different parts of the town; I saw it on that very Monday, I saw it on dead walls, and I have heard there was chalked up a reward of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181504050013"/>five hundred pounds for Mr. Robinson's head.</p>
               <p>Q. After the attack on the evening of Monday, was the attack renewed again on Monday night, or Tuesday morning - A. The mob returned on the Monday night about eleven; on the first attack about nine, they succeeded in tearing up the pallisadoes; they carried out the furniture, and broke it in the street; there was a carpenter in the house, he nailed up the shutters; we made the house as secure as we could; they broke the fastenings by throwing brick bats in. When they returned on Monday night between eleven and twelve, they threw in iron bats then, and brick bats, and broke the fastenings of the house, and other materials were thrown in that had been torn up in front, and drove us completely back. They came again on the Tuesday; in the mean time the house had been put in a state of security as well as we could by a carpenter. When they came again on the Tuesday, on a third attack, they attacked it with the same violence as on former occasions; on Tuesday morning near nine, they tore open the shutters again, they succeeded in breaking the fastenings, and driving us backwards; afterwards the mob dispersed. They had taken a large figure for a lamp; we could not prevent them from taking the figure, had we attempted to prevent them our lives I believe would have been sacrified; I believed so then, and I state it now. They broke this figure into fragments in the street, and then used it to break the windows at the upper part of the house, as high up as possible; at the time I heard the mob withdraw, I thought I heard somebody call out, the horse soldiers were coming; their retreat was occasioned by supposing that the cavalry was coming upon them; when they found the horse soldiers were not coming, in spite of all the resistance we could make, they broke into the house again. They came into the house very rapid; I was driven back with brick bats, and iron bars; they faced the inner door, and attempted to break into the parlour, where the furniture had been stowed away for safety; they did not succeed in breaking open the parlour door; while they were breaking open the parlour door, the cavalry came upon them; they retired using very bad expressions, and saying that they would have my master's head before night; they retired, and we got a carpenter, he put the house into as good a state of security as he could. They renewed the attack on Tuesday, between eight and nine in the evening, in the mean time, the foot soldiers had been introduced into the house for its protection.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the attack on Tuesday evening - A. A violent attack was made at the shutters that had been fastened up, with brick bats and iron bars being thrown at them, which burst them open, and fell into the room; the soldiers fired several times; nobody was hurt as I heard; the soldiers fired blank cartridges; the mob shouted, and said, the soldiers dare not fire any thing but blank powder; the corporal then warned them that they had ball cartridges if they did not disperse, they must take the consequence.</p>
               <p>Q. If the soldiers had been disposed to fire wanted only to destroy life, were they not able to fire ball cartridges - A. I heard them say ball cartridges; I think they fired to protect my master's property, and to save our lives, they were protecting my master's property. From the mobs declarations I apprehendded the greatest danger to our lives; I do not believe we should have been safe, if the soldiers had not fired more than blank cartridges; I thought so then, and I think so now.</p>

Yes, about eight o'clock; the attack was made upon the house, by the people in the street, between eight and nine, the mob attacked the house by throwing stones and brick bats; after they broke through a little; a soldier was placed to prevent their coming in; the stones and brick bats, broke open the shutters; the mob kept on throwing stones and brick bats for half an hour before any fire arms were used; I saw the soldiers fire, but I cannot swear who it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what they fired with first - A. No, I could not tell; I heard the soldiers say they fired with blank cartridges; the soldiers told the mob if they did not disperse, they must fire with something else, the mob kept violently throwing brick bats and stones, which forced open the shutters several times. The soldiers fired again, but what with I cannot tell; when the last firing took place, I was in the dining room backwards.</p>

            Your residence is in Old Burlington-street - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On Monday, the 6th March, were you under any apprehension of any attack from the mob - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you learn that any attack had been made - A. I believe it was between nine and ten, when I was at the House of Commons, I was then informed of the particular circumstance attending the attack; I then wrote from the House of Commons to the Secretary of State, informing him that my house had been attacked by a mob; I requested<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181504050014"/>that he would send protection.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether any military had been sent before he received your letter - A. I believe there might.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see what they had done that night - A. No, I did not. On the next morning I think between ten and eleven, the footman, Sutton, came to me; in consequence of the information I received from him, I wrote to Lord Sidmouth, requesting that whatever protection was sent to my house might be there permament, as I understood that some of the soldiers who had been sent there on the Monday night, in consequence of the first attack had withdrew from the house at an early hour on the Tuesday morning, and that the house had been subsequently entered by the mob; which I received the intelligence by my footman. I should think, in an hour I went down to the Secretary of State myself, to represent the danger which I received, to present the state of the case as it reached me. I understood that protection had been sent to my house, I requested into the course of that morning; I told the footman, and I believe the butler also, that it should be taken care; that they should have some thing to eat and to drink.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Have you seen the state of the your house - A. I saw it some days ago, after it had happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the state of the house when you saw it - A. At the time that I went into the house all the windows almost in every floor were broken to pieces; it was manifest to me at last, that great violence had been used against the windows and the doors of the dining-room, and the wall in front of the house was also down; in the hall and in the passage near the foot of the stairs, there were marks of stones, brick bats, or things of that kind, having been struck with violence against the walls; on one door, which is a very old one, one which communicates between the dining-room and a room backwards, there were similar marks of violence, and on the pannel of that door, there was the mark of some sharp instrument having been forced through it; a window also on the stair case about half way up was also broken backwards, and a figure which had stood in that window had disappeared, and some pieces of furniture which were in the hall, chairs, tables, and a lamp that hung there also disappeared, and I saw some fragments of broken chairs. This was some days after the affair had happened; and the doors and windows were very strongly barricaded in order to prevent a renewel of a successful attack.</p>

            . Q. Where do you live - A. No. 2, Duke's-court, Duke's-street, St. James's.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in Old Burlington-street on the evening of Tuesday, the 7th of March last - A. Yes, I entered the street about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the occasion of your going there - A. Merely to look at the houses which had been injured, on the Monday evening, first I went into the the Square; they said it was Lord Darnley's House. Then I came down Bruton-street, and looked at a house there, which they said was Mr. York's; I then came into Old Burlington-street, and went in it at the end of Clifford-street, in Old Burlington-street; I went, and stood up at a step of a door almost opposite Mr. Robinson's house.</p>
               <p>Q. What number of people were assembled in the street at that time - A. The Horse Guards were riding up and down the street; they did not remain long in the street after I went there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any other person on the step where you stood - A. The deceased was standing on the same step with me; the door was open, and the servants of the house where standing at the door; Mr. Robinson's door was almost opposite of the step where we stood; I had a conversation with the deceased; I never saw her before.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the subject of that conversation - A. We were merely saying it was a pity that they pulled the houses to pieces, for we should all have to pay for it; I said, it was a pity that people should let their children out, because I heard it was done by boys; it was done concerning the Corn Bill. I heard stones throwing several times, and I saw the shutters open a small space a great many times, when the stones or bricks were thrown, they said it was done by boys; I did not see them myself. The deceased and I left the steps, and walked up and down the street towards Clifford-street; there was a small quantity of people in the street, there was not an hundred, I do not think there were more than fifty, if there were fifty, they seemed to be walking to and fro; I was at the end of Clifford street when they fired.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that they fired was the deceased with you - A. She took hold of my arm as we stood at the step of the door, and never loosed it until she fell from the firing of the gun.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you walk in the street together - A. A short time, we came and stood upon the step again, where the servants were standing at the door; after that, I was proceeding to go home, the deceased said, she would walk to the top of the street with me, and with that we left the step of the door we were walking up the street as the gun was fired; we were at the fourth door from where we were standing, as she fell from my arm, at the firing of the gun, we were walking to go home about four doors from the step where I had stood, one of the guns fired, and she fell to all appearance dead; the Horse Guards came up almost immediately; I did not know what to do with her. The Horse Guards said it was best to bear the body away: I found myself in a aukward situation, I was covered with blood from a wound in my face; the deceased was carried to a chemist's shop, in Bond-street, and from there to St. George's Hospital; I never left her.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the street were the persons collected together - A There seemed to be no one but what was passing and repassing before the doors they seemed to be chiefly on the pavement by what I could see.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any person say any thing about the Corn Bill - A. No. I heard a riot, and that some person was taken into custody, that throwed a stone.</p>

I heard a great many brick-batts and stones thrown into the house above. I heard them coming into the house all the time; I was below. Immediately I came up stairs the Life-Guards came up directly; the officer of the Life Guards ordered us to fall into the street, and after that we were ordered into the house, and there to remain until the morning. I had twenty-one rounds of ammunition myself; when I came up stairs the shutters were open, and large stones and brick laying about the floor; it must have been a large man to have thrown them. I returned all my ammunition.</p>

               <p>Q. When you got there how many people did you see there opposite of Mr. Robinson's house - A. When I first entered the street there were about fifty; they were in a body near Clifford-street, at the end of Burlington-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How many did there appear to be directly opposite to Mr. Robinson's house - A. When I first came to the door there did not seem any body at all, only people passing and repassing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any conversation between the soldiers and the people - A. Not at that time; afterwards I did. Between the first time of my going to Mr. Robinson's house and the second at the end of the street, there was a fire; with that I walked down to the end of the street; there was no mob then; I returned from the end of the street; I think it could not be above three or four minutes.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181504050016"/>when I got to the post of Mr. Robinson's house, that fire was considered as an alarm to disperse the people at the end of the street, it was considered, so I returned to the front of Mr. Robinson's house, at that time I made a stop, the people were coming both ways at that time, there were about a dozen people collected at the front, I made a stand; I looked down into the area, I saw a soldier stand at the right hand parlour window, and at his right hand there was a man with a black or blue coat; I saw the third person behind them, I saw a third person between them in the back parlour there was a light behind; I heard one of the men out of the twelve men standing in the front of the house this man out of the twelve was rather joking to them, he said they had no business to fire we heard the report five minutes before that he was saying it in a jocular way that he had no business to fire with ball, he had better to load his piece with bullocks blood, and something was said about eighty shillings, with that the soldiers said, you had better mind how you act, or what you are about, or you will find the contrary, or something to that effect; the moment the soldier spoke I considered he spoke in such a manner I thought myself in danger, I made off momently my brother had come along with me, I thought we were in danger. I took an oblique direction from the front of the house right oblique across the road. Before I got three parts of the way across the road, a stone, or a brick or something was thrown against the house; it hit against the wood, and the moment the stone reached the house there were three successive fires at one moment, I heard the report, I ran, and then this unfortunate woman fell before me, or rather inclined on my left side I stooped down and laid hold of the persons head; I saw she had received a wound on the right temple, there was a person with her, I held her for the space of a minute and a half, there was an immence quantity of blood, and I conceived brains, it must have been congealed blood, or else she could not have lived so long as she did. I was very much affected, at that time, my brother called me, he came and laid hold of me by the shoulder and pulled me away, I left her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. Your brothers object, and your object was the same - A. Yes, to see the havock the public had done to Mr. Robinson's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you happened in the course of your walk towards Burlington-street, observed any writings on the walls - A. Yes, many.</p>
               <p>Q. Among others perhaps fifty pounds for Mr. Robinson's head - A. I do not recollect any such thing I saw chalkings on the walls, his effagy exibited upon a gibbet against the Asylum wall.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see a copy of your deposition - A. Yesterday, it was not exactly correct. I gave that book to one of the constables in attendance, he lent it my brother.</p>

The people seemed to stand out of curiosity; there were some boys running in and out of the people tossing, they noisy and troublesome to the people standing about, the boys were not standing together as a mob, they were standing in little lots of three and four; the mob or assemblage, were composed of men and weman, some of whom had children in their arms; they were people that seemed to be assembled out of curiosity. I suppose, in about five minutes after I had been in the street, a stone was thrown from just behind where I stood, the stone hit the broken fragment of glass, it was not a large square of glass that was struck, it sounded as if it was a loose piece of glass at the top of a pane; it came tinkling down from the top of the house; I remained there a little while longer and a person said, there was a corporal and a file of men in the house; we went further on, and something was thrown of a soft heavy substance like clay, it hit the shutters, of one of the windows; as soon as that was thrown there was a musket discharged; I saw the flash, and I heard the report, and as soon as that musket was discharged we moved further on, and stood on the steps of a door way; on the report of the musket, the people went up the street, and some down the street, the boys hooted and hissed and were very noisy; several stones were thrown in succession, at no time did I hear stones throwed more than one at a time. There were no volley of stones; the mob returned again; I saw no peace officers there, except about ten o'clock there were two officers and horse soldiers opposite of Mr. Robinson's house they turned down Clifford-street; the throwing continued; there was a substance came against the boards or shutters as I before described, that had a dead sound like clay, as soon as that was thrown, there were four muskets discharged from the parlour window of Mr. Robinson's house, there were not discharged in a volley, but in succession sharp, one after the other, the instant they were discharged, the people begun to run.</p>

            's Defence, read.</p>
               <p>May it please your lordship and gentlemen of the jury; my counsel being prevented by the law from either observing on the evidence offerded against me or laying my defence before you, I am obliged to have recourse to this mode of defending myself against a charge of wilful murder. Considering the painful situation in which I stand; the discussion that our cause has undergone out of this court, and the various publications respecting it, which have lately been most industriously circulated through this town, I am sure you will pardon my requesting you to dismiss from your minds whatever you have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181504050018"/>read or heard of this transaction before you came in court, and that you will give your verdict on this evidence that you shall this day hear. Let me also entreat of you to separate our case from a subject that has lately been the topic of much discussion, and on which there has been a great difference of opinion.</p>
               <p>Neither I, nor my fellow prisoners, had nothing to do with the Corn Law. We were ordered to defend a house; the felonious distruction had been attempted; and we are brought here to answer with our lives, because we have faithfully discharged the trust committed to our care, and the duty imposed upon us.</p>
               <p>Our defence rests upon general principles; you, the Jury, and every member of the Community, have an equal interets with me, and my fellow prisoners, in supporting these principles; if these principles are broken in upon, or brought into doubt, the security of property is distroyed; and the peaceable and well disposed men of society, will be at all times at the mercy of a furious and inraged populace.</p>
               <p>The crime of murder, as the language of the record itself informs you, consists in killing a fellow creature with malice aforethought; I learn indeed besides, that direct malice against an individual, which is made out by direct proof, and is called express malice; the law in certain cases, presumes the existence of malice, and describs it by the term of implied malice; From express malice our cases must be entirely free; we could by no possibility have had any knowledge of malice against or disposition to injure either the unfortunate deceased or any other person that were before Mr. Robinson's house on the night when she unhapily met with her death; I think I can with equal clearness, shew you that there is no pretence for saying there exists any implied malice. The Law which I am about to state cannot but be familar to the Learned Judges, but I trust I shall be forgiven in shortly bringing it before their review for your information in the humble hope that it will receive your Lordships sanction, and desiring only that as it is sanctioned by them, it may be acted upon by you in the decission of our case.</p>
               <p>I submit that every man is justified in the use of fire arms in defence of his life, or protection of his own property, or that a fellow subject in whose assistance he is called against the commission of a felonious attack. It is not necessary to delay the use of arms until the felonious attack be actually made; it is only necessary to wait till the immediate intention to make such an attack be manifested by some open act. The principle of Law is bottomed on our nature, and is recognized in that sacred act which establishes the liberty of our Country.</p>
               <p>In the Bill of Rights it is expressly declared that the subject of this Country, may have arms for their defence suitable to their conditions. Lord Chief Justice Hale, one of the most learned and humane Judges that ever sat in Westminster Hall, says, if A had attempted a burglary upon the house of B with the intent to steal, or to kill him, or had attempted to burn the house, if B of any of his servants, or any within the house had shot and killed A, this had not been so much as felony nor had he forfeited ought for it; for his house is his castle of defence, and therefore he may justify assembling persons for the safe guard of his house.</p>

               <p>The case made out against us, if made out in fact, comes completely within the doctrine of Lord Hale, as the law stood with regard to the breaking of houses in his time. After the house had been broken in the manner in which it was, in the continuance of this riot; after the threats uttered against Mr. Robinson and his family, what could those who were in the house expect, but that if the populace succeeded in forcing admission, they would kill those whom they found in it, who had endeavoured to resist them? But since Lord Hale wrote, the law has made it a capital felony for any persons riotously and tumultuously assembled together, to demolish or pull down any dwelling house. Some writers have, with universal approbation, carried the doctrine of Lord Hale beyond the case of burglary. The only injurious breaking of a house known in his time to any felony committed against or in any house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Foster says, in the case of justifiable self-defence, the injured party may repel force by force, in defence of his person, habitation, or property, against any one who manifestly intendeth and endeavoureth, by violence or surprise, to commit a known felony on either. In these cases, he is not obliged to retreat, but may pursue his adversary till he findeth himself out of danger, and if in a conflict between them, he happeneth to kill, such killing is justifiable. The right of self-defence in these cases is founded in the law of nature, and is not nor can be suspended by any law of society, (Foster, 277.) The words now read to you, are those of that learned and excellent Judge Mr. Serjeant Hawkins, in his Pleas of the Crown, says, the owner of a house, or any of his servants or lodgers, may kill any one who attempts to burn it, or to commit murder, robbery, or any other felony, I Hawkins, c. 28, p. 21.</p>
               <p>It has been generally understood, that the great Lord Mansfield, in consequence of the riots which so long disgraced this metropolis in the year 1780, declared, that he was astonished that it could ever be doubted that soldiers called upon to preserve the public peace, and to protect the lives, houses, and property of his Majesty's subjects, did not stand precisely in the situation of any other individual, and had not a right to repress force by force, in the same manner, and to the same extent, as the owner might have done.</p>
               <p>Let me now, Gentlemen, intreat you to apply this law to the case you are now called upon to decide. For many days before the spirit of disorder broke out into acts of riot, attempts were made to intimidate the members of parliament from exercising their judgment on a measure then depending in the House of Commons, among various other means, placards, and writings on the walls, threatning those who suggested or supported the measure. Among others that were seen, Mr. Robinson was exhibited on a gibbet, and rewards was offered for his head. The fury of the populace were directed against him, and those<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181504050019"/>who should protect him, or his house or property. On Monday, the 6th of March, in the evening, his house was, by a large concourse of persons attacked, broken and entered. In the middle of the night of the 6th the attack was repeated with increased violence. On the morning of Tuesday the house was again attacked with increased violence; the house was entered, and furniture and property publicly destroyed. On the evening of Tuesday the attack upon the house was renewed with increased violence; on these occasions the windows were broken, the pallisadoes in front of the house torn up, the doors forced; some of the mob broke in and destroyed a a part of the furniture which they used in committing fresh acts of violence, and the lives of Mr. Robinson and his servants were loudly and repeatedly threatened. The frenzy which directed the rioters was increased, and their mischievous designs were aided by the advance of night. An attack of a most alarming nature was again commenced, and those to whom the care of the house was entrusted would, as I humbly submit, have been justified in taking the strongest measures for dispersing the rioters; instead of this, it has already appeared, that blank cartridges only were fired; this was found rather to provoke insult than repel aggression. The mob encouraged each other to still further acts of violence, by calling out, that the soldiers did not dare to fire ball.</p>
               <p>Felony upon felony had already been committed; for I believe my Lord will tell you, that every tumultuous breaking of any part of the house is a beginning to demolish, and a felony within the law; and the next thing to be expected was the entire destruction of the house, and the murder of those who defended it.</p>
               <p>If it should occur to you that the deceased was not engaged in these riots, his Lordship I conceive will tell you that makes no difference in our case. If a man, meaning only to resist felons, unfortunately kills an innocent person, such killing is not murder; that case was expressly decided in the case of Lovett, cited in Coke, c. 538. It may perhaps be said, by some persons, that there was not sufficient violence to justify firing from the house; if that be said, it must be by persons who stood only a short time on the scene of action. In all alarms there are short and dreadful instances of calamity. Your attention, if after what you have heard, you shall think it necessary, will now be called to those who witnessed these transactions from the commencement. On the Monday night again, on the Tuesday morning, and the Tuesday evening, which unfortunately terminated in the death of the deceased, these witnesses can only present that entire case, on which alone your judgment can be formed. With these observations, Gentlemen, I leave my case in your hands, perfectly satisfied that I shall receive from your justice a verdiot of not guilty.</p>
               <p>Burton, Herbert, and Mathews's defence.</p>
               <p>My Lord, we have not any observations to trouble the Jury with. We were called upon to assist in protecting the house; that we acted with caution, moderation, and care, for the lives of our fellow subjects. After blank cartridges had been fired without any other effect on the mob than to encrease their violence and defiance; at length, two pieces, one a pistol, was fired with shot, when our lives was in the greatest immediate danger. The object of this was to intimidate; and we regret as sincerely as any men can do, that any person should have been mortally injured.</p>

On the 29th, I was ordered down to Mr. Dampier's, I watched the prisoner with the team out of the yard; the prisoner stopped his team at Norton Falgate; Smith the officer was appointed to meet him there, Smith examined the cart, I saw Smith the officer find a sack of oats, and a bushel and a half of split beans in sacks, the sacks were Mr. Dampier's sacks.</p>
               <p>MR. SMITH. I am an officer. I got upon the dung and found the oats and split beans in sacks, they were concealed under the dung, I have had them ever since; I produce them.</p>
               <p>MR. DAMPIER. I can swear to the sacks, they are mine.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about this chest of tea - A. No, I saw the same chest that I lost in Coblers-court, Essex-street, I got the empty chest again, the tea was taken out of it.</p>

               <p>Q. In a short time after she came into your service had you occasion to reprove her - A. I had, about three weeks after she came.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181504050021"/>Q. What was the occasion that you reproved her - A. I observed her one night go into the young men's room partly undressed. I said it was very indecent of her to go into the young men's room thus undressed.</p>
               <p>Q. What age were the young men - A. I suppose seventeen or eighteen years old.</p>
               <p>Q. How many of them were they - A. Two; I reproved her severely the next morning for her conduct; I threatened to discharge her, and gave her warning to quit; but she shewed contrition for it. I forgave her, and retained her; that passed over.</p>
               <p>Q. What was her department after that for the remaining month - A. I observed that she failed in the respect that she before paid me, and appeared extremely sullen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she, after this, say any thing to you upon the subject of yeast dumplings - A. She did; a fortnight before the transaction she requested me to let her make some yeast dumplings, professing to be a capital hand. That request very frequently was made. On Monday, the 20th of March, she came into the dining-room, and said the brewer had brought some yeast.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you given any order to the brewer to bring any yeast - A. Oh, no. I told her I did not wish to trouble the man, that was not the way I had them made, I generally had the dough of the baker, that saved the cook a good deal of trouble, and was always considered best, but as the man had brought a little yeast, on the next day she might make some. On Tuesday morning the 21st, I, as usual, went into the kitchen. I told her she might make some; but before she made the dumplings, to make a beefsteak pye for the dinner of the young men; and as she would have to leave the kitchen to get the steaks, I did not wish her to leave the kitchen after the dumplings were made. I told her I wished them to be mixed with milk and water. She said she would do them as I desired her. This was about half past eleven; she carried the pye to the baker's before the kneading of the dough commenced. I told her, I wished her not to leave the dough, that she might carry the pye to the baker's. She carried the pye to the baker's near twelve. I went into the kitchen after she had been to the baker's; I gave directions about making the dough. I said, I suppose there is no occasion for me stopping; she said, Oh, no, she knew very well how to do it. Then I went up stairs. In about half an hour I went into the kitchen again; I then found the dough made; it was set before the fire to rise.</p>
               <p>Q. What other servant have you - A. Another maid; her name is 
               <persName id="t18150405-18-person241">

             orders to go into the bed room to repair a counterpane. I am certain that during the time the dough was made no person was in the kitchen but the prisoner; this was about half past twelve; we dine at three, the young men at two. From half past twelve to three I was in the kitchen two or three times, until the dough was made up into dumplings.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the dough - A. It remained in a pan before the fire to rise; I observed it never did rise. I took off the cloth, and looked at it. My observation was it had not risen, and it was in a very singular position, in which position it remained until it was divided into dumplings. It was not put into the pan as I have seen dough; its shape was singular; it retained that shape to the last. I am confident it never was meddled with after it had been put there.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time was the dividing the dough into dumplings - A. I suppose about twenty minutes before twelve. I was not in the kitchen at the time; I had been in the kitchen half an hour before that time.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you remark to the prisoner the singular appearance of the dough - A. I did not remark to her the singular appearance; I told her it never had risen; the prisoner said it would rise before she wanted it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many dumplings would there be - A. Six; the prisoner had divided it into six dumplings. About three o'clock I sat down to dinner; the dumplings were brought upon the table. I told the other servant they were black and heavy, instead of white and light.</p>

               <p>Q. Who sat down to dinner with you - Mr. Haldebart Turner, myself, and my husband. I helped Mr. Haldebart Turner and my husband to some dumpling, and took a small piece myself. I found myself affected in a few minutes in the stomach after I had eaten; I did not eat a quarter of a dumpling; I felt myself very faint, and an extreme burning pain, which increased every minute. It became so bad I was obliged to leave the table I went up stairs.</p>
               <p>JURY. You eat nothing else - A. I eat a bit of beef steak that the prisoner had cooked. When I went up stairs I perceived my sickness had increased and my head was swollen extremely. I reached very violently; I wondered none of the family come up to my assistance; I was half an hour alone. When I came down I found my husband's father very bad, and my husband. I was ill from half past three till nine, sick and reaching; at nine it abared, but did not cease; my chest was swollen; we called in a gentleman near, and afterwards Mr. Marshall, the surgeon.</p>

             left the room indisposed. She went up stairs; we did not then know she was very ill. Some time afterwards my son left the room, and went down stairs. I followed him shortly afterwards, and went into the parlour below. Coming out I met my son at the foot of the stairs; he told me had been very sick, and had brought up his dinner. I found his eyes were exceedingly swollen, very much indeed. I said, I thought it very extraordinary; I was taken ill myself in less than three minutes afterwards; the effect was so violent, that I had hardly time to get into the yard before my dinner came up. I felt considerable heat across my stomach and chest, and pain.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the vomitting of a common kind - A. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181504050022"/>never experienced any thing before like it for violence; I was terribly irritated; it was not more than a quarter of an hour my apprentice Roger Gadsell was taken very ill in a similar way to myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your son sick also - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner give any of you any assistance while you were sick - A. None in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether the prisoner eat any dumplings - A. I did not; I had suspicion of arsenic; I made a search the next morning; I found a brown dish or a pan that the dumplings had been mixed in; there appeared to be the leavings of the dumplings in it; I put some water into the pan, and stired it up with a spoon, with a view to form a liquid of the whole; I found upon the pan being set down for half a minute, upon my taking it up slowly, and in a slanting direction; I discovered a white powder at the bottom; I shewed it to several persons in the house; I kept it in my custody, and shewed it to Mr. Marshell when he came; no person had access to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any arsenic - A. Yes; I kept it in a drawer in the office: any person might have access to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know whether the prisoner can road - A. I believe she can read and write.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mrs. Turner. Is that so - A. She can read and write very well.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mr. Turner. Was that drawer locked or open - A. It always has remained open.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lit the fire in that office, do you know - A. It was the prisoner's duty to do so; waste paper was kept in that drawer; she might properly resort to that drawer for paper to light her fire. I saw that paper of arsenic in that drawer on the 7th of March, never after that time; I heard of it being missed about a fortnight before the 21st of March. I observed that the knives and the forks that we had to eat the dumplings with were black; there was no vinegar used in the sauce at all. I have two of them in my pocket to shew, (witness producing two of the knives,) I saw them with this black upon them the next day; on the next day I asked the prisoner how she came to introduce any ingrediants into the dumplings that were so prejudicial to us; she replied that it was not in the dumplings, but it was in the milk that

I had several discourses with her on that day on this subject; during the whole of which, she persisted that it was the milk, as before described, that milk had been used for the sauce only; the prisoner made the dumplings with the refuse of the milk that had been left at breakfast. I asked the prisoner if any person but herself had mixed or had any thing to do with the dumplings; she expressly said no.</p>

I went into the kitchen between three and four in the afternoon; I had dined at two; I observed there a plate on the table with a dumpling and a half; I took a knive and fork up, and was going to cut it to eat it; the prisoner exclaimed, Gadsdell, do not eat that, it is cold and heavy, it will do you no good; I eat a piece about as big as a walnut; there was a small quantity of sauce in the boat; I put a bit of bread in it, and sepped it up, and eat it; this might be twenty minutes after three.

On the evening of the 21st of March, I was sent for at Mr. Turner's family in a great hurry; I got there a quarter before nine o'clock; I found Mr. Turner and Mrs. Turner very ill; the symptoms were such as would be produced by arsenic; I have no doubt of it by the symptoms; the prisoner also was ill, that was caused by the same.</p>

He did; I examined the dish; I washed it with a tea-kettle of warm water, I first stand it, and let it subside; I decanted it off, I found half a tea spoon of white powder; I washed it a second time; I decidedly found it to be arsenic.</p>

On the 26th of March, about haf past five I was going through King's Arms Yard, I saw the prisoner come from behind a coach that stood before a door that was broken open; I asked him what he did there, he said, he had been locked out of his lodgings, he had been laying underneath the coach all night; I said I was afraid he had not; I turned my head round; I saw the horse shoes in a sack at the back part of the coach, they were tied up. I asked him what he had got there in the bundle, he said, he knew nothing at all of them. I then saw the door broken open; I secured the prisoner, the shoes and the tools, and took him to the watchhouse. I produce the horse shoes chisels and punches, that were in the bag, and this hammer.</p>

            . I am a constable. I heard the cry of stop thief. I stopped the prisoner; a person came up and gave me charge of him. I conveyed him to the watchhouse with difficulty. On taking the prisoner into the watch-house he squatted down on his bottom; I put my hand down to help him up round his waist; I found in his hand the watch ribbon. I took the watch from him; the prisoner denied all knowledge of the watch and seals some of the young men about the watchhouse said, they had seen the ribbon hang out of the prisoner's breeches. A search was made for the seals; the ribbon and seals were found in the constable's chair, close by the fire place; the prosecutor came into the watch-house, and owned the watch and seals; I produce the watch and seals.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my watch and seals.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming home from Kennington, and coming along Fleet Street there was a mob; I went to see what was the cause of this mob; I then proceeded towards my home; I heard the cry of stop thief. This gentleman came up and said, I was the person that had robbed him of his watch; I was then dragged to the watchhouse; I told them I had not robbed any one of his watch.</p>

I said it was; Mr. Fletcher the constable searched him; none of my property was found on him, but there was a bunch of my keys; which he dropped down on the bottom of the stairs, which I had left on my desk. The prisoner was taken to the Compter; no person was in my chambers. I missed nothing but the bunch of keys, they were found on the staircase; these are them, they are my property.</p>

I saw him looking out of the window; I then went up stairs; on his seeing me, he threw a quantity of paper out of his apron. I took no notice; I came down stairs, and kept on the watch. In about five minutes he came down stairs. I watched him to the Post-office; it then appeared to me as if he had something under his apron. I left the prisoner at the Post-office. I communicated to Towgood what I had seen; he watched him.</p>

I came upon him unexpectedly, by reason of his stopping, and told him to come back; he came along with me as far as the public house in Sherborne-lane, then David Gibson, another clerk, came up.

            . I am an errand boy to Mr. Walker. I saw Mr. Walker's watch before Griffin, came in, he came in between two and three o'clock, on the 22nd of February, and directly Griffin was gone, we missed the watch; I went to Mr. Jones, the pawnbroker, and found that Griffin had pawned the watch there.</p>

               <p>PHILIP JONES. I produce the watch; I took it in pawn of the prisoner; in about three minutes after, Briggs came, and asked me if Griffin had been, and pawned a watch with me; I told him he had, he had pawned it in his own name; I have known Griffin ten or twelve years; I really believe he is not right in his mind, or else he would not have come to me that have known him so long. I produce the watch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. At the time this offence was committed I was in a state of intoxication, and when I am so I am in a state of insanity.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Was he a distressed man - A. I have every reason to suppose that he was distressed; I have heard his father say that he was insane at times.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you let a lodging to these people - A. Yes, they came in the lodging on Christmas Eve; they both lived together, and passed as man and wife, they had one room ready furnished in the first floor at five shillings a week; they had two blankets, a quilt, a rug, a tea kettle, a saucepan, and a looking-glass; all these things they were to have the use of.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you loose these things - A. I believe on the 4th of March they were taken in custody I opened the door and went in, and missed these<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181504050028"/>things; not seeing the woman for two days; I had seen the man, he left the lodging on the Saturday; she left it on the Thursday. I got an officer, and had them both taken into custody.</p>

On the 1st of March, the patrole alarmed me, and said there was some person in the cellar, a little before six in the morning. I jumped up, took the poker, and went to the cellar door; at the top of the cellar stairs I struck against the boards, I did not strike the man, I thought I heard him come up the stairs, the man ran down the stairs, and began to cry.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the patrol accompany you - A. No, he was not in the shop; I called my brother up; he got up, and opened the door, and let the watchman in; the watchman brought his lanthorn in the shop; I opened the cellar door; the man came up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man coming up stairs or going down when you first let him in - A. He came up from the cellar; he had been in the cellar and in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not seen him there - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. You only found him on the stairs - A. Yes, and when he came in the shop I gave him to the patrole.</p>

               <p>Q. You keep the house do you - A. Yes; I have no partner.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181504050029"/>Q. How do you know that he was in the shop or in the cellar - A. I saw him in the shop; he came up stairs without my fetching him, and delivered himself up to the patrole, and me. He had packed up these things in the shop, and took them into the cellar; they were all in the shop at one o'clock when I went to bed. The basket that now contains the things, is mine; the things were not in the basket when I found them in the cellar, the loose copper he had tied up in my apron, with other things.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any copper money tied up in the apron - A. Yes; all this four pounds ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any butter - A. Yes, four pounds three pounds of bacon, and five pounds of pork, they were all in my cellar; the copper that was tied up in the apron was left under the counter when I went to bed, the butter was on the board, it was a full tub of butter turned out, he had taken one slice off, it weighed four pounds; the bacon was in the shop when I went to bed; it was in the cellar when I saw it again; the pork was in the cellar, it had been in the shop when I went to bed, at one o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your cellar secured - A. Yes; the door that led to the shop was bolted; he had got a knife and cut it, and got the bolt back; I found the knife on him that he cut the cellar door, and a piece of cheese in his pocket. The cellar flap he broke into and made an entrance into the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else of your family that had access to this shop - A. No, I have buried my wife; I had no servant lived with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that apron in which the money and things were wrapped in - A. I am positive it is mine; I had worn it the day before; there is no particular mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any account of himself - A. All that he said was a person pushed him down the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see how the flap had been opened - A. He had opened the cellar flap, after that was open, he could not go down unless he had ripped up a board at the bottom, he had taken one board up. There is no particular mark of mine on the butter, bacon, or cheese; I know where he had taken them from; this handkerchief was on a horse in the cellar; he took the handkerchief, and tied the bacon up in it; the handkerchief is mine; he had this piece of cheese in his pocket; I had such a piece of cheese in the shop very much like it; the halfpence are all new, and the penny pieces.</p>

            . I am a patrole of St. Mathew, Bethnal Green. On the 1st of March, in the morning, I observed a board of the cellar flap of the prosecutor's house was taken up; I laid hold of the door, it came open; I put my ear to listen if any body was there; I heard the sound of feet walking, I hallooed out, who is there; the prisoner said, the master of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was the prisoner that said that - A. There was no other person in the cellar; I took him coming up out of the cellar; I alarmed Mr. Reynolds, and ordered him to open the celler door that leads into the shop that there was some person in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. That was before you laid hold of the prisoner - A. Yes, Mr. Reynold's brother opened the shop door then it was, that I found the prisoner; I secured the prisoner. I searched him in the prisoner's right hand coat pocket, I found this piece of cheese, in another pocket I found this knife; the prisoner acknowledged that he cut the cellar door, and unbolted it. I then ordered Mr. Reynolds to go down into the cellar to see if any of his property was there; he went there, and found a quantity of copper tied up in a cloth, he found a piece of bacon in another cloth. I took the prisoner to the watchhouse. I neither promissed or threatened him; he said, this was the knife that he cut the cellar door to come into the shop.</p>

            . I am an ivory-turner, No. 30,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181504050030"/>Houndsditch. In the month of March last, the prisoner came to my shop on Saturday morning, I think the 18th; it is three weeks ago to-morrow. About a quarter past eight in the morning, he came and asked whether I would buy any ivory. I told him I could not tell, if I saw it I could tell. He said, there were nine elephant's teeth, about an 100 lb. I asked him whether I could see them. He seemed to intimate, that I might see them; he said they were cut in pieces, they had been smuggled, and that was done for the convenience of getting them on shore. I believe that is the substance of what passed in the morning. He left me; I then wrote a note, and sent it to Mr. Sinclair by my boy. In the afternoon of that Saturday he called again; he called again on Tuesday afternoon, and brought this piece of ivory with him, it was in a bag, or in a canvas wrapper wrapped round it; it was tied with a string, this is the piece, I have had it ever since. He said here is a piece of stuff; I said I should like to see the whole. He said he could let me see the whole, if I bought this piece and paid him for it, he would bring me another piece, until I had got the whole. He put down the particulars on a piece of paper in my shop; the weight of the four teeth, two hundred and six pound. He asked three shillings a pound for this piece, if I was to buy it; the weight of this piece is about thirty pound. I told him I had a suspicion it was stolen. I said I must detain it; he said I had used him very ill, and I had brought him into a dilimma. I said public justice was of more importance to me than buying a piece of stuff under price. I have known him fourteen or fifteen years, I entertained a better opinion of him: I had no idea of his being a thief; I said Messrs. Sinclairs wished to find out the person that broke open the house; if he would disclose that, they might make him an evidence.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember making any particular observation of teeth upon lot 6 - A. Yes, one tooth in lot 6 had been originally in lot 3; and upon examination I put it into lot 6; there was a blemish in the tooth that would depreciate the value of the other teeth.</p>
               <p>Q. Take that tooth into your hand; do you believe that tooth to have been in lot 3, and was put into lot 6 - A. I do; there is a blemish in it, that is the tooth that was in lot 6, and had been in lot 3.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I called on Mr. Harwood with this piece of an elephant's tooth; I asked him three shillings a pound for it; he detained it, and said he had suspicion it had been stolen.

I am one of the Marshalmen of the City; I found this trunk that I now produce at No. 6, Church-street St. Giles's, in the lower front room, Mr. O'Cornell occupied that room; the prosecutor saw the trunk, and said it was his; he produced a key that opened it; he claimed the trunk, and every thing in it, there was C P upon the trunk in brass nails; the watches were not in the trunk; I apprehended the prisoner in the street, about a hundred yards from O'Cornells's room, he was talking to a girl of the town in the street; I told him he was my prisoner, he said, for what; I told him if he would go with me to O'Cornell's where he lodged, I would tell him, he made resistance, for the moment, but we forced him there, and then I asked him if he knew any thing of this trunk; I took him in charge for stealing this trunk, I told him I must secure him, I took out a pair of hand cuffs; he made resistance, we were oblidged to throw him on the ground to handcuff him, and with great difficulty we put the handcuffs on him; a rush came from the outside by the people that had assembled, and smashed the door in upon us; the prisoner seemed to be in liquor, and said but little; the people found that we had pistols, they came no further; we took the prisoner to the Compter and searched him; we did not search him there, on account of the mob at the Compter we found on the prisoner's neck, this silk handkerchief, that the prosecutor claimed and swore to; in his left hand pocket a cotton handkerchief; the prosecutor claimed that also; in another pocket we found a key, exactly the pattern of the prosecutor's key; it was quite new, on the next day I accompained the prosecutor to the same room where the trunk was, we found in the room under a loose brick at the fire place, the coin I now produce, a spanish dollar, a half doubloon, and a quarter doubloon, and an English guinea; the prosecutor said they were his; under a part of the floor which had the appearence of having been mended, we pulled up a piece of board; we took a silver watch out of there; the prosecutor claimed it. Mrs. O'Cornell was bound over to prosecute, she has absconded; we found the other watch at Mr. Harper's, a publican, in Shorts Gardens, he is here, the publican produced the watch; the prosecutor claimed it; that is a silver watch. I have kept the silver watch, I found at Mr. O'Cornell's ever since, this is it.</p>

I took the trunk to Mr. Hamilton's; in about five minutes afterwards, the prisoner Cambridge came to me, and asked me where the trunk was; I told him it was under a table by the head of the cellar stairs; he said he would not wish to leave it there, he was afraid it will be lost. He asked me if I could take it up stairs into my room; I told him I could. I took it from Mr. Hamilton's into my own room. About an hour after that,

            , wife of the prisoner, as I thought, came in, and said she wanted a bundle of things out of it; she took a bundle out of it; she came into my room, and emptied the trunk into a large bundle; the contents I do not know; I did not see what she took; I was standing by the fire; I did not see how she opened it: she took out a large bundle of clothes from the trunk, I cannot say what they were. My wife came up at the time; she asked her whether she could tell her of a pawnbroker; she said there was one at the corner of Paddington-street; she asked my wife if she would go along with her; my wife said she was sorry she could not. She went out of my room, down stairs, with the bundle; she paid my wife two shillings, and the price of a pint of beer. I saw no more of her until I saw her at the office.</p>

I was at Mr. Hamilton's; the prisoner, Cambridge, was there; he asked me to let this box stand at my stable for a few days; the box was not brought to me until I saw it at Mr. Hamilton's; on the Monday the prisoner, Cambridge asked me if I would let that box that was at Mr. Hamilton's, stand in my stables for two or three days until he called for it; I observed the box was open; I could see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181504050033"/>some wearing apparel in it; I refused to let the prisoner put it in my stable. Mr. Hamilton sent for me to take it away from his house, that was on Monday; seeing the box open, I thought I would have nothing to do with it, however, I let the box be put into my stable.</p>

I suspected him, that he was the person that had taking my pocket book from me; I ran, and took hold of him; he threw the pocket book away from him, from under his coat; my friend picked the pocket book up, and delivered it to me; it contained a note for twenty pounds, and eighteen pounds. This is the pocket book; it is mine.</p>

            , the officer. On Sunday, the 19th of March, I received of my cousin a three shilling bank token; by his direction, I went to buy some oranges of the prisoner, Cohen, I saw him in Watling-street, Levy was about ten yards off; I told Cohen I wanted two oranges, I gave him a three shilling token to pay for them; he said, he could not give me change; he put my three shilling token into his pocket, and gave me another; I then gave him threepennyworth of halfpence to pay for the two oranges.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the three shilling bank token that you received of the prisoner - A. I kept it in my hand, and gave it to my cousin; he was just by. The three shilling bank token that my cousin gave me, was marked with 3 upon it; the one Cohen gave me for it had no figure of 3 upon that.</p>
               <p>CHARLES MATTHEWS. I am a city constable; the last witness is my cousin, he is about fourteen or fifteen. I was in company with Johnson, on Sunday, the 19th of March, I saw the two prisoners together in Watling-street; in consequence of suspicion, I employed my cousin to buy two oranges of them; I put a notch upon a three shilling bank token, it had No. 3 upon it; I gave it to my cousin, and told him to buy two oranges of the prisoners; I saw the two prisoners together in Watling-street; I and Johnson kept out of their sight. I saw my cousin go towards them; my cousin came back to me, and brought me a three shilling piece, he did not bring back the same I gave to him, it was another, a bad one; I marked that at the bottom with the key of my handcuffs. I told Johnson it was all right, to go and apprehend them; we followed the prisoners into Newgate-street, they went from Watling-street in company together in Newgate-street; I catched hold of Cohen; I said to Johnson, catch the other; Levy threw his basket down, and ran away; I held fast of Cohen until Johnson brought Levy back; we then took them both into a public-house in Distaff-lane; I searched Cohen; I found on him the three shilling token I had given to my cousin in his left hand breeches pocket, and two bad three shilling tokens besides; in his coat pocket I found two bad shillings, and one bad shilling in a pocket at the back of his breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these two counterfeit tokens, and these three bad shillings, and tell me whether they are the whole that you found upon Cohen - A. These are the tokens, and these are the three shillings; I found one at the back of his breeches, and two in his coat pocket. I saw Johnson take something from Levy's sleeve, I did not see what it was.</p>

On the 24th of June, the prisoner paid me a bill of exchange for iron, that was sold to him on the same day, in consequence of proving this bill at Guildhall an enquiry was made into this bill. I received the bill of the prisoner to the best of my knowledge, my clerk marked it, he is not here and there is a mark that I put upon it myself at the time I proved it at Guildhall; I believe that is the same bill I received of the prisoner, it became due on the 27th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever pay that account - 
               <persName id="t18150405-52-person507">A. </persName>
            He placed a bill in my hands for one hundred and fifty four pounds seven shillings and ten pence, that bill was honoured, and I was over paid if the transaction had ended there; I do not carry on the prosecution it is carried on by the assignees under the Commission.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the prisoner's partner - A. Mr. Stables the assignees son; this bill was given for the account of the son of the prosecutor, in the indictment.</p>

On the 7th of March, the box was opened; I examined the box to see what money was in it, we enquired for an acknowledgement of one hundred pounds which was lodged in the hands of Messrs. Calvert's the brewers; I enquired of the prisoner for that money, he said it was in the box, but it could not be found, in looking over the papers in the box, we there saw an acknowledgement purporting to be a paper of Messrs. Calverts, for sixty four pounds, that had been put in their hands about four weeks.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether that is the paper that was found in the box - A. Most undoubtedly, I am sure it is; I was ordered to make enquiry at Calvert's, I went there and found our money was not in their hands; this money had been in the Bank of England, and sold out by the prisoner's order, and instead of his placing the money in Calvert's hands, he has kept it himself.</p>

I enquired it any of the society were apprized of our money<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181504050037"/>being drawn from the Bank; Mr. Box said he would speak to me presently; I am stewardess, he withdrew; I went into the passage to him; he drew out of his pocket this paper, he said he had not acquainted any of the ladies of it, but he would do it that evening, the money he said was taken out of the Bank, and put into the brewer's hands; I then went into the club room, and stopped until he had finished, he read the paper to us, he said that paper was a security for us, it was given to Mrs. Hyser; I think this is the same paper.</p>

            He did, he said, he was come at the request of the society, for me to transfer the money to him, the stewardess's had come to an agreement to draw the money out of the Bank, and place it in Messrs.

We then proposed to go down, which we did; we arrived there at four o'clock; we went to the chapel at Tottenham, where I knew Mr. Elliott was in the habit of going; we saw him there; from there we went to his house; George with a chissel opened his shutters, and entered his house, struck a light, he had a tinder-box with him for the purpose; I told him where the drawer was; he brought me several watches, and old watch cases, and some old silver, a gold seven shilling piece, with which we both came away to London, and at the corner of Widegate-street; we parted. When I went to my room, I took out all the articles he had stolen, and shewed them so Mr. Barnes, a fellow lodger, who was quite astonished, and said James, you have been in bad company; I told him I had been at the other end of the town at a bawdy-house. Barnes called up my landlord; the landlord advised me to take the property to the young fellow, my companion; I took a gold watch to the pawnbrokers by the church in Spitalfields, I offered it for a guinea. I said I had it of a sailor; the young man told me to fetch the sailor; I went out, but did not return, for fear of being stopped; I pawned another watch close to the trunpike in the Commercial-road, a silver hunting watch, with a diamond, made by Miller, at Tottenham; the other watches I gave over to my companion. I and my companion roved about for several days together; he wished to be engaged in other robberies; I said, I would do no more, I was so uneasy in my mind; he said, he would go to France; I do not know where he is;</p>

I am sure I saw them all safe on the evening of the 5th of October. The prisoner worked for me since the month of August in the shop where the diamonds were deposited; all the work men and apprentices worked in that shop. On the evening of the 7th of October, I found I had been robbed; I sent for an officer, and had all my men searched; nothing was found upon any of them. I caused an advertisement to be inserted in the newspaper. I saw some of my diamonds again in Parton-street, in the possession of Mr. Levy. The prisoner left his employ; I had not discharged him. On the 20th of last March, I met the prisoner in Chandois-street, I seized him by the collar, I said, I believe you are the scoundrel that robbed me, you must go with me. I asked him what induced him to rob me; he said, he did not know, he did it in an unlucky moment; it was his intention to replace the property; I replied, that is impossible. I took him to my house in Salisbury-street, before my partner; he begged our pardon, and hoped we would forgive him. I sent for an officer; he was taken to Bow-street. I found about three hundred diamonds at Mr. Levy's, we do not count them, we weigh them; I found them at Mr. Levy's, there was one yellow stone I particularly know; I am sure these diamonds are part of the diamonds I lost.</p>
               <p>ISRAEL LEVY. I reside in Parton-street, in the Haymarket. About the beginning of January, a glazier, who had a job to do for me, said he knew a young man that had some diamonds to sell; the glazier sent the young man to me; he had some white and some yellow diamonds; I believe the prisoner is the young man that brought them. I sent for Mr. Isaacs. The prisoner said he had some more to bring me. Mr. Isaacs came, and looked at the diamonds, and while he was looking over them, the prisoner came in with the other diamonds; Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181504050039"/>Isaacs said, he believed they were stolen, to stop them; the prisoner said he could not stop them; he said, he could, and him also. The prisoner ran out of the house, and left the diamonds behind him; I kept the diamonds until Mr. Parsons came with Mr. Isaacs, and then I delivered them to Mr. Parsons, I am not sure whether they were left in my possession, or Mr. Isaacs's, he can tell; I wish to be correct.</p>
               <p>MR. ISAACS. In January, I went to Mr. Levy's house; I there found a parcel of diamonds; they answered to the description of diamonds that Mr. Parsons had lost. I told the prisoner I would keep them, unless he would go to Mr. Parsons, and contradict that they were his property; the prisoner said I could not stop them; I said I could, and stop him too. He bolted out of the house, and never came back for the diamonds; they were the exact weight that Mr. Parsons had lost.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are the property of me and my partner.</p>

I lost a shawl on Thursday, the 16th of February, it was in the shop on the counter, on that day, between one and two o'clock, the prisoner came in with a child in her arms, she asked the price of some silk shawls that were in the window; I told her the price, and shewed her several others; I asked her thirty shillings for a shawl; she bid me twenty. I had a great suspision of her; I cleared the counter, and while she was in the shop a person came into the shop to change a shawl for another; she left the shawl with me; I folded it up, and left it on the counter until she came for it.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the shawl you charge her with stealing - A. Yes. I missed that shawl after the prisoner was gone; the prisoner bought a gown, and left three shillings on it. The prisoner called on the Thursday following, and paid the remainder of the money for the gown, and took it way; I desired my wife to watch her; I intended to take her up on the Sunday following; I did not do it. She came again on the Tuesday, I took her up then. I saw my shawl again on Thursday after, at the pawnbrokers.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 10th of March did Mrs. Beaufort miss a ring - A. No, not till the morning of the 11th.</p>
               <p>MRS. BEAUFORT. I missed the diamond ring, on the 11th of March; I took it off my finger and laid it on the table on the 6th and missed it on the 11th, I communicated it to Mr. Beaufort, I was present when Powell was called up, he at first denied knowing any thing of it, he afterwards confessed he had found it, I have seen the ring since.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mr. Beaufort. In consequence of information, from Mrs. Beaufort, did you inform your servants of your loss - A. I did, Bara Domingo denied any knowledge of the ring; I said, if the ring was not found by Monday morning I would go to Bow-street. On Monday morning I went to the office and got Westbrook, he came to my house, and searched Powell, in his pocket he found this receipt, this receipt was put into my hands, and in Powell's chest he found some duplicates, nothing was found upon the woman.</p>

            . I live at Twickenham. On Saturday, the 17th of September, I observed a lug boat by the edge of the River Thames, between eight and nine in the evening, it was rather dark; she was laying at a wharf by the Thames side, at Twickenham; I heard some men at work shoveling coals; I went to Mr. Turner, knowing he had a lug boat of that description; I and Mr. Turner went to the wharf; I found the boat fastened to the wharf. I spoke to the men who were at work; I could not distinguish who the men were; I spoke to them about the impropriety of the time they were at work, and whose coals they were. Mr. Turner asked them who they were; they made no answer. Mr. Turner then left me; Rednap came on shore; I went towards him; he went into the boat again, and cut the cord that it was fastened by; Rednap I knew; I cannot say who the others were; one of them cut the hawser, and the boat went off. Mr. Turner came and took a boat, and went after it; we found the boat on the Twickenham side, on the heigth, there were a number of coals in the bottom of the boat; it turned out to be Mr. Turner's boat, the Henry. Moore was taken; he escaped.</p>

On Monday, the 13th of March, two men called me up at half past five, they asked me to give them the horse and cart they had left three or four days before; I told them the cart was broken down. They then said I was to give them the horse, they could borrow a cart in Old-street. I gave them the horse; the mens names are Smith and Fenn; I gave them the horse, and they went about their business; and about ten minutes before ten the same morning, I saw them again, they came up the yard with a horse and cart; they had me to take care of the horse.</p>

He could not sell it for more than a shilling for waste paper. He said, he was going to take it home to wrap up bread and butter. These are the forty-three sheets, it is my property.</p>

            . Having been robbed every day, for eight days, I set myself upon the watch, to detect the offender; on the 28th of March, the prisoner came into my shop; I asked him what he wanted, he appeared confused, he asked me for a knife; I shewed him some knives, and while I was getting him other knives, I heard the sound of paper drawing along the counter; he saw I detected him, he left the shop, and went about his business.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in this paper - A. It was a paper of goods, that I had done up for a customer, he went away: I watched him about sixty yards distance from the shop; I returned into the shop again and concealed myself behind a cabin stove. In the space of two minutes the prisoner came into the shop again, he took a lock from off the counter; I pursued him, and took him, about an hundred yards from the shop; I took the lock from underneath his jacket; this is the lock, it his my lock.</p>

I heard a man carrying something along the passage; I came down stairs with a candle in my hand; I saw the prisoner with a range on his shoulder; I called Mrs. Wood, he dropped the range off his shoulder, and ran out of doors, I ran after him, and brought him back: this is the range.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It is my range.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I kept my clothes in that cupboard, the range had dirtied my clothes; I took it out of the cupboard, and was going to put it into Mrs. Wood's cellar.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 17th of February, about six in the evening, Godfry, and me were standing at the bottom of George-street, St. Giles's; I saw the prisoner go in the middle of the street, he had something heavy on his shoulder; I went up to him, and asked him what he had got; he said lead, that had been given to him, and some brass screws; he said, a labouring man gave it him; he afterwards said, he had found it. This is the property.</p>
               <p>Whitty. These are part of the old materials that came from Storey-lane, it is part of the lead that was in the cart; it is the property of Messrs. Meux and Co.</p>

            . I am shopman to the prosecutor. On the 18th of March, the two prisoners came into the shop, they asked to look at some ribbons; I put the ribbon drawer on the counter; the prisoner Watson put her bonnet on the ribbon drawer. I saw her take four pieces of ribbon out of the drawer under her bonnet, and put them into her pocket. She desired me to cut off a yard and a half of ribbon; the other prisoner was standing by her; she told me to cut her off a yard; I cut her off a yard, and then I told Mr. Harndell; they both left the shop; I never lost sight of them, I fetched them back, and then I fetched Jackson, the officer; he secured them, and I saw him pick up off the ground close to Watson four pieces of ribbon.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for to take charge of these two women; I have seen Watson before. I found four pieces of ribbon on the ground when I came in, close to the right side of Watson, and a pocket, containing two other pieces of ribbon; the pocket was Watson's pocket, it had a duplicate of a shawl in it that Watson had pledged that morning; I went to the pawnbroker's with the duplicate; the pawnbroker said Watson had pledged the shawl that morning. I searched Baxter; I found nothing upon her.</p>

Afterwards I had information the ass was stolen; I went in search of it, and found it locked up in a stable in George-street, Spitalfields; I found the stable belonged to a blind man, of the name of Miller. I was obliged to go to Winchester Assizes. One of my fellow officers took the prisoner the next day.

            . I bought the ass of the prisoner, on the 4th of March, it was a she ass; I gave fifteen shillings for it; it was in my stable in George-street, I put it there. I heard the prisoner's voice at the office, I am sure he is the same man that I bought the ass of, by his voice; he was charged with stealing the ass.</p>

I watched the prisoner's notions a long time; I saw him attempt a number of gentleman's pockets; I see him put his hand into the prosecutor's right hand pocket, and pull his handkerchief out; I instantly seized him by the collar, and tapped the prosecutor on the shoulder, and told him he had lost his handkerchief; the prisoner dropped the handkerchief; I picked it up in the presence of the prosecutor.

On the 2nd of April, about ten o'clock at night, the prisoner called at my house, he asked me if I could give him a nights lodging; I told him no. He then asked me to take charge of his bag of clothes, and to lock them up; I took the bag. I afterwards delivered the bag to May, the officer, at Union Hall. On Tuesday morning, Partridge, the officer, of Shadwell Office, came, and asked me if I had got any thing of a man of the name of Till; I told him I had delivered the bag to Mr. May.</p>

Orange-street, ran into an empty house; they came out again without the bundle, and went away. I then went up to Bow-street, I met Dickens, the officer; I told him; he said, he would go with me if I would shew him the house; I took him to the house, and in the dust hole, there were six pieces of print; on our leaving there to go to Bow-street, I saw

I saw the two prisoners go up Wild-street; a mob of people followed them; I was looking at them; they turned up Orange-court, went into an empty house with the prints; they staid there a bit, and came out without it. When the officer took the property, the officer asked if any body knew them; I said, I did; I went with the officer. I am sure the two prisoners are the men.</p>

I stopped at the end of Rose-street; I saw the prosecutrix come up to the prisoner, she said, he had robbed her of her veil. I said where; she replied, in Long Acre.

            . I live at 123, Newgate-street, I am a wholesale glover. The prisoner Cowling came to my house, on the 21st of January, he brought an order, as if coming from a customer of mine; this written order is one of my customer's cards</p>

I knew the prisoner, he had lived with a customer of mine, a Mr. Tidcomb, of Knightsbridge; the prisoner delivered me the pattern; I delivered them to the prisoner as the order of Mr. Tidcomb. He came again on Monday, the 23rd, with this written order, as from the same person, for</p>
               <p>"three dozen of Norway ditto gloves, of different colours;" that I delivered also. I sent to Mr. Tidcomb; he said, he never received the goods, in consequence of that, I had the prisoner apprehended.</p>
               <p>MR. TIDCOMB. I live at Knightsbridge. The prisoner never lived with me as a servant; he has been in the trade. I never gave him any order, or sent him to Mr. Uxley for goods, nor ever did I receive the goods; the order is not my writing.</p>

We returned to the spot where we apprehended him, opposite of the warehouse of Clements and Berradaile, we found the premises broken open; these two pannels were broken out of the door, and this lock was off the outer door.</p>

               <p>Q. You had a little boy of the name of Dagoo, who attended you - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your steward's name - 
               <persName id="t18150405-166-person1395">A. John Decrase</persName>
            , he went by the name of Butler John; he was recommended to me by a very particular friend of mine; he is the object of enquiry; I engaged him to come to England; a very few days before the voyage commenced, I entrusted him with three thousand eight hundred rupees, which is about five hundred pounds, to furnish a stock of vegetables for myself and passengers, it was quite sufficient for the purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you sail - A. Finally on the 24th of June.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had sailed a little while, was a complaint made of the stores that had been purchased by Butler John - A. Yes; he never gave me any accompt of the money; I applied to him for an accompt of my money; I never could get it; he always said I should have it to-morrow. I never got that accompt. Finding the supply of vegetables short, I became more anxious for the accompt. I had him tied up to punish him, seeing him so indifferent; I had him loosed, and said it was of no use to punish such a man as that. I told Butler John that he had disgraced the character given him, and that I would turn him on shore at the Isle of France. On the morning of the accident, I was in the cabin, the table stood opposite of the cabin door, so that as I sat at the table with my back to the cabin windows I could see all that was done on deck. Butler John came to me with several papers, without any vouchers to his accompts; I was by no means satisfied. I pointed that the charge was large, and there was nothing forth coming to answer to it. I said, he must see himself that he had wronged me very much; I told him, I would over look it if he would tell me how the money had gone; I repeatedly asked him; he seemed in a state of apathy, he would return no answer. I slapped his face with my hand, and told Dagoo to fetch me a cane; when Dagoo was gone for the cane, I was sitting at my table; I thought Butler was sitting in a chair behind me, in the mean while Dagoo was. I did not speak to Butler John, or strike him one blow. I heard a noise at the corner window of the cabin, which I cannot explain, was the first thing that attracted my attention, on turning round instantly, I saw nothing but the legs of a man at the window; I rushed out immediately, and ordered the man at the wheel to put the helm right starboard, the ship was going at the rate of eight knots an hour, all the canvas was set; I immediately ordered the boat to be put out, in order to save the man; all was done as fast as it could to save the man, he perished.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know if any man whatever contributed to the loss of his life - A. Certainly not, by no means whatever; I, myself, bore not the smallest resentment against him at the time; I have no other reason to think he came by his death but by accident in going to look at the vegetables that were stowed over the cabin windows. I arrived in the River on the 27th or 28th of November, the ships crew were put into Mr. Gold's barracks. I first heard of the death of this man that a complaint had been made before the Lord Mayor by Johnny, the serang; that is the first time I heard my conduct was called in question; I attended before the Lord Mayor on the Thursday, after the information reached me on the Friday; when I appeared before the Lord Mayor, Johnny appeared as prosecutor; at the second examination, Sider Caun attended; Dagoo, my boy, said that Sider Caun had said what he had said before the Lord Mayor at the instigation<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181504050064"/>of Johnny, the serang, I asked Sider Caun if he had any objection to go to Mr. Harmer, the solicitor, and state that; he said, he had not.

I am; between the second and third examination the prosecutor, Dagoo, and Sider Caun, came to my house about the 11th of January, that I might hear the confession of Sider Caun as to what he had said at the last examination; I had my clerk present to reduce my questions into writing, and Sider Caun's answers to my questions.</p>

            . Q. You are superintendant of the East India Company's service - A. I am. I remember the arrival of the ship Caroline; the Lascars came to me about the end of November. I asked Johnny, the serang, whether he had any cause to make any complaint; Johnny, the serang made a complaint that the Captain had used him ill, the Captain had put him on duty not common for a serang to do. I asked the whole of the sea cunneys if they had any cause of complaint; Francisco said he had been punished during the Voyage; the sea cunneys complained generally of ill usage from the Captain. They made no complaint of any man losing his life by the Captain, nor I never heard of such a complaint until I attended at the Lord Mayor's.</p>

            . I was servant to Mrs. Woodhouse in the voyage; our cabin adjoined the captain's cabin, it was parted by a thin partition of wood, we could hear loud talking and a noise in each other cabins; on the day this accident happened, I heard no loud talking, or blows or quarrelling in the captain's cabin. Francisco had been cleaning out our cabin that day.</p>
               <p>CAPTAIN WOODHOUSE. I was a passenger on board the Caroline.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the day on which this accident happened - A. I do, after the accident the captain came on deck, ordered the ship to be stopped, and the boat to be lowered, in order to save the man's life; the boat was put out immediately, and every thing was done that could be done to save the man's life; the Captain was very humane and kind; he would make the men do their duty, occasionally they were not willing to do their duty; he made the serang work, and he complained of it; I never heard any complaint that the Captain was the cause of this man's death not till I was in England eight or ten days,</p>
