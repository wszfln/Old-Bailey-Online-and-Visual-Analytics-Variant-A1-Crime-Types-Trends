The Prisoner deny'd the Fact, and in her Defence said she having been abroad, as she was going home the Prisoner struck her and abused her at a very greatrate without any manner of Provocations, nor did then Charge her with having taken any thing from him, nor till after she had charged a Constable with him for abusing of her; for this she called several Evidences. The first Evidence was one who deposed the Prisoner was his Sweet-Heart, and they having been abroad that Day were going home about 10 a Clock at Night. the Prisoner having a Riding-Hood on ; and hold of him by the Arm, that it rained pretty fast, and being at the door of the King's Bagnio, the Prosecutor struck the Prisoner, upon which he turn'd and asked him why he struck the Woman; upon which he struck her several other Blows, whereupon he took away his Cane and gave it to a Walter belonging to the Bagnio, that the Prosecutor retiring into the Bagnio, he went for a Constable to apprehend him, and when he came he found the Prisoner sitting on the out side of the door, at liberty to have gone where she would, and the Prosecutor on the Inn side and the door shut, and that going in and Charging the Constable with the Prosecutor, he attempted to strike the Prisoner again, and also the Constable himself, and did not lay anything to her Charge, till after, they were at the Round-Houses . This was confirm'd by several Evidences, some as to one Circumstance and some to another. Another evidence deposed that when the Prosecutor w as at the Round-House, sitting by the Fire he pulled out a Snuff-Box, and being much in drink, let it fall upon the Fonder , and it broke there, and he himself took up the pieces. The Prisoner produced her Mistress and several Persons of Reputation and Fashion who gave her an extraordinary Character. The Jury <rs id="t17190115-37-verdict195" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>I submit my self to your Lordship and this Honourable Bench; and I beg only your honourable Favour and Regard that as she Witness's for me swore positively to my being assaulted and that the Jury (to my, great<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171901150008"/> Misfortune) were not pleased to give Credit to the family your Lordship will make the most favourable Interpretation of it. But above all I desire your Lordship's notice, that there were many manifest Contradiction, in Vernassell's Evidence, and I may say Impossibilities in other of their Witnesses. Besides her denying on my Tryal that he did double lock the Door, which he swore he did before the Coroner, makes me with reason believe my Life has been maliciously sought; for I call God to Witness, I did not offer the least Violence to the Deceased till after I was struck and ill used by him. I submit my self to your Lordship, and hope your will make such favorable Report to his Majesty as may not obstruct, but leave room to apply to his Wisdom for Mercy.</p>
