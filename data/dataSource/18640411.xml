                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and have offices at 1, Cloister, Temple—I first became acquainted with the prisoner about the beginning of December, or latter end of November—he was brought to me by a Mr. Arundel, with reference to a bill for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I was applied to to have cashed—the prisoner said that he had the means of procuring the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, that he had bespoken 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the purpose of discounting that 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—he said that in the presence of Arundel; they both said it in fact—that transaction went off, the money was not required—about 19th December, I was desirous of discounting a bill for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for a client—the prisoner came to my office about that time to know whether I could give him the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill which had not then been disposed of—I told him the money was not required for the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, and I asked whether he could apply the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the purpose of discounting the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—he said he could, that it made no difference whether I gave the bill to him or Mr. Arundel; it was one and the same thing—he was Mr. Arundel's agent in the matter—I gave him the bill, and took this memorandum from him—<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "23d December, 1863, I have this day received a bill of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. accepted by Mr. T. Pitcher, and drawn by Mr. Vizitelli, from Mr. Pullen to get cashed, and he has received no consideration for the same, and I undertake to return it on demand, George Bayfield. "On receiving that memorandum I gave him the bill—he called on me frequently respecting the bill within a few days from the time, and showed me the bill nearly every time he came—the last time he called upon me was on the Friday, I think, immediately after Christmas-day—he then told me that application had been made to the drawer to know if the handwriting of himself and the acceptor was correct, and the money would he handed over to me between 3 and 4 on the following day—he did not call on me on the following day—I never saw him afterwards till he was in custody—I did not get any of the money—I called on the following day, Sunday, at the place where he represented himself to live, 17, Munster-street, Regent's-park—I did not find him there—I next saw him when he was</p>

               <p>brought to me by Mr. Arundel, in custody of an officer—I have no particular date of when that was; it was a month after this at least—I should not have parted with the possession of the bill if the prisoner had not represented him<lb/>self as the agent of Mr. Arundel—he was an entire stranger to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PATER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you have carried on business as a discount agent for some time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not at all; I never have been—when I had clients, whom I thought deserving of a matter of that sort to be attended to, I have got their bills discounted as I could; but I don't think I have discounted a dozen in my life—I have carried on business in the Temple since last Christmas twelve-months; before that I was in St. Swithin's-lane—if 23d December is the date on the memorandum, that was When I gave the prisoner the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—I am quite sure it was on the day I took the memorandum—he was alone when he called on the 23d—on the first occasion Arundel introduced him to me—he stated that he wanted some in<lb/>formation beyond what he already possessed respecting the bill for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he had brought Mr. Bayfield as he had the means of procuring the money, supposing the information was correct—Arundel had attempted to negotiate the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—he did not have possession of the bill at all—I had instructed him to ascertain whether he could get it discounted—when I entrust any<lb/>body with a bill of exchange, as a rule I always take a receipt—I saw the prisoner five or six times after I entrusted him with the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill on 23d December; between that time and the Friday after Christmas-day—I had not seen Mr. Arundel at all between 23d December and that Friday—I cannot recollect the date when he brought the prisoner to me in custody—I met Arundel on 1st January, when I was going into the hotel at Temple-bar—I only saw him for a moment—the prisoner was then in possession of the bill—I did not say anything to Arundel then about having entrusted the prisoner with the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill as his agent—I had no suspicion on my mind—I thought he was his agent—I certainly had not seen Arundel several times between the time of the prisoner receiving the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill and 1st January—I saw him frequently after 1st January—on the Tuesday following the 3d or 4th January, I gave Arundel authority to take the prisoner up whenever he could find him, and told him the whole facts—immediately the prisoner stopped calling upon me, I went to Arundel—the prisoner came to me, I think, the day after Christmas-day—he appeared to have been drinking too much—he said he would like to lodge the bill with me till Monday for safe custody—I gave it to him again on the Monday following—I had not seen Arundel before that—I had no communication with Arundel after the prisoner received the bill from me before I gave him instructions to give the prisoner into custody—I have known Mr. Arundel, without speaking to him, with reference to other matters, perhaps for a year—I never had any tran<lb/>sactions with him—I have known him, perhaps, three or four months—he had not discounted any bills for me; he had for friends of mine—he was recommended to me as a person who would discount—he was formerly clerk to a barrister—my knowledge of him, with regard to these matters, has been only a few mouths—I gave the prisoner a note to a Mr. Moore, of King William-street—it is very probable that I told him on that occasion if he obtained cash for a bill of exchange for 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he and I would divide the commission—I will not swear I did say so, very probably I did—I did not say to him on that occasion, that Arundel got so drunk that I could have no more to do with him—I did not say that he had been at my chambers in such a state of intoxication the day before, that I was ashamed anybody should see him—I don't think I told the prisoner that after he had seen Mr.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186404110005"/>
               <p>Moore, with reference to the hill of exchange for 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., he was to return tome at my chambers; I introduced Mr. Moore to him, but I don't think I had anything further to do with it—he called and spoke to me about Mr. Moore's bill, as having appointments with Mr. Moore in reference to it, but I did not know what was going on about it—I don't know whether or not be told me he had not been successful in the matter—I can't tell at what time the bill was running; whether it was running at the time he had the other bill or not—I know that the bill was taken out of his hands; it was not cashed—I don't think I told the prisoner that if he obtained the discount for the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, the commission would be 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I think it would be much less—I think it was to have been 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I did not tell him that Arundel was not to receive anything for that—I do not know that since I handed this bill to the prisoner Mr. Pitcher, the drawer, has compounded with his creditors; I know nothing whatever about it—I think the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was entrusted to him before the introduction to Mr. Moore—I am not quite sure about that—he was to employ part of the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I said I could give him an introduction to Mr. Moore, and if he could get the bill discounted, he could do it out of the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was when he came for the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill that some<lb/>thing was said about his being the agent of Arundel, when he was intro<lb/>duced by Arundel, and afterwards when he came by himself—I and Arundel did not have any private conversation when he introduced the prisoner to me—the conversation took place when they were together—he did not state in Arundel's presence that he was his agent—Arundel mentioned that the prisoner had the means of getting the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that was required for the bill—he did not say he was his agent—I considered at the time he brought him to me in the first instance, to be the principal—on the two occasions when Arundel introduced the prisoner to me, I thought he was acting in concert with regard to getting the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill cashed—I have no reason to doubt Arundel's respectability—I believe him to be a perfectly trustworthy person—the address that the prisoner gave was not where he received his letters—he said it was his address, and he gave me his card—I considered it to be his residence—he said he resided there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BEST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been asked about giving Arundel authority to have the prisoner apprehended; what did you say to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I told him that Bayfield had represented to me that he was acting as Arundel's agent, and as I had found out that was not so, I thought it was his duty at once to take him into custody, and I directed him to do so; that he had mis<lb/>represented himself and he was to take him into custody whenever he could find him—when the prisoner was in custody with me and Mr. Arundel, I asked him where the bill was—he shuffled in his pocket-book for some letters, hut nothing passed—that impressed itself very strongly on my mind—he mentioned the name, I think, of a man named Dilnutt—I don't know whether he represented him to be in the possession of the bill—he appeared to be looking for a letter in a pocket-book, which had a number of loose papers in it, and something that he could not find seemed to be connected with Mr. Dilnutt's name.</p>

               <p>done about it—he told, me he would not tell me without my principal being there—we went to Mr. Pullen's office—the prisoner had the whole talk—he said he might get the bill discounted—he never had the bill in his possession but a copy of it—that transaction went off—the prisoner was never my agent—I had a very slight acquaintance with him—I never authorized him to obtain, as my agent, a bill for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Pullen, on 23d December—I knew nothing about it.</p>

I assist at this bazaar—I saw the prisoner come in on the first occasion—he was served by Groom—about a fortnight after that he came in again—I knew him again, and went up purposely to serve him—he asked me for four shillings' worth of postage stamps—I said to Miss Groom, "This is the man who passed the two-shilling piece before"—he gave me a two-shilling piece and four sixpences—I took the money and held the stamps in my hand—I then asked him if he had not been there a fortnight before for three shillings' worth of stamps—he put his hand up to his ear, and said, "What?"—I then repeated the question louder, and he said, "No"—I passed the florin to Miss Luke, who was at the desk, and said, "Try that; I think it is a bad one"—the prisoner stood there, but did not make any observation—Miss Luke left her desk to go to a detector to try the money—the prisoner could see her, and he went quickly out of the shop, leaving the four sixpences and the stamps with me—I went to the door, but could see nothing of him.</p>

On Saturday, 12th March, in consequence of information I received, I took Montgomery at the White Bear public-house, corner of Bear-street and Castle-street, Leicester-square, at half-past 6 in the evening—he was a little the worse for drink—I told him that he was charged with being concerned, with another, in passing bad money at the Crown and Grapes, Little Newport-street, New-port-market—he said, "You have made a mistake, I was not there"—I took him back there, and the last witness identified him—I received three shil<lb/>lings (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I searched Montgomery, and found sevenpence in copper—on Monday, 28th March, I took Wilson at the White Hart, Finsbury-market—I said to him, "Is your name Gleeson?"—he said, "No, my name is not Gleeson, you have the advantage of me"—I said, "l am a police-constable, and I take you into custody for passing, with another man, some counterfeit shillings at the Crown and Grapes, Little Newport-street"—he is well known by the name of Gleeson round about there, and Wilson also.</p>

I am servant to Mr. Charles Bloxam, of Bedford-place, Russell-square—on Sunday-evening, 13th March, about half-past 7, I was coming out of the drawing-room with a candle in my hand, and saw the prisoner going up the stairs—directly he saw me he came back and shook hands with me, and asked how I did—I said I did not know him—he asked if I did not remember seeing him at the Casino the other night—I said no, I had never been to such a place in my life—he begged my pardon, and walked out of the house as fast as he could—I went into the dining-room and saw that the top sash was pulled down from the top to the bottom, as far as it would go—I had been in the dining-room about an hour before—the window had been open about a quarter of a yard from the top all the afternoon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Smart of Fenchurch-street—on 2d April, shortly after 3 o'clock, I was serving in the shop with Mr. Smart and Francis Ormandy, when the prisoner came in and asked for two ounces of cannister tobacco, which came to one shilling—she tendered the lad a sovereign and Mr. Smart gave her change, a half-sovereign, three half-crowns, one shilling, and a sixpence, which he put on the glass counter by the prisoner, she having removed from one division to another—she had a child in her arms which she rested on the case while the change was being given—she then said to the other woman, "You wait, my dear, for the tobacco, and I will take the change and go on"—she then said, "Can you give me all silver?"—Mr. Smart said, "It is inconvenient on a Saturday, but I will try and oblige you"—she inquired the price of the tobacco, he said, "One shilling"—she turned round to her friend and said, "My dear, we only paid 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it the other day here"—as she said that the change was by her side, and she placed her hand over it, took up a half-crown, and replaced it with a counterfeit one—I picked it up, saw that it was bad, and said, "This is what you came in here for and not for the tobacco"—I sent the lad for an officer, and then saw that the whole of the change was on the counter as before—I marked the bad half-crown at the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist of Fenchurch-street—on 2d April the prisoner came in with another woman and a child—the prisoner asked for some tobacco, and before it was delivered to her she put down a sovereign—I put the change on the glass portion of the counter, a half-sovereign, three half-crowns, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they were all good—I had examined the money in the till a few minutes before, and I do not think any money had been put in since—I saw Jones go round the counter in front of the prisoner—she wished me to change the half-sovereign for silver, which I objected to do but afterwards consented—she then turned to her friend and said that she had purchased the tobacco before at a lower price—I saw her take up one coin and put down another, which Jones took away, and she immediately put down another, a good one—Jones then said that she came, not to pur<lb/>chase tobacco, but to ring the changes, and gave her in custody with the bad half-crown—she said, "Send to a silversmith and test it; I am quite certain it is good."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where was the half-crown when Jones took it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the glass portion of the counter—it had just left her hand and he took it immediately—she took up the three and had them and the counter<lb/>feit one in her hand at the same time—she then laid three down, and when Jones took away the counterfeit she put down the fourth half-crown—she first put down one, then two, and within 3 or 4 seconds the fourth—the</p>

On Thursday night, 10th March, or Friday morning, I was on duty in Great Chesterfield-street, Marylebone about five minutes past 12: I saw the prisoner there, standing against the King's Head public-house, which stands at the corner of Great Chesterfield-street and Little Woodstock-street—it has doors entering into each of those streets—he was standing with his back against the wall, with his hands be<lb/>hind him, near the door in Little Woodstock-street—I did not speak to</p>

               <p>him—I went round my beat, and came round again to the same spot, in about twenty or twenty-five minutes—the prisoner was there again, standing in the same position in the same place—I did not say anything to him at that time—I left him, and went round my beat again—it would take me about twenty minutes to walk round my beat; sometimes it may take twenty-five minutes—I returned to the same place a third time—that was about ten minutes or a quarter to 1—he was standing in the same place and in the same position—at that time the door of the public-house in Little Wood-stock-street was open—I spoke to him—I said, "Devine, how are you living now? what are you doing?" (I knew him—when I first knew him he was a shoeblack boy, several years back) he answered, "I have no settled place of residence at present, and nothing to do; but I expect to have something to do shortly"—that was all that passed—the door in Little Woodstock-street, belonging to the public-house, was then shut too, whilst I was talking to him—I then went round my beat again, leaving him standing in the same place and position—when I came back to the place he was gone, and the public-house was all closed; all the doors were closed, and the house was in darkness—that was about ten minutes past 1—I then went down Great Chesterfield-street to the right, and then into little Marylebone-street, and then to the left into Little Chesterfield-field, which is parallel with Great Chesterfield-street—in passing through that street I saw a man lying down on the pavement in front of No. 5, Little Chesterfield-street—that is about from seventy to eighty yards from the King's Head—he was lying partly on his right side; his head was towards the door of No. 5, and his feet towards a hoarding, which there was in the street, opposite No. 6—I went up to him and spoke to him—I said, "What are you doing here?"—he made an attempt to speak, but I could not understand him—his hat was against the hoarding, near his feet—he was bleeding from the back of the head—I took hold of him by the arms, and endeavoured to raise him up—there was a good deal of blood on the pavement—his right arm was saturated with blood flowing from the wound at the back of his head—when I took hold of him he caught hold of my cape, and got up partly on his knees—he tried to speak to me several times, but I could not make out what he said; he mattered something—another constable came to my assistance, and we took him to the station-house—he did not make himself intelligible to me—when we got to the station a surgeon was sent for, and his wounds were attended to, and I took him in a cab to the infirmary—when I first took him up I noticed that the fall of his trousers was undone—I did not observe the fob pocket or the trouser's pocket—he had no handkerchief on—I saw no watch, chain, or seal, or any money in his pockets—I did not search him—at the infirmary, as I was in the act <hi rend="italic">of</hi> undoing his clothes, he resisted very forcibly, and said, "Let me have my property; I had two sovereigns"—I did not know him previously—at the time I saw the prisoner standing in the way I have stated, there was no one else in the street—when I found the deceased lying there was no one about.</p>

I would have given you the halfpence for the lodging"—he said, "To tell you the truth, I did not like to ask you"—I told him I had not got the halfpence at present, or I would have given them to him for his lodging that evening—several halfpence were made up for him in the tap-room during the evening—I saw Mr. Duck there while the prisoner was there—the question was put to Mr. Duck to know if he would give him a penny towards his lodging—he said no, he would not, he <hi rend="italic">knowed</hi> him—he afterwards said he had got him a place of work, and he would not do it; afterwards, Mr. Duck made friends with him, and offered him a lodging—he said he would make him up a bed on the floor—the prisoner said he could do that, he had been used to lying about—that was all that passed—I think the prisoner left the house about 10, or it might have been a little after 10; he left before Mr. Duck—I saw no more of him that night.</p>

I am a medical practitioner—I knew the deceased, Joseph Duck, well—his age was about sixty—I last saw him about a fortnight previous to the murder—he was in the habit of wearing a watch—I have seen it many times—it was a large, old-fashioned English watch, silver, double cased, with figures, not letters upon it—he also wore a chain and seal—it was a curb chain, about six or eight inches long, with a large seal with a red stone—it was a yellow metal chain; I can't say whether it was gold or not—the seal was a large, old-fashioned seal, with a red stone in it—I can't say whether there was anything on the stone—this is exactly the description of seal without the stone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the Infirmary—the deceased, Joseph Duck, was brought there by the police, on the morning of 11th March—he was suffering apparently from the effects of intoxication and concussion of the brain—he was not sufficiently sensible to know what he was about—he spoke; at first we could hardly understand what he said, but afterwards he asked for two sovereigns, which he said were in his pockets—I was there when they were searched for—they were not found—I can't say whether it was exactly at that time, but I remember seeing that the fob of his trousers had been out across—the bottom of the fob had been cut away, and the lining of the trowsers also—his head was already dressed when he came to the Infirmary—I had a history of its having been dressed by the divisional surgeon of police—next morning I took off the plasters and examined the head—I found three cuts at the back of the head, running transversely across the back of the head—two of them were somewhat in a line with each other, and the third about an inch below those two.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you form any judgment from what direction the cuts had been inflicted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That would depend a good deal, I imagine, on the shape of the instrument—I could hardly judge from their appearance—I found there was a depressed fracture of the bone—he was trephined in my presence that same day—he died at 6 o'clock the same evening—I attribute his death to the injuries I observed—after death I examined the head and the injuries more carefully—I found one depression of the bone, and three fractures extending from that depression—one fracture was seven inches in length, running round the left side of the head; the second was about three inches in length, running upwards, and towards the right side of the head; and the third about two inches in length, running downwards, and to the right side of the head—there was a good deal of blood effused—that would be the effect of blows of that character, inflicted at that place—the immediate cause of death would be the effusion of blood, produced by the injuries on the skull.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. RANDALL</hi>. I am a graduate of the University of London—I saw the body of the deceased five or six times during the Friday—at first we were strongly under the impression that the injury was done with a cutting instru<lb/>ment, and I performed several experiments with an instrument like this, with a view to prove that it was not done by this instrument, but we produced three wounds of exactly the same character, on similar matter, not on a living subject.</p>

                  </hi>. M. R. C. S. I live at Limehouse—about the middle of November the child was brought to my surgery—I examined its head, and found a punctured wound penetrating to the left side of the skull, above the ear, through the membranes of the brain, and wounding the brain itself—the child survived longer than I expected it could have done, and I had it examined by a surgeon at one of the London hospitals—it died in March, and I made a post-mortem examination—after removing the top of the skull, I saw the wound in the brain, and pressing down upon it the brain collapsed, and nearly three-quarters of a pint of matter escaped—these scissors would be likely to produce the wound, and it could scarcely end otherwise than fatally—the child died from suppuration of the brain, caused by the wound.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you sure of that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Almost as sure as I can be of anything—matter formed in the brain—that might have been produced by other causes, but here was cause sufficient for it—a scald would do it if the scald was sufficient—if the scissors produced it, I should not have ex<lb/>pected it to have occurred before, there is such wonderful tenacity of life in children—it was about a year and a half old—I examined the traces of scalding when I made the post-mortem examination—I saw a redness, but that had nothing to do with the suppuration—the whole hemisphere of the brain was one mass of matter—the wound was about an inch and a half in depth—I could see the wound in the brain by means of a candle—the depth they penetrated to would depend upon the force with which they were thrown, and the resistance of the bone of the skull; but they wounded another person first slightly, and glanced off—the skull is not quite bone.</p>

I am the wife of Joseph William Bunbury, a licensed victualler, of Great Tower-street—I know the prisoners—they were at my house last Tuesday week, 29th March, between 9 and 10 o'clock, as near as I can guess—they were in a side bar, in a small box, by themselves—Bone called for a pot of porter—the little girl served them, and took the money—I was just inside the bar parlour at that time, and I saw Holmes get up on the shelf over the bar, and take 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver off a shelf—he dropped some of it as he was getting away—1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was found on the floor afterwards—he got down into the side box, and ran out into the street—I asked Bone twice</p>

               <p>to stop him, and be would not do so—he stood and looked at him—Holmes must have had assistance to get where he did—he could not hare got up without help—they were both close together—Bone was in such a situation that he could have helped Holmes up, no one else could—there was not a soul there but Bone—I next saw Holmes at the station-house, about 12 o'clock the same night—I knew him again—I have known him two or three years—we kept Bone and gave him into custody—I said to my husband in his hearing, "Hold him there till we get the other man as he is as bad, because he must have assisted him up, and would not stop him when I asked him," and my husband kept him till the policeman came—he then said he was only lighting his pipe, and he did not see any man come in and take the money.</p>

I am a cigar manufacturer, at 57 and 58, Crown-street, Finsbury—on the evening of 2d March, I left my premises about five minutes after 9, perfectly secured—from information I received I returned again at a little after 12 on the same evening—I found several police officers there, and a van standing in the street—I examined the van and found six sacks, representing coal sacks, made of black linen, full of cigars, which belonged to me—the sacks were not mine—I went into my warehouse by the side door with my own key—I found two more of these black sacks inside, full of cigars, one on the counter and one close to the door—some of the chests were empty; there were cigars in them when I left—I found nothing more removed—the value of the cigars in the van, and the sacks on my premises, was between 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe an entry was effected by a duplicate key at the private door—these are some of the cigars (<hi rend="italic">produce a</hi>)—they are British—I found the prisoners in custody on the following Friday evening, when I preferred this charge against "them—I know nothing of them—in addition to the robbery the main water pipes were severed, so that the fol<lb/>lowing morning the water came into the place like a fountain, and I should have lost 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property, if my neighbours, had not kindly assisted me to take the goods away—there must have been several men engaged in it; one man could not have packed the cigars in the time—I had to cut the sacks to get them out, they were fastened up so very tightly.</p>

I examined the prosecutor's premises on the morning of 3d March—in my opinion, an entrance had been effected by a duplicate key at the side door—the front window had been broken, and the back window of the kitchen had been opened, and there were foot-marks which I could trace over the leads to a court, to Barford's-buildings, Earle-street—there were also marks down the face of the wall—the water-pipes in the kitchen were cut asunder—the shop was in great confusion, and some of the boxes emptied—I heard Marshall make a statement at the station; he said, "I was in East-lane, Walworth, about 8 o'clock; I met a man who asked me whether I knew anybody who had a horse and van to let. I said, 'I have got one.' He then went with me to the stables, and we got the horse in the yard, and then we got the van. I then went with him as far as London-bridge, when I got down to make water, and when I returned the horse and van were gone. The name on the van was 'George Hunt, Haville-street, Southampton-street, Camberwell.' "I examined the van; there was no such name on it; there was "Camberwell, Surrey," on the side, and "Coleman," on the front of it—there were marks of something having been nainted out—Marshall stated that ho had lost the van about 9 o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the London and County Bank at Knightsbridge—the prisoner kept an account there—in November, 1862, he applied to me for au advance of money—I advanced him 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by dis<lb/>counting</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186404110064"/>
               <p>two bills for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. respectively—they were debited to his account; put with his vouchers and given up to him. (<hi rend="italic">William Base, clerk to Messrs. Mullens, proved the service of a notice upon the prisoner and his solicitor, to produce the various bills alluded to in the evidence.</hi>) The bills were dated the 12th of November, 1862, drawn by the prisoner and accepted "William Neats"—the application was for a loan of 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the bills were drawn in that way for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., simply because we hap<lb/>pened not to have a stamp for 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were four months' bills; they would become due about the 15th of March—on the 20th of March, a few days after they became due, I received 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the prisoner—I carried on the loan by discounting a bill for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. drawn by him and purporting to be accepted by Mr. Neats, dated the 14th of March, 1863, at four months—that was done by agreement with the prisoner—on the 17th of July that 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was paid by 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash, and a renewal for 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was by agreement with the prisoner—that 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was drawn by the prisoner and purported to be accepted by William Neats—it was dated the 7th of July—on the 10th of November, the day on which that bill became due, we gave the usual notice to the prisoner, and we held the bill till the 14th of November, on which day he called and paid 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., giving me this bill for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated November 12th, 1863, drawn by the prisoner upon, and accepted by William Neats and Son, at three months—that is the bill which is the subject of the present indictment—upon two previous occasions I had objected to Mr. Neats making his bills payable at our bank, as he had no account there—the prisoner said that Mr. Neats had no private account at Glyn's, and he did not wish to accept them for Neats and Son, as his son knew nothing about the transaction—the 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill accepted by Neats and Son is made payable at Glyn's—I received it in that form—this conversation took place on the 18th of July, on the occasion of discounting the previous bill, and on an occasion subsequent to that—I did not require that it should be accepted by Neats and Son; I required that it should be payable at Glyn's—the prisoner called on me on the morning of the 16th February, 1864, and stated that two acceptances of Neats and Sons for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. respectively, became due on that morning, and he proposed to pay 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. off the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, and to renew the 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—I suggested that it would be better to have one bill for 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he then left, as I imagined, to get a new bill, to get Mr. Neats' acceptance or promissory note—this was about twenty minutes past 11 o'clock—he returned about 4, or a little after, and complained that I had not prevented these bills from being presented—I told him, in the first place, I had received no instructions from him to retire the bills, and secondly, that, even had I done so, it was too late, for the bills had been presented when he was with me in the morning—he wished to know if he should get them himself by going to the City—he said that Mr. Neats was very much annoyed—I noticed that the prisoner seemed a great deal agitated, but I attributed that to the bills having been presented contrary to his wish—he asked when we should have them back—I told him at half-past 10 the following morning—he then left, and agreed to come in the morning—he did so, and while he was with me the bills were brought back from the head office—Mr. Cutler, the accountant, in my presence, showed him this memorandum written on the 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, "orders not to pay this accept<lb/>ance, being a forgery"—upon that the prisoner said that Mr. Neats had repu<lb/>diated the bill because he imagined he had no bill becoming due for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that date, that Mr. Neats thought the 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was at six mouths, instead of three, and that he therefore denied its being genuine—I told</p>

               <p>him if that were the case, he had better bring Mr. Neats to me, and he then left, as he said, for that purpose—Mr. Neats did call upon me some days afterwards; the prisoner was not present at that time; he called alone—I had seen the prisoner in the meanwhile.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was duly paid by the prisoner, was it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it was—that is to say, we debited his current account so soon as we had funds to meet it—there were other money matters between us—it was debited to his account as an unpaid bill—I could not have given him that bill, it having been marked a forgery—I am not sure whether he applied for it—I don't know whether he did or not; but for its being so marked he could have had it—I don't recollect whether he applied for it; at all events he did not appear anxious about it—in the first instance there were two bills for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were re<lb/>duced by the payment of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and acceptances given for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>,—the arrangement then made was, that there was to be a subsequent reduction of not less than 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill became due, Mr. Neats came with the prisoner; he was not a party to that arrangement—the prisoner and he came together—the prisoner came into my room—Mr. Neats remained at the counter, but seeing him at the counter, and Mr. Wykes handing me the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and joining Mr. Neats, I imagined that Mr. Neats was cognizant of the transaction—Mr. Neats says that the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. hill was a forgery—there was no other bill at that time except the 1,0002. bill—Mr. Neats did not transact any business with me that day—he did not speak to me at all—he and the prisoner came together and left together—a new bill was given for 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot tell whether it was accepted then and there, without seeing the bill—I cannot speak from personal knowledge, whether I got the bill back again—in the usual routine it would be debited to his account, but we do not keep them, when the pass-book is made up the cheques are put into the pocket—I think that is done by all joint stock banks—I don't think Mr. Neats was present when the business respecting the 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was transacted—I should not like to say positively whether I got that 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill at that interview, but my impression is that I did; in the absence of the bill I cannot recollect—it was alleged that the first two bills for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. were forgeries—Mr. Neats' expression to me was that with the exception of the one for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which came due on the 15th of February, that is the last 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, he had not given the prisoner an acceptance for eighteen months—the two first bills were not renewed by the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, until four or five days after they were due—we had them for a few days until the prisoner called—they were presented, because they were due at our office, so that our having possession of them would be presenting them—they were not presented to Mr. Neats, nor was any notice given to him that they were due at our bank—the prisoner arranged to renew them, so that they were not dishonoured—Mr. Neats was not communicated with—the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which the prisoner paid was upon the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. genuine bill.</p>

I was not there; and I want to put that right, because it might bring my name into question—I was there on one occasion, but not at that time; it was a year and a half or two years previous—I am positive I was not there at that time, because I bad no occasion to be there—I was not at the bank in 1863; that I can declare on my oath—I was very sorry for the prisoner's position when I ascertained this was a forgery—it did not alter my friendship for him at all—I I was not dining with him when he was taken into custody; I was dining at the same table—he was not dining—he sent to say he wished to see me at the Bridge House Hotel, and I went there, and had dinner at the same table with him—I was exceedingly good friends with him—I am not the prosecutor—I am not opposed to the prisoner; quite the contrary—I have not said that he might have imagined he had authority to sign my name—I have never said that—I said at the Mansion House that he might think be could take a liberty with my name, but that he had not my authority to do it—if he had asked me to accept the bills, no doubt I would have done it, out of the respect I have for him—I did say at the Mansion House, that I thought he might have supposed he could take a liberty with my name, and I think so now, from the terms of intimacy upon which we were—he has paid this bill—I have not lost a sixpence, nor has any one else, that I know of.</p>

I live in Galway-street, St. Luke's—I am the proprietor of 4, Lempster-terrace, James-street, Peter-street, Islington—on Friday night, 11th July last, Mrs. Harding, my tenant of that house, left—I was desirous of obtaining possession of the house, and went to it on the Saturday morning about 10 o'clock—I did not see the prisoner there when I first went—I saw a child about six months old in the back parlour, lying on the floor on a pillow or some rags, in a very filthy condition—it had some clothing on—it was unwashed, and had all manner of filth about it, face, hands, and everything, quite offensive—I did not see the prisoner until 5 in the afternoon—the child was left alone in the house four hours, to my knowledge, while I was in the</p>

               <p>house—when I saw the prisoner at 5, she was somewhat in liquor—she was in the room when I returned, after having been home for some refreshment—I had been away about an hour—I found the child in the same condition in the same spot—it was not strong enough to cry; it was lying in an exhausted state; it was very emaciated—I was Dot there on the Sunday—I went again on the Monday morning, about 9 o'clock—the prisoner was there—she was quite sober then—I was there two or three times on the Monday for some hours—the prisoner bad one room—it was her own furniture, what there was—there was no bed, only a dirty mattress on the ground, and the child was lying on that—I was told that her husband is a labourer at the Docks—I saw the prisoner several times on the Monday—I did not see her intoxicated that day—the child was in the same condition that I saw it in on the Saturday—I was there again on the Tuesday, and towards evening I saw her some-what the worse for liquor—on the Wednesday, I had a request from some-body to come down to the house—I found a policeman there—the door was locked—I forced it open—I found the child still there—the police had sent for me—I had not made any complaint to anybody—I had spoken to the prisoner—I wished her to leave the house, that was all—I had not spoken to the police about getting me possession of the house; I was in hopes they would go away—Mr. Mather, the surgeon, was sent for—some milk was administered to the child, and Mrs. Molloy took it to the Workhouse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 53, Bunhill-row and Essex-street, Islington—on 15th July, I was called to the house in Lempster<lb/>terrace, and found the child in a dying condition—it was in a most filthy, offensive state, extremely emaciated, and all but dead—a bottle of medicine was standing near, of which a portion appeared to have been given, and had been ejected from the stomach, the child's linen was covered with it—I had a little warm milk given to it immediately, and then requested the persons in attendance to take it to the workhouse—it was suffering from diarrhoea—I think the death arose in part from the diarrhoea and the emaciation, in fact from inanition completely—I think the diarrhoea most likely arose from the debilitated condition into which the system was reduced—I apprehend that had been caused by want of food and care—I was not present at the post-mortem examination—assuming there was no internal disease, I do not think from the external symptoms that the child could have arrived at the state in which I saw it without great neglect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

                  </hi>, M. D. I am medical officer of the Islington workhouse—on 15th July, about half-past 1, the child was brought to the workhouse—I went there to attend it, and found it lying on a bundle of rags, in a very filthy, emaciated condition—it had evidently been suffering from diarrhoea with <hi rend="italic">prolapsus ani,</hi> in consequence of the prolonged diarrhoea—I ordered it to be washed and attended to—it died about 4 o'clock that afternoon—I made a post-mortem examination next day—the brain was healthy and very little ensanguined, less than usual; the lungs were healthy, but not quite inflated, from want of power; the heart was also healthy; in the stomach we found a little food, which had been given according to my directions—that had not been ejected from the stomach after it was given; the whole intestines otherwise were entirely empty—I found no particular disease—I attribute the death to the continuance of the diarrhoea causing emaciation, and to apparent neglect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would the diarrhoea have the effect of emptying the stomach? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the child appeared to have been neglected—a little cold milk, and small doses of brandy and water were given to it in the workhouse—those would be proper things to give it—the dirty appearance of the child indicated neglect—that would not cause its death—the diarrhoea caused the death—I heard before the Coroner that the prisoner's husband was a labourer in the docks—I don't know what his wages are—if she had applied to the work-house, anything would have been given her—it is never refused there, even though the father was in work—I believe that is generally known.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Angel-terrace—the deceased child was brought to me by one of the witnesses, I think, on 7th July—I was in the surgery at the time, my assistant saw it, and I concurred in what he gave it—it was medicine to check the diarrhoea—it was suffering from diarrhoea, that was caused probably in part by teething, but I judged it had chronic diarrhoea of long continuance—I could not form any positive infer<lb/>ence as to the care that had been taken of the child—from what I saw, it seemed to be in a very exhausted condition, but I am bound to say, that a great many children have been brought to me in a state of as great apparent neglect as this child; that apparent neglect might have arisen from disease—I observed no neglect beyond emaciation and want of food—if a child is not nourished by its food, there would be emaciation; in that case, it would be attributable to disease and not to neglect—I observed nothing that I could truly call neglect.</p>

                  </hi>. Until 20th February I was master of the barge "Acton," which was at Woolwich—on that day I received 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Messrs. Sturman and Clerk of London—it was paid to me by John Anderson between 11 and 12—about half-past 2 I was in the George and Dragon public-house, in Ratcliffe high way—the money consisted of six 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, twelve sovereigns, and a few shillings in silver—it was in my left-hand pocket—I was passing along the Highway when O'Brien offered to give me a little dog—I told him I did not want the dog, and said, "Perhaps it does not belong to you"—he said, "Oh yes, it does," and he would give it to me—I said, "I will give you a pint of beer for it"—I did not want the dog—I took O'Brien to the George and Dragon public-house, and gave him a pint of beer for it—he did not tell me what public-house to go to—we went into the taproom—two coal heavers were there when we entered—I ordered a pint of beer with some gin in it, but I drank very little of it—I was quite sober—I was sitting alongside the table, and O'Brien was sitting near the two coal heavers, and when I got up to go aboard my ship he caught hold of me and choked me—I had paid for the gin and beer—I took the money out of my waistcoat-pocket—I had not said a word about having money—one of the others took the money out of my pocket, and they cut away and ran out of one door, and one out of the other—it was done in an instant—I hung by O'Brien, till I gave him in charge—I could not swear to the other two.</p>

Gibson and Co. antimony refiners"—it was a pretty large board; it covered the width of the gateway, so that carts could go in—there was no person in the firm besides me, but I intended to have taken in my son—Mr. Pratt succeeded me, and I left next day—I did not go to the works after that—the acceptance, Gibson and Co to this bill is not my writing—I first saw it, I think, on the Friday, and Ross and Wittkower were taken on Wednesday or Thursday—from the time I transferred the business to Mr. Pratt—I had seen nothing of Hodson—I had never given him any authority to sign my name to bills of Exchange—this acceptance is his writing; the acceptance only, I think—(<hi rend="italic">Read; "January 26th,</hi> 1863, <hi rend="italic">four months after date, pay to my order</hi> 100<hi rend="italic">l. accepted payable at the London and</hi>

               <p>we went through the same form again; I should not have paid him without—I do not know whether Mr. Warr is here—on this cheque of Bachelor's here is "Hodson and Gibson, or order;" that is very like my writing, and this "A Gibson" underneath is written by me—I wrote that to send to my account kept in the name of Gibson, because I had no other account—the first transaction I had with Mr. Bachelor the invoice was "A. Gibson"—I paid him that by cheque—the next time I had goods from him to the amount of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; Hodson's name was on that invoice, and I scratched it out—I told Hodson that Bachelor had sent an invoice with his name upon it—he said, "He has no right to do so"—I said, "You write to him about it"—I wrote to Bachelor and told him—I have not got Mr. Bachelor's letter with the invoice; all his invoices are different—here is one, "Gibson and Co."—I saw him afterwards and told him—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is another cheque of Bachelor's; this is "Gibson and Hodson," but I do not know anything of it—there is no writing of mine on it; I never saw it before to my knowledge—it was not paid to the firm for any goods: he did not owe me any money when that cheque was drawn—this is Hodson's writing, I believe, on the back of it—I never represented Hodson to anybody as a partner, and I told Bachelor personally that he was not a partner—I know Messrs. Jewin, of Miles-lane, City, and I do not know a person named Jacqueray, in their employ; nor did Hodson introduce me as his partner to any person in their employ, nor did we after that all three go across to a public-house together; nor did I say that I had joined Hodson, and I hoped the gentleman with us would do all he could for me—I bought plumbago from Jewin and Son, not from the party you are speaking of; he is only a porter—I do know him, I know the person I have seen here—I do not recollect going with any person in the employ of Jewin and Son, but will not swear I did not—no deposit was paid for the plumbago; what I bought I paid for in full—I do not remember anything being written on the paper when I bought the plumbago—I do not know a person named Brown, in the employ of the metal or metre manufacturers, in Kingsland-road, neither father nor son—I never dealt with the company—I have never said to Mr. Worsam, my land<lb/>lord, that the prisoner was my partner—here is the receipt for my rent, made out to me simply—I dealt with Jewin and Co.—I have not told their foreman that Hodson was my partner—their bills were made out to Mr. Gibson—I only had one transaction with them—I have seen Mr. Evans, who keeps the Cheshire Arms; I have not told him that the prisoner was my partner—I know Mr. Mitlett, who applied to me for the situation of agent; the prisoner was present—I did not propose that he should act as traveller for myself and Hodson, but for me only—I have not the prisoner's book previous to 12th December; he had memorandums previous to that, and he complained that he sometimes lost them, so I gave him a book—I have none of the memorandums; he took them.</p>

I am an iron-merchant, of Bethnal-green—I supplied Commercial-wharf and delivered forty or fifty parcels of goods there, and little papers with each, in the name of Gibson and Hodson; but the "Hod<lb/>son" was scratched out; Gibson scratched it out before my face, or I might have scratched it out—he said that it was "Gibson"—these are dated the 26th and 28th, but it does not say of what—these others are October 19th, 23d and 24th—after five or Six weeks the name of Hodson was put on the others; that was while Mr. Gibson was there—I never saw Mr. Gibson, except on Saturdays, when I went for the money, and he sat there and paid it, both before the alteration of the name and afterwards.</p>

On Wednesday, 2d March, about half-past 8 in the evening, I took the prisoner in Commercial-road, Ratcliffe—I told him I should charge him with being concerned with three others, not in custody, with breaking into Mr. Vane's warehouse, 12, Narrow-street, Ratcliffe, and stealing two bolts of canvas, and twelve brushes—he said, "I know nothing about it; if you wanted me, you could have had me before"—I said, "I have been looking for you since Monday"—I took him to the station—he was searched, and I found this knife and a key upon him—I examined the warehouse—there was room enough for a man to get through the dog-hole.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Richard Duke, sail cloth maker, of Lower-east, Smithfield—I left the premises on the evening of 9th December, from half-past 6 to 7 o'clock—I left no one there, I was the last there—I closed the warehouse—I should think there were about 400 bolts of canvas on the premises when I left—I returned about half-past 7 next</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186404110092"/>
               <p>morning—I undid the padlock, and then began to undo the warehouse-door; instead of turning it twice, as I usually do, I only had to turn the catch, and the door flew open; I had double-locked it the night before—when I got in I missed a quantity of canvas, which I had seen there the night before I left—I could not at that moment tell the amount; it was about fifty-one bolts—one of the desks in the counting-house had been forced open, the drawers were open, and papers lying about—no entrance could have been effected at the back—the padlock must have been taken off and put on again—I gave information to the police—on 29th December, I went to Messrs. Morrisons, of Norton Folgate, to make a purchase of some goods; I there accidently saw some bolts of canvas, and recognised them as belonging to my master, which I had left in the warehouse the night previous to the robbery; there were about twenty-seven or twenty-eight there—on the following day, the 30th, I went to Tatton, and there saw twenty-one more bolts, which I also recognised as my master's property—I told Tatton they were my master's property—he said, "As I hear they have been stolen, as a man of honour I shall give them up"—I took all the canvas home with me that evening, the twenty-seven bolts and the twenty-one—I afterwards took stock of the can<lb/>vas—there were then about three bolts missing—I went to Tatton next day and told him so—he said he had cut them up for tarpaulins, but as a man of honour he would pay for them—the value of the whole of the canvas was about 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the first quality is about 17<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per yard, the second quality about 14<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and there were two bolts of about 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per yard—the twenty-one that I saw at Tatton's were not in the same state as when they were on our premises, they had been undone and done up again—any one could tell they had been undone—there was no alteration in the numbers that I am aware of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILIPPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many qualities have you got in this canvas? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There are generally about five qualities; we mostly have four or five qualities in our warehouse—they vary in price a good deal; No. 2 would be about 16 1/2. <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and No. 3, 16<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; it falls a half-penny a num<lb/>ber up to 7 or 8—we are continually getting it in and out, sometimes we have a great quantity in the warehouse, and sometimes not so much—some of this canvas might have been in the warehouse two or three months, some a week, and some a fortnight—we are continually getting them in by railway and by steam-boat from the makers at Dundee—most of this canvas we had had about a fortnight—it was bought in different lots—we buy of the manu<lb/>facturers—we have a stamp put upon our canvas from a tin plate, not our name—it is, "Extra twice-boiled Navy"—that is a stamp used in the trade—I put this on myself—different warehouses have different stamps—I never saw one like ours—I will not swear there is not any—it is for the purpose of denoting the quality—this is the stamp I identified it by—there is no ticket upon this—there were others with paper tickets on them—Mr. Duke's name was not on them, only the number of yards—the value of the canvas stolen was about 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to us as sellers—I can't tell what my master gave for it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a second quality canvas, worth about 14<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard; at the present time it would be worth more; three months ago, it might have been worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we sell to the trade at a less price than to general dealers—I saw a book at Tatton's, he showed it to me, I saw an entry of the sale of three bolts—he said that he bought the canvas of a man named McCarthy, in Nightingale-lane—T was aware that Tatton had seen Mr. Duke before I saw him—canvas does not very often come to us in a dirty state, it comes in bales, with a wrapper over it to keep it clean—it may get dirty in the warehouse</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186404110093"/>
               <p>—if I was going to buy canvas, I should examine it to see if it was injured—we should not open it, just look at it—if we did examine it, we should untie it and tie it up afresh—it is not usual to untie it, if it comes from a manufacturer—if a bolt of canvas like this was brought to me for sale, I don't think I should open it to look at it—if it was duty outside I should do so, and then I should relay it in the best way I could, for the purpose of sale afterwards—the twenty-one bolts I saw at Tatton's, had been undone and tied up again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEWIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In what condition were the bolts of canvas when you last saw them at your warehouse? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Quite clean—those I saw at Morri<lb/>son's on the 29th December, were very dirty—those I saw at Tatton's, were clean outside, but dirty inside—that was twenty days after the robbery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At what per yard do you reckon the canvas to make 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were forty-two yards in a bolt, and we reckon a bolt to cost from 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the average would be 16<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard to come to about 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was in consequence of something I heard at Morrison's, that I went to Tatton.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it the practice to put those bolts in a press, and then have them tied? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If they are going to be shipped abroad they are put in a press, but if they are for sale in London, they merely put a string round them—that would not alter the shape of them—these have not been put into a press—there were from thirty-five to forty bolts of the best quality.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">McCarthy. Q.</hi> Did you look round the warehouse on 10th December, and see how many bolts you missed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We could not tell how many we missed till we took stock—on the Saturday, 11th or 12th, we had some bills printed previous to taking stock—we took a general average of what we missed—we advertised forty-seven bolts—the book Tatton showed me looked like a day-book, in it was an entry where he had sold three bolts of canvas, and got paid for them—that was all I saw in the book—the number on the bolt does not denote the quality, only the thickness of the canvas—we lost about seventeen of No. 1, about twenty-three of No. 2, of the best, and then some Nos. 5 and 6, I think—there were some No. 3, they were very common, two bolts at 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Tatton told me he had paid you 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the canvas—he said, "I paid 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it to a man named McCarthy, in Nightingale-lane.</p>

"—we went into the Angel public-house, and bad a glass of half and half with him.</p>

Come and have something to drink"—I said, "No, I shall take you to the station," and I did so—I then went and saw the prosecutor, came back to the station, and said to Tatton," I have seen Mr. Duke, and he states that at the time you gave the canvas up to him, you promised to find McCarthy. and that you would prosecute him"—McCarthy was then present—Tatton said, "So I will, and I will have my solicitor down at the Thames in the morning for that purpose"—he did charge McCarthy, and appeared at the Police-court on the following day, and gave evidence against him—on the 23<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, I apprehended him again at the Thames Police-court, and told him again that he would be charged with stealing thirty-seven bolts of canvas from Mr. Duke's place, in Lower East, Smithfield—he said, "Who will charge me?"—I said, "I will" he said, "You had better let my solicitor know; I have a counsel inside"—I said, "Very well, I will let him know," and I did so.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">McCarthy's Defence.</hi> I have no friends, or I could prove that Dunaway did bring me that beer and brandy. My family want to send me away. The two boys have been put up to swear against me. To speak to a certain day four months ago, it stands to reason that two boys of their age could not state any day without being put up to it, and told the day; but they are so well trained, that I believe they cannot be broken down. I believe my wife would be very glad if I was sent away for a little time. As to that letter, the policeman gave me brandy and beer, which, after three weeks' starvation in prison, had such an effect upon me, that I could not tell what I was doing. He said if I would write such a letter, it would be the means of my getting off better; but he only got me to write it that I might commit myself. He has been in the habit of coming to see my wife where she now lives, and giving her and the boys money. Young boys like those would not, perhaps, know why he came; but they want to send me away.</p>

                  </hi>, I am a lighterman, of 9, Thomas-place—on the after<lb/>noon of 2d March, about ten minutes to 6, I was in Ratcliff-highway, near Old Gravel-lane—the prisoner, Burgess, came behind me and put his hand in my right hand trousers' pocket—I looked over my shoulder, and said, "All right mate; I know you; you have picked my pocket"—I grasped his hand in my pocket, and tried to hold it—I lost that, and turned round and caught him by the collar—he up with his fist, and struck me on the right eye—I saw him when he struck me—it was this one with the light coat—he gives the name of Burgess—I called out, "Jack!" two or three times, and" Police!"—the other prisoner directly gave me a violent blow on the neck—that was the first time I had seen him—I was then surrounded by six or eight men</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186404110103"/>
               <p>and women, and received several blows—Burgess turned down Little Gravel-lane, and I pursued him—John Platt was close to me—when it took place we were walking side by side—I was knocked down a second time in Old Gravel-lane by Buckley—Piatt came and released me when Buckley and another one had got me down in a corner close to the Dock-gates, and were ill using me—I got before them, and saw Burgess walking a little distance ahead, with his coat off and under his arm—I saw two policemen on the opposite side of the road—I then got close to Platt again, and saw Burgess walking on—we walked behind him—the police came up, and I gave him in custody—there is a bridge there—I lost sight of Buckley, but have no doubt of his identity—I was sober—I have been a teetotaller four years—I lost a half-crown and a florin.</p>

I say was Bur<lb/>gess, about fourteen yards off, with his coat under his arm—Platt seized him, and took him in custody—it was then about ten minutes past 6—I saw the time coming down the Highway, and it was not ten minutes past then—at the time Burgess jumped on my back Platt, was side by side with me.</p>

Jack!</hi> on missing my money—up to that time I had neither seen nor heard anything of Buckley—Pratt then said, "What is the matter?"—when Burgess jumped on my back, he said, "I know you mate," as I looked over my shoulder—I was rather angry at his jumping on my back in that way—I did not fall down then—we had a little scuffling, and he escaped, and went down Gravel-lane—I then saw Buckley in the Highway—there was a little crowd at the beginning of Gravel-lane—there were two or three women—there was fighting down the lane—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186404110104"/>
               <p>when the police first appeared, the crowd halloed, "Down with them; keep them down," and" Boot them"—I do not think I heard the crowd cry, "Shame"—this happened on Wednesday evening, and I next saw Buckley on the following Monday night; five days afterwards—I believe I had seen him once before this night—when I spoke to the police about it, I did not hear them say, "Oh, we know the man"—as soon as I gave Burgess in charge, I made my way out of the crowd to avoid further violence, and walked to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lighterman, of 17, New-street, Poplar—I was with Cates on 2d March, walking down the Highway in conversation—I missed him, and saw him some distance away, singing out, <hi rend="italic">"Jack! Jack!</hi>"—I went back, and he pointed to Burgess, and said, "That man has picked my pocket my "—before he could say the words, one of the party struck him, and Burgess ran away—I went and caught him in the Highway—Cates came up, and we both caught hold of him—I saw Buckley in the Highway, and there were three women there—I cannot say where Buckley was then, because there were such a gang of them to get Burgess away, that we were over<lb/>powered—we then went down Old Gravel-lane—Burgess saw me following him, and turned round and made a strike at me, but I leaned on one side and struck at him—I looked round on my left, and saw Buckley and another of the gang with Cates down on the ground, in a corner, striking him—I pulled Buckley off him, and the other one got up and ran away—it was then a few minutes after 6—it was not dark; it was a little dusk—Buckley got away, but we pursued him, and just as we got to the bridge they made some bitter oaths how they would serve us if we pursued them over the bridge—the prisoners were among the gang—Burgess, hearing that there was a policeman over the bridge, pulled off his coat, put it under his arm, and walked steadily, like a man going home from his work—I ran after him, put my arms round his arms, and gave him in custody.</p>

I am a carpenter of East Stratford, Stratford New Town—I attended some pleasure grounds in a field near the Eastern Counties Railway, on Easter Monday—I was standing close by the ropes, looking at a race—my watch was in my left-hand waistcoat-pocket, and I saw the prisoner Jacobs take it out, and pass it to Adams—they were almost close together—I seized them both—I did not say anything, that I am aware of—the chain was left, and it fell out of my pocket—I have the bow of the watch, which some one picked up from the ground and gave me.</p>

               <p>"No; of course not, if it is your cousin"—the prisoner, John Ogden came on Christmas eve, and spent the evening with us—I accompanied him to the barracks about tattoo time, 9 o'clock, and he said to me on the way there, "Mr. Cox, you are blessed with a good wife"—I said, "I have no reason to complain"—on Christmas day he came again in the afternoon—my wife in<lb/>vited him—he came about 2 o'clock, and I went with him to the barrack yard, about 4—I had a birdcage at that time, which I missed some time after that—I don't know exactly the day—I asked my wife where it was gone, and she said she had lent it to a friend, I should get it again—I said she had no business to do so, as it was my property—Ogden came to my house almost every day for a week after that, then he stopped away a few days, and then came again—he said he had volunteered to go with a detachment to Jersey, and he gave me a book which he said he did not want to carry with him, and said, "I dare say I shall not see you again"—that was about eight or nine days after Christmas—on 5th February I went to my work as usual shortly after 5, when I returned at night I missed my wife, and also some of the goods—a chest of drawers, a sofa bedstead, a bed and bedding; some chairs, two tables, two pictures, a stuffed bird, a set of tea-things, and a quantity of crockery—they were not all my property—the sofa bedstead was bought after our marriage; the pictures were my property, and part of the bedding, not the bed—the sofa bedstead was hers previously—the stuffed bird was not bought with my money, or the two tables, or the set of tea-trays—the bird<lb/>cage was my property—the crockery was mostly bought after our marriage—I found all those things gone—from information I received, I went to the front parlour of the house 59, William-street, and found them there—the prisoners were in the room—I asked Ogden if he was comfortable there—he made me some sort of answer, which I could not understand—I said, "I shall make you uncomfortable directly"—he then began to dress himself, and said he had some duty to do at the barracks, and wished me to take no more notice of it—the birdcage was found in Ogden's quarters at the barracks—I did not take it there—I was with the policeman when he found it—I was never in those quarters before then.</p>

I am the wife of Richard Hodge of 137, Bridge-street, Greenwich, and live next door to the prosecutor—on Sunday, 28th February, at half-past 7, I was standing at my door, and saw Collins come from the prosecutor's area gate with his boots in his hands—I saw him put his boots on and lace them up—he shut the gate after him, shook his trousers down over his boots, and said, "Now I am all right," and went away towards Deptford—I had seen him twice before—he had not got anything with him—this was from a quarter to twenty minutes past 7.</p>

I am a baker, at No. 49, Regent-street, Lambeth—on 2d March the prisoner came to my shop—I served him with a penny loaf—he gave me a bad half-crown—I gave him a two-shilling piece and five penny pieces in change besides the loaf—directly he got outside the shop he went away very quickly—I tried the money and found it to be bad—I put it on one side—the next evening he came in about half an hour later and asked for half a quartern loaf—I asked which sort he would take—he said he did not care which, he was not particular—I put the loaf on the scale—he tendered me a bad half-crown—I went round the counter, shut the doór, and detained him, and gave him in charge of the constable with the half-crown—he said he had just taken the half-crown—he said he was not there the night before, that he was at the play—I am certain he is the man.</p>

I am the wife of Thomas Holmes, an engineer, of 14, Lambeth-walk—I know the prisoner—he is a carpenter, and had worked on the premises for about a week—we had only moved in on Monday; the day before this happened—on Tuesday we went to bed about 11—my husband and I fastened the doors and windows—on Wednesday morning I came down about twenty minutes to 6, and found the back windows open, which looks on a yard; the shutters had been forced open—three large clothes' chests, which had not been taken up stairs, and which when I went to bed were the largest at bottom and the smaller at the top, near the only window in the room—they had been moved, and prized open—we missed three shawls, three dresses, and some blankets and sheets, value 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they had taken the best, and left the rest—in the yard we found the prisoner—my husband said, "What are you doing here?"—he said, "I am coming to my work"—my husband said, "Where are your tools I"—he said, "I do not know"—I said, "I saw last night, when we went to bed, they were behind this door"—it had been taken away—I had used a hammer out of the basket over night—another basket of tools belonging to another carpenter were safe—the prisoner, when told the place was robbed, said, "It is a bad job for a poor fellow to lose his tools, "but he seemed indifferent about it, and went to his work—I did not hear any one knock at the door for admission—the window is about sixty yards from the road, but there is a stable at the back.</p>

I am foreman to a manure manufacturer, and live at 26, James-street, York-street, Walworth—on 19th February, about I or half-past in the morning, when I was in bed, I heard a noise, as if somebody was breaking into my premises—I got out of bed, opened the window, and saw that the parlour shutters were wide open—I had fastened them before going to bed—I called "Police!" as loud as I could—my housekeeper hearing the noise, came into my room—I told her to look out of the window while I put my trousers on—I put my hand out of the window and touched the top of the shutters and put them to—they were gently opened again, and a head came out—my housekeeper said, "Short, here they are"—I looked out, and saw the prisoner—he looked up at me, and said, "Short, Short, don't be frightened; it is only Dudley"—I had known him previously—I said, Oh, you vagabond!" and he got out of the window, made use of some filthy expressions, and went away—a policeman came, and I went down and looked about—a lot of my papers were spread over the floor, a tea-caddy that I used to keep my cash in was moved on to the carpet, and a window was broken, and next day I missed from a drawer a silk pocket-handkerchief, which I had</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and act as housekeeper to the prosecutor—on the night of 19th February, I was disturbed by his getting out of bed and moving about his room—I went to his bedroom door, and asked what was the matter—he said, "Come in; somebody has broken into the house"—before I could get in, I heard him call "Police!" three times—he told me to watch the window while he put on his clothes—I did so, and I saw the parlour window gently open, and something come out—Short said, "I will have you, whoever you are"—the man carelessly put his hand on the window-cill, and said, "Don't be frightened, Short; it is only Harry Dudley;" and as he got out of the window, I distinctly saw his face—he said, "You vagabond, to break into the house"—he said, "Go to b—y," and ran from the window right round the corner—I have not the slightest doubt it was the prisoner—I had seen him once or twice before, coming backwards and forwards to Mr. Short's house to work—I had seen him about 4 o'clock that afternoon—I did not go into the parlour that night; but next morning I saw the papers all scattered about, and the box they had been in empty—the tea-caddy was broken open, and the middle pane of the window was broken close at the bottom bolt of the shutters—the shutters had been fastened the night before.</p>

About half-past 1, on the morning of 19th February, from information I received, I went to the prosecutor's house—I found that an entry had been made by forcing open the shutters—they open outwards—there is a bolt to each shutter, and one of them had apparently been pulled away from the hole—the window was open—a square of glass was broken in the centre close, to one of the bolts—I examined the room—I found a number of papers scattered about, and marks of a dirty footmark on the table under the window—a drawer in a chest of drawers had been broken open, apparently by a chisel or jemmy.</p>
