Alfred Tilley was an errand boy in his service, at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week—he had been there, I think, about ten weeks when he was taken into custody—he was employed in the braid machine room, on the ground floor—the silk is kept in the ware-house, on the first floor—about a fortnight before Tilley was apprehended a person in the warehouse called my attention to some bundles of silk; they were loose—four hanks had been taken from them—nothing more occurred to excite my attention till the morning the boy was taken, Friday, 20th Oct.—Samuels and I counted some hanks that morning in the first floor warehouse, where I am always selling goods—Tilley was away at that time—after the boy Tilley returned from his breakfast he made an excuse to go upstairs into the warehouse to fetch a knife, and he must have come down with some silk in his pocket; for I went upstairs, and found that four hanks of silk were missing—I then searched the boy, and found on him only 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—young Mr. Samuels then went down into the vault, and found four hanks of silk behind some moulds—I had noticed Tilley go to that part of the house several times that morning—at 7 o'clock</p>

               <p>in the evening, just as Tilley was going from work, I went into the vault, and found that the silk was gone—I then searched him, and found on him the four hanks of silk that were missing—they were new and were worth 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. trade price—18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is a very inadequate price for them—Tilley made a state<lb/>ment to me, and I took him to Mr. Griffiths, his master's house, in Down<lb/>ham-road, Kingsland, who was unwell, and had not been in business that day; I afterwards took Tilley back, sent for a constable, and gave him into custody—the constable made an arrangement with Tilley, in my presence, to go to Harrisson's house, and give him three of the hanks of silk, worth 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I and the constable followed Tilley, about half past 9 o'clock to Har<lb/>risson's house, No. 19, Hope-street, Spitalfields; it is a little shop, there were scales and weights there—the shop was not closed; it has a large win<lb/>dow; it had the blinds down, and a few of these <hi rend="italic">thrums</hi> in it—I saw Tilley go in; I stood on the same side of the way, six or seven yards off, and could only see the side of the window; I could not see figures inside—the policeman was on the opposite side of the way—Tilley came out, and offered to give me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I told him to keep it, I would have nothing to do with it—I had searched him in the morning, and only found 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him.</p>

                  </hi>, <hi rend="italic">continued.</hi> I think I did receive the silk from Mr. Newnham; I made a mistake before—I received it at the station house, not at the warehouse—I went with it to the warehouse; I saw Mr. Dawe at the station, he was waiting with me to go and follow the boy—I gave the silk to the boy, and I and Mr. Dawe followed him, and saw him go into the house—I waited on the opposite side, and saw shadows moving on the blind as of a man leaning over something, which afterwards turned out to be the counter; I could not see the figure of any person—immediately after<lb/>wards I saw the boy Tilley come out, and I then went in and saw Harrisson sitting with his back towards me, with his wife and children; I asked him whether he had purchased some silk of a boy; he said, "I have not, but the boy brought a piece of silk in; I said I thought he had not come by it honestly, and he threw it under the counter, and said he would go and fetch his mother"—I asked him where the boy had thrown it, and he said,</p>

               <p>"You will find it <hi rend="italic">whisked</hi> under the counter"—I picked it up from under<lb/>neath the counter, which is open to the room where they all live together, and a little counter goes along by the door; the end of the counter is closed towards the door—Harrisson was sitting in just such a position as he could have thrown the silk there without my seeing him—I do not think the boy could have thrown it there, because there were some scales hanging on the counter—I told him I should take him into custody for buying the silk, knowing it to be stolen—he said he never saw the boy before, and he had not bought it of him—I took him into custody, took him outside, and asked Tilley in his presence what he had received for the silk; he said, "18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>"—Harrisson made no reply—I have often seen him passing along Watling-street and Thames-street, with a bag.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

My husband is afflicted—the boy, Alfred Tilley, is my son—I remember his being convicted of taking some silk from Messrs. Foote and Son, of Spital-square—the schoolmaster of the prison sent me a letter to come and fetch him; and after he came out, in consequence of what he said to me, I went with him to the prisoners—that was on a Wednesday evening—he had then been out of prison two or three months—I dare say it was four months ago—it was some time in the summer; I do not exactly recollect when—I told the prisoner that the policeman had been to my place, and threatened to give him (the prisoner) in charge again—he said to my boy, "You have no occasion to be afraid, for they can't hurt you; Mr. Foote, nor fifty Mr. Footes, can't hurt you, as long as they don't find the property upon me"—"Nor you either," said he to the boy—the boy had been already punished, but the policeman had been to my place, and said that Mr. Foote was not at all satisfied that the boy had told the truth of the first crime—the prisoner told my boy that if the policeman should take him up again, to stick to it that he was not the man; and he said, "Neither should you know me if I was brought up again"—I told him that he was a good for nothing villain to encourage the boy to rob—he stood against the window, with his hands in his pockets, and made a <hi rend="italic">snigger</hi> and a laugh and told the boy not to be frightened—that was all that passed—as we came out, he said, "Shut the door, for there are plenty of spies about;" and when we came out into the street, he said the same; and he told the boy to look out, for fear there should be anybody looking about for him.</p>

On 18th Oct., about half past 3 o'clock, I saw a constable named Smith, at the door of the house, No. 51, Mornington-row—I looked through the key hole, and saw the prisoner come out of the back study with this crowbar in one hand, and a light in the other—he went down in the kitchen—I went to the back of the house, and got over five walls—I got into the yard and saw the study window standing open, I saw the bottom bar had been taken from it—I heard the prisoner strike a lucifer match—I took off my boots, and got in at the study window—I then saw the prisoner coming up the kitchen stairs to the back study, where I was standing—lie had this crowbar in his hand, and a writing desk under his arm, and two scarfs wrapped round the writing desk—I turned on my light and the prisoner turned round, and ran down to the back kitchen—I followed him down, and when I got to the bottom of the stairs he struck my lantern from my hand with this bar—he was just in the kitchen, and I was outside the kitchen door—I was in the house—I called to the prisoner to surrender, and he struck at me with the bar—I parried the blow off with my right arm—it bruised my arm—the mark was on it for three weeks afterwards, and the arm is very tender now—there was a little light, and by that I saw that he took the crowbar out of his breast and struck me—I took him by the collar, and threw him on his back—he struggled and got up, and I threw him a second time—the persons in the house were roused by the other officer knocking at the door—the other officer came to my assistance, and we took the prisoner to the station—when we were outside the house the prisoner said if he had thought well, he could have killed me with the crowbar—at the time he struck me, he had got this writing desk under his arm wrapped round with some scarfs—the writing desk belonged to Mr. Ranger, and the scarfs to Mr. Byron.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at No. 3, Albert-square, Clapham-road. On 2nd Nov. I was in Fenchurch-street, from half past 1 to 2 o'clock in the afternoon—I was stopping for about a minute, looking into a print shop—I had a <hi rend="italic">porte-monnaie</hi> in my pocket—I had been into a biscuit shop about a minute before, and I had it then quite safe—whilst I was standing at the print shop I felt something touching my right side, where my pocket was, and, on looking round, I saw the prisoner—I said to him, "You have picked my pocket"—he said, "No, I have not"—I said, "You have," and I caught hold of his left hand, but he struggled, and got his hand away from me, and passed it in front of me—I caught hold of part of his coat, which tore in my hand—I lost my umbrella in holding him—I called out as loud as I could, "Help! help! this man has picked my pocket"—some persons came up and asked if I wished to give him in charge—I said I would—a youth came up, and said, "I have picked up this purse; I saw the prisoner throw it away"—it was my purse—two gentlemen held the prisoner—he was never out of my sight—I never let go of him till the gentlemen said, "You may leave go, we have got him"—this is the purse—it contained four sovereigns, 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a cheque, for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it contains that now.</p>

I have known him eighteen months, and have done business with him—I asked where he lived; he said that he kept a shop over in Lambeth<lb/>marsh—the ten sovereigns was then given him, and the note was taken away and placed in the till—this is the note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I also asked him on the 17th, if he knew the person from whom he got that note—he said he had known him for about fifteen or sixteen months, that he had continually sold him goods, and he kept a shop in the New-cut—that was John Cross—on 18th Oct. my master, Mr. Russell, brought me both the notes, and in consequence of what he told me, I went to the prisoner's father's house in Booth-street, Spitalfields; from that I learned nearly where to find his residence, I went there; I did not find him at his house, but at a chandler's shop in the neighbourhood; he was drinking a glass of ginger-beer—I waited outside for him, and then said, "Well, John, about these notes I—he said, "What is the matter with them?"—I said, "I don't know; Mr. Russell has brought them to me this morning, and says he shall look to me for the money, they are no use to him, and we must have the money for them"—he again asked me if they were wrong, or if any<lb/>thing was wrong with them—I said, "I do not know; you had better come with me to Mr. Russell, down at the shop, he is waiting there;" with that he accompanied me to the shop, but Mr. Russell was gone—previous to arriving at the shop, I asked him what he had done with the money—he said that he had been in arrears, and he had paid his debts—after we got to the shop, he said that we had better go together down to his mother's—when we got there we arranged to meet in the afternoon to see the father, by the mother's wish; as we were going from the shop to his mother's, he frequently asked me if I thought the notes were bad; and once he said, "If they are, I shall be entirely ruined for life"—I left him at his mother's house; I got the assistance of a police sergeant, and accompanied him to the Bank of England, where we proved that the notes were forgeries—we then saw the prisoner's father at his situation, and we kept in company with him until about 5 o'clock, when we took the prisoner into custody at his own house, in New-street, Bethnal-green.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> During the eight years you have known the prisoner, have you ever heard the slightest imputation upon him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It never came across me to hear of it; I cannot say that I ever did—it was between 11 and 12 o'clock in the morning of the 18th that I first went after the prisoner, in consequence of having discovered that the notes were forgeries—he was not given into custody till nearly 5 o'clock in the after<lb/>noon—it was not when I told him the notes were valueless, that he said cross had a shop in the New-cut; it was on the day that we changed the notes—this is not the first time that I have ever made that statement—I am sure it was when he brought the notes, that he told me the names of the persons from whom he got them; I might have asked him the same upon another occasion also, but on my oath, I asked him the names when he paid the notes to me—I cannot exactly say whether this is the first time I have stated so—he never told me that he did not know where they lived; he told the officer so; I heard him say so when he was taken into custody—he did not tell me that it was eighteen months since he had had any pre<lb/>vious transactions with them—he did not tell me that they were hawkers, and he did not know where they lived; but that when he last knew either of them, it was about eighteen months ago, and then one lived in the New-cut, and the other in Lambeth-marsh—he did not tell me before he was taken into custody that they were hawkers, and that he did not know where they lived—he told the constable so in my presence, when he was taken—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185411270031"/>
               <p>he had made an appointment to go to Mr. Russell's at 3 o'clock that after<lb/>noon—I cannot say whether he kept that appointment, no one can prove it—I was not there to meet him—I did not hear from Young, or any one, that the prisoner had called there at 3 o'clock—when he was taken into custody he was at his own house; he was not then engaged at his work, cage making; he was quite clean, ready to start out as I knocked at the door—that was about 5 o'clock—he stated that he had received each note in the course of his business; he said that one man had bought cages of him to the amount of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and that he had given him the difference; and the other had bought goods from him, amounting to over 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he had given him the change—when I went to his mother's in the afternoon, she told me that he had gone to keep the appointment with me at his master's, and that he was then at his own place waiting for me—I went there and found him—he lived about seven minutes' walk from my master's, and about the same distance from his mother's.</p>

I am assistant to Mr. Russell I have known the prisoner for the last three months, only by sight—he had been several times to our shop before 16th Oct.—I remember his coming between 3 and 4 o'clock that afternoon—Bull came in with him, from outside—Bull asked me if I could get change for a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I said I could—the prisoner laid a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note on the counter—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I looked at the back of it, and saw the two names that are now upon it—that was after Bull had given the prisoner a pen, and he had written some<lb/>thing upon it—I then took the note to the till, and gave the prisoner ten sovereigns for it—I did not hear Bull ask him where he got the note—on the following day he came again, about the same time—Bull came in with him, and asked if I could oblige Crow with change for a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; I said, "Yes"—Bull told him to write his name on the back of the note, and gave him pen and ink for that purpose—he did so this is the note—I received it after he had written his name upon it—the name of John Cross was at the top, and John Crow underneath it—Bull wrote the date—I then gave the prisoner ten sovereigns, and put the note into the till—the other 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note that I had received the day before was also in the till—there was no other note there, nor any other in the house at that time—next day, the 18th, Bull came again into the shop with the prisoner—they were in conversation together; but I was busy at the counter, at the time, and did not attend to it—I did not then know that the notes were supposed to be forged—I had never changed notes for the prisoner before.</p>

On Wednesday evening, 9th Nov., I was in St. George's-street, Ratcliff-highway, between 8 and 9 o'clock, and heard a cart rattling along—I stopped and listened, and in about two minutes I went and found the horse and cart standing still—the prisoner was out of the cart holding the horse's head, and Mr. Tatham was there also—the still was in the cart—I beard the prisoner say something about a note that he had given Mr. Tatham—Mr. Tatham said, "Yes, but it was a forged one"—I went up directly and saw the prisoner with his hand up, shoving Mr. Tatham away—I asked Mr. Tatham, whether he bad taken a bad note—he said, "Yes," he believed it was—I said, "Will you give him into custody?"—he did so—I said to the prisoner, "You must go to the station, and if it is a bad note you will be detained, and if not you will be set at liberty"—he said he would not go, and be wanted Mr. Tatham to give him the bad note back again—Mr. Tatham said he would not—I asked Mr. Tatham to show me the note, and I saw the name of James Wright, written on it—another constable came up, and I asked him to take the cart, and I took the prisoner—as we went along, he asked me how I thought he would get on—and he said, "Make it as easy as you can, and I will give you a shilling or two, or two or three, or three or four; I won't stand to a shilling"—I told him, he must ask the inspector about that—he then asked to walk on one side of the cart, and me on the other; to walk by himself; the other policeman was leading the horse—I told him to come with me, and walk behind the cart to see that nobody took anything out—</p>

               <p>he said, "No, you walk on one side of the cart, and I will walk on the other"—I said, "No," when I had charge of a prisoner, I made sure of him—he made no answer to that—he afterwards said that he had got another note in his pocket, and that might be a bad one—he was searched at the station, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a good 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note found on him; I heard him asked his name, and he said James Wright—he was asked where he lived, and he said No. 21, St. Andrew-street, near Horsemonger-lane gaol—he was then locked up, and the horse and cart was taken to the greenyard—next morning I went to No. 21, St. Andrew-street, and inquired for Mr. Wright—I could not find that name—I gave a description of the person to Mrs. Davies, the landlady, and then learnt that his name was Dobson—I searched the place—I found a desk there—I brought it away—I have the contents here—I took the desk to the station—the prisoner said it was his desk, but there was nothing in it to hurt him—I met the prisoner's wife close against the station house gate, and in consequence of her request, I permitted her to ride in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with the prisoner to the police court—on the way she said to him, "Edward, you have been duped into this, you have been led into this by others"—he told her to hold her tongue, and not say anything, for he should not—on returning from the police court I examined the desk, and found a deed of apprenticeship in it, of Edward Dobson to Isaac Dobson, his father—the name of Perry was on the cart—it was the same cart that Mr. Perry got from the greenyard next day.</p>

I know the prisoner; he has been in the employ of the Company as guard, and occasionally as driver of the vans—it was his duty to call for parcels from my office; he was on the extra cart which relieves that portion of the city—it was his duty to present the way bill, and I or my daughter enter it—my daughter occasionally makes out the way bills—this is the way bill (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>)—it is made out by my daughter—besides presenting the way bill, the prisoner examines the number of parcels delivered to him, and signs in the book for the number of parcels he receives—on this day the prisoner signed for four parcels, three unpaid, and one paid; it is signed, "J. Bowler"—it is part of my duty to take the particulars of parcels received at my office—the first parcel was a stone bottle and basket, addressed, "Massey, 2, Reading-villas, Islington;" the second was a parcel directed, "Harrisson, 5, Ayle-place, St. John-street;" the third, a hat box; and the 4th, a basket directed to Gilbert, of No. 2, Notting-hill-square—I delivered no parcel addressed to Mrs. Budd or Rudd, Euston station, to be left till called for.</p>

I was on duty in Drury-lane—about 8 o'clock the prisoner came up to me and said, "Policeman, I wish to make a statement to you"—I asked him what it was—he said, "I am the man that set fire to Mr. Farebrother's place this morning, in Bow-street"—I asked him if he was employed at Mr. Fare<lb/>brother's—he said he was not now, but he had been, and that Mr. Fare<lb/>brother owed him three weeks' work, which he had stopped, and he had done this through revenge, at the same time not intending to burn the place down, but to make a smoke to frighten them—after he got to the station he gave me this knife, and said, "That is the knife that I got the lock off the door with"—he said, "I threw the lock over the hoarding at the corner of the Lyceum theatre"—I afterwards went there and found the lock; it was identified by Mr. Farebrother.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a collecting clerk in the service of Messrs. Barber, ironmongers, of Stanhope-street, Clare-market; I have been in their service fourteen years; I live at No. 20, Cecil-street, Strand. On 4th Nov., I was out collecting for my employers—I collected about 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I forget the exact amount—a few minutes after 6 o'clock in the evening, I was in the neighbourhood of Drury-lane, and went into a urinal in Vinegar-yard, by the pit door of Drury-lane theatre—there are eight compartments to it, and an entrance at each end; there is a passage, so that persons can pass behind the compartments—at the time I was in, it was lighted with a gas lamp in the centre—there was plenty of light to see all over it, it was very light—there is an oyster shop immediately opposite, which is very brilliantly lighted—the outside lamps of that shop are considerably above the urinal, and they reflect a light into it—the stone which separates the urinal from Vinegar-yard, is higher than a man—I went into the second compartment from Brydges-street—there were other persons in some of the other com<lb/>partments; I should say at least three—when I went in there was no one in the first or third compartments, nor in the fourth; there was a man in the fifth, that was the prisoner, and there were one or two persons in the others—whilst I was standing in the second compartment, I heard some one say, "I have just left work," and on looking round, I found that the prisoner had moved from where he was to the next compartment on my left, the third—I am sure I saw him in the fifth when I went in; I could not be mistaken—he was standing up as a person would who was using the place—I did not see him move, but I found him in the third compartment when I looked round—he said, "You can give me what you like, but I sometimes get 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said, "What have I to do with giving you money?" nothing more was said—he buttoned himself up and left—he was unbuttoned at the time; he was standing with his face towards the urinal; he turned his head round in addressing me, his person was in the compartment—he passed me, and went out at the Brydges-street end—I still remained in the second compartment; I am afflicted with a stricture, which causes me to be a long time; I staid I should think six or seven minutes after he had left—during that time he returned, and passed through the place, but took no notice of me, or I of</p>

               <p>him; there was no room for him then, ail the compartments were full—he merely passed through, and never spoke to me or to any one; I came out at the Brydges-street end—that was the way he had gone out—I cannot say which way he came in the second time, but he went out at the Brydges-street end both times—I went into Brydges-street, which is merely three or four paces from the urinal, and as I was about crossing, the prisoner collared me, and said he would give me in charge for indecently assaulting him—I made him a reply, but in my agitation I cannot tell what I said, whether it was, "You scoundrel," or, "You vagabond, I never saw you," I really can<lb/>not say; it was something to that effect—I had seen him—when I looked at him as we were going along, I could see it was the same man—in less than two minutes, I should say, 100 persons gathered round; rather a rough lot—the prisoner was looking about for a policeman, and no policeman being in view, I said, "If you want to give me in charge, take me to Bow-street"—it was close by Bow-street—no policeman came, and I walked quietly with the prisoner to Bow-street, without any policeman at all—he held me by the collar all the way—there were several policemen standing at the door of the station—I walked into the police office—the prisoner gave me in charge at the door for having indecently assaulted him in Vinegar-yard—I did not while I was in the urinal, or at any other time, in any way indecently assault him, or touch him—(<hi rend="italic">The prisoners state<lb/>ment before the Magistrate was read as follows:</hi>—"All what I wish to say is down on the deposition I gave before at this Court, and which has just been read, that is the truth; I did not say that he hurt me so that I could scarcely draw my breath; every word the gentleman has spoken is quite false; two or three of the words might be right.") (<hi rend="italic">The deposition of the prisoner above referred to was read as follows:</hi>—"Robert Patrick Golding upon his oath says, I live at No. 18, Bennett's-court, Drury-lane; I am a porter; about 6 o'clock on Saturday afternoon last, 4th Nov., I went into the urinal in Vinegar-yard, Brydges-street, Covent-garden, in the second division; the moment I had taken down my trowsers, and before I had commenced making water, the defendant, who was in the next division to me, put his hand round the Corner, and laid hold of my privy member, and squeezed it very hard; I hallooed out very loudly, and ran out, and spoke to a man at an apple stall, and then returned to the urinal, and waited for some time until the defendant came out; his coat collar was turned up, and he walked smartly away; I followed him, and laid hold of him, but seeing no policeman, I brought him to the station at Bow-street.")—it is not true that I laid hold of him at ail; I did not touch him in any way whatever-—I heard no one halloo out—there were other persons in the place—it as raining at this time—I had the collar of my coat up in consequence of the rain, before I went in there—it was not done in any way to conceal my face; it could not conceal it—it was merely to protect myself from the rain—I gave my name and address at the station, and the address of my employers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Peter Evans, of Eaton-place, Edmonton. I resided in the same house with the deceased, John Bowler—his wife was then living—the prisoner is the step daughter of Bowler—her mother died two days after the deceased—he was seventy-eight years, of age—he was a pensioner, and had been in the army—the prisoner did not live with her parents—she is an unfortunate female—on 2nd Nov., between a quarter to 3 and a quarter past 3 o'clock, she came to the house—I was in the room, with old Bowler and his wife—he was lighting a fire, after coming from London—he was sober, to my knowledge—the prisoner was about half tipsy—she had a child in her arms, about a year and a half, old—it was not her own child—she sat down in a chair—Bowler asked her to go out; he did not wish her to be there—she said she would not go out for him, and he laid hold of her to push her out—she kept him away from her as well as she could, and they struggled together—I said to her, "Let me have the child"—Mrs. Bowler then interfered—the prisoner said to Bowler, "Mind you, I will mark you before the night is over for this"—Mrs. Bowler said to him, "Let her be for a few minutes, and she shall go out"—he did not leave her alone—he wanted her to go out all the time, but she would not; and when he saw that he could not put her out, he went to look for a policeman—while he was gone, the prisoner asked her mother for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she said, where did she think she should find a sixpence—she did not give it her—I cannot say exactly what time Bowler returned, but it was moon-light—the prisoner then took up two chairs, one after the other, and broke them in the middle of the floor—she was in a passion—she then took a kettle of boiling water from the stove, and broke it on the floor, and kicked it right out into the yard—the boiling water came on the floor—she then went away—she came back in a minute or two, without her bonnet, and her sleeves tucked up, and struck Bowler with a stone—he was then at the threshold of the door—she had got the stone from the yard—I saw her stoop and pick up something, but I could not say whether it was a stone or a brick—it was bigger than my fist, but not so big as my two fists—she struck him with it on the top of the head—he hallooed "Murder!" several times—he bled most awfully—he said, "Is there no neighbour that will assist me, or I am a dead man?"—a man named <hi rend="italic">Dan</hi> O'Neil came, and took him to the chemist's—before the prisoner struck Bowler on the head, I saw her drag him down, and kick him most awfully when he was down; and when he got up, he said that he had lost the use of his hand—he did not complain of his head then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at Edmonton, I first saw the deceased on Wednesday, 8th Nov., at his own house; and he was removed, on Thursday, to the Infirmary—he was in a most dangerous state, from erysipelas on the head and face, extending over the whole head—a blow on the head with a brick would produce erysipelas—a fall might equally produce it—I did not see a wound on the head—the head and face were excessively swollen, and covered with vesications—I saw no appearance on the head to account for that—there was a wound on the head, but the swollen state of the scalp prevented it from being much seen—it was on the right side of the head, on the parietal bone—I could not say of what standing it was; some few days, I presume—it might have been inflicted on the second or third day before—if a person had been perfectly well before, and had received a blow on the head with a brick or stone, it would account for all that I saw—I saw him again on Friday; he died that night of the erysipelas.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sculptor, of No. 17, Newman-street, Oxford-street. I knew the late Mr. William Scoular for twenty years—he re<lb/>sided in Dean-street, Soho, and was a sculptor likewise—I have been in the habit of seeing him frequently during the latter years of his life, for the last ten years generally once a week, sometimes twice; and sometimes a month has passed when I have not seen him—I have been in the habit of calling there most frequently—in June last, the 10th, I think, I heard that he had become acquainted with a person named Edwards, with whom he had formed a partnership—I had not been consulted by any parties touching that part<lb/>nership—I only know from what I have been told how long the deceased had been acquainted with Edwards previous to the partnership being entered into—I do not know of my own knowledge that Mr. Edwards was acquainted with him any considerable time—in consequence of a communi<lb/>cation made to me by a man named Marcatti in June, I went to see Mr. Scoular (Marcatti has worked for Mr. Scoular ten or fifteen years)—I found him very unwell, I may say ill—his age was about fifty-nine—I saw him again about 9th or 10th July, and on that occasion I saw the defendant Edwards alone, and had a conversation with him—the first question he put to me was, "Do you know whether Mr. Scoular has made a will?"—I told him I did not know, but I thought it likely he might have made one—he then gain he thought it was quite proper that Mr. Scoular should make a will, and that he thought it also proper that he should make his (Mr. Edwards') solicitor, one of the executors—he then asked me if I should like to be the other—I said, "I suppose Mr. Scoular will do as he likes about that;" but that of course I should have no objection to act if Mr. Scoular did make me executor—I mentioned that Mr. Van Sandau was Mr. Scoular's attorney in case of a will having to be made, and that he had prevented Mr. Scoular from forming a partnership which might have turned out a dangerous one had it been formed—I mentioned to Edwards on that occasion that it would be more delicate for an old friend (meaning myself) to speak to Mr. Scoular on the subject of a will—I said, "I think it would be more delicate for me as an old friend to speak to him than yourself—I did not say "for me,"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185411270051"/>
               <p>I meant to, but I said, "for an old friend"—lie referred to Mr. Scoular's brother, and said he should have sent to Scotland for his brother to come to London, but he had mentioned Mr. George Scoular to him, and he got in such a passion when his name was mentioned, that he should not do do—I think his words were, "He got into such a violent rage that I am afraid of mentioning his name again to him"—he said that the two brothers were at great enmity—that closed the conversation—from this day to the death of Mr. Scoular, I do not remember that Edwards said anything to me relative to Mr. Scoular making a will, nor did he tell me before Mr. Scoular's death that he had made a will—on 11th July, the day following, I believe I can swear to that date, it was Tuesday, I believe; I saw Mr. Scoular, he was extremely ill on the 10th, and on the 11th he was worse, in my opinion—I think he had been partially blind, and at that period he was purblind—if he was standing where I am he would see a candle on that table, but he would not distinguish any object—I mean that he was partially blind—I believe his illness was consumption—in consequence of a conversation I had with him, on 11th July, 1 saw Mr. Van Sandau, I believe on the 11th, and made a communication to him by the direction of Mr. Scoular; and in con<lb/>sequence of what passed between us, I saw the deceased again on the follow<lb/>ing day, and made a communication to him from Mr. Van Sandau—an appointment was made for Mr. Van Sandau to call on Mr. Scoular on the Thursday following—on the next day, the 12th, after I had seen Mr. Van Sandau, I was with Mr. Scoular, and Edwards called or beckoned me out of the room—I left the room, and he said that I was acting against the direc<lb/>tions of the doctor, that no one was to be allowed to see Mr. Scoular again till he was better—he did not mention who the doctor was—I already knew that it was Dr. D'Allex, one of the defendants—I went back to the room, and wished Mr. Scoular good bye—I do not think that Edwards accom<lb/>panied me—I called again that evening, but did not see Mr. Scoular—I saw Mr. Edwards, and was speaking to him, but nothing very important, wishing him good evening, when Dr. D'Allex entered the shop—I was then asking, I think, how Mr. Scoular had been; his reply was "A little better"—I then told D'Allex, in Edwards' presence, that Mr. Secular's attorney had appointed the following day to call for the purpose of making his will—I should men<lb/>tion that Dr. D'Allex said that Mr. Scoular could not be seen for some time, and in consequence of that I informed him of the intention of Mr. Van Sandau to be there, at his request, to make a will—I do not know whether I mentioned Mr. Van Sandau's name, or said "his solicitor"—Dr. D'Allex said that he was very ill, and must not be seen—I do not think Edwards said anything—I said to Dr. D'Allex, "Do not you think that the absence of, Mr. Scoular's solicitor, whom he has appointed to see for such a purpose, will be the means of exciting him very much, and making him worse?"—he said that it would not be well for him (Scoular) to see him for a few days—I then said, "I presume I must put off Mr. Van Sandau," or "the solicitor"—Edwards said "Yes," and so did Dr. D'Allex—that closed the conversation, and I then left the house—Ed wards was present all the time, to the best of my belief—in the course of that evening I happened to be in Dean-street—I think I passed the house two or three times that evening, but did not see Edwards—two or three evenings afterwards I called to ask how Mr. Scoular was; the shop door was opened by the nurse—a conversation took place between me and the nurse, and I left the house without seeing Mr. Scoular—I called on Dr. D'Allex that evening, and saw him—I did not tell him that I had been to Mr. Scoular and had seen the nurse—I asked him how Mr. Scoular</p>

               <p>was; he said that he was better—I asked if he had been delirious, he said "No, only a little light headed"—I put that question to him because I had put similar questions to the nurse—I called on Dr. D'Allex in consequence of the conversation between me and the nurse—I asked him if he thought Mr. Scoular would know me if I called upon him—he said, "Yes"—I told him I knew Mr. Scoular would be glad to see me, and that if he would allow me to see him, I passed my word that I would not even speak or enter the room; I would merely look into the room to be satisfied that he was com<lb/>fortable—he said he could not allow it just then, not for a day or two, and he told me he would call on me next day, and let me know how Mr. Scoular did—he did call on me next day, and in the course of conversation he said, "Did you ever hear of Mr. Scoular's brother leaving him 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—I said, "No, I do not believe it; I do not think Mr. Scoular is worth as many hundreds"—he said that Mr. Scoular was very ill—I do not think anything further passed of importance—on 19th July one of my sons brought me a message from Mr. Scoular, and I immediately went to his house; on my way I met Dr. D'Allex, and asked him how Mr. Scoular was; he said he was very much excited, for Mr. Campbell had been there (he is the celebrated sculptor, and a very old friend of Mr. Scoular)—I said, "I know Mr. Campbell has been there"—he said, "How do you know that?"—I told him that I heard that Mr. Campbell had been sent for, and that Mr. Scoular had also sent for me, and said, "I suppose there is no objection to my seeing him now"—he said, "Yes, there is, you must not," or some<lb/>thing to that effect—I then parted with him, and went on to Mr. Scoular's house; on arriving there I opened the door, and went up to Mr. Scoular's room immediately without asking permission—I saw him; he was very ill, I believe—Mr. Edwards seeing me go up ran after me, but I was up first; I think he stopped, that he did not follow me into the room; he did not speak to me—I considered Mr. Scoular to be perfectly sane always, but very weak; I conversed with him, it was half past 6 o'clock in the evening—after leaving I was crossing the street coining out of Soho-square, and crossing Dean-street; the house is almost at the corner, and I saw a van at Mr. Scoular's door; it was then 7 or half past 7 o'clock—I did not pay attention to what sort of goods were being placed in the van; there was something in it—I do not know of my own knowledge where what was in the van was conveyed—on that evening I received a note from Mr. Campbell, in consequence of which I called on Mr. Van Sandau, and on the following day, the 20th, I accompanied him and Mr. Campbell to Mr. Scoular's house—we saw the defendant Edwards; Mr. Van Sandau repre<lb/>sented that he was Mr. Scoular's attorney, and that he had called respecting taking instructions for his will—Mr. Edwards said he could not be seen, that he had his own interests to look after, and he should not allow him to go up stairs—a person who I believe to be Edwards's mother, and some other person, a man whom I do not know, were with him—Mr. Van Sandau conducted the conversation; he spoke in very strong terms of Edwards not allowing it—he said, "I advise you to allow him to see his solicitor, it is nothing but right," and advised him to allow him to see him—he said that if he was acting a fair part he would allow him to see his solicitor, and that he thought he was not acting a fair part not to allow him to see him—nothing more was said about a will—I said I was an old friend of Mr. Scoular, and I should go up stairs, and nothing but force should prevent me—Edwards then stood on the staircase to prevent me, and I desisted, it was then 12 o'clock—in consequence of what took place I went to Marl borough-street</p>

Sir,—In consequence of your unjustifiable proceed<lb/>ings, I have this morning, at the request of my client Mr. Edwards, seen Mr. Scoular's medical man, Dr. D'Allex, 60, Berners-street, Oxford-street; who has intimated to me, and has left advice that Mr. Scoular is not to be seen by any friends for the present, and that owing to your late proceedings his ill<lb/>ness has been increased. Mr. Scoular has also himself expressly desired that no one should be admitted to his room until he is better. I have, therefore, in the first place to beg of you, if you are the friend of Mr. Scoular you profess to be, that you will not for the present trouble him with your visits; but should you again adopt proceedings similar to those adopted this morning, I have left instructions with Mr. Edwards to call in a police constable. In great haste, your obedient servant, E. W. Plowright. E. Papworth, Esq., 17, Newman-street, Oxford-street."</p>

It is my particular wish, at the instigation of my doctor, that my interview with you may be deferred for a few days, until I am better able to bear the excitement Wm Scoular")—it is written in a strange hand, but is the signature of Mr. Scoular—I took this letter to Mr. Van Sandau that night—I went twice to him that night—I then felt it right to communicate with the deceased's friends in Scotland, and on the Saturday in that week, George Scoular, the brother of the deceased, arrived in London, and he and I and Mr. Van Sandau went on that day to Plowright's office, about 12 or 1 o'clock—we left Plowright's office together, but I left them on the way to the deceased's residence; I did not accompany them—on Sunday morning, 23rd July, I received a note from Edwards; this is it—(<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "92, Dean-street, Sunday.

               <p>must correct myself; whether it was against Edwards or not I do not know—I did not hear Mr. Van Sandau accuse Edwards of causing the death of the deceased—I never had any interest in Mr. Scoular's private affairs, further than when he has asked me in do so—I have lent him money—that was when he was in Rome, in 1835—I lent him various sums, I cannot say how much—I took the benefit if the Insolvent Debtors' Act two years ago—Mr. Scoular was one of my creditors then, to a small extent; I cannot say how much—I do not know whether I was his debtor or whether he was my debtor—I do not think he was my creditor when I took the benefit of the Act—the account was so nearly balanced that I cannot say whether he was debtor or creditor if we balanced accounts—I had to swear to the correctness of my balance sheet—I mean to tell those twelve gentlemen, on my solemn oath, that I do not know whether I am debtor or creditor—I cannot swear that it is rather more "Yes" I than "No"—I do not think he was included in my schedule for that very reason—I will not swear that—I have been twice insolvent—I was so three years before—Mr. Scoular was not a creditor then—if I was in debt with Mr. Scoular at all it was not increased—I cannot say whether in the former one the balance was in favour of myself or not—I had no intention of becoming Mr. Scoular's partner, or of succeeding to his business—I would not succeed to it—he was a plaster caster, and I know nothing about the business at all—I perhaps saw Mr. Scoular ten times after 10th June, but I cannot swear to it—I did not always find him in bed—about the middle of June he was sitting in his ordinary sitting room, and towards the end of June also, I think—I saw him five times in July; he was in bed each time—I saw him twice or three times alone, and was with him a quarter of an hour, twenty minutes, or half an hour—I did not see him once in company with Mr. Van Sandau—I went to his house once with Mr. Van'Sandau, but Mr. Van Sandau did not see him then—I was there when Mr. Simpson and Dr. D'Allex retired, and then I was alone with the deceased—they were absent two or three minutes.</p>

               <p>Scoular's particular request—I do not recollect there being an altercation between me and some parties in the sick room—there was loud talking on Dr. D'Allex's part—I was perfectly calm—I merely told Dr. D'Allex that if he had anything to say he had better say it out of that room—I do not think that he told me on one occasion that my disturbance in the sick room had increased Mr. Scoular's excitement and endangered his life; I cannot swear that he did not—I had not an interview with Edwards on 9th July—I believe it was on Monday, the 10th, that he suggested to me that it was necessary that Mr. Scoular should make his will, but if you will give me leave to correct myself, it might have been Sunday, the 9th—he said that Mr. Scoular was very ill, and he thought it was necessary that if he had not made his will he should be told to do so—he did not say that he thought it was proper that I should be one of the executors—he rather asked me if I would be one—I did not act as one—you may say I did, as I ordered the funeral—I locked up the papers, but I did not act as executor—I do not know Mr. Goldsworthy—the gentleman who took the inventory was Mr. Chinnock—on my oath, I did not tell him that I was executor, and give him orders; quite the reverse—I did not say so—I repudiated the will, and said I was not executor—it was as an old friend that I ordered the property to be sold, put a person in the house, and had an inventory taken, and it was as an old friend that I ordered the funeral—you are the best judge whether I had any right to do it—I certainly did not do it as executor under the will—I did not, under the advice of Mr. Van Sandau, consent to have the inventory taken as executor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of No. 27, King-street, Cheap<lb/>side, in partnership with Mr. dimming. I have known Mr. Scoular upwards of twenty years, during the whole of which time I acted as his solicitor—he was introduced to me by my brother-in-law Mr. Papworth, on his return from Home, and I afterwards acted as his solicitor—he was in partnership with a gentleman named Loft; I acted for him on the formation of that part<lb/>nership, and on the dissolution of it—I believe he had no other legal adviser but myself—about the commencement of this year there was some talk of another partnership, but I broke off the arrangement—I first heard, some time about June, of an acquaintance with Edwards—there was a partner<lb/>ship between him and the late Mr. Scoular, which appears by the partnership deed to have begun about May 30th—I was not at all consulted, nor did I know anything of that deed being made, until after 20th July—I had not had any dispute with Mr. Scoular, nor had he at any time dismissed me as his legal adviser.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you receive any intimation from anybody in reference to a will of Mr. Scoular? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> For the first time on the 11th July last; Mr. Papworth called upon me on the subject—I subsequently had two notes from him on the same subject, on the 12th and 13th—I appointed to attend Mr. Scoular on the 13th, and in consequence of those notes I did not attend</p>

               <p>him—I have those notes here—the 19th July, was the first time I heard of Mr. Scoular after that—Mr. Papworth called upon me on the evening of the 19th, and in consequence of that communication, I on the 20th met Mr. Papworth and Mr. Campbell, and afterwards went to Mr. Scoular's—Mr. Campbell is a sculptor—during the whole of the twenty years I have known Mr. Scoular, he and Mr. Papworth have been on terms of great inti<lb/>macy and friendship—I went first to Mr. Papworth's on the 20th where I met Mr. Campbell, and with them I went to Mr. Scoular in Dean-street—I there saw Mr. Edwards, Mrs. Edwards, his mother, and there were on the premises two or three other persons, who they were I do not know—Mr. Papworth expressed a wish to see Mr. Scoular, and said as he was there he would see him; he was proceeding to go up stairs when Mr. Edwards placed himself on the stall's, and I advised Mr. Papworth not to use any violence to force his way up, and he desisted—I told Mr. and Mrs. Edwards that I was the solicitor of Mr. Scoular, and that I came there for the purpose of taking his instructions for his will—they both declared that Mr. Scoular was not in a condition to see anybody; according to my recollection they stated that he was not in a state of mind able to see them; that he was in a state of delirium, and that by order of his doctor, they were not to allow anybody to see him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Mr. Edwards ever say anything to you, or have you ever had any conversation with him, by which you have learnt whether he did invest any money in the business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have since seen the books; I never had any conversation with Mr. Edwards about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I rather interrupted you, go on with your former answer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I remonstrated with Mr. Edwards upon what I considered the impropriety of his conduct; and I then insisted that if he would not allow me to see Scoular, at least he should allow Mr. Simpson, the medical man, who had teen him the preceding evening.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember the words in which you remonstrated? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I told him that it appeared to me his conduct was extremely improper, that he would draw upon himself very important consequences, that it was highly improper to interfere between a man who was in a state of extreme ill health and the making of his will, and he would probably draw very grave inconveniences and responsibilities upon himself—I cannot say that those were the precise words, that is the substance; and I then said, "I dare you to refuse Mr. Simpson, the medical man, to see him, to see the state in which he now is"—after some hesitation he consented to allow Mr. Simpson to go up stairs to Scoular—Mr. Simpson remained up stairs with Mr. Scoular five or six minutes, and during that time I asked Edwards how long he had known Mr. Scoular—he told me that the partnership had com<lb/>menced some time in May, but that he had had a great deal of business with him previously to that—he did not state how long he had known him—some mention was made of partnership articles—I asked to see those part<lb/>nership articles—Edwards said he believed Scoular's part was somewhere about the house, he did not know; but Mr. Plowright had his part of the agreement—I asked Mr. Edwards if Mr. Plowright would produce it to me—he said he had no doubt he would.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that he said, by way of repeating those words, "for fear of giving offence?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My recollection of the conversation is precisely as I have stated, that Mr. Simpson expressly stated that Scoular had repeated to him, that for fear of giving offence, he was forced to delay seeing me for a week or a fortnight longer—Mr. Simpson further stated that he had expressly asked Scoular if he had made a will, and Scoular had stated emphatically that he had not made any will—I then asked Mr. Ed<lb/>wards if he would, after hearing that, permit me to see him—Edwards replied, "I have my own interests to protect, and I will do so"—he then repeated that he had invested his money in the concern—he also expressly stated that he would not permit me to have any private interview whatever with Mr. Scoular—I asked him what right he had to interfere between Mr. Scoular and his solicitor, or with the making of his will—I repeated that he might draw grave consequences upon himself by his conduct, and I said, "I will now advise you as I would if I were advising you as your solicitor: I would say, 'Send for your solicitor, consult him, and if he is a respectable man, he will advise you, to quiet this poor old man's mind, and to permit him to see his solicitor, and those friends whom he is desirous of seeing'"—Mr. Edwards thanked me for my advice, and I then left.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">proposed to ask who were named as legatees, but the question was objected to, and over<lb/>ruled</hi>)—I had not, before I went there, prepared any will, or anything of the kind.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185411270064"/>
               <p>any paper that you had brought with you, or how was it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I brought no papers with me when I went into the room—Mr. George Scoular gave me a sheet of paper which I hold in my hand, and very imperfect writing materials—it was upon this piece of paper that I wrote down, as far as I did write them down, the wishes he expressed to me with regard to his property; I also collected from my conversation with him what his wishes were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you had known Mr. Scoular for many years, did you know of any hostile feeling between him and his brother? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not aware that I knew that he had a brother until about 11th July, when Mr. Papworth called upon me, and I certainly knew of no hostile feeling existing—when he saw his brother in my presence, upon the occasion of my taking the instruc<lb/>tions for his will; he did not exhibit by word or manner any hostile feeling towards him—what then passed would lead me to the direct contrary opinion, that there was no hostility towards his brother—I then returned to my office, after calling, I think, at another place, and I then prepared the draft of the will which I hold in my hand, in accordance with the instruc<lb/>tions which I had received, and the same afternoon, immediately afterwards, I had it fair copied by one of my clerks, and I hold that fair copy in my hand—when I went up-stairs on this occasion, there was no one else in the room besides George Scoular; and by the desire of his brother, which I repeated to him, he left the room—it was entirely in his absence that I took the instructions in reference to the will—I prepared the will in accordance with the instructions of the deceased; according to my judgment and know<lb/>ledge as a solicitor, and I believe in precise accordance with his directions—neither Mr. Papworth or myself had a shadow of interest or hope in reference to the property of the deceased—there certainly was not the shadow of a hope on my part, and I never heard any expressed by Mr. Papworth—I returned again on the Sunday, but previously between 5 and 6 o'clock on the Saturday, I saw Mr. Plowright, in accordance with the appointment I had made in the middle of the day at Plowright's, and of the letter which I received—I mentioned to him that I understood he had prepared some partnership articles between Edwards and Scoular, and I expressed my surprise that he, as the solicitor of Edwards, should have prepared partnership articles for a man in the state in which Mr. Scoular was, without the intervention of his solicitor—he said he did not consider the solicitor of Mr. Scoular was necessary, as the partnership articles which he prepared were a mere copy of the partnership articles which I had prepared some years previously, between Scoular and Loft—I told him that I had not been able to see Mr. Scoular's copy of those partnership articles, but that I had learnt from Edwards that he had Edwards's copy, and I asked him if he would permit me to see it—he said, "Yes," and produced it, and at my instance, he lent me the draft of those articles—he then said that the consideration was 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but that as Edwards had no money, he had given a, bond for the payment of the money in two years—he sponta<lb/>neously added that the capital was to be 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was all to be provided by Mr. Scoular, and to be paid into a bank to the joint account of Scoular and Edwards—he told me, also spontaneously, that he had found that Scoular was indebted about 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for rent to his landlord, and that he wanted some money for himself, and that therefore he had taken from Scoular a power of attorney to sell out 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Consols; that power of attorney he told me was made out to himself and to Edwards, and also extended to the receipt by them of the dividends due to Scoular—he told</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185411270065"/>
               <p>me that he had sold out, I think it was the sum of 545<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, to raise the precise sum of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that as Scoular was not able to go to the banker's, he had paid it in to the separate account of Edwards, at the Union Bank—I inquired if the dividends had also been received, and he told me they had not, and if I pleased, he would himself receive those dividends, and pay them to me—(I afterwards found there was an arrear of dividends)—I objected to receive the dividends myself; I suggested that Mr. Plowright had better receive them, and I should be more content with their being in his hands, than their getting into the hands of Mr. Edwards—I afterwards found at the Bank that the dividends had then been received—I went to the Bank on the 24th, and I afterwards spoke, on the 24th, to Edwards and Plowright, and found that they had been received before—they did not state at what time—the Bank clerk is here—both Edwards and Plowright told me on the 24th that they had been received—I represented to Plow<lb/>right, in the presence of Edwards, that I found they had been received pre<lb/>viously to the 22nd—Mr. Plowright said that he had learnt from Edwards that morning that they had been received—I asked the amount; Edwards said 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or thereabouts, and that had been paid to the account of Mr. Scoular—I asked if he meant that it had been paid to the separate account of Scoular, or into the account opened in his name.—he asked Plowright if he should answer that question, and Plowright desired him not to do so—at my interview with Plowright, on the evening of the 22nd, I told him that I had that day been to Scoular's, had seen Scoular, and had taken the instructions for his will, and that those instructions were to leave every<lb/>thing to his brother, with the exception of legacies to his two cousins, whose names were Janet Thompson and Mary Ann Thompson—this was said to Plowright only—Edwards was not there—I am now speaking of what occurred on the evening of the 22nd—Plowright said that he was aware I had seen him, for he himself had seen him since—he said he himself had been several times to him to get him to make a will, and that he had always postponed doing so—I believe the expression he used was, "I have been several times to him to get him to make a will, and he always post<lb/>poned it," and he said, "I have desisted in consequence calling upon him for the purpose"—I then adverted to the note, which is dated "Thursday," signed by Scoular, and said, "I am fearful that any party who could get him to sign such a letter, might get him to sign any other document," and Plowright assured me that he believed that Scoular had made no will—I believe that was all that took place at that interview:—on Sunday morning, 23rd, accompanied by Mr. Simpson, I went to Scoular's; Edwards came in immediately after me—I stated that I came to take his signature to his will, and I was told that he had died that morning at 8 o'clock—I then told Edwards that I understood from Mr. Plowright that he had had 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Scoular's money, and that it had been paid into the Bank, and I asked him if he would permit me to see his banker's book, that I might satisfy myself that the money was safe; he told me that Sunday was not a proper day for the purpose, but if I would call next day he would show me the banker's book—I then, with Mr. Simpson, left Dean-street, and went to Mr. Papworth's house, in Newman-street—Mr. Papworth was out for the moment, but his son told me that Mr. Edwards had just left a letter there—I found the letter, which I opened; it is here—it is dated Sunday—after that, I accompanied Mr. Papworth, and I think also Mr. Simpson, back to Scoular's, and we there met Mr. Plowright—I think Mr. Simpson did not then remain—when we returned, Edwards was out—Plowright told</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185411270066"/>
               <p>us that he had that morning learnt from Edwards that Scoular was dead, and that Edwards had left in his possession a will, which will we might see if we thought proper—I have a copy of the will—I afterwards went with Plowright and Papworth to the police office, to put a man in watch of the premises, and I accompanied them to Plowright's house—I was then shown a will, of which I was allowed to take a copy, and of which it is a true copy; Mr. Plowright himself having examined it with me—I expressed my conviction that the will could not possibly stand, in which opinion Mr. Plowright concurred, stating that Edwards had been too greedy, and that the will could not stand—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">stated the substance of the will; it gave a legacy of</hi> 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to Marchetti;</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to Masspoli;</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to each executor, Papworth and Plowright, to Morton Andrew Edwards, all the testator's share in the business and fixtures at Dean-street, and all the property he died possessed of, whether real or personal, was divided into two equal shares, and given to Edwards and Augustus Hay</hi>)—it is attested by four witnesses—I have seen Hay—I saw him on the 24th, in company with Edwards and Plowright, at Dean-street; further than that I know nothing of him—I am acting in this matter for George Scoular, the sole next of kin—he is my client; so acting for him, I have felt it my duty to take every step I possibly could to set aside this will; in Chancery to protect the property, and in Doctors' Commons a suit is now pending—the bill in Chancery also extends to set aside the partnership articles, on the ground that they were fraudulently obtained—on the morning of the 24th I called, and I then asked Edwards to produce the banker's book—he declined to produce the banker's book, saying he was advised by Plowright not to produce it—he produced to me the partnership books, and I had an opportunity of looking at them, but not the banker's book.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT WILKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you file your bill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The precise day I cannot say; as soon as I reasonably could after the death—I believe the date is on the bill—it was soon after the death—the inquest was held, I think, on 25th July—I believe the first hearing before the Magistrate, which was postponed, I believe, for the con<lb/>venience of counsel, was before the filing of the bill, and I believe it was a few days after the filing of the bill on the following Thursday, that the meeting before the Magistrate took place—Dr. D'Allex was not charged before the Magistrate—I had served him with a subpoena to attend as a witness—Mr. Sleigh, representing Mr. Parry, who was engaged in this Court, attended as my Counsel—Mr. Sleigh undoubtedly opened the case at very great length—the Magistrate declined to hear evidence, in consequence of the pendency of the suit in Chancery—the Magistrate in the first instance expressed an opinion that there was not a case of conspiracy made out, but after hearing Mr. Sleigh, he altered his opinion—I cannot answer the question whether Mr. Bingham uttered a syllable indicative of a change of opinion—he did not dismiss the summons; he adjourned the summons until after the Chancery proceedings were concluded, saying that he would not dismiss the summons—as he reserved the case, I should say he did indicate a change of opinion—he did not dismiss the summons, but he adjourned it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he not say, upon Mr. Sleigh entreating him to hear the case, that if he could he would please all parties, and he would not hear anything until after the Chancery suit was decided? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe some words to that effect he did state, but he certainly did not dismiss the summons—he did not reject the argument urged by Mr. Sleigh, and the impression upon my mind is that he did not consider it was a case that he ought, as he did</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185411270067"/>
               <p>not, to dismiss—he declined to hear the evidence, stating that he thought it would be indecent for a single Magistrate to hear a case which was before the Lord Chancellor—I think it was on 15th Sept. that I preferred the bill before the Grand Jury.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you did not attend on the adjournment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was adjourned almost <hi rend="italic">sine die;</hi> it was not dismissed; it was adjourned until the Lord Chancellor's judgment should be given—I will not say it was adjourned until the Chancery suit was over—there was an application for an injunction—I should say there was a refusal to entertain it until the suit was over.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT WILKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The Chancery suit is not over, is it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It has been postponed upon the answer, at the application of the defendant—it is not over—I have cited the parties in Doctors, Commons to bring in the will, which they have not done—I cited them at the same time that I filed the bill—I instructed my proctor, and he did not think it expedient to cite them until the commencement of this term—that was certainly whilst this case was pending here; nor can the decision of this case affect the decision of the validity of the will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you last do any legal business for the deceased? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think, according to the best of my recollection, it was in March in the present year, when I was, by his desire, instructed to inquire into, and make proper arrangements with a person of the name of Mismay, with whom it was proposed that he should go into a kind of partnership, and upon that occasion, although I did not personally see Mr. Scoular, he came to my office to see me—some few months previous to that, I had had some com<lb/>munication with Mr. Scoular himself—his business was in the collection of money, or otherwise—I cannot tell when the last time was—it was in the course of the preceding year—it was not years ago—my partner attended to those things more generally; it was the collection of money, which does not come under my department—I do not know that I ever heard of his brother before this matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Although you were his confidential adviser? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not tell you I was his confidential adviser; I said that when he wanted a solicitor he consulted me—I believe if he had any matter of confidence he would consult me upon it—he consulted me upon the subject of his forming a partnership with Loft, and also upon the dissolution—I arranged the disso<lb/>lution—I did not find that the deed of partnership between Edwards and the deceased was nearly a copy of mine that I had made before; on the contrary, I found there were material differences—in the early part of the deed there are words introduced by which Scoular is made to make over, as I read the deed, all book debts—those words are introduced in the recital of the agreement, although they are not in the operative part—in my appre<lb/>hension, if the deed was valid, it would pass the book debts, although it is not in the operative part—a recital is often considered a covenant in part<lb/>nership articles—in the deed with Loft, the partnership capital was to be furnished by the two equally—in this instance they are wholly to be fur<lb/>nished by Scoular—in the partnership with Loft, I think, the capital was 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or a larger sum, and that was to be provided in equal moieties by Loft and Scoular—in the deed with Edwards, it is wholly to be provided by Scoular—the bond is for the consideration—a larger sum was monthly or weekly, I believe it is, to be paid out to Edwards than was to be paid out of a larger capital to Loft, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, instead of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Pray, at that time, let me ask, if you were so intimate with Mr.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185411270068"/>
               <p>Scoular, was he in much better health when he entered into the partnership with Loft? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have never said that I was intimate with Mr. Scoular—I did not consider him in bad health at that time—he was certainly capable of taking an active part in the business at that time, and he did take an active part—I did not accuse Mr. Edwards of having poisoned Mr. Scoular—Mr. Papworth proposed that the Coroner should be called in—Mr. Simpson concurred in it, and I certainly thought it was a proper case for inquiry—I was present before the Coroner, and I did volunteer evidence—I did not instruct Mr. Simpson to commence opening the body—I did not know that he was so doing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you express an opinion that Mr. Edwards had used some unfair means to hasten his death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have written letters which will state the opinion which I expressed—I have stated, and I repeat now, that the mere fact of the absence of poison, and the absence of any appearance of violence, did not satisfy my mind that the death, for which there was palpable and apparent cause, occurring at what time it might, would have occurred at that precise moment, had it not been known that, if delayed, a will would have been executed, had it not been known that a will was about to be executed—I have said this, that the circumstance of the death occurring at the particular moment that it did, although there was disease enough to account for death at any time, certainly led to suspicions that the death might have been accelerated, not by making his will, that his death occurred a short time before it was known he would make his will—I do not know by what means it was accelerated—my notion was, that he held his life by so extremely attenuated a tenure, that the most trifling circumstance might have tended to destroy life—I have certainly not expressed an opinion that Edwards had used unfair means to accelerate the death of Mr. Scoular—I have said that the death might have resulted from any cause whatever—I said there was sufficient cause to justify suspicion that his death might have been accelerated—I went on the 21st to take his instructions for his will; on the 22nd I did take his instructions, and prepared his will in accordance with those instructions; and on the 23rd I went to take his signature—I prepared the draft on the 22nd, and in the draft there was one blank, and one blank only, which was for the amount of the legacy to be given to his cousin—I have got both the draft and the copy here (<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—it was Mr. Scoular himself who mentioned the cousins, before I did—I have always said so—I asked him what sums he chose to leave his cousins—he aid he had not made up his mind, and therefore the blank was left that he might make up his mind between that and the next morning—with the exception of those two legacies, he ordered that the whole of the rest of his property should go to his brother George—I suppose it would not take me more than ten minutes or a quarter of an hour to draw a will of that description—I suppose I was with him more than half an hour—if you please, I will tell you all that occurred upon that occasion—it was on Saturday, 22nd July, the day before his death—I went upstairs to his bed-room—Mr. Papworth was not there—George Scoular was there when I went up—he fetched me, and I went up with him—I said, "I am very sorry, Scoular, to see you so ill"—I commenced the conversation with him in that way—his answer was, as I understood him, "Not so ill"—after some conversation about the partnership articles, and his directing his brother to look for it, and not finding the key, Scoular said, "We will talk of that lay and <hi rend="italic">bye;</hi> there is to be a will"—I said, "Yes; I have come to take your instructions for your will"—George Scoular was in the room</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185411270069"/>
               <p>when that was said—I then asked George Scoular for pen, ink, and paper, and he gave me a sheet of note paper, and a magnum bonum pen with a handle which would not fit into it, and an ink bottle which I could hardly put it in—George Scoular produced the paper and the pen out of a book in his pocket, and he went into another room and brought the ink bottle—the deceased then suggested that his brother should go out of the room, and I requested him to go out—I then said to him, "What do you propose to do with your property?" or something to that effect—I believe those were the words—it was either, "What are your testamentary intentions?" or, "What do you propose to do with your property?"—he said, "I don't exactly know," or some words like that—they were words stating that he was not prepared—what the precise words were I will not take upon myself to say—you have my affidavit before you, and if I state anything inconsistent with it you can contradict me—at the present moment I am not prepared to state the precise words; whether it was, "I have not thought about it," or, "I am not exactly prepared," I know not; it was one or the other—I will not take upon myself to swear what was the precise form of words he used—I believe I said, "You had better make up your mind," and I believe the expression he used was, "I have not quite made up my mind, or thought about it"—I said, "You had better do so at once"—I said, "What relations have you?" by way of leading his mind to what he intended to do with his property, and his answer was, "There is but that youth," referring to his brother.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What aged man is he? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Scoular was about sixty and his brother fifty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT WILKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you then say, "Am I to understand that you wish to give everything to your brother?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—he said, "Yes"—I then said, "If such are your intentions, I can prepare your will in a very few words; it will run thus: 'I give all I die possessed of to my brother George, and I appoint my said brother the sole executor of this my will'"—I said, "Is that what you mean?" or, "Is that your wish?" and he said, "Yes"—I commenced writing the said will—I wrote the words, "This is the last will and testament of me, William Scoular of—"—there is the paper—I did not read it out to him—he then made an intimation, a sound, that he wanted to speak to me, and I left off, and went to his bed to speak to him—I believe the bedroom was not much larger than this small space here (<hi rend="italic">in front of the witness box</hi>)—I went from the table to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You could not hear him a yard and a half off could you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was difficult for him, I think, to speak loud enough for me to have heard him at two yards or a yard and a half off—he was extremely feeble.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT WILKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he say, "There are two cousins"? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did—I said, "The Thompsons?"—he said, "Yes"—I asked him whether he intended to give them anything—he said, "Yes"—I first, I believe, asked their names, and where they resided—he told me Janet and Mary Ann Thompson, and they resided at Edinburgh, somewhere, in lodgings—I believe I also asked him whether there were any other persons to whom he desired to give legacies—he said, "No"—I then asked him how much he proposed to give them—I believe he said, "I have not made up my mind," or something to that effect—it may have been, "I have not thought about it"—I will not say the precise words in which he stated it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It is rather an important difference; if you can, tell us? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I rather incline to think the words were, "I have not made up my</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT WILKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you venture to swear that he did not say, "I have not thought about it?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will not swear that he did not use those words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not say, "Why, you should do so," and ask him whether it would be 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., each? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did use words to that effect—I believe I stated this: "This is a case in which there appears to be a likeli<lb/>hood of litigation; you must bear in mind that, in the event of litigation, if the costs are not paid by the other party, they will come upon the residue, and therefore you should regulate whatever you give to your cousins with reference to the amount of your property, and with reference to the amount you intend to give your brother; bearing in mind that he, out of the residue, will have to pay the legal expenses"—I expected litigation with Mr. Edwards.</p>

Did he not tell you that he would prefer that the will should be delayed another day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he did not—finding that he hesitated in fixing the amount to be given to his cousins, I said this, "I fear I have already fatigued you, I will prepare the will in this way: 'I give to my cousins so much each, the residue to my brother, and appoint my brother my executor;' is that your wish? if so, I will prepare the will, and bring it to you to-morrow to fill up, and by that time you can make up your mind as to the amount of legacy you will give your cousins"—I should say I did not ask him if he would prefer it being delayed until the follow<lb/>ing day, that he might consider about the amount—I believe I have the draft of my affidavit here—I have here the office copy of it—(<hi rend="italic">the witness was desired to refresh his memory from it</hi>)—when I inquired what he pro<lb/>posed to give his cousins, he said he did not quite know—I should say he did not use the words, "I have not thought about it"—according to the best of my belief, I swear he did not—you may caution me as much as you please, I do not need cautioning; I am quite aware that I am upon my oath—I swear, according to the best of my recollection and belief, that he did not use those words—I have not been using the original affidavit for the purpose of refreshing my memory—I do not know that I have read over that affidavit; I believe, before the last indictment, I looked at it, without reading it, merely casting my eye through it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the document you were looking at? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> An office copy of the affidavit; the affidavit being filed in Chancery, a copy is given out by the office of the Clerks of Writs and Record.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>his cousins—I asked him if he had property in the Bank, or about the house, except the stock in trade—he did not say there was 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid into the partnership—he said there was money in the Bank, as in Loft's matter—I do not believe that he at all mentioned the sum of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—according to my belief I will swear he did not, to the best of my recollection; I will not swear that he did not, but I state distinctly that, according to the beat of my recollection, no such sure was mentioned by him—I asked him if he thought the property he had in the house was all right—he did not answer, "I do not know, I will see;" he answered, "I don't know"—I said, "Then I think it is better that you should see"—I was standing almost close to him at that time—he spoke lowly; whether he could speak louder or not I do not know—he spoke above his breath, he spoke in a low voice—he appeared extremely feeble.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long were you with him altogether, half an hour? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think about half an hour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did it not occur to you that it was rather a perilous matter, this man being almost <hi rend="italic">in articles mortis</hi>, to occupy his tune for nearly half an hour? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I thought that I had quite tired him enough, and I so told him—I cer<lb/>tainly considered that he was likely to die soon—whether he would live for a week, a fortnight, or a month longer, I could not judge, but it appeared to me that he was <hi rend="italic">in extremis</hi>—at that time I certainly did not suspect that he had been poisoned; I thought he was so extremely ill that his death might occur at any time—Mr. Simpson suggested the inquest; I certainly concurred in the propriety of the suggestion, as I thought that the death, occurring at the precise moment it did, was an extraordinary coincidence—I certainly have not the slightest supposition that my conversation with him could have hastened his death for a moment—I do not think so now—nothing occurred which was calculated to excite him; he was not excited, and I do not con<lb/>sider that his death could have been hastened by it—I thought I had talked quite long enough to fatigue him, and I therefore proposed to bring his will next day—I was extremely surprised to hear that he was dead—the fact of his death at any time would not have surprised me, but his death at that moment surprised me materially, notwithstanding the conversation I had had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I do not understand you; you say his death at any moment would not have surprised you, but at that moment it did? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The death occurring at that particular moment, when the will was ready to be pre<lb/>pared appeared to me an extraordinary coincidence—it did not surprise me, because there was quite enough apparent cause to account for death at any time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you any doctor with you to see how much this dying man could bear? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not on the Saturday I had not, and on the Sunday I did not take him with a view to see how much he could bear, but took him to witness the will; although I did not consider a medical man was necessary to witness a will, leaving everything to his own relations, but expressly to see that he was put in a state of bodily comfort, and expressly to see to his bodily comfort—I certainly did not consider it necessary to take a medical man on the Saturday, nor did I consider, from the state in which I saw him, that there was anything in what passed calculated to excite him—I think I had seen him previous to visiting him upon the sub<lb/>ject of the will, some time about the middle of the preceding year; perhaps about twelve months before—I cannot tell how recently before that I had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185411270072"/>
               <p>seen him—I occasionally met him at Mr. Papworth's, and he occasionally came to my office; he had not much business to transact, and I never was in the habit of going to his house—in the ten years preceding his death, perhaps I had seen him twenty or fifty times; I cannot give you very accu<lb/>rately the times—he was not a man whose habits induced me to visit him, although I considered him in the character of a friend—I mean his personal habits; he was a man of slow habits and mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Being a man of slow mind, I think you must rather have adminis<lb/>tered a dose to him for that half hour? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not consider that I ad<lb/>ministered any dose whatever; I thought I had done quite enough to tire him—possibly fatigue at that time is very near death—it is possible I was very imprudent in talking too much; I abstained as much as I could, except upon the immediate purpose for which I came—I recommended him to see that his stock was right, not his stock; I said, "Have you any other pro<lb/>perty?"—I found that Mr. Edwards, from his own words to me, had been looking among his private papers, and I found that he had sent property away from the house, and therefore I thought it quite proper that he should see—Edwards told me that he had learned the address of George Scoular from looking among his private papers—I did not recommend the deceased to go and look himself; I said, "You had better see that it is all right;" I meant by employing his brother, or anybody he pleased; he certainly was not in a condition to walk, or do anything.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, he not being a valuable client, and you not knowing much about him, why should you assume any right whatever to make his will? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Be<lb/>cause I was sent for to make his will, because I had received instructions, and it had been postponed—I did not force myself to this dying man's bed-side upon the suggestion of the brother, to whom all this money was to go—I had been consulted about the making of the will, by Mr. Papworth, as coming direct from him—on the 12th, I was appointed to come on Thurs<lb/>day, on the 13th my attendance was postponed, on the 19th I received a communication from Mr. Campbell and Mr. Papworth, that he had expressed a wish to see me to make his will; on the 20th I was informed that he had expressed a desire to see me to make his will; on the 21st I went for that purpose; on the 21st I heard from Mr. Simpson, which was stated in the presence of Edwards, that he was fearful of giving offence, and therefore he had postponed me; on the 22nd his brother came to town, and I accom<lb/>panied his brother to him; I sent up his brother to him to tell him that I was there, and to ask if he wished to see me, and he sent word down that he wished to see me—I went up, therefore, to him—I did not introduce the subject by saying that I came to make his will; I asked him first about his health, and spoke of the partnership articles, and he then said, "There is to be a will"—I did not say that the partnership was a riddle to me, I did not say anything about a riddle—that was the way in which I came to be at his bedside; Mr. Scoular and I had no conversation about his property—Mr. George Scoular came to my office, and told me what had taken place at the interview between himself and his brother that morning; and in my way up to Scoular's I asked him what relations he had, and he told me he was his only brother, and that he had two cousins of the name of Thomp<lb/>son—when I went to the deceased's bedside, I and George Scoular had not had one word of conversation about the disposition of the property—George Scoular is now my client in this matter, he is the person paying the costs of all these proceedings, he is my client, and he is indebted to me for every<lb/>thing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185411270073"/>
               <p>—I certainly intend to render him liable for the costs of all these pro<lb/>ceedings—I look to him for payment, in the Chancery suit, the police court, Doctors' Commons, and the Old Bailey—Scoular will have to pay them all; there is no other person that I can look to, and he is liable to me—I have told him repeatedly that it would be extremely expensive—I told him so before I had spent a single shilling—he is a gentleman living somewhere in Edinburgh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose you have ascertained whether he has got any money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the first instance my conviction is, that it is impossible the will can be main<lb/>tained—I mean the will giving the property to Edwards—then the property will slip into Scoular's hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And then it will slip out of his hands into—? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is no question he will be liable to me for a certain amount of costs—there is no action going on, a suit was issued which ran out; immediately after the Coroner's inquest, I got one or two letters from Mr. Plowright, in the name of Edwards, threatening to bring actions against Mr. Papworth, against Mr. Simpson, and against myself, for defamation—I am not in the habit of defaming anybody intentionally.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you just insinuate that there was a little bit of murder? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, nor a little smothering—I stated then, and I state now, that I thought there was quite sufficient cause to justify inquiry into his death, and there might be reason to suppose that his death had been accelerated—I did not state by whom—if you ask me by whom I now state, I say there were various persons about—the nurse told me that nobody had seen Scoular after I had seen him, except George Scoular, whereas I have since discovered that many did—I do not say who I think murdered him; I do not say that I think anybody murdered him—I say there was reason to suppose that his death might have been accelerated; by whom I have neither said, nor do I see that I am called upon to say—I think some time in the month of July a writ was served upon me—nothing further has been done in that writ—they are quite welcome to bring the action, and I am quite ready to defend it—a writ was also issued against Mr. Papworth—he brought the writ to me—he understood quite enough what it was for, and Mr. Simpson likewise—he did not require any explanation; he had received a letter, which I have here—I should say there could be no mistake what it was for—what it was for was, I presume, to intimidate us, for I do not believe there was a serious intention to bring an action—I suppose Mr. Papworth could not make any mistake about the nature of the charge—he certainly understood what the nature of the charge was—I do not know that before I sent any message, Edwards had sent a telegraphic mes<lb/>sage to George Scoular; I know that on the same day that Mr. Pap<lb/>worth was advised by roe to write to his brother I got the telegraphic message, which I will produce, which Mr. Edwards sent to him—it is dated the 20th—it is a telegraphic message sent to George Scoular, desiring him to come up to town—here is the document; it is a written document, it had better speak for itself; it is a letter, advising him to come up to town immediately—I suppose that was not before any of us had sent to him—Mr. Papworth had written on that same day, the 20th—he wrote by pos t—I had advised him to write a telegraphic message; but he could not find the address, so he wrote by post.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, in point of fact, it was the message of Edwards that brought Scoular to town? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Papworth will answer that question; he has</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185411270074"/>
               <p>answered it already—if you ask me, I say he did not come up in conse<lb/>quence of the message, but he came up in consequence of a communication from Mr. Steele, and Mr. Papworth's letter—as a telegraph travels faster than a letter, I must infer that he had the message first.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You believe he had? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe he had—the letter and the telegraphic message were sent on the same day.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say he was not at all excited; how do you account for the fact of finding him sitting out of his bed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> 1 believe that that was occasionally his practice, by way of relief; he was sitting with his legs band<lb/>aged, upon the bed—I found him so and I left him so—I presume that I know his writing—there is a sufficient resemblance in the execution of the will that has been shown to me, not to induce me to say that it is not Mr. Scoular's—I believe it to be his.</p>

               <p>in the deceased's bedroom on my first visit—there was some loud talking, and he retired into another room at my suggestion—on my second visit the deceased told me something about Dr. D'Allex making him write a letter; and afterwards, on the occasion of the analysis of the stomach and liver, I told Dr. D'Allex that the deceased had informed me, on my last visit on Friday, that he had compelled him to send a letter to put off seeing Mr. Papworth, as he had expressed a wish to do—he nodded an assent; he did not deny the fact: he merely bowed his head—he did not say "compelled," but "made him sign a letter"—that he threatened that he would not attend him, or have anything more to do with him, if he allowed Mr. Papworth to visit him—that is the only conversation I have had with Dr. D'Allex.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Sometimes there is such a thing as alleviating disease and pain; did you and Dr. D'Allex set to work to see how you could alleviate his pain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was perfectly without pain, and told me that he should get well; he expressed himself as perfectly happy—said I was sorry to see him so ill—he said he was not ill, and he hoped to get better—I did not <hi rend="italic">hit out</hi> any new remedies, or old ones either—I left him perfectly satisfied with Dr. D'Allex's treatment—I have said so all along—I should not object to Dr. D'Allex being paid for it—I consider that a medical man ought always to be paid; in fact he cannot be paid too well—the state of Mr. Scoular's legs was a secondary consideration; it was the disease—he had his legs bandaged—they would require continual treatment; the nurse would do that—they had swelling of the cellular tissue, which would require continual attention—it was the fact of organic disease pressing on the larger vessels, and inflammation set in—I do not think 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. too much for twelve months' attendance on a man in that condition, certainly not—I went, before the Coroner to prove the truth—Mr. Scoular died a natural death—he was not poisoned, or smothered, or shaken to death—I said that no human power could save him, but that is not analysing the contents of the stomach—a man might labour under disease, and yet be poisoned.</p>

               <p>poison was a suggestion of my own mind—it is always customary, when you have made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, for the Coroner to ask you, though there is sufficient disease, if you have examined the contents of the stomach—I examined to ascertain the presence of poison—it was merely to see that everything was right.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not you think that a medical man might conscientiously have recommended that it should be postponed for a week? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think he would say that being so well it was the proper time—I did not anti<lb/>cipate his death—he was in that state that I considered it my duty to suggest it, though he probably might live a month or six weeks, his mind being calm and collected, though he was so ill—I do not think that a medical man could conscientiously entertain an opinion that it was dan<lb/>gerous to trouble him about his will at such a time—I should not have had the least objection to his seeing his solicitor—if his mind had been at all impaired he would not be in a state to make his will—a medical man might conscientiously entertain that opinion, but that is not my opinion, certainly not—my opinion was that anything like an altercation would injure him, anything which excited him, in short; and he said to me the following</p>

               <p>morning, "You saw what a disturbance took place yesterday"—I did not know what he alluded to, and he said, "Dr. D'Allex and Mr. Papworth"—it is usual for doctors to say, "If you do not obey my instructions I shall decline to attend you"—I myself should decline to attend any patient who did not attend to my instructions.</p>

I saw Chapman lying on the deck, and Brazell and Smith were standing over his head, and about a dozen other men were at some distance off—I did not see Parkes at that time—while Chapman was lying on the deck I saw Brazell give him one kick on the head—after I saw him kicked I turned and spoke to Mr. Kinnear—I said, "They have got Chapman down, and are kicking him"—I looked round again, and Chapman was on his feet, and blood was coming trickling down his brow when he came aft—as near as I can remember the kick was on the right side of the head—the blood appeared to come in that direction—Kinnear went in the direction where Chapman was, but Chapman was on his feet, before he got there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk, and live at No. 8, Whitmore-road, Hoxton. On Thursday evening, 19th Nov., between 8 and 9 o'clock, I was in company with the deceased, William Henry Cooling, in Charles-place, Hoxton New-town; we were standing conversing together at the corner—I heard some person behind make some observation; I do not know exactly what the words were, but I know it was passed upon our collars—I turned round and saw the prisoner, and others with him, close by—we went up to them, and the deceased spoke to the prisoner, but I do not know what he said—a few words passed between them; I do not know what they were—the prisoner made use of a very bad expression, upon which the deceased struck him in the face with his fist—they immediately closed together—the prisoner lowered his head to the deceased's belly, and with the assistance of his arms he gave him a very heavy fall—they fell together, the deceased undermost—he laid flat, with his arms stretched out, and his head on one side; I did not see him move; he could not get up—I raised him up—his cap had fallen off in the scuffle—he fell in a kind of gutter; there are large pebble stones there—while he was lying there, the prisoner remarked that he was only shamming—he afterwards went for a doctor—the deceased was rather taller than the prisoner; he was just such another youth as I am, about an inch shorter.</p>

               <p>called to No. 54, Chart-street, Hoxton, about 9 o'clock, on Thursday night, 19th Nov.—I found the deceased lying insensible on the floor, from the effects of a blow at the back of the head; there was a large tumour, about the size of a hen's egg, at the back of the head on the right side—I opened the head, and underneath that tumour I found a quantity of blood effused, between the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi> and the brain, which caused the death—a fall on the back of the head would be likely to produce that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am nineteen years old, and am the son of Robert Crossley who was tried here last Sessions, and who is now in prison; he kept a beer shop in Bermondsey—I resided with him there, and assisted him in his business—I know Baker, who was butler to General Eden—I first saw the prisoner to notice him, on Saturday, 9th Sept., about 10 o'clock in the morning at my father's shop—on that day, by my father's direction, I went to General Eden's house—I got there about half past 7 o'clock in the morning, and received from Baker a rush basket with a flat bottom, which contained plate—I took it to my father's house, and gave it to him when I got in, and he took it up stairs, and put it in the front bed room—in about half an hour the prisoner came; my father went up stairs with him, and I followed—they weighed the plate, and while they were doing so the prisoner took out a tankard; it was an old fashioned one, with a bust of Queen Anne at the top, and about thirty coins let in—my father said he thought it was gold; the prisoner said, "No, it is silver I know, because I have such things passing through my hands every day;" and he asked me if I had got a file—I said I had got one down stairs; he desired me to fetch it—he tried the tankard with the file, and I believe it turned out to be silver—it was gilt—that, as well as the rest of the plate, was weighed; there was some spoons and forks, and a fish ladle, of old fashioned make—the prisoner and my father together weighed it, in what had been a potatoe machine which was kept up stairs; it weighed about twenty pounds—they were iron weights, potatoe weights—after it was weighed, the prisoner put it into the basket again from which it had been taken—I saw 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold paid to my father by the prisoner, out of a little canvass bag, such as this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), just the same colour—I cannot swear to it, as it had a string like this (<hi rend="italic">red tape</hi>)—after the money had been paid the prisoner asked me to carry the basket out for him to a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he said, "Take this; I am going to take this along with me, and I will pay you for your trouble"—he left the house first, and I followed him to Weston-street, and found a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> waiting under the arch of the railway there; he took the plate of me, got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and drove off—I saw him again between 4 and 5 o'clock on that afternoon; he brought back the same basket, but without the plate—on the following morning, about the same time, I went to Onslow-square again (I got up that morning at 6 o'clock; I think my father and mother, and my little brother slept in the same room with me that Saturday night, and my brother Robert slept in the same bed as me)—when I got to Onslow-square, I saw Baker again—I had taken the basket in the after<lb/>noon previous, Saturday: and left it there, and on the Monday morning I received it again from Baker filled—I took it to my father's house; it con<lb/>tained plate the same as before, but new fashioned—my father took it up stairs—I gave it to him directly I got inside the door—about 1 o'clock the prisoner came, and they went up stairs together—I was up stairs cleaning myself in the room where the weighing machine was, and where the family slept—I saw the prisoner empty the basket, and weigh the plate—there was a plain silver teapot, four large silver dishes, four smaller ones, and some silver spoons, which the prisoner admired—he said that they were very massive table spoons—he put about half a dozen of them in a paper, folded</p>

               <p>them up, and put them in his pocket after they were weighed—the plate was then put into the basket by the prisoner, and I believe there was about the same quantity of money passed as the day before; it was all in gold, and was taken out of the same bag—the prisoner employed me to carry it as before, and I followed him to St. Thomas's-street East, on the other side of the river, where there was a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> waiting at the bar which stops carriages from going down; it was not a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stand—the prisoner took the plate of me, got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and drove away—he did not give me any money; he gave me a glass of gin—on Wednesday, the 13th, Baker came to my father's house, and remained there till the 25th, when he was taken into custody, and my father also—after my father was taken I accompanied sergeant Whicher to Petticoat-lane, and found the prisoner there; he had just come out of a house there, a public house I believe—I then said some<lb/>thing to Whicher, and he took him into custody.</p>

I received that parcel on Saturday, 28th Oct., about 2 o'clock in the day—I opened it—it contained some watch bags and five pieces of brick—they are there now—they are in the same state—my assistant saw me open it—he is not here—I immediately communicated with Mr. Hewett—he lives in Bristol, close to my place—we arranged to come to London to make inquiries—on Monday morning I went to Mr. Hewett's office, in the Old Bailey, to make inquiries—Mr. Hewett came up with me on Sunday night, and went to the office on Monday morning—I looked about the yard; I saw a piece of brick—Mr. Hewett and I had gone into the counting-house, and asked Mr. Lavington about the parcel—I was about to leave, and looked round the yard, about the counting-house door—I saw a heap of rubble just behind the counting-house door—I beckoned to Mr. Hewett, and said, "What is this?"—Mr. Lavington, the father, said, "That is for repairing the yard;" he said, "There is no brick there; it is only stone"—I said, "There are some pieces of brick;" and on going a little further I found this large piece of brick (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have examined this brick with the brick that was in the box, and find three pieces fit—these three pieces fit; this other does not—(<hi rend="italic">the brick and pieces were examined by the Court and Jury, and fitted exactly</hi>)—I subsequently informed the police—I went with the inspector and Moss, the detective, to the prisoner's lodgings, and saw them searched—the first occasion I went, was the day the prisoner was given into custody, on the Monday—the second occasion was on the Tuesday week following—the policeman found on the second occasion a piece of piper—he has it—that piece of paper has been fitted to some papers which were in the box which the stones were in—it is dark paper—that is all I know about the matter—we found it in the box—I can identify it—Mr. Hewett wrote his name upon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You had brought up the paper from Bristol? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had, in the box—I did not search the prisoner's box on the first day—I was standing in the room—I saw the policeman searching it—I was not searching the box to see if anything could be found—on that occasion nothing whatever was found in reference to this—the prisoner was present—I had brought up those pieces of paper on the first occasion—I did not, that I am aware of, on the first occasion, say, "Perhaps we shall find something like this"—I did not take the paper out—I did not point to it—I showed it to Mr. Lavington at his warehouse—I did not say, "It is possible we may find something like this."</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are trifling with our time; did you, or did you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you believe you did? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it is likely I did—I believe I did, because I wished to see if there was any like it—when the search of the boxes of the prisoner was made, watches or duplicates were searched for—I did not direct them to look for the paper—I did not myself look into the box to see if I could find anything like it—I believe nothing was found while the prisoner was present to connect him with this—I left on Thursday, the 3rd, and came up on the Monday evening following; and on Tuesday, the 7th, I went to the prisoner's lodgings—I did not take him with me—I looked at his boxes without the presence of anybody on his part, except the woman he lodged with—she is here—I cannot say whether she is to be called as a witness—the policeman searched the box on that occasion—I was looking over, part of the time—I had not this piece of paper with me at the time—it was in the box at the station house—the policeman searched the box and gave up the paper—I did not search the box—I did not shake up the things at all—I did touch the things—after the policeman had searched and found the paper, he touched me, and said, "Here, this looks like it," or, "like a piece," and I said, "It is too dark."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he say, "like it"? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was the idea he conveyed—I was looking for letters, but he referred to the paper he had found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The prisoner was not there, the box was not there, and you had not spoken to the policeman about the paper, and you were looking for letters? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was the object of our going there—I cannot account for the policeman saying "This looks like it."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Am I to understand you to swear that you never touched the things in that box before the policeman found the paper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I took out a piece of music which was on the top and a letter—I think that was all I took out—when the policeman opened the box the first thing was a piece of music, and I took that out and one letter, and I was reading that and the policeman took out some others—I think it is likely that I first touched the things in the box—I have a doubt—I think it may have been the policeman—the music and letter were first, but I am not sure whether the policeman did not take out something else at the same time—if he did, he need not have groped under them, as they did not cover half the surface of the box—the letter was about the prisoner enlisting as a soldier—I cannot say whether I began the search—the prisoner was not there—nothing was found on the first occasion, and this remarkable piece of paper was found by the policeman on the second occasion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, I ask you, Sir, did not the policeman look, and say he could find nothing, or words to that effect, and did not you say to him, "Let me look?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not—I did not, on looking, point out this piece of paper—I did not myself point out that piece of paper to the landlady—the first I saw of the paper was in the policeman's hands—I did not point it out to the landlady—when the policeman found the piece of paper, I said, "Here is a piece that looks more like it"—that was a piece of whitey brown which was on the table; the policeman drew my attention to it—he said, "This looks like it," or something like that—I had not been talking to him about the piece of paper—he knew I had a piece, because he had it in his possession—I found a part of this brick—after I found the first piece Mr. Hewett found</p>

               <p>another while I was away at the station house—Mr. Hewett and Mr. Lavington were present when I found the first piece—they are here—they saw me pick it up—I am a silversmith and watchmaker—I was apprenticed to the business—that is the only business I have carried on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you been engaged in tracing out persons on other occasions? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You refer, I suppose, to a remark I made to Mr. Lavington about coming to London—some time ago a Mend of mine was bankrupt, and he came from Bristol, and was ill—I came to London and found him out—it was an act of private friendship—they were not my goods, but the goods of a friend of mine—I have not been attended by a medical man.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What are you suffering from? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Bowel complaint—diarrhoea and sickness—I did not put the paper into the prisoners box for the purpose of it's being found.</p>

                  </hi>. I came up with the last witness from Bristol, on Sunday night, 29th Oct.—I went to the yard on the Monday morning with Mr. Bale—Mr. Bale made a search, and found a piece of brick in the yard—I am not positive that I saw him find it—I afterwards made a search, and found another piece of brick, corresponding with that which Mr. Bale found—that is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You cannot say that you saw Mr. Bale find that brick? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am pretty sure I did not see him pick it up—I was in the office with Mr. Lavington, and he beckoned to me to come out—he said that there was a heap of rubbish in the yard, and that he had picked up a small piece of brick corresponding with those pieces in the box—we turned round in conversation—Mr. Bale was behind, still looking over the bricks, and called my attention to another piece which he had picked up—neither Mr. Lavington nor I saw him pick it up—I found a second piece—Mr. Bale did not say anything to me about looking farther to see if I could find more—he came and produced it to me and Mr. Lavington, and we both said it was very like the nature of the brick in the box, and Mr. Bale went to the police station to get a detective—I remained in the yard—curiosity led me to look about, and I found the other bit within three or four yards of the place where Mr. Bale found this.</p>

I am a detective policeman—I was employed in this matter—I went to the lodgings of the prisoner—I searched his box on the first occasion—I did not find anything—Mr. Bale was with me—I afterwards searched his lodgings again, for the purpose of finding some letters—when I met Mr. Bale in the morning, he suggested that we should go and see the landlady, and inquire about a letter which he said he had received from Southampton—I went and searched his lodgings again—I found this small piece of paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—that piece matches with some others—the marks upon it are my initials—(<hi rend="italic">the witness produced two pieces of paper</hi>) these are the papers in which some of the stones were wrapped—as far as I know I received them in the box from Mr. Bale—I can fit that (<hi rend="italic">the piece found in the prisoner's box</hi>) in here—my object in going to the box a second time, was to look over the letters to see what acquaintances he had got—I came near to the bottom of the box, I lifted up a waistcoat, and this piece of paper dropped from the waistcoat and fell to the bottom of the box.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you or did you not go to search for a piece of paper like that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not think of the paper at all till I found it, it did not strike me about the paper—nothing at all bad passed about searching for paper of that description—my attention had not been called before I went to search the second time, to the large piece of paper having a piece torn out of the corner—I received this large piece from Mr. Bale, on 7th Nov., the day that the prisoner was committed; that was after we found the small piece, after we came from the Hall—Mr. Bale had been in possession of the box and paper up to that time—I had seen the box and the paper before the first search; and Bale had called my attention to it—I did not find the small piece of paper</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185411270106"/>
               <p>on the first search, I had no idea of searching for it—the watch box was emptied of its contents at the station—I think it likely that the small piece of paper could have been in the box the first time without my seeing it, because I did not take anything out, as I was quite certain the watches and duplicates were not there.</p>
               <p>

On Sunday night I was aroused by the opening of a window above—I jumped out of bed, opened the window, and saw the prisoner receiving a bundle, coming down from above—that was while the prisoner was lodging with me—his wife was living with him while he lodged in the house—he lodged on the second floor; I live on the ground and first floor—I could see the bundle coming down, and I could see what it was—I noticed the blankets and the feather bed—the prisoner ran away—I ran after him—he turned into a court, or passage—I could not see any more of him that night—I saw him eight days after, on a Monday, at the corner of Prescott-street—I asked him whether he thought it right to treat me like that—he said, "Stop a minute, I will go to my governor, get some money, and settle with you"—I went with him—he took me close to the railway, in the Minories; he then ran under some of Pickford's wagons, and tried to escape—I called "Police!" and he was stopped—after I pursued him on the night of the robbery I went up to his room, and found everything gone—I left the door open when I pursued him—I went to bed at about 11 o'clock that night—the prisoner and his wife were then in doors—I myself fastened the door—none of the things have been found.</p>

On Sunday, 5th Nov., between 3 and 4 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Holywell-lane, Shoreditch—I saw the prisoners, Edney and Mayhew, standing outside the prosecutor's shop window—I have known Edney for two years—I am quite sure he was one of the men—I saw him as plainly as I see you now—it was a bright moonlight morning—I am sure of the three prisoners—I went and stood in a doorway opposite the King John public house—it was a dark place—I could see them very plainly but they could not see me—I saw Prior standing in a court six or eight yards from the prosecutor's shop—I had not known her before—I have no doubt she was the person—she was standing, looking out, at the end of the court, but she could not see me—I then heard some glass break, and I ran towards the men—when I ran towards them, they ran up the court, where Prior was standing—I could not discern whether they had anything with them, as I was running—I followed them into the court, and I heard a door slam just as I entered the court—I did not see where the female went—I ran down the court, and pulled the door—it is a side door—there is no number to it—it is about eight or nine yards down the court, from the lane—I had lost sight of all the prisoners before I heard the door slam—I pulled the door, and it appeared as if there was some one inside holding the door—I could not pull it open—I directly turned back out of the court, and sprang my rattle, and G 20 came to my assistance—we both went to the house, and G 20 went in first—I followed him in, and we found Edney and Mayhew in the same room—Mayhew was standing behind the door, he was dressed—Edney was undressed, and was in bed with a female—I took Mayhew down stairs, and gave him into custody to another officer, who was outside—I went in and searched a little further, and found the prisoner, Prior, on a dust heap, under some steps—she was concealed, and had a shawl covered over her—I took her out, and took her out of the door, along the passage into the lane, and left her with another policeman—I then went up stairs, and the sergeant and I made Edney put his clothes on, and took him down—there was no other man in the same room—there were lodgers, who lodge in the house—we took the three pri<lb/>soners to the station at one time—we then went back to the prosecutor's shop; we had seen that the glass was broken, when we went by with the prisoners—we found one of the shutters was slipped down—the glass was broken, and we could see where the boots had been taken out of the window—I could not see how the shutters were, when I first saw the prisoners in front of the shop, because they were before the shutters.</p>

                  </hi>. I am station master at the Barking-road station, on the North Woolwich branch of the Eastern Counties Railway. The prisoner was also in the service of the Company—clerks are employed at the Barking station to issue the tickets and to receive them—a relieving clerk is employed during the season to relieve the different stations, so as to give each station clerk one day's holiday—the prisoner was the relieving clerk—for one day in each week it would be his duty to relieve the regular acting clerk, and perform all the duties that the clerk had to perform—he had acted in that way for about three months—I was the regular station master there—the prisoner relieved me on Thursday, 19th Oct.—I left by 9.43 train that morning—there is a case, called the ticket case, which is fitted up with tubes—those tubes have tickets inserted in them to issue to the different stations—the tickets, being placed in the tube, are taken from the bottom of the tube in rotation—they are cut after they are issued—the tickets are placed in the tubes in certain quantities, and quite perfect, in the state they are issued—previously to giving them to a passenger, it is the duty of the clerk to stamp them with a stamping machine that we have expressly for that purpose with the date of the day, month, and year.</p>

               <p>and the lowest one you withdraw with your fingers, upon which the next in rotation comes down.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there also a book kept called the train book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there is in that book the first number of the tickets in the tube at the time—this "5547" under the head of "Woolwich," would indicate the commencing number of the tickets, and all the other numbers would follow that—on the morning of 19th Oct. I gave him this train sheet—it would be his duty to put the number of the tickets, if there had been any issued, under the column headed, "Closing numbers"—when the last train has gone up, the tickets are then pulled out, and the number taken into the book—there do not appear to have been any tickets issued that day—I fill the tubes when occasion requires—as we sell out our tickets we have a reserve case expressly for those tickets—when the tubes are low we fill them up again from the reserve—I cannot say when I had filled up the tubes last—there was sufficient for some days—on the morning of the 20th the inspector wished me to open the case in his presence—I did so, and the inspector threw out two tickets—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are stamped with the date of the 19th, and are numbered 5547 and 5548—we take the ticket, when we give it to the passenger, out of the bottom of the tube—the passenger then goes on the platform, and when he gets into the train the ticket is taken away from him by the inspector, or one of the porters, before he starts on his journey—the inspector takes charge of them and clips them—after that, they are put in numbers and sent up to the Audit office, and then we have done with them—Squires drew these two tickets from the tube when I opened it—they were the two first first-class tickets that came in rotation—if they had not been taken out, they would have been issued to passengers on the 20th, if notice was not taken of their being stamped—these two were at the bottom of the tube—they had been replaced at the bottom—tickets that have been once issued would not, under any circumstances, have any right to be put back into the tube—it is possible to put them back in at the bottom without emptying the whole tube, by lifting them up—the prisoner would pay over to me the money for the day's takings—he did not pay over to me a couple of sixpences on account of any first-class passengers.</p>

PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say the prisoner came on the 19th? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; by the first train out of London, which is about a quarter past 9 o'clock—I issued tickets that morning until he came; I issued tickets to three trains—when he came, these first class tickets were all ready in the tube—I had placed them there; I cannot say when, accord<lb/>ing as the tubes required filling—they might have been there for a week or a fortnight, we have not many first class passengers—I think the pri<lb/>soner had been there about three months before, acting as station master—he only acts for the day—it is an arrangement made by the company, to give me a day's holiday now and then—I have been relieved once a week, until the last few months—the prisoner had been there the week before this, he had been relieving once a week for about three months—the tickets come from the printing office when we require a supply, with an invoice of the number of tickets that they send, for which we are accountable—it is an invoice of the number of tickets, and also of the numbers on the tickets in rotation—sometimes 500 tickets come at a time, sometimes 1,000, and sometimes 4,000 or 5,000—I suppose the stamping on these two tickets must have been plainer at one time than now, rubbing would obliterate it to a certain extent, it is printer's ink—these tickets are just as they come</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185411270115"/>
               <p>from the printing office—a portion of this train sheet is in my handwriting, the commencing figures, I believe they are in ink (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—these figures in ink are my handwriting, and the writing as well—they represent the different stations that we book to—we call this a train book, it is a daily account of the traffic which we book for each station—this is the paper that was given to the prisoner, on the morning of 19th Oct.—all the ink writing was upon it when I gave it him—it represents the traffic for the day from the time he took possession, which was about half past 9 o'clock till the following morning, the pencil figures show the traffic—these first columns in ink were written by me, they represent the number of our tickets as they stood in the tubes—the column is headed "Commencing numbers," then under the head of "Closing numbers" the pencil figures represent the traffic, which had occurred up to the time I handed over the paper—"1" and "2" here means first and second class, we have no third class—in making out this list, I do not take out the tickets from the tube and count them; I take the number from the ticket at the bottom of the tube; I draw it partly out to enable me to see the number, and then place the number on the paper; 5547 would be the first number—that was the position of the case when the prisoner took it; I had looked at it that morning and made out this, and it was acknowledged by the prisoner as being correct before it was given to him; we both looked over it together, 5547 was acknowledged by him as correct—the tickets are collected from the passengers before they go off; they are clipped after they are taken from the passengers—you first get your ticket, and go through a door on to the platform—a man stands at that door, who ought to clip the tickets—in the ordinary course of things, the passenger would deliver up his ticket clipped to the party collecting it—the man at the door clips, and collects too—the passenger takes his ticket in the office, and as he goes on to the platform he surrenders it again, after he gets into the carriage—I believe it is not always clipped, before he goes into the carriage; I do not know whether it ought to be—sometimes passengers are to the very minute, and are obliged to jump in, and then they are in a great hurry—it is the usual way to clip them at the door—these pencil figures are the pri<lb/>soner's—they are done at the close of the day—the last train up is at a quarter to 11 o'clock—about 11 o'clock would be the close of the day—trains were running at that time every half hour—there would be full twenty-four or twenty-five trains—the first train, which we call a local train, leaves Stratford at half past 7 o'clock—tickets are collected from the the trains that arrive as well as from those that leave, if persons get out—passengers coming from Woolwich, and stopping at Barking-road, would have to present their tickets before they could pass through—it is the duty of the station master, or the inspector, or the porters, to collect those tickets—the station master leaves for an hour, to go to dinner—at that time I was living at Stratford—I frequently had my tea sent to me, invariably I may say—when I am absent the inspector gives out the tickets—there is an inspector and one porter at that station at present, besides the station master—there was also a boy, but he has left—he was a porter—it was the prisoner's duty to give me the money that he took on that day—he sent me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that day—it was brought into my bedroom by a little girl that I keep—that was the exact amount, according to the number of tickets on this paper as issued that day—some of these pencil memorandums are mine, those that have crosses to them, the adding up—the others are the prisoner's—this leaf is taken out of the train book—none of the closing figures are</p>

               <p>mine—I had issued tickets that morning—I only issued one first-class ticket—this is the original train book (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—this is copied from the paper that has been produced, "Ticket 5547, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., Woolwich," is the ticket that I issued—"5547" means the ticket in the ease—this is a copy from the closing numbers, but not the commencing numbers—this "5547" is the number I took down at the time—I left the case in charge of the prisoner—this book contains the number "5546"—that is not copied from the list—the commencing numbers are not copied, only the closing numbers, because I had issued tickets previously that morning—this sum of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. represents the amount taken that day, both by the prisoner and myself—I took away the amount of my takings that morning, leaving sufficient for change for the prisoner to work the day—there was sufficient cash left to issue tickets in case parties had wanted change—the amount received is ascertained from the closing numbers of Wednesday—that appears in the commencing numbers of the next morning—there is no other memorandum but this book—I took money before the prisoner came—I did not make a memorandum of those sums—it is taken from the closing numbers of Wed<lb/>nesday night—I did not make any pencil memorandum—it is not required—it was optional with the prisoner to do it—he might have put it in ink if he had liked—he must have made some memorandum to show his work; I did not, but I am accountable if there is any deficiency—the prisoner would be accountable if a deficiency was observed—that occasionally occurs—sometimes I have had to account for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or something like that—sometimes the tickets are not in rotation, which causes a deficiency for the time, but they follow afterwards—I cannot give you any idea of the number of tickets issued at that station in the course of the day; it depends entirely upon the time of year, and the traffic—we are very dull now—the Satur<lb/>days, Sundays, and Mondays, are, generally speaking, the busiest days—this was on a Thursday—generally speaking, Thursdays and Fridays are very dull days.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector in the service of the Eastern Counties Railway Company; the prisoner was also in the Company's service. On 19th Oct. he was the acting station master at the Barking station—I was there in the afternoon of that day, in company with two porters named Battle and Armstrong; I was on the down platform—I and the porters stood at the door as the passengers came out, after they had taken their tickets in the office—for some reason I had I examined the ticket of each passenger as he came out, and made a memorandum at the time of what the numbers of the tickets were, and of the train—I saw two tickets, Nos. 5547 and 5548, by the seven minutes past 3 o'clock train—I have here a correct copy of the memorandum which I took at the time, the original got so dirty that I lost it somewhere, but I can swear this to be correct—I copied it three weeks or a month ago; I copied it from the original one that I lost, because it had got so dirty, and the figures were not plain—I am able to remember the numbers independent of that memorandum—I can swear that the numbers were 5547 and 5548—they were in the hands of two gentle-men when I examined them—I saw those gentlemen get into a first class car<lb/>riage; and when they had got in the prisoner collected the tickets of them; I saw him take them—his duty was to hand them to me to cancel after the train was gone—he collected part of the second class tickets as well—he did not hand over any tickets to me to be cancelled—I saw him put the two first class tickets in his pocket; I expect that he put them in his pocket, I saw him put his hand to his pocket—next morning I found those two tickets in the tube, stamped and dated, Oct 19; they had no right whatever to be there—I was on the spot, so that the tickets might have been handed to me at once, I never left the platform.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where did you stand on the platform, while the train was going off? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About the centre—that is about fifteen yards from the office—persons come into the office and get the tickets, and then come on to the platform towards me—I never was instructed to clip the tickets before the passengers go in, I have done it sometimes—it is our duty to cancel after the collection—I have not received direct instruction to clip the tickets of the passengers before they get into the carriages—that has not been the practice at the Barking-road station—I am not aware whether it has been the practice at any other station—if there was a great number of passengers, I sometimes go round and clip their tickets before they get into the carriages, but that is optional on my part; sometimes I do and some<lb/>times I do not, but they are always marked, and I can get them after the train has started—I have not been blamed for not doing it—I have since received instructions to mark them as they arrive on the platform—I have not been told I was wrong in not doing it, nothing of the kind—I always do it now, or the porter—it is my duty to see that they are notched, or notch them myself—Battle, one of the porters, collected tickets besides the prisoner on this occasion, and I collected some—when the tickets have been</p>

It was my duty to be at the Barking-road station—on 19th Oct., the prisoner was acting station master there—it was his duty to issue tickets to persons going to Woolwich—it was not the duty of any one else to issue tickets, if he left—after the tickets have been issued to the passengers, they are col<lb/>lected, before the train leaves Barking, by myself and the prisoner—if I collected them, it was any duty to notch them—if any one else collected them, it was their duty to hand them to me to be cancelled—on 19th Oct., there was no one at the station but myself, two porters, and the prisoner—I was watching the prisoner at the 2.7 train—I was at the entrance to the platform—the prisoner was giving out the tickets, and taking the money—I took the tickets from the passengers' hands, noticed them, and handed them to the porters—two porters stood, one on each side of me—T have lost the original memorandum that I made; here is a copy (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>), and I can speak by memory as to the number of the tickets and what train they went by—I saw a ticket in the hands of a second class pas<lb/>senger—the number of it was 3175—I made a memorandum of it at the time—after handing it to the porter, it was given back to the passenger—I did not notch it at the time—I saw the prisoner collect that ticket from the passenger—I did not see what he did with it at the time—I saw it again in the hands of another passenger, coming from the ticket office, at the 3.7 train—the prisoner was then giving out tickets—I afterwards saw him collect that ticket again, but did not see what he did with it—there was another train at 47, but we had no passengers by</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">written</hi>). Your petitioner is a friendless orphan, depending entirely upon the labours of her own hands for subsistence, which she obtains by going out daily to iron, and has been able to keep herself respectable by so doing up to within the last two or three months. My case is simply this: I went to lodge with Mrs. Walters about a fort<lb/>night before last Christmas, and I remained with her until the last week in July, when I left her, in consequence of which she has been very spiteful to me ever since, and tried every means in her power to do me some injury, and has so far effected her purpose by getting me discharged from my work; and not content with that she has now preferred the present charge against me, of which, heaven is my witness, I am entirely innocent. The sub<lb/>stance of the charge is this: At the beginning of Feb. last I entered what is termed a raffle, for a watch, which I was fortunate enough to win; it was out of repair at the time I became possessed of it; I took it, and got it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185411270125"/>
               <p>repaired, and I thought no more of it, until a week or two after I left Mrs. Walters, when I was taken ill, and having no means of defraying the necessary expenses of my illness, I thought I would dispose of the said watch in the same way as I became possessed of it, namely, by having it raffled for; upon hearing which, Mrs. Walters obtained a description of the watch, first, by sending, and afterwards by going herself to Mrs. Bellam, who is a friend of mine, who, not knowing her motive, described it fully to her. From that description she has described it to the Magistrate, alleging at the same time that it is here, and one which I have a slight recollection of seeing about her house, that the children had to play with, but which, to the best of my recollection, was half as large again as mine. She has also described it as having gold works, and to the value of 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which that alone, upon comparison, will prove it is not hers. I have no one to speak a word for me, being an entire stranger; but I humbly pray of you, my Lord, to look upon me with an eye of pity; and I hope that God, who has promised never to leave me or forsake me, will give me strength to vindicate my own cause when I stand before you.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carrier of Wakeling, in Essex—I was on my road from there to London on Thursday, 26th Oct.—I came to a place called the Cauliflower public house, near Ilford—I saw a man cross the road near the Cauliflower bridge; it was then as near 2 o'clock in the morning as possible—the prisoner then got up on the step of my cart—I said, "Halloo, mate, what do you want?"—he said, "I will b—soon let you know what we want; for what we want we will have"—I felt for a stick which I had in the cart, but could not reach it—I struck him with my fist, and knocked him out of the cart, but he saved himself from felling—he rose again, and I collared him—at that instant two more men sprang up to my horse and stopped him—one stopped by the horse's head, and while I was trying to get the prisoner down, the other man got up into the cart to him—I kept <hi rend="italic">scrimmaging</hi> with them—the prisoner held me down by my coat, while the other man rifled my pockets—I had 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. then; they took that, and then allowed me to get up—the other man took it, and then the prisoner said, "You have not got his watch;" they then felt for my watch, but I had none—the prisoner said, "Give him one for luck before you leave him," and then the other man jumped down, and the prisoner let go of my head—I rose my head up, and he struck it with his fist—as he left the cart, he struck at me with a stick, but the blow did not touch me—I saw the prisoner cross the road the same way as I had seen the men come—I had never seen the prisoner before, but am certain he is the man—I saw him on the next day at Chadwell, about a mile off", when I was talking to a policeman, and gave him into custody.</p>

It will be more satisfactory if you will allow me to look through your boxes,"—she said, "Yes; but about that chain, I had only one chain, that was a long one, that was given to Carr, Captain Inglefield's servant, to clean"—I said, "What chain was it you wore last Sunday, in this house?"—Miss Jef<lb/>freys, one of the young ladies connected with the establishment, took up the words, and said, "That was a silver chain",—the prisoner replied, "Yes"—I went up stairs, accompanied by the prisoner, to her bed room—she was a little in advance, and picked up a towel, and threw it on a chair by the side of the bed—I then asked her for her boxes, and she pointed them out—I searched the two boxes: in one I found the Grecian lace, the pattern of which I had seen before at Captain Inglefield's—I said, "This is Captain, Inglefield's lace"—she said, "Mrs. Inglefield gave it to me"—I said, "Very; well," and took possession of it—I then pointed to the chair, and asked if there was anything else; at this time there was a gown placed over the towel—I then took up the gown; at the same time I remarked, "I think there is something under the towel"—I took up this watch and chain (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>), and said, "This is Mr. Inglefield's chain,—she said, "Oh no, it is not; that watch and chain were given to me by a young man with whom I kept company, and he is now dead"—I said, "I am positive this is Mr. Inglefield's"—I produced a drawing, and compared them in her presence—she still denied that it was Mr. Inglefield's chain—I then went down stairs with her into the parlour—I saw the same lady, Miss Jeffreys—she made some remark with reference to the chain—she said, "I think you have found everything"—I said to the prisoner, "You told me the chain up stairs was silver"—she said, "No, I did not say it was silver"—I went with her to the house of the prosecutor in Devonport; when close: to it she said, volun<lb/>tarily,</p>

On 25th Oct. the witness Barnett came to the station at Woolwich—I went with him along Brewer-street—he then went towards Wellington-street—I saw a military man standing at the corner of Wellington-street—Barnett pointed him out to me—the military man then disappeared round the corner of Wellington-street, going towards the barracks—when he turned the corner I lost sight of him—I pursued him for two hours, and found him in the barracks—I did not see his face—I took him into custody two hours afterwards—I told him he was charged with stealing a medal—he said he knew nothing about a medal—after a short time he said he knew of a medal that bombardier Oliver had—I said that was the one he was charged with stealing—he said he had no knowledge of it—I took him to the station—Barnett was asked whether he was the man in the presence of the prisoner—Barnett said he should know better if he had a great coat on—he said Mr. Wightman knew him personally before, and he could identify him as being the man—Wightman was fetched, and he identified him.</p>

I was at Woolwich—I know the prisoner Chalkley; he is a marine store dealer, and keeps a shop in Warwick-street, about 100 yards from the dockyard—I was not watch<lb/>ing his shop, no more than the regular duty—I saw the prisoner Aldous go into the shop about 6 o'clock in the evening—as soon as he entered I went to the corner of the windows—there was a gaslight in the shop—I saw a brown paper parcel in the scale—it was weighed by Chalkley, and put into a cupboard in the back part of the shop—it was a cupboard with no door to it—it was merely thrown in carelessly in the paper by Chalkley—I then saw Aldous take two metal tape from his pocket—he laid them on the counter—Chalkley came round from the other side of the counter; he picked them up, and looked at them with the gas, and he walked towards the place where he had put the paper parcel—the prisoners had been speak<lb/>ing to each other—I could not hear what passed—I went into the shop and asked Chalkley to let me look at the thing that this man had brought in for sale—he brought the two taps round and delivered them into my hand—I saw the mark of the broad arrow on both of them—I asked him to let the look at the other things that were brought there—he said there were no more—I told him there was; and he then went to the cupboard in which I had seen the brown paper parcel put, and he took from there a brown paper parcel and delivered it to me on the counter—it was like the one I had seen him put in—I told him the taps were marked with the broad arrow—the brown paper parcel had then been opened, it contained sheet copper—the copper was lying there—I said to Aldous, "Where did you get this from"—he said, "I found it"—I asked him where, and he made no answer—I told him I should have to take him to the station, and Chalkley must come like<lb/>wise, and I did so—I had known Aldous before that day—this is the copper and the taps.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside with Ebenezer Davis and Richard Davis; they are drapers at Woolwich. On Saturday evening, 18th Nov., the two prisoners came to the shop about a quarter before 7 o'clock—one of them asked for some black twilled handkerchiefs—I got down a paper parcel, and found we had not any—we had some plain ones—they were kept in the same parcel—they looked at the plain handkerchiefs—there were in the parcel three pieces containing about six handkerchiefs in each, and one single handkerchief—Dean opened the single handkerchief, and by that means covered the three other pieces which were lying on the counter—it hid the others from my view—there were four or five other customers in the shop beside the prisoners—I left the prisoners for about half a minute—I was about two yards from them—I returned to the prisoners—they were in the same position as they were before—nothing attracted my atten<lb/>tion, only that the single handkerchief had been opened—I think it had been opened just before I left the prisoners, but I cannot recollect—I folded it up, as they decided that it would not do—they then left—they did not purchase anything—I followed them, out immediately—they turned to the right, and I could not find them—I went to the station—I had missed one piece of handkerchiefs as soon as they had left—this is the piece I missed—I am quite sure of that.</p>

In consequence of information I went to the Miter tavern, High-street, Woolwich, on 18th Nov., about five minutes before 7 o'clock in the evening—I saw both the prisoners standing in front of the bar—I said, I must take them into custody for stealing silk handkerchiefs—Wyles said she had got nothing, and turned her pocket inside out—Dean said he had got nothing, but if I would go up stairs I might search him—I was in the act of taking Dean into custody, and he was forced away from me by some persons standing in the door—he made his escape out of the door by the assistance of some bystanders—he ran about 15 yards, when he was stopped by a bystander—I immediately pur<lb/>sued him, and took him to the station—I found a quantity of silk in his possession, which I produce—I asked him where he got it—he said he</p>

               <p>bought it of a broken down shopkeeper in Woolwich—I went in search of Wyles, and found her about half a mile from the public house, against the dock yard—she was in company with two marines—I took her into custody—she said, "How funny you are"—I took her about 100 yards, and she said, "What do you want with me, I have not done anything"—I told her she was charged with being concerned in stealing silk handkerchiefs with a man—she said she had not been with a man, and she denied all knowledge of the handkerchiefs.</p>

I sometimes received the money from him, and sometimes from the footman—on Saturday, 4th Nov., I saw the prisoner in the pantry—he gave me 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. first, and told me he was very busy, and I was to go and pay the men, and he would give me more presently, after he had laid the cloth—after that I saw him again, and asked him for the rest of the money—he counted out 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver on a tray—I saw no note or bag, nor did he say anything to me about them—he did not say that he had been to a Mr. Scriven's—he said that he had had a job to get change—when I had got the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I asked him what it was master said about him—he said he did not know—I said I had hardly money enough to pay the men—he said he would lend me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I was not to mention it to Mr. Green—he lent me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the Tuesday morning following the prisoner was dismissed, and I received a message from Mr. Green to go and make inquiries—I went to the prisoner's lodging, at the Greyhound, about 12 o'clock that night—I told him I wanted to see him—he said, "What fort?"—I said, "Concerning the change"—he asked me what <hi rend="italic">odds</hi> was it to me, I had my change all right, had I not 1—I asked him what he had 'done with the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he had at Mr. Taylor's—he said it was no <hi rend="italic">odds</hi> to me so long as I had my change all right—he said he would give me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. not to say any more, and then he said he would not—I asked him what he had done with the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—he said he had changed it at Mr. Scriven's, and laid it on Mr. Taylor's block or bench, and lost it—he was sober on the Saturday evening when he gave me the change.</p>

                  </hi>. I am potman at the White Hart in London-street, Greenwich. On Tuesday morning, 17th Oct. a little before 1 o'clock, the prisoner was in front of the bar talking to two or three friends—I don't think he was either sober or tipsy, he had been drinking a little—whilst he was there David Evans came in, he was neither drunk nor sober; he had been drinking; he had half a quarter of gin and some cold water—a general conversation took place between him and Hockley and friends round the bar—a fight was spoken of between two other men, and Evans and Hockley disagreed about it, and Evans said he would fight Hockley for half a crown; he put his hand in his pocket and pulled out some halfpence, and said, "I have not got half a crown, I will fight you for nothing"—Hock<lb/>ley</p>

               <p>said he would fight him wherever he liked to go; upon that the landlord interfered, and said he would have no fighting in his house, and they left the house—I went out with them—they went into the road—Evans was in the road first, and Hockley went out to him, and they commenced fighting—they had no seconds—Evans fell down, I can't say from what cause; they began to fight, and closed, and Evans fell—Hockley had not hold of him at the time he fell; they were struggling, closing together—he got up again, and they commenced fighting again; they closed again, and both fell down, Evans fell in the gutter, and Hockley alongside of him—Hockley got up, Evans remained in the gutter—I left him there, and came away.</p>

I am a coachman, living at No. 4, Brand-street, Green-wich—I was at the White Hart on this evening, and saw the fight—Evans walked off the footpath into the road, buttoned up his coat, and put himself in a fighting attitude—Hockley walked out afterwards into the road, and they commenced fighting—the first round, down they both went together, and very short it was—Hockley was fresh, and the other was very tipsy—Evans fell about a yard from the footpath, not near the gutter, on the opposite side—they both got up again, and had another scrambling round, which ended at the opposite side of the road; they then both went down together, Evans undermost—Hockley got up, and Evans laid in the gutter—I saw Hemmings and Stanley go to him and pick him up, I do not think he was able to get up himself—I observed blood on his nose and mouth—he did not speak—Stanley fetched some water, and he drank some—a man named Sullivan came by, and he said, "Oh, put him up, he will do, I know him; you go home, he will wake up and go home directly; I have been drinking with him to-night"—we left him there, not with Sullivan, we left him alone—by Sullivan's advice we set him up against the door, and left him—the prisoner was very handy there at the time we set him up against the door—we did not leave him there, he went away; we all went away together.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business as a miller, in part<lb/>nership with my father, Samuel Mumford, and my uncle, Peter Mumford, in the Greenwich-road—Bulpitt has been in our employ, as foreman, about six years of the time—our counting house is thirty yards away from the mill—Bulpitt's duty was to be in the mill—his duties were, to see to the general working of the mill, and to deliver goods to customers that came for goods—when a customer comes wanting goods, he comes into the counting house, which is away from the mill; if he wants bran, for instance,</p>

               <p>he asks for bran; the clerk in the counting house writes a ticket, which is taken out of this book, for the goods which the customer asks for—the ticket is, "Deliver to Mr.—, four bushels of bran," and a counterpart is written here—one part is torn out and given to the customer—he takes it up to the mill, delivers it to one of the men appointed to deliver goods, and it is the duty of that man to take this ticket and enter it in thin book, which they keep at the counting house in the mill; they put the folio of this book in the ticket, and then deliver the goods according to the ticket which the customer has—Hawke has been a customer of our firm—this green book is kept at the counting house in the mill, in the custody of those men that are in the mill, whose duty it is to attend to the customers—there are three, Bulpitt is one of them—Hawke has been in the habit of coming there for years, I cannot say exactly how long—on 19th Oct. Hawke came to the counting house about 20 minutes before 1—I heard him ask Roper, the clerk, for four bushels of bran—the clerk wrote the ticket for four bushels of bran, and said, "2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." and Hawke paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the clerk gave him the ticket—Hawke then went into the mill—after he was gone, for some reason I had walked down the yard, and stood at the door of the engine house—after Hawke had had his goods delivered to him, he drew close to me, and through a hole in the sack, about a foot from the bottom, I saw that he had not got bran in it—the yard being Mocked by other teams, his cart was stopped, and as I walked by I put my hand into the hole in the sack, and took out these middlings—I did not stop Hawke on that occasion; I took no notice—there was only one sack in his cart—Bulpitt was in the mill on that Thursday, between half past 12 and 1—there was no other delivery man there besides Bulpitt at that time—I put my thumb and finger into the hole in the sack—it was not necessary to put my hand in to see that it was middlings—I could see through the hole, and I took out a pinch—Bulpitt was the only delivery man in the mill between half past 12 and 1; that was the time Hawke came on both occasions—according to the regulations of the mill, Bulpitt would be the only man there—the other men had all gone to their dinner—I speak from the general conduct of the business—I saw Bulpitt in the mill—on Saturday, 21st Oct., Hawke came again, about 20 minutes to 1—he came to the counting house, and asked Roper, the clerk, for four bushels of bran—Roper wrote the ticket for four bushels of bran, and said, "4 bushels of bran, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," and he took the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it is the duty of the man, after he has booked the ticket in the green book, which is kept in the counting house in the mill, to deliver it to the customer again—I have since seen those tickets—we found Thursday's ticket upon Hawke when we searched him at the station—Saturday's ticket was left in the mill in the green book, and we found it there—after Hawke received his ticket he took it down to the mill, and I saw Bulpitt deliver a sack to Hawke—he dropped it down on a stage about the height of the cart, and Hawke took it off and put it into his cart—he then drew away, and went away some distance—I stopped him in Deptford Broadway, which is about as far from our mill as from here to Ludgate-hill—I said, "Hawke, what have you got there?"—he said, "I don't know, Sir; something heavy"—I said, "Well, then, you had better come along with me to the station house"—I took him to the station, and he there said he did not know what he had got—on examining we found he had got middlings—I have a sample of it here (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—this is not what I took out of the sack, but it is exactly the same—I then gave him into custody—he went with me to the station without any officer—there was a</p>

I am an iron moulder, and lodge at the George—I was present on the night of 13th Oct.—I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor fighting together—directly after they got parted, I saw a knife in the prisoner's hand; it was open—I laid hold of his hand and said to him, "Thomas, shut up that knife," and he dried it on his trowsers like this (<hi rend="italic">drawing his hand across his thigh</hi>), closed it, and put it in his pocket—I observed that there was blood on it—I went in the parlour and saw the prosecutor; he was stabbed—I saw the knife given to Lloyd by a young man—I do not know where he got it from.</p>

I purchased a watch at Mr. Carter's shop, in Tooley-street; the prisoner sold it to me; I paid him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—I went to the shop again about three or four days afterwards, because the watch stopped—when I got there, the prisoner said the hands had stuck—I afterwards went again with the watch, because the glass kept constantly coming out—that was three or four days after the hands had stuck—I brought it back to my house.</p>

                  </hi> The prisoner was in my service—it was his duty to manage the shop in Tooley-street—it was his duty to keep books of the transactions in that shop—if a customer bought a watch he should enter it—this is the book which he kept—here is no entry in it, from 16th Aug. till 29th Sept., of any watch sold to Horspool, or to any one else, for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have carefully looked through the book—he has never accounted to me for that 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—having received a communication, I went to the prisoner on 14th Oct., and charged him with robbery and embezzlement—I had heard he was in difficulties—I upbraided him with his conduct, and told him I should feel it my duty to give him into custody—he begged me not to do so—I reminded him that this was not the first time he had been in difficulties—he left the room, went up stairs, locked himself in his bed room, and cut his throat.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 31, St. George's New-town, Southwark. On Monday, 30th Oct. I was in company with Elizabeth Hazle at a public house—I don't know the sign of it—the prisoner and Nelson came in, and we afterwards went together to another public house—there was some quarrelling there—we took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> from there—there were five of us got in; the prisoner, Nelson, my companion Elizabeth Hazle, a man I knew as an Irishman, and myself—we drove into Mint-street, where Hazle lived—we had some drink there, and they quarreled again—the Irishman and Nelson were quarrelling first—Nelson then called Brown a son of a b—, and told him that he was no mate not to take his part—I believe they were ship<lb/>mates—Nelson then caught hold of the prisoner by the collar or handker<lb/>chief, until he was nearly black in the face—upon that I ran for the police—I left the Irishman and the two men in the room—when I came back I heard an Irish girl who lived in the next room, Mary Ready, halloo out that he was stabbed—I went into the room and saw Nelson lying dead on the ground; he was bleeding—there was only Brown, Nelson, and the Irishman in the room—the deceased was lying on his side and a dagger was sticking in his neck; I pulled it out and put it in my pocket, and afterwards gave it to the policeman—when I left the room I left Brown on the bed nearly strangled by the deceased—I can't say that the Irishman was drunk, but Nelson and Brown were very much in liquor.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are an unfortunate female, I believe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the two mates were very drunk at the public house—they had very little at our place—I think the deceased was more in fault—he first began the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with the Irishman at the public house—he afterwards called the prisoner a son of a b—, because he did not join in the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with the Irishman—he called him that twice—the prisoner offered no violence to the deceased at the public house—I do not know whether they had just come from the same vessel—after they got to Hazle's place, the Irishman and the deceased still kept quarrelling and calling one another bad names—the prisoner and deceased were very much in liquor indeed—the deceased at last seized Brown, and threw him down, and hit him several times with a cane—Brown had not done anything to him then—he had caught hold of Nelson in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and told him to be quiet, and not quarrel—we had only been to two public houses—we were in company about half an hour—after they got to our place Nelson kept sparring at Brown, and calling him names—before I went for the police Brown was black in the face—I told Nelson if he did not let the man go I would go for a constable, and he said he did not care one God d—n—he had got Brown on the bed, and was upon him, holding him by the handkerchief—I left him on the bed when I went for the police—as far as I saw, the violence was on the part of Nelson towards Brown, and not of Brown towards Nelson.</p>

                  </hi>. I went into Hazle's room on 30th Oct., between 3 and 4 o'clock—I saw the man, Nelson, on the floor, and the prisoner holding him by the hair of his head with his left hand, and a dagger in his right hand—I tapped him on the shoulder, and said, "Bridle your temper, and don't spill blood on a shipmate"—he did not say anything—Nelson was then lying on his back, with his head against the door—I saw blood upon him—I tapped him on the shoulder, and said, "Mate, you are stabbed," and found that my hand was covered with blood—I saw a wound in his neck—I did not see any weapon in the neck—the prisoner had it in his hand—I saw no blow struck—fie was bleeding from the neck—I went down stairs, and met sergeant Davis at the door of the house—I saw no weapon used.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I live at No. 3, Harrow-street, Southwark, in the same house as Hazle. On 30th Oct., I saw the prisoner and two other men there—I did not notice them when they came in, but I saw afterwards that they were drunk—I saw them standing up against the mantel-piece, and I thought they were fighting—I heard the deceased say to the prisoner, "You son of a b—;" (that was after Hazle was gone)—he said he was no son of a b—; he said, "I will fight you; I will fight the best of the two, but don't let the two of you come on me together"—I saw the deceased come up and hit him with his right hand in the left breast, and knocked him on the ground—the deceased afterwards stooped down to hit him in the face, and the prisoner caught hold of him with his right hand and said, "Don't hit me while I am down," he then pulled a dagger out of his left hand pocket, and stabbed him in the neck—I only saw him do it once—I then ran into my own room, rose up the window, and screamed out "Murder!" and "Police!"</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the deceased using the prisoner with great violence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and calling him very bad names—he hit him three times before he chucked him up against the bed.</p>

I was called to the house, and saw the deceased and prisoner there—they were both very drunk—the deceased was bleeding—I asked him what was the matter—he said to Brown, "You should not have stabbed me"—Brown said, "You struck me first"—he said, "I know I struck you first, but you should not have used the knife," or, "dagger"—Wilson gave me this dagger in the prisoner's presence, and said, "This is what he <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it with, policeman"—the deceased gave the name of Charles Nelson—when I first went into the room, I found the prisoner and deceased there, and another man was coming down the stairs.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am senior surgeon of St. Thomas's Hospital. The deceased was brought there, between 4 and 5 o'clock, on 30th Oct.—he was then very drunk—I examined him, and found a wound on the left side of the nape of the neck, about one inch long; a wound on the back of the blade bone, on the left side of the spine, which was the important wound; a deep wound in the left loin; a superficial skin wound on the outside of the left knee, and two other superficial wounds—he died from wound of the lung—the wound between the spine and blade bone penetrated the lung—I found that afterwards, on a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I have no doubt that was the cause of death—it is very probable that that wound might have been inflicted by a person lying below him, by striking round him over the shoulder—this dagger might produce such a wound.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The other wounds were not necessarily mortal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the penetration of the lung, produced collapse of the lung, and caused—death.</p>
