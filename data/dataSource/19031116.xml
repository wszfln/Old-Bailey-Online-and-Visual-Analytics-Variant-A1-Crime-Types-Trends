                  </hi>. I am the wife of Frederick Wolff, a baker of 1, Cross Street, Islington—about 2.30 p.m. on October 23rd the prisoner came and asked for change for a half sovereign—I sounded it on the counter and gave him in change two half crowns and five separate shillings—he took up the change and went away—it is a wooden counter and was wet, as I had been scrubbing it—I doubted the coin as it was light—I took it to the post office, where it was weighed and found light—I paid it to the barman at the Britannia, who tested it and fetched the manager—a constable on point duty was sent for—I attended Clerkenwell Police Court on Saturday and was discharged by the Magistrate—I identified the prisoner at Clerkenwell Police Court on October 26th.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon at the Homeopathic Hospital on October 27th—the prosecutor was brought in between 1 and 2 a.m.—I was called at 1.55—I found him bleeding from several wounds on the left side of his face and neck—the deepest and longest was behind the angle of the jaw on the left side—he was also bleeding from three punctured wounds under his left eyebrow, and five superficial scratches over his left eyebrow and down the cheek—there were ten wounds alto<lb/>gether—that behind the angle of the jaw was about three-sixteenths of an inch deep—it was in a dangerous position—if it had been a very little deeper it would have entered the external jugular vein—it might have been fatal—the scar is there now—he was bleeding profusely—the wounds</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business as J. Husbands and Company, wholesale umbrella and blouse manufacturers, at 7, Little Britain—Joseph Wheeler was employed by us for some years—his duties took him into the basement—on September 8th I found in the warehouse some sticks from which the handles had been broken, in consequence of which I instructed two servants to keep watch in the basement; one of them, Cox, has had an accident; the other, Mordan, is here—my servant, Wheeler, was given into custody that night—on September 10th, at the police station, he made a statement to me in the presence of the police, in consequence of which I went to 12, Bethnal Green Road, which is a railway arch, used by Rickards as a shop and store—there is nothing displayed, just a name painted in front—I saw Rickards' son—on Sep<lb/>tember 11th I went again in the morning with Detective Hallam and again in the afternoon, when I saw the prisoner—Hallam was there before me—I told the prisoner that I wanted to look at the goods of his stock of umbrella handles—he showed me some—I said those did not interest me, I did not see what I was looking for, and that I wanted to see anything that he had bought recently—he said he had not bought anything just lately—I said he had, and that I should like to see the stuff he had bought up to yesterday—he said he was quite sure he had not bought anything up to that time, that he had plenty of stuff, and had not wanted anything, I think he said for several weeks—I told him I knew he had bought from the man Wheeler—he said he did not know him and had not soon him—I then asked to see more of his goods, or I should have him arrested, because I knew he had bought stuff that was stolen from me—his son produced some boxes of umbrella handles, in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190311160013"/>
               <p>which I found thirty of my stock that I got from Hall and Portbury, who made the silver for the handles—I bought the whole of their stock—I had not sold them—I only sell the completed umbrella or sunshade—I had missed the stock by the figures in the book, and I have missed about 700 more since this case—I take stock in June each year—seven of these have been specially made for me, I have no doubt they are my handles—I told the prisoner I could swear to them as having been stolen from my stock by Wheeler, and unless he could account for them I should give him into custody there and then—he said he had not got them from Wheeler—I asked him where he got them—he said he could not tell—I said, "Show me the receipt where you bought these, if you bought these goods and paid for them"—he said, "I do not get a receipt, if you refer to the bulk I bought them from J. and R. Morley"—they are a wholesale house—I have not sold any handles to J. and R. Morley—these are 1s. each wholesale—he produced Morley's receipt for sample handles which he paid for at the time he bought them—referring to some I said, "These never came from Morley's, these have been stolen from my stock, and unless you tell me from whom you bought them I shall give you into custody; have you any books?"—he said he did not keep any—I gave him into custody—he was taken to Snow Hill Police Station—some of these handles have been broken off the sticks and some have been sawn off—I have never sold them to the trade in this state—whilst waiting for the charge to be taken at the station in the presence of Detective Loakes, the prisoner said, "Do not be too hard on me, Mr. Husbands, I <hi rend="italic">ain't</hi> had all your stuff, there's half a dozen others in it"—then I said, "Who are they, give me their names?"—he said, "Why should I tell you; it won't do me any good"—he was charged immediately after that—I was subsequently present at Guildhall when my servant Wheeler pleaded guilty to selling my handles, and was sentenced to two months' imprisonment.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When Wheeler pleaded guilty these goods were produced—I believe they were shown to him—I do a nice business—I handle nearly every article—we try to avoid similar patterns of handles—I usually engage the pattern when it is shown to us by the trade—we make umbrellas—these patterns were bought absolutely for ourselves—we cleared the whole lot—we buy the sticks and handles—I do not sell to Hall and Portbury—they have dissolved partnership—they sold us 200 dozens—I accept the statement of the seller that the samples are put in with the goods—I examine all the goods—I leave the warehouseman to count them—probably three in a parcel may be thrown out to be returned for the pattern to be altered or some other reason—the partners are at the warehouse fifteen hours a day—not the employees—I know and A. Grant, of Aldermanbury Avenue; De Saxe and Company, of Odell Street; and Barnett Phillips, of London Wall, who deal in goods of much the same class—I imagine they deal of Hall and Portbury, but I do not know that they were supplied with exactly the same class of goods—the goods are made in London—those firms supply wholesale firms like J. and R. Morley, Copestake's, and so on—some of these silver goods are</p>

               <p>Hall and Portbury's—they are sterling silver and have the hall mark—the goods I identify as mine are absolutely different in pattern to those of any other firm—at the shop the prisoner cried and said, "Do not lock me up, do not ruin me"—at the station he said, "Do not be hard on me, Mr. Husbands, I have a wife and four children, I have not had all the stuff, there are others that have had it," not "I have not had the stuff," nor "There are half a dozen others in it"—I was engaged some hours in this investigation—I made a note on a paper I have in my pocket (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I made it in my office as soon as I returned from the police station—it might have been three quarters or half an hour afterwards.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective, City.</hi>) On the morning of September 10th Joseph Wheeler was detained at the Snow Hill Police Station—at his request I sent for his employer. Mr. Husbands, to whom he made a state<lb/>ment in my presence, in consequence of which I went to Rickards' shop in Bethnal Green Road—I saw his son—on leaving the shop I watched the premises from 50 to 100 yards off—I saw Rickards' men at the door and watched from another position—on September 11th I went to the shop in the afternoon—I said to Rickards, "I am a police officer; I should like to ask you a few questions; there is a man named Joseph Wheeler in the employ of Joseph Husbands, of 7, Little Britain, who has been charged with stealing a quantity of umbrella handles, and he says he has been stealing them, and that he brought the whole of the property to you, that you paid him 2d. each for them, that you knew that the whole of the property was stolen, and that last Wednesday he brought some to you, and you received them"—he said, "I do not know a man named" Joseph Wheeler; the only Wheeler I know is a man who works at the stores; he never brought me anything last Wednesday"—I said, "I should like to look through your premises"—he said, "Very well"—I went over the premises with him—I waited till Mr. Husbands arrived, and together we wont behind the counter—Rickards produced three boxes containing umbrella handles—Mr. Husbands selected thirty from the three boxes and said to him, "From where did you receive these umbrella handles?"—he said, "From J. and R. Morley's"—Husbands said, "I know that these umbrella handles came from my promises, and that they are stolen"—Rickards said, "No. they do not; if they do not come from J. and R. Morley's I do not know where they come from"—Husbands asked for a receipt, and ho produced this one for seventy-two dozen job sticks and 120 whole feathers and other job items, to the value of £40 1s., and dated July 9th, 1903, from J. and R. Morley—I did not hear the further conversa<lb/>tion;</p>

               <p>I was searching the premises—at that time a detective brought into the shop this brown bag—I said to Richards, "Yesterday afternoon, when I left your premises I saw one of your work girls with your son come out of your door with this brown bag"—I showed him the contents, a quantity of umbrella handles and covers belonging to Messrs. Howell's, and asked him to account for them—he said, "I refuse to give any information"—I told him he would be charged with receiving the thirty umbrella handles—he said, "They are not stolen"—I conveyed him to Snow Hill Police Station—he made no further reply to the charge.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective.</hi>) I was present at the police station on September 11th, when the prisoner was charged with stealing thirty umbrella handles—previous to being charged he said to Mr. Husbands, "Don't be hard on me, Mr. Husbands; I have a wife and four children; I <hi rend="italic">ain't</hi> had all the stuff; there's half a dozen others in it besides me"—Husbands said, "Who are they?"—he replied, "Why should I tell you? it won't do me any good"—I made a note of that statement about a quarter of an hour afterwards; as soon as the prisoner was charged and put back in the cells I put it down in my book—on September 11th I kept observation on 12, Bethnal Green Road—I saw Sergeant Hallam and Mr. Husbands go there—after they had left the shop and were going towards High Street, Shoreditch, I saw a man come out of the prisoner's premises—he crossed the road and looked down the street in the direction Husbands and Hallam had gone, then crossed to where I was, and appeared to be watching them—they stopped at the bottom of the Bethnal Green Road—they were in sight then—they moved round the corner out of sight, when the man re-crossed the road and went into No. 12—shortly afterwards the girl, Flora Hills, came out, carrying a brown bag—she got on a <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> with it, putting it on the stage, as it seemed heavy—I saw her subsequently—in consequence of information she gave me I went to 163, Wilmot Street, Bethnal Green, where Miss Whalen gave me the bag—it contained a quantity of umbrella handles, and parts, and some sunshade covers—some of the articles have since been identified as having been stolen from Henry Howell and Co., of Old Street, and from Mr. Reddrop.</p>

               <p>in May, 1902, I acted for my uncle, Mr. William Henderson, in letting Holmesdale Stables to Mr. "A. J.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner gave me a certificate of soundness with the cobs—when I sent my cashier to him for the repayment of my money I think he saw the prisoner—I first of all wrote demanding payment, and as I did not receive an answer I sent my cashier—I know that Powles has said that the vehicles and horses which were discovered afterwards were his but I do not believe it—I know he has stated that he financed the prisoner.</p>

               <p>February 13th, 1894, and Macphail as secretary on March 29th, 1895—he remained secretary until his arrest—on July 5th, 1901, application was made to me by the secretary on behalf of Lynch for a loan of £300; this is the letter—(<hi rend="italic">This stated that Lynch desired a loan of</hi> £300, <hi rend="italic">and saying that he would lodge as security for the loan certain shares in the Simmer and Jack West Company.</hi>)—the application was granted, and a charge was given to the company on 200 Simmer and Jack West shares—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is the charge, signed, I believe, by Lynch—on October 9th there was a further application to increase the loan to £450 for three months—that was agreed to on October 10th, and a cheque drawn for £150 in favour of Lynch—it is endorsed by him—the cheque for £300 was drawn on July 9th, 1901, by Lynch as a director, and is endorsed by him—I believe the loans were confirmed at a board meeting on November 1st, 1901—Lynch and Macphail were both present then—on February 23rd, 1902, a further application was made by Macphail on behalf of Lynch for a further sum of £250, and a cheque was drawn on February 26th, 1902, for that amount—it is signed in the same way as the others and endorsed by Lynch—that loan was confirmed at the board meeting on March 26th, 1902, Lynch and Macphail being present—when the loan was increased to £450 on October 9th, 1901, the company received this charge and also this one when it was increased to £700—on June 10th, 1902, an applica<lb/>tion was made by the secretary on behalf of Lynch to extend the loan by £200, lodging as security some shares in the Imani Company, making the total security £1,200—on June 11th I received this letter from Mac<lb/>phail—(<hi rend="italic">Stating that Lynch wished to increase the loan by</hi> £300 <hi rend="italic">instead of</hi> £200, <hi rend="italic">and proposing to lodge</hi> 200 <hi rend="italic">Matabele Sheba shares, which would give</hi> 30 <hi rend="italic">per cent. cover</hi>)—the application to increase the loan to £1,000 was agreed to, and I believe on June 12th, 1902, a cheque was drawn for the further advance of £300—it is in favour of Macphail, drawn by Lynch and en<lb/>dorsed by Macphail—there was a power for one director and the secretary to draw cheques—by the minute book, Lynch and Macphail were present at the meeting on September 11th, 1902—the financial statement book was then produced; it was the practice of the company to have that book produced at every meeting of the company; it contains an account of the financial position of the company—amongst other things it would contain the amount of the loan to Lynch and the securities—each state<lb/>ment is numbered, and No. 80 says, "J. B. Lynch, £1,000." and then "Security, 200 Simmer and Jack West, 200 Imani, and 200 Matabele Sheba"—at each board meeting down to October 16th. 1903, a financial statement was produced, made up in the financial statement book—in the statements down to October 16th, 1903. those shares appear as the security for Lynch's loan—300 Antenior shares appear as a further security, but I only know of them from the book—the minute book shows that Lynch and Macphail were present from time to time at the board meetings down to August, 1903, and Lynch was present when the statement was produced in October; Macphail was away on his holiday—there was a steady fall in the South African market, and the directors became concerned for the value of their security, and on October 16th</p>

               <p>it was decided to call in the loan—Lynch had been seen earlier with regard to it—on August 28th it had been reported to the Board that he was making arrangements to repay it; he was present then—the meeting of October 16th was adjourned till October 19th—on October 17th I sent for the security box, and it was opened in the presence of myself, Mr. Chisholme, and Mr. A. J. Macphail, who were two of my co-directors; neither of the prisoners were present—there was no certificate for Simmer and Jack West shares; this blank transfer was there (<hi rend="italic">Produced.</hi>)—we found no Imani shares or any document relating to them—we found no Matabele Sheba shares—we found in the box the various charges, and also this document, giving a charge dated October 1st, 1901; penciled over the 1901 is 1902 (<hi rend="italic">This gave a list of the securities, and was signed "J. B. Lynch."</hi>)—at the board meeting of October 19th Lynch was present; Macphail was not present—Lynch was informed that the box had been opened, and that the securities had gone—he was asked if he could give any information with regard to them—he said he could not, as he did not know—the meeting was adjourned until the next day, when Mr. A. J. Macphail produced this document—I have an idea that it is in Myles Macphail's writing, but I cannot swear to it—Lynch was present then—the document shows what had become of the shares—"Disposal, 130 Simmer and Jack West shares, transferred to A. D. Ford, proceeds handed to Mr. Lynch; 70 converted into four Matabele Railway debentures and subsequently handed to Mr. A. D. Ford for a consideration, which was handed to Mr. J. B. Lynch; 200 Main shares carried by T. J. I've and subsequently taken at T. J. I've, we will say the proceeds.; 200 Matabele Sheba shares transferred to A. D. Ford: D. Ford did the above business in good faith, and he will produce his cheques; understand all the above money went to pay differences."—that was read out by the solicitor of the company—Lynch was present; he threw all the blame on the secretary for parting with the securities—he said that he himself had not done it, that he was innocent, and did not know anything about it—he was then confronted with the transfer certi<lb/>ficate of the Matabele Sheba shares, which was in the office for registration—the office of the Matabele Sheba Company is also at 10, St. Helen's Place—the transfer was executed by Lynch—he said that they had been lodged four or five days before for transfer, that he must have received the advice note that the shares were to be transferred from his name into that of another—it is for the company to advise the transferor that the transfer has been lodged—he produced a press copy of the advice note—we told him that he must have been aware of this, and that it had only happened four or five days before, and that he must have been aware where they were, and he admitted that he was aware of it—he went on to explain that he did not wish to admit anything until he had seen the secretary, that that was his excuse for not admitting any<lb/>thing on the day before, and that he supposed he himself was responsible and would have to suffer—there was a very long conversation; he got very agitated—this blank transfer for the Simmer and Jack West shares, Nos. 236502 to 236701, inclusive, has no date on it—I do not know whose</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known Lynch since 1895 or 1896; I have been a fellow director of his since that time up to his arrest—with the exception of this unfortunate matter, I have always found him to be straightforward and honourable—I placed great reliance in him—I did not know that he was a partner in Lynch, Beach and Company—I knew that he has been connected with Lloyd's for over forty years—the secretary would have the key of the security box—I am not aware that the directors have keys—so far as I know, the secretary was the only person who had a key, and unless he opened it, the directors, in the ordinary way, could not do so—the shares had never been transferred to the company—the transfer had never been through the company's books—whoever had removed the securities had left the charges which recorded their having been deposited; all the charges produced to-day came from the box—from those docu<lb/>ments the company could, by means of them, trace exactly what shares were missing from the box—the means of identification had been left behind—when Lynch was first spoken to about the loss of the securities he was not more upset than the rest of the directors; we were all upset—he said that he himself was responsible, and would have to suffer, but that he was innocent—he never admitted that he had been a party to taking the securities away—when the matter was first broached to him he said that, owing to the absence of the secretary, he could not explain matters—he said he knew nothing whatever of the Antenior shares—I do not know, of my own knowledge, of any substitution of the securities—I do not know how it is that in the charge there are only 100 Simmer and Jack shares instead of 200.</p>

B. Lynch—he was registered as the owner of them, Nos. 236502 to 236701—he held no other shares in the company—a certificate was issued for those 200 shares—on October 20th, 1902, that certificate was brought in to be split into three blocks—three certificates were issued instead of one: one was for 100 shares, Nos. 236502 to 236601; one for 70 shares. Nos. 236602 to 236671. and the balance of thirty was represented by a certificate, the numbers being 236672 to 236701—on November 13th, 1902, a transfer was lodged in respect to the block of seventy shares—that is a transfer from J. B. Lynch to somebody named Lazarus, it is executed by Lynch—the witness to Lynch's signature is Myles Macphail the consideration being £97 10s.—on June 8th, 1903, a transfer, dated May Kith, for 100 shares, Nos. 236502 to 236601, passed a board meeting for registration—it is the same block of shares for which we issued a certificate for 100; they are transferred from Lynch to A.

B. Lynch—he had lodged them for registration on December 2nd, 1902—he had no other shares in the company—on December 18th, 1902, before they were registered in Lynch's name, we received a transfer executed by him in favour of Frank Helder for the whole of them—Lynch was advised that that transfer had been lodged—the shares were registered both in Helder's and Lynch's names on January 6th, 1903.</p>

Macphail's account for Myles Macphail; the rules of the Stock Exchange do not permit me to have a speculative account for an employe; I had these things opened for Myles Macphail with the permission of his brother. A. J. Macphail—I contangoed the 200 Imani shares at one in the market; you can begin an account with a contango—I can borrow on the shares at the market price—we simply deliver the stock, take the money for it, and hand the money over, which is similar to a transaction of having purchased 100 shares in the next account—the 200 Imanis were placed in my possession, and I obtained money on them—cheque for £180 was paid to A. D. Ford on December 11th and there was a balance of £20 left in the account—the shares were carried over from account to account until June 26th, when they were taken up at by A. D. Ford, who paid £176 for them, which left Myles Macphail £16 8s. 11d. in my debt at the end of the account—I took proceedings against him for that amount—when the Imani shares were taken up I had a transfer for them: they were originally delivered to Frank Helder—they might or might not come back from him—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is the transfer from Lynch for 200 Imani shares in A. J. Macphail's account, which I delivered to Holder; Myles Macphail brought the transfer from Lynch, whose address is given at Lloyd's—that was executed by Lynch.</p>

I am a partner in Burton, Cook and Company, chartered accountants, of 7, Lawrence Pountney Hill—we are the auditors of the St. Helens Buluwayo Association, Limited—the last audit took place in the early part of December, 1902, and on December 16th I went with the secretary, Myles Macphail, to the company's bankers, the Union Bank of Scotland; the security box was produced, which the secretary unlocked, and I examined the securities for Lynch's loan—there was a certificate and blank transfer representing 200 fully paid shares in the Matabele Sheba Gold Mining Company, a transfer receipt and blank transfer in respect of 100 Simmer and Jack West shares, and bearer bonds for 400 Mashonaland Railway debentures, and 300 Antenior Matabele Mining Company debentures—there was an agreement which provided for a certain margin, and the margin did not appear to be sufficient—I called the secretary's attention to that, and I received this letter from him—(<hi rend="italic">Stating that he had obtained a further</hi> £100 <hi rend="italic">cover from Lynch</hi>)—the fact that these different shares were the security for the loan would not be stated in the balance sheet—the amount of the loan would be stated there.</p>

So there was no transfer—I keep no books: all my business is done with a stockbroker—it all goes through his books—there were 200 debentures, and they were a little above par.</p>

On October 22nd I received a warrant from Guildhall, and on the 23rd I saw Lynch at his solicitor's office, where he surrendered to me—I told him I was a detective officer, and cautioned him—on the advice of his solicitor he said nothing—on the way to the station he said, "Is Macphail locked up? Macphail is a scoundrel; he has let me in for this"—the same evening, about 6 p.m., Macphail surrendered at the police office at Old Jewry.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in his defence on oath, said that Macphail had said nothing to him about taking the securities in order to raise loans on them; that he did not that any of the transfers he signed were connected with his security for the loans, as the transfers were generally in blank; that about a month before Macphail went for his holiday he told him (Lynch) that all the securities had gone, and were all in Ford's hands, but that he did not know of it till then; that he had had suspicions that Macphail was not acting squarely, but he had no idea that it was in reference to the St. Helens security; that he did not know there was a security box, and had never had access to it; that when Mr. Dixon asked him to repay the loan he said that he was not responsible for it, and that it was not his business, and that he was perfectly innocent. He admitted that when Macphail was going away he said he was not coming back; that he could not explain writing to Macphail and telling him that he might use thirty of his Simmer and Jack West shares; that he had signed agreements in blank, so that anybody could put what they liked into them; that the money received for the shares he may have handed to Macphail, but he did not know on what security the money was paid by Ford; that some of the security was accommodation bills, some of which he had repaid; and that the whole of his business was done in a most careless way.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Lynch received a good character.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Canonbury, and was employed as clerk by A. Weibking and Company, Limited, until September 14th, when the company went into liquidation—I constantly saw the prisoner—he handed me a bill of exchange for £20 about August 8th or 9th, and asked me if I could discount it, but I could not, nor could I get it done, so I handed it back to him about August 9th or 10th—he asked me to write him a letter, which I did, saying that I had not then been able to get the bill discounted, but should be able to in a few days' time—the letter was untrue.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I tried to get the bill discounted, but could not, so handed it to the prisoner—he did say he thought there would be money coming in at the end of the week for the company, which would enable him to draw a cheque on the company's account to meet the bill—the amount has been treated by the company's liquidator as a preferential claim, and I think there is enough of the company's property to meet it.</p>

I am a registered medical practitioner, of 43, Claremont Square, Clerkenwell—during 1901 and 1902, on various dates, I attended Mrs. James for illness, and on June 1st, 1901, I attended her for injuries—I found her to be suffering from severe nervous prostra<lb/>tion—she was very severely bruised down the right side of her body, commencing at her head—she had a large swelling on her leg—I judged from the appearance of her hair that it had been pulled—it was all anyhow—that was the only occasion on which I found her to be suffering from bruises or injury—I asked the prisoner his reason for behaving in the manner he was doing to his wife, and he said, "She is always nagging at me."</p>

                  </hi>. I am an hydraulic fitter, of 162, Barnsbury Road, and am Mrs. James' son in law, as I married a Miss Purkiss—I have known the prisoner for about four years, since he married my mother in law—I remember going to Myddelton Square about August 28th—my wife had made a statement to me, and in consequence I went there—about an hour afterwards the prisoner came in—I said, "Hulloa!"—he laughed and asked me what I wanted—I said I had come to make a visit—he said, "Clear out"—that was in the passage up stairs—he went down to the breakfast parlour in the basement, and I followed him—he was talking to Miss Florrie, his step daughter—I <hi rend="italic">see</hi> a very strange look in his face—I thought he was going to catch hold of her, and I struck him, as I thought there would be trouble—I was asked to look after the daughters, and so I struck him—he struck me back, and we fought for about a couple of minutes, and both fell through a glass door—two policemen came, and the prisoner and I went to the station with them—I cannot remember whether I spoke to the prisoner on that day about what my wife had told me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was just across the road from the prisoner when I first noticed him—he looked in the direction of the boys' club and fired something—he looked as if he expected somebody was coming after him—when I walked up past him he put his arm up like that and fired—I was then a few dozen yards from him—I and my <hi rend="italic">pal</hi> were the only persons near to him—he did not apparently fire at anybody, and the moment he had fired he put the revolver into his pocket and walked away—he seemed strange in the way he behaved—it attracted my attention—I do not know if he had seen us before he fired—he was looking in our direction—it was not until we walked in his direction that he did anything—I saw him take the pistol from his right hand pocket.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was living with my mother at 19, Myddelton Square when she married the prisoner in 1899, and I lived with her right down to this affair—the prisoner was always very kind to me, except when he tried to take the ornaments from the mantlepiece; he wanted to move them to the conservatory—I do not know if he had brought them to the house when he married my mother—at the time he moved them I do not think he said anything—my mother tried to prevent his moving them—I should not care to say how I was knocked down; I only remember that I was knocked down—the prisoner was pulling one way, and my mother the other, and I went to help her—the prisoner left the house finally on the last day in August—I was at the house when he went away—he did not say good-bye or anything; he went out just as if he was going to business in the ordinary way—he had been at home all the previous day, a Sunday—we were all on good terms during that day, and also when he left—we had all had breakfast together—when the prisoner came into the sitting room on October 6th he raised the pistol without saying anything after I spoke to him—I saw a flash and heard the report—at that time I did not know where the bullet had gone, if one had gone at all—I was sitting with my back to the fire, a trifle nearer to the kitchen side of the table than the centre—he did not appear to be firing at me or anything in particular—I noticed his face—he seemed very strange indeed to me—he seemed to have a wild and dazed look—he did not look like a man who knew what he was doing—he was not angry with me—after he had fired the first time I rose from my seat—I stood up quite still; it seemed a long time to me, but I suppose it was only a second or two—he had plenty of time to fire at me again while I was standing if he had wished to—I was facing him, between the fire grate and the table; then I went to the edge of the table, near the glass doors, and crawled under<lb/>neath it—I stayed under the table for what seemed a long time to me—if he had chosen to do so the prisoner had plenty of time to fire at me while I was there—I could see his legs, but I could only see him walking about—he did not further molest me—then I crawled from under the table to the door and got on to the stairs—when I got to the door the prisoner was standing opposite the door—he could see me as I went out—he could easily have fired at me if he had chosen to while I was walking out of the door—I did not notice him come out of the room as I went up the stairs—in order to get into the kitchen he would have to come out of that door and go in at the kitchen door—I think I must have got up five or six steps when I heard the report—the scream came from the kitchen—I know my aunt's voice; the scream was hers—I turned round and saw the prisoner just outside the kitchen door—as I turned and looked down I think he turned and looked at me, but I am not positive about it—I did not notice where his hand was in which he had the pistol—it only took me 8 minute or two to get from the breakfast</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have had sixteen years' experience of persons who are insane, as an ordinary practitioner only—I have not made it a special branch of my practice—I have known persons when suffering from epilepsy to murder people and within half an hour to be perfectly rational, but there are different symptoms of epilepsy—you can have madness before the epileptic attacks, or between them, or, as it is called, <hi rend="italic">post</hi> epilepsy—there are different forms of epilepsy—there is an excitable form, which</p>

               <p>comes shortly before the fit itself—in those cases the face is red and the eyes bloodshot, and a general appearance of strangeness in demeanour.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There was not the slightest indication to my mind that the prisoner had ever had epilepsy, or was in an epileptic state on this night—there was not the slightest thing which gave rise to any such suspicion in my mind—until this moment it has never been suggested to me that he was ever suffering from epilepsy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the medical officer at Brixton Prison—for the last seven or eight years I have held that position at Brixton and Holloway—I have had considerable experience in looking at and examining and testing those as to whom there is any suggestion of insanity—the prisoner was received at Brixton on October 7th, and, as is usual in such cases, was at once put under special observation—I have seen him daily from the evening of the 10th till now—my fellow medical officer, Dr. Watson, saw him up to the 10th—during the time he has been in prison he has been nervous and depressed, but rational both in his conduct and conversation—I do not consider that he was more depressed than is natural, considering the charge against him—I have conversed with him on several occasions in order to discover whether he suffered from delusions, or any disease of the mind—I have not detected any insanity during the time he has been under my observation—there was no evidence of recent excessive drinking—I have had placed before me the whole of the depositions in this case, and I have been in Court to-day during part of the trial—in my opinion I do not think it is shown by the evidence that on October 6th he was suffering from any disease of the mind—I have seen no evidence that he is an epileptic, and he has had no attacks of that nature while under my observation—he said that for some years he had fainting fits, but that, to his knowledge, he never had a convulsive fit—insanity is not necessarily hereditary—from the statements I have seen as to the prisoner's family insanity, I do not think it is strong enough to lead one to think that he has inherited it or not.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It is difficult to say whether insanity may show itself in any particular branch or generation—there are not many cases of persons who, suffering from mental trouble, go long periods without any overt act—there are cases where persons go voluntarily into retreats when they feel the approach of such trouble, remain there some time, then emerge once more—there is generally something to be traced if you inquire into it.</p>

I am manager of a common lodging house at 23, Law<lb/>rence Street, Chelsea—on the evening of March 28th the prisoner was in my house—he had not engaged a bed—another man had paid for one for him—I was sitting in my office up stairs, and heard cries of "Murder! police!" and my name was called—I went downstairs into the kitchen, and found the prisoner and another man named Croucher—they had robbed two men, and were kicking them—I stooped down to assist Palmer, one of the men, and as I did so the prisoner made a running kick at me, saying, "Take that, you f—g bastard; that is one I owe you"—I picked the man up, set him on a form and ordered the prisoner out of the house—he went—I was severely bruised, but did not know then that my injuries were so serious—the kick had broken two of my ribs—I went to St. George's Hospital, and was there treated for that, and then pleurisy set in, and I was under treatment as an out patient for a further six weeks—I feel the effects of my injuries now—the prisoner has borne ill-will against me for five years because I was the principal witness against him for robbing a bootmaker five years ago.</p>

                  </hi>:. I am the wife of <hi rend="italic">Jim</hi> Byrne, and live at 49, Martin Road, Custom House—on November 15th I met a man called Rusthall; he was sober—we went along the Victoria Dock Road—the prisoners and a man called Duggan were standing outside a public house—they followed us into a coffee shop, where Rusthall ordered some tea—Rusthall and I walked out, and the prisoners and Duggan followed—we went into a public house, where I had a small lemon and Rusthall a glass of bitter—the three followed us there—Turpin said, "Why shouldn't I have a drink?"—I never answered, and we walked out—we went into another coffee shop next door to the public house, and had something to eat in there—the three men followed us there—we came out and went along towards the Docks—when we got into the Dock, Turpin followed us up and hit Rusthall on his face in several places, which knocked him up against some wood, and Smith <hi rend="italic">went through</hi> his pockets and cleared off, and I went on board the ship with Rusthall.</p>

                  </hi>. I first made the prisoner's acquaintance at the Prince's Restaurant, on January 5th, 1903—I was lunching there with a lady, and he came up to us—I am not sure that the lady introduced us, but he knew her—there was a conversation about some horses; that was all that passed on that occasion—I next saw him a week or so afterwards at the same place—we had a conversation—he told me he had some shares in a certain company, and that he had not at the time thought of any name to place them in, and had put them in my name, and that I was entitled to a profit of £1,000 by having sold them—I think the company was called the "Credit Foncier"—this letter of January 10th I wrote at the Hotel Albemarle to the prisoner at Wargrave, "Berks:" My dear Sebright,—I hope you will not think me an awful bore writing to you when I am fully aware what a lot of letters you must needs have to attend to, but as I want you, as a <hi rend="italic">pal</hi>, to grant me a great favour, I cannot desist writing; the favour is this, that if when your daughter has tried the horse, and you still like him, you will accept him as a token of my gratefulness to you for what you have done for me"—I understood by the transaction about the shares that I was entitled to the £1,000, and so I offered him the horse, which I think cost me £160—he had it on trial, with the idea of buying it from me—this was arranged between our two meetings at Prince's Restaurant—he next came to see me at my hotel, on the 12th, I think, and said, "I have come to see you about these shares," producing a letter ready written, which was, I supposed, a receipt for the bills which I was to sign, a formal document, to entitle me to draw the</p>

               <p>£1,000—I said I had no idea of this business, or something like that, but that I would simply take his word for it—I was asked to sign two bills; they looked like cheques, but I found out afterwards that they were bills of exchange—I read them, but did not understand them—he did not say very much about the effect of them, except that I was entitled by signing them to draw this money—nothing was said about my being liable for anything if I signed them—I said I must take his word for what I did in the matter—I signed them, writing, "Accepted, payable at Drummond's"—it is all in my writing, according to the prisoner's dicta<lb/>tion—I never accepted a bill before, except under advice—I had accepted one for about £3,000, relating to a cigarette company, under my father-in-law's advice, for my brother-in-law—I think that bill was paid, but it was done through my agents—I can only recollect one bill—this is the letter the prisoner brought on January 12th, and which I have described as a receipt: "My dear Downshire,—I have this day received from you two acceptances of £5,750 each in purchase of 12,650 preferred shares of £1 each, fully paid up, which you have this day purchased from me in the company which I am about to form, which is to be called the Credit Foncier of England, and am, yours sincerely, Arthur E. S. Sebright"—I wrote this letter [<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 3] at the same time, on January 12th, at the prisoner's dictation: "My dear Sebright,—I enclose you my two accep<lb/>tances of £5,750 each in payment of ray 12,650 shares preference of £1 each in the company which you are forming, and which is to be called the Credit Foncier, which I have this day bought from you.—Yours very sincerely, Downshire"—I did not understand much about it, as I trusted to the prisoner—I also wrote this letter: "My dear Sebright,—Out of the proceeds of the sale of my bonus shares in the Credit Foncier, please pay to "the person named "the sum of £525.—Yours very sincerely, Downshire"—I explained to the prisoner what I wanted to do, and he told me the language to write it in—I had never before had any transac<lb/>tions in shares of a public company except under advice—my agent manages my business and money affairs—the prisoner came next day to my hotel with another man, and said he had brought Mr. Hicks, the Secretary of the Reversionary and General Securities Company, to witness my signature—in the presence of the prisoner and Hicks, I went over the acceptances with a dry pen, at the prisoner's request—I think Mr. Hicks asked me if I had signed the documents, and I said, "It is all right"—I think I also went over my signature to letter No. 3, but I am not quite sure—I think on the 12th I asked the prisoner when I was to get my £1,000, and he said "Very soon"—I met him casually afterwards, and he gain said, "You will get your £1,000 very soon"—I always had the same answer—he accepted my gift of the horse—one day the driver of my private hansom gave me certain information about the prisoner, and I went the same day, February 4th, to my solicitors, Messrs. Lewis and Lewis, who upon my instructions commenced two actions, one in the Chancery Division to restrain dealings with the bills, and one in the King's Bench Division to recover possession of the horse—I swore some affidavits in both actions, and the injunctions were granted, but too late to save</p>

I cannot remember whether on the first occasion I met the prisoner I was introduced to him by name by the lady I was lunching with, but I think so—we soon became on such friendly term that he called me "My dear Downshare," and I called him "My dear Sebright"—I am thirty two years old, and was at a public school for six or eight years—I have estates in Ireland and England which are managed by agents—I draw a large number of cheques in the course of a year—I know what a cheque is, and do not require assistance to draw one—I am aware that there are such things as public companies and shares in companies—I know the difference between a company which is in existence and one about to be formed—I did not bother very much about whether the company the prisoner spoke to me about was a com<lb/>pany that was formed or not—I understood that this was a company which was going to be formed, but was not yet in existence—he was to be the manager. I thought—I understood that I was going to get £1,000—I did not know anything about bonus shares—as to letter No. 1, beginning "My dear Sebright, "I explained to the prisoner that I wanted to give halt the amount resulting from the sale of the shares to a certain lady; the lady who introduced me to him—I suppose it was explained to me that I was to get bonus shares—I suppose in consideration of the £11,500 I was to get 12,650 preference shares—I suppose that was because the company was not then formed—I suppose I was to receive a bonus of a thousand shares which, when sold, would give me £1,000—I said at the police court, "My object in taking the shares was to get the £1,000 profit; I was not told when I should get it"—that was correct—I understood the prisoner to say that these shares had been sold before January 12th—I really say that before January 12th I did not know what a bill of exchange was—I had, as I say, accepted a bill of exchange before under advice in the case of a cigarette company; it was payable at Drummond's Bank, and duly paid—that was a company about to be formed, and I suppose I accepted the bill for the purpose of taking shares in it—when Mr. Hicks came with the prisoner to my hotel I did not recognise that he came from the same office that I had been to in 1894 and signed an acceptance to a bill Hicks produced the two bills and said, I believe "Are these your bills and did you accept them" and I think I replied, "It is all right"—I knew then that they were bills and not cheques—I thought they were formal documents—after these criminal proceedings were com<lb/>menced I went to a Mr. Faulkner, an engineer and model maker, of Shaftesbury Avenue—Faulkner did not introduce me to someone, saying, "This gentleman knows Sebright"—I may have had some conversation with Faulkner—I did not say there when asked what a bill was "I know what a bill is well enough"—I do not remember saying "I have been a—fool"—I may have said, I went to Lewis and Lewis, and left the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I am prosecuting by the advice of my solicitors as much as anything—in the course of this case I have become aware that the prisoner has been an undischarged bankrupt since 1880. and that he has been four times bankrupt since—I have realised all along that neither by criminal nor civil proceedings was there any possibility of getting anything out of him.</p>

Allen's office at 17, Carlisle Street; they are solicitors to the City Council of Westminster, and made a statement there—I saw Mr. Hunt, the Town Clerk—no police were there then—on Sunday, about 2 p.m., Inspector Drew came to my house, and he came again on Monday with another policeman, about 3 or 3,30—he was shown into the sitting room, where tie previous conversation had taken place—he got under a table—before doing so he gave me £20 in gold, which warn marked by him—the prisoner had come to the house at 11 a.m., but had not seen me; he came again about 4.30—we went up stairs into the dining room—I took hold of some bills I had to pay and said, "Look here, sir, I have all those bills, more than £50 to pay, let me off with £10"—he said, "I cannot help your trouble, I must have the £20"—I picked up a bill and said, "If I don't pay that hill to-morrow I shall be summoned; let me out with £5;</p>

               <p>I will give you £15, and I will keep the £5"—he said, "I must have the £20; if you don't give me £20 I have been this morning to Marlborough Street Police Court, and have had those two summonses signed by Mr. Denman, the Magistrate, and you will be up there to-morrow in the Court"—he showed me two blue papers—I did not see any name on them except "Westminster City"—they were like these two papers (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>). but I did not see the bottom of them—I then gave him the £20; I put it into his hand and said, "It is very hard for me to give this £20 "'—he said, "It is not only for me; I have to share with somebody else"—he put it into his pocket and said, "Mind you keep your mouth shut, because if you say anything to anybody you will have six months, and I shall have six months as well"—I said, "Would you like to have a whisky?—he said, "And you?."—I said, "I don't mind," and I called for two whiskies—I did not go out of the room to do so; one of the waitresses came in, and I said, "Bring two whiskies and a soda"—the prisoner said, "Where was she, that girl? she was listening to us what we say"—I said, "No she was on the staircase, I suppose"—he said, "Anybody else in the room listening to what we have said?"—I did not answer, because Inspector Drew came out from under the table and arrested him—the other officer was in the next room—the prisoner was taken away.</p>

If you tell anybody what you have done, you would get six months for doing it, and I should get six months as well"—I then heard some money counted, and I should imagine, being put on the table—I then heard the prosecutor ask the prisoner if he would have a Scotch and soda; the prisoner said "Yes,"—the prosecutor crossed the room and called out to the girl to bring up Scotch and soda—the girl came immediately into the room, and when she went out the prisoner said, "Was she listening?"—the prosecutor said, "No"—the prisoner said, "Have you got any<lb/>body else here?"—the prisoner said, "I do not know ", or he was about to make a remark, when I came out from underneath the table—as I did so the prisoner jumped up from the table and put both his hands into his trousers pockets—I rushed at him, seized both his wrists, and held both his hands in his pockets, and told him I should prevent him from</p>

               <p>taking anything out—I could hear money jingling—I told him to take his hands out of his pockets empty, which he did—I then told him who I was, and that I should arrest him on a charge of demanding money by menaces from the prosecutor—he stood quite mute for several seconds—I called in Sergeant Burton, and sent him for a cab—the prisoner then said, "Can I have bail?."—I said, "No"—I told him to button up his coat, which he did—I put him into a cab and conveyed him to Vine Street Police Station—on the way he said, "I did not use any threats"—at the station I told him to turn out his pockets, and he produced from his right hand trousers pocket a quantity of gold, silver, and bronze, saying, "There is £22 there in gold"—I said, "Before you came to the place this afternoon I marked twenty sovereigns which I handed to Mr. Houssier and I have ascertained since you have been in custody that he has handed them to you at your request"—I then commenced to inspect the sovereigns—as I identified them by my mark, I put them down—he asked if he might also inspect them—I showed him where my mark was, and after examining three or four he declined to examine any more—he had also this pocket book and these two destruction orders signed by Mr. Denman—as soon as I got to the station I wrote down in my pocket book the conversation I heard underneath the table—I read it over to the prisoner, he made no reply, but said, "What Act do you charge me under?"—I said, "The Larceny Act"—he said, "This has all been arranged; I knew he was going to do it, and I was going to charge him under the Corrupt Practices Officials Act for bribing me; that is my answer to the charge."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I arranged with Houssier that after the prisoner had accepted the money he was to give a signal by asking him if he would have some whiskey, so that I could catch him, and also to give a signal to Burton in case I could not get out of my position, as I was crumpled up under the table—it was as much a signal to Burton as it was for me, in case the prisoner tried to run out of the room—it was not intended that he should have it; I do not think the girl brought it—I told Houssier that at first he must refuse to give him the money, so that I could judge what the prisoner's intentions were—I did not tell him he was to give what he could afford.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner, of 42, Friar Gate, Derby—on November 14th I was assistant house surgeon at Guy's Hospital—the child, Ellen Paxton, was brought in by a woman—I examined it—I found it breathed with considerable difficulty, as though there were some obstruction—there seemed to be inflammation at the back of the throat—he was under the charge of Dr. Lister the next few days—after November 16th I took over Dr. Lister's work—on Novem<lb/>ber 17th the child died of inflammation of the lungs—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, when a cork was found in the gullet of over an inch in length—I believe these bottles contain the gullet with the cork, and the stomach with two pieces of cork as they were found (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—Dr. Targett has the charge of them—the cork interfered with the child breathing, so food had sunk into the lungs, that caused pneumonia and death—a child of that tender age could not have swallowed corks of the size of these or anything like it—they could not have passed into the gullet without assistance from without—the one in the gullet was too big to pass to the stomach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The larger cork pressed against the windpipe just below the epiglottis, and prevented food passing down the gullet, and so it passed down the windpipe into the lungs—the other two corks are not quite the same size; they are all in gradation—there is laceration in the gullet, but not above the point where the cork is; nothing observable certainly—there was at the point where the cork rested—there was evidence at the time that there was bleeding, but I did not see it—Dr. Burroughs gave the evidence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The evidence on the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination bore out the suggestion that the corks were wilfully forced down the child's throat—I think it is impossible for a cork to get as far as that without assistance—I believe someone must have pushed them down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner, of 50, Brook Street, Grosvenor Square—in November, 1893, I was house surgeon in Guy's Hospital—the child, Ellen Paxton, was taken in on November 14th, suffering from a swelling of the neck and difficulty in breathing and swallowing—I had her in my charge from November 14th to 16th, when I handed her over to Mr. Luce—it was not possible for her to have obtained works while under my charge—it was extremely unlikely for a child of en months to have accidentally got corks into its gullet and stomach in the position in which I see them to-day for the first time (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>).</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The preserving spirit would not, I should say, make he cork swell—I cannot say without experiment, but I think the tendency would be to contract rather than swell them—I put my finger down the child's throat—there was a good deal of swelling of the tissues, the soft lining of the tissues of the throat; I could not get beyond that—one might feel the top part of the posterior wall of the gullet, the oesophagus</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Guy's Hospital—I made the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination in November, 1893—these bottles contain the corks which were taken from the child's stomach and gullet—the large corks remained in the gullet—the Exhibits have been in my charge—I agree with Dr. Luce with regard to the way in which the corks must have got into the child's gullet—that the child was unable to swallow was evidence of that fact—two are in the stomach; the other one is too large to have been swallowed by natural mechanism—if the smaller corks had got sufficiently far back in the throat the child might have swallowed them, but force must have been required to have got the larger cork in that position.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I mean if they got within the grasp of the muscles; behind the soft palate it would not be impossible, but it is quite improbable—the preserving spirit, which we call formalin, would not swell the corks—I should not think they have been swallowed since the child was in the hospital—I do not think the position of the corks has been altered—a cork could only be pushed in by the end of the finger in a child's mouth; one could hardly assume two fingers at work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> In my opinion the large cork was pushed down by the finger—the smaller corks probably passed sufficiently far back to get within the grasp of the muscles, but there must have been some assistance, a child of ten months having a smaller passage—swallowing is a rapid act, but it might have been painful—the corks would have to distend the throat from the back of the mouth—the big cork could not have got into the child's stomach by any muscular action—it is in a curious part of the passage separating the part above and the tubular part below, and the passage is rather narrower there—I cannot imagine a child picking up the smaller corks and swallowing them, and then swallowing the larger one to the point where I found it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of Bartlett's Buildings, Holborn—I was Deputy Coroner for the Borough of Southwark—on November 28th I held an inquest on the body of this child—I took notes of the evidence which was given on that occasion—I have before me my note of the examination of George Henry Woodward, taken on that day in my own writing—it was not signed by the deponent—he was sworn before he gave it—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "George Henry Woodward, sworn, saith, I live at 10, Barrow's Place, Church Street, Lee. I am a painter. I first saw deceased child about the first week in November; that is when it came to my wife; she came with my consent. I was at home on the 14th Novem<lb/>ber the whole day (I had no work to do that day). About twenty past nine in the morning the child was brought by the mother. My wife took it in her arms and nursed it all the morning. About half past twelve she gave it a slice of brown bread and butter. About one o'clock it was took with a choking in the throat, and turned very black in the face after that it began vomiting up a lot of blood. My wife said to me,' For goodness sake, do go for the mother!' I went round at once; she was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190311160096"/>
               <p>gone to dinner then. But I saw his eldest boy, and told him to go for his mother at once, as the baby was bringing up blood. She came about two minutes after that, and said, "What do you think I had better do with the child? "I said, 'Take it to a doctor at once.' She got up and took it, I suppose. I did not go with her, neither did my wife. She came back again about an hour and half after. She said she had been to the doctor's. Both Dr. Burroughs had seen the child and also Dr. Clark, and had ordered it to Guy's Hospital. She brought the child back with her. That would be away from the station. The mother brought the brown bread and butter in the morning. I had not taken any notice of it. My wife nursed the baby the whole morning without putting it down once. I did not object to my wife taking charge of the baby; I said she could do as she liked about that. It was rather trouble<lb/>some. About a week after she first had it I said she would have to give it up if it kept so troublesome. Mrs. Paxton came one night at the beginning of November and asked my wife if she would mind the child, without any introduction. I do not know what made her come, I am sure. I cannot account for the corks. I am quite sure the child never got them in my house. My child was ill about three months ago, and died. My child had medicine from Dr. Burroughs and the Evelina Hospital. It only had one bottle. I am quite sure of that. Only one bottle was used for all the medicine he had. I threw the cork away in the dust bin I am quite sure I have no more medicine bottles in the house. The size of the cork would be about an inch long. The child's little brother, two and a half years old, was the only person in the house besides me and my wife."</p>
