               <p>asked him if he knew anything about it, and then referred to Mr. Dresden's case—he said "I was b——annoyed about that affair; I. thought what I spoke to you I spoke in confidence" (that was a black poodle which I had bought for Mr. Dresden)—I said, "I have offered 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward for my dog; if you know anything about it, I shall be glad if you will tell me"—he said, "Oh, you don't mean paying any 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get him back"—I said, "Yes I do, if I can get him back at once"—he said, "You come to me in two or three days' time; I will see if I can do anything for you"—I said that I should have to know at once, as I had a bitch coming from Long Sutton, and was going to give the gentleman an answer about it; that as I should get a fee of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., it would suit me then to pay 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Page said "Call again in two or three hours' time, and I will go round and see one or two of the lads and see whether they know anything"—I said, "I have not time to go home and back"—he told me not to go home, as he should not be more than 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour—he went away and came back in about seven minutes and picked up a head of mint at the greengrocer's next door, which he handed to me and said, "Here, smell this; is not this nice?"—I took it, and he said, "Put it in your coat;" but I held it in my ha id and made no remark—he said, "Put it in your coat"—I still held it in my hand and said, "Have you heard anything about it?"—he said "Have you got the <hi rend="italic">stuff</hi> to pay for him?"—I said, "No, but I can get it in a very few minutes"—there was some talk about getting the money—he said "You can either get it now, or come down any time by appointment to Moorgate Street or Liverpool Street, and wear that in your coat, and some one will pick you up, and take you where the dog is"—there was some more talk about the arrangements, and it ended in my going to his beershop in Slater Street—I said to him, "10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is a good lot; can't you get him back for me for less?"—he said, "No, you are very lucky to get him back for that, for he is in price for a Captain Taylor to go to New York on the Wednesday, and the hamper and everything was prepared for him to go away"—an arrangement was made for me to go to Slater Street—I had been there before to get the black poodle for Mr. Dresden—he said I should have to come down by myself, and this time to bring hard cash; it was no use for mo to come alone; if I brought anybody with me, sooner than I should have my dog back his throat would be cut, because the lads would not be done—I went to Slater Street about 8.30 that evening—I did not wear the mint as I was to go to his house—in the meantime I had communicated with Inspector King—when I got into Page's beershop I saw Mrs. Page, and asked if Mr. Page was in—she said he was lying down—I saw a number of people in there, and when I went in there was a general whisper all round, men getting up and putting their heads together, and all eyes were upon me—Page came out, and I asked if he had heard anything more about my dog—he said "No, don't know the least; I have put it into the hands of those who will arrange everything," or "into the hands of the lads," "and somebody has promised to come and pick you up"—I asked if they would be long—he said, "They may be here in a few minutes, or half an hour, or an hour, or an hour and a half; I cannot tell in the least"—he said I should have to go through a little ceremony, and if I paid my money civilly I should get my dog—I said, "Then you promise there will be nothing more," meaning that there would be no row—he said, "No, there will be nothing more"—soon after the man came in, but before that Page looked straight across at the men that were there and said, "There is a fine lot of you in here; I should think it was time some of you were</p>

I lost my dog on 9th July—I saw Page about recovering it on 15th July; these proceedings were taken on 14th November—Page has a shop in Leadenhall Market; I believe he deals in rabbits and fowls and such things—I did not put the mint in my coat; there was no occasion for it afterwards the mint had nothing to do with the recovery of the dog;</p>

               <p>he told me to go to his own beershop in Slater Street—I knew that he had a beershop there—my dog was worth 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it was a valuable dog for lining bitches, and was always able to command a good price for that—I know a little about dogs—when dogs are lost I have found it of use to go to the police—I have never received anything for getting a dog back, save Mr. Dresden's; he gave me a sovereign for my expenses when I got his dog back—Page was in Court in that case; I don't know for what purpose—I had a St. Bernard bitch there was a little disturbance about; it took the second prize at the Crystal Palaee; it was owned at Margate as the property of a gentleman named Congreve—I gave 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10A for that dog; Mr. Congreve entered it for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the show; I also know it was not worth anything like 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I bought it without a pedigree; I afterwards got part of the pedigree; I bought it of a man named Riddesford, a carrier at Walton—on the-Hill; he is dead; I refused to give Mr. Congreve his name on account of Mr. Con<lb/>greve's behaviour—the dog was subsequently given up to Mr. Congreve—the matter was settled to the satisfaction of the committee, and I got my prize—people may innocently be possessed of stolen dogs—I knew where to find Page between July and November—the prisoners were tried for this offence last Sessions, and the jury being unable to agree were discharged without giving a verdict—when I left Page at his beer-house in Slater Street I did not see him afterwards—I left him about 9 o'clock, and I paid the money about 10.30.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Cook</hi>. I have no doubt it was you who said to me, "Do you mean paying the money if he goes and gets the dog?"—I don't think I would swear it—the other man had the dog—I offered the money to you because your hands were free, and the other man had the dog; I believe you were the nearest to me—I thought you were both concerned in it—I had no particular reason for offering you the money more than the other; it was not to get you into trouble—I addressed both of you when I asked for something to drink—it was you who said, "I have got to go and give the money to the man that got the dog."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I gave information to the police on 15th July, and left the matter in the hands of the police—it was in August that I was sent for and saw Cook at the police-court, and on 14th November both prisoners were charged at Worship Street, and the matter was then taken in hand by the Treasury authorities.</p>

I manage the Victoria Tavern, King's Cross, for Mr. Baker—these two pewter measures are his—one has "Baker" on it, and the other "Speedy"—Mr. Speedy was the former proprietor—the prisoner was a frequent customer—I saw him drinking beer there on the night of the 16th from 9.30 to 11.30—these measures must have been taken from the back of the recess.</p>

                  </hi> I am Inspector of Coin to the Mint—bad money is frequently made from pewter pots—these are two moulds, one for making pence and the other for shillings—they are made of plaster-of-Paris, but I have seen pence cast in sand; this was never intended to do anything at all—this frying-pan has metal adhering to it now, and might be used to pour lead into the moulds, but it would be a clumsy way of doing it—these pliers have plaster-of-Paris sticking to them; they would hold a coin which was too hot to hold with the fingers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I have been connected with the Mint many years, and never saw such a set of things produced before in any coining case—I should say that a man had been trying to make something with them and did not succeed—the fact is he could not use these moulds; copper would break them by its excessive heat—both sides of a coin could not be com<lb/>pleted in one mould; if he wanted to make a cheap copy of the Queen's head it could be done, but I doubt if he could make either side in this penny mould—the shilling mould shows the same peculiarities precisely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. A bad shilling cannot be made in this mould because it is so badly made; the hot metal would run through it, and you would not get any impression, but you might stop it with a bit of grease.</p>

On Tuesday, 19th November, about 4.30 p.m., I met the prisoner with another man in Nile Street, East Road, and from the description I had received I told him that I should take him on suspicion of stealing a watch on Sunday night in East Road—directly I took hold of him, he said "If you don't let me go I shall kill you"—he was very violent, and took from his pocket this stocking with a stone in it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I closed with him, and caught his comforter with my left hand—his companion kicked me and threw me down—I think there were two or three companions, but only one of them took a prominent part in it—they got me down, and I asked some of the shopkeepers by name to</p>

               <p>assist me, but they would not come—the prisoner heard that I halloaed out loud when we were struggling together—it is a very low neighbourhood in Hoxton—I got up again and struck the prisoner's companion across the face, and struck the prisoner across the head with my cane and cut his head open—my cane was then taken from me, and I lost my hat—a uniform man came to my assistance, and then two constables, and the prisoner was taken to the station—I went back and picked up this stocking with a stone in it, which the prisoner dropped when the constables came up—I was shaken, but not much hurt—I had one or two little bruises—he was put with six other men, near about his own appearance, at the station, and she identified him—I did not point him out to her—I kept in the charge room.</p>

I am the wife of John Jeffries, a law-writer, and live with him at 22, Cumberland Street—I have known the prisoner two years this last August—on 26th November, at 6 o'clock in the evening, he came to my house; he knocked twice before I heard him—I only heard the third knock; I then opened the door to him; I said "What do you want here!"—he said "You"—I said "You will not get me, you have no business here—he called a young man, gave him threepence, and said "I shall not be</p>

               <p>long"—the young man went away—I should not know him again—my street door is close by the room door, and the prisoner put his foot between the doors as he gave the young man the threepence—I used rather a vulgar expression in my excitement, and said "You had better take your <hi rend="italic">hook</hi>, you have caused enough misery here; I don't want you here after me"—he walked into my room and shut the door after him; he looked round the room and said "This is very comfortable, very comfortable indeed, and I have nowhere to go"—he then said "You have got to come out with me"—I said "I am sure I shall not, I expect my husband home every minute;" with that he pulled a revolver out and said "Come out or die here, which you like, for die to-night you will"—he put the pistol to my head—I put on my bonnet and tried to escape by the bedroom door, he heard me turn the key, and said "You don't get out that way, you will never slip me again"—he pulled the pistol out again and said "I have a great mind to do it as you stand now, if you defy me I will"—I said "Oh! pray don't shoot me, I am sure I am not prepared to die"—he said "Then come out, or I will shoot you;" and under that threat I went out—I told him I expected my husband in to supper—he said He will never have another supper here—I went out with him round to a beerhouse; I sat there crying; he called for a pint of ale and wished me to drink; I did not want to drink; his pistol was out again directly—we stayed there about three-quarters of an hour; he would not allow me to go home—I was praying to go home to get my husband's supper; he would not allow me to do so—we came out together and walked from Goodge Street into Tottenham Court Road and went into another public-house; he would not let me leave him a step; the pistol was then in his coat pocket, just inside, and he kept shifting it from one pocket to another pocket—I was crying most hysterically in this public-house, and I kept saying out loud, thinking the landlord would notice what I said, "Will you unload that pistol; pray unload that pistol?"—the prisoner laughed and said "Yes, I will unload it directly, through your head when I do unload it; you had better behave yourself, if you do you shall stay till 12 o'clock, you shall live till 12 o'clock; if not, you will go at once, as I mean to do for you, the old man, and myself to-night"—the land<lb/>lord ordered us out; he would not go till he made me walk first—I said something to the landlord when we got outside; the prisoner did not hear it; he asked me what I was whispering about, I said "Not anything much"—he said "If I thought you had told him what I had got you would have it directly"—he said to me "Come to the corner of Windmill Street with me, and I will give you up the pistol to your possession"—I went with him, and when we got there he laughed at me when I asked him for the pistol—there were two Life Guardsmen there, he spoke to them and called for a quart of beer, and they drank it with him—that was at a public-house at the corner of Windmill Street—I went with him there; he demanded me to go wherever he went—I said to the Life Guardsmen "Well, gentle<lb/>men, you are soldiers, this man has got a loaded pistol in his pocket, will you be kind enough to protect me?"—they said "I suppose it is a love affair; you are his wife?"—I said "No, sir, I have got a good kind husband at home, and I want to get home to get his supper"—I pulled his coat on one side and they could see the butt-end of the pistol, and one soldier said to the other "He has got a pistol</p>

               <p>there," and the other one said "Let us see what you have got?"—the prisoner said "I can let you see my fist, and if that is not sufficient I can let you have a bit of metal"—I believe those were the words—the land<lb/>lord then ordered him out; we walked from there back towards the police-station, and when I got there I walked backwards into the station; the prisoner was standing looking at me at the time, and I expected he would shoot me as I went in—I spoke to the inspector, and explained everything to him; a constable in uniform came out with me, the prisoner was then gone—the inspector told me something and I went home, that was about 9 o'clock as near as possible; I found that my husband was not at home and I went to the Old King's Head opposite, where he generally goes to get a glass of beer for his supper;—I said to my husband, "I have seen that fellow again," and as my husband was coming out at one door the prisoner came out at the next compartment following him; I caught hold of my husband, and said, "Don't speak to him, pray don't, he has got a loaded revolver, and he has pointed it at my head such a many times to<lb/>night;" the prisoner laughed and said to my husband, "Well, Mr. Jeffries, how are you, I should like to shake hands with you"—my husband said, "You go away, you are no man to follow my wife about and frighten her as you do," and he said to me, "Come inside, Jane"—I went inside with my husband, the prisoner followed us in; he said, "I am going to Colchester to<lb/>morrow, I have enlisted to-day"—my husband said, "I don't know so much about that, for the first constable I see, I shall give you into custody"—the prisoner had got the pistol then in the waist of his trowsers, and he pulled it out and fired at my husband without a word; my husband said, "He has shot me"—the prisoner waited close on a minute and then he fired again; finding my husband did not fall, he levelled the pistol straight at my hus<lb/>band's head; at the second shot I laid hold of his hand and knocked his hand on one side, and made the shot go on one side; he fired, and as he fired I knocked his hand on one side, and the shot went to the right; I laid hold of the pistol, and he tried his hardest to bend his hand down and put the muzzle to my head—I held it straight up in his hand—I had got my two hands on it, and in our struggle he turned me from one corner about four or five feet; I still kept hold of the pistol, and hearing a crowd outside, I called out, "Won't some one come, I can't hold on much longer"—two young men rushed in, one laid hold of him by the wrist—I can't tell whether I gave the other one the pistol or not, but it was taken from him—I don't know what the prisoner said—my husband was taken to the hospital <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I had seen you on the Monday afternoon, the 25th, the day before this—I met you accidentally in Tottenham Court Road—I was not walking with a young man, you saw me speak to a young man in the Euston Road, a cousin who used to come to Mr. Cole's shop, he did not speak three words to me—whether he got on a bus or not I could not tell—I tried to pass you, and you said, "I have come from the Isle of Wight to see you, you need not think to pass me like that since you have got up in the world"—I did not tell you the young man was a particular friend of mine, and that I did not intend to give him up—I did not say that he knew nothing of me as yet, but at Christmas he might, as he was going to buy me a diamond ring, which I should have to take care to hide from the old man—I said nothing of the kind—I don't think you asked me why I did not keep to my husband, and not go with</p>

               <p>other men—why have you followed me in the manner you have done if you wish mo to keep to my husband—I do not remember saying it was no business of yours, and that I should have who I liked—I think if I said that I should be bound to remember such a thing—I went with you to the City Road that night, I was bound to go because you always followed me about—you have been to my house in the dead of the night—I went with you on the Monday night, I was bound to follow you, as I have always been bound to do since I have been a married, woman, or else have you come to the house—I went into Mrs. Jordan's—I tried to get away from you think<lb/>ing you would go away, but you waited outside the door and came and knocked and asked me if I was not coming out, and I said to Mrs. Jordan, "It is no good, I shall never get rid of him till I give him some money again as usual"—I tried my utmost to get away from you, I did not stay there with you till half-past 12 o'clock, I jumped into a hansom to get away from you, and you caught sight of my dress as I got into the cab, and you jumped into the cab while it was going on—as we were going along, I said, "Will you allow me to go home"—you said, "I have got no money, and you don't go home till you give me some"—I gave you 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the cab, and you allowed me to get out, and I went straight home and told my husband what had occurred—it was not 1 o'clock when I left you, I was frightened of you knowing where 1 lived—you shot my first husband dead—I did not ask you to come next day at 3 o'clock—I had too great a horror of your knowing where I lived to think of such a thing—you did not come and whistle, I never knew that you could whistle—I did not jump up and come to the street door and say, "Come in"—you did not come in and sit with me in front of the fire—I did not take a fancy to your purse, nor did you give it me—I never saw your purse—I think I told you that my husband had been suffering with rheumatics, that was in the evening when I wanted to get home—I did not show you my knee covered with flannel—I showed you my hands where I had rheumatism, and I said, "Keeping me out in this wet won't improve it"—I did not say to you "You cannot pass from this door because my husband has got the key and he can come in at any moment, we will go to the bedroom"—you did not pull off your coat, nor did I say, "Don't be careless, keep your coat on"—I tried to escape out of the bedroom door and you followed me and said "No, you don't escape me any more"—we did not remain in the bedroom 20 minutes—I did not tell you to wait for me at the corner of the street—I did go out with you under your threat of shooting me in my own room if I did not—it was not as we were standing in the house having a glass of ale that I saw the muzzle of the pistol in your pocket, the first time I saw it was in my parlour, and you pointed it at my head several times—you did not tell the Lifeguardsmen that you had a pistol—I can't say that you were sober—when we went into the last house you were not so sober as you were when you first came to my house, because you drank several pints of ale to yourself—I did not drink anything but one glass of ale—you insisted on my drinking with you.</p>

I am a law writer and live at 22, Cumberland Street, Tottenham Court Road—the last witness is my wife—on Tuesday evening, 26th November, I was at the Old King's Head, in Cumberland Street, about 9.15; the prisoner came in while I was there—I knew him by sight only, I had never spoken to him—he looked very hard at me, but I did not want to know him, and I went out and into another compartment to avoid him—I spoke to the landlady—my wife had not arrived then—I went outside and met her—the prisoner came out as well—nothing passed between me and my wife in his hearing—he came up and said "How do you do, Mr. Jeffries?" I said "I want nothing to do with you"—he said "I am going to Colchester to-morrow morning for a soldier"—this was just inside the public-house—I pulled my wife in there for protection sake—I said "I don't know so much about your going to Colchester, for the first policeman I see I shall give you in charge;" he then deliberately took out this revolver and levelled it at me and fired—he fired twice—I think he took it out from his left-hand pocket, he had been fumbling about there for some time, and he fired it from his right-hand—he might have been perhaps three yards from me when he fired the first shot, perhaps not quite so far—the bullet hit the button in front of my trousers and glided off on to the floor—the button struck my stomach—the bullet went through my greatcoat and there is the hole now—when he fired my wife seized his hand, but he managed to fire a second time; the pistol was directed at me, but she just managed to shake it off, and the bullet fell on the ground close by where I was standing—it must have hit the partition, I suppose—the prisoner did not say a word when he fired the two shots—my wife kept hold of his hand all the time, struggling with him till assistance came in—I believe the revolve was taken from him, but I was so excited after being struck—I walked to the hospital with one of the constables, and a surgeon examined me—it was not necessary for me to remain there—there was a bruise on my stomach—this man has been trying to take my wife's character away, but she has been a good wife to.</p>

The day after the prisoner was in custody, I went to the Old King's Head, and made a search to see if I could find any marks of bullets—I found two marks on the partition, apparently bullet marks, one three feet from the floor; it was a very slight indentation; it might be accounted for by the bounding of the bullet; the second mark was 13 inches from the floor—that appeared more like a bullet mark—there was also a fresh Mrrk on the ceiling—it had the appearance as if something had hit the ceiling, and bounded from the ceiling on to the partition—the ceiling is about 12 feet from the floor—I measured the place where this matter occurred, the partition is 11 feet 6—that is the space in front of the bar.</p>

                  </hi>. For about three months previous to 24th October I was in the employ of Messrs. Bird, brickmakers, of Shepherds' Bush—I had to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187812090028"/>
               <p>look after everything that entered and left the field, and check the tickets with respect to the quantity of bricks that came in—on the morning of the 24th I took a can of tea which my wife had filled and some food in this handkerchief for my breakfast—I never drink milk in my tea—I arrived at the field about 6.20, having been previously to the office—I unlocked No. 4 gate to let in a van with bricks—on leaving home at about 5.45 I drank some of the tea, and at about 6.20 I drank about a pint—the can holds about two quarts—I then hung it up on one of the iron pegs that keep up the hack caps that cover the bricks to keep them from rain, close by the kiln—this is the can (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I went away and returned about 8 o'clock, and saw the prisoner holding the can like this, and the handkerchief which had been attached to the handle was thrown over a wooden cross-bar under the middle of another hack cap—he went straight down through the same hack my bottle was in towards Elliott's lobby—that is not the same lobby I breakfasted in—I then took my can and went straight down to the lobby to breakfast, where I found Marlow, sen., Sheppard, James Marskel, jun., Hughes, and Swanney—I cannot say whether that is his right name—I ate some bread and butter and took my can from the fire and drunk five or six mouthfuls—I detected a disagreeable smell, handed my can to Marlow, and asked him to smell it—he put it to his mouth, and said it smelt very strong of something, and I believe George Marskel tasted it—I cannot say whether any one else tasted it, for directly after I felt ill, and had a burning pain in my muscles, throat, and stomach—my muscles seemed drawn up double, and I cried, thinking of a threat the prisoner had used towards me only one hour before—I cried out, "I believe <hi rend="italic">Dabber</hi> has been poisoning me"—Marlow handed me his bottle to rinse my mouth out—one of them poured some of the tea into his hand—I thought it was Marlow, but I heard at the police-court that it was Sheppard—young James Marskel says, "I dare say <hi rend="italic">Dabber</hi> has been and put some stuff in it, as we seen him with the bottle"—<hi rend="italic">Dabber</hi> is the prisoner's nickname—the boys Marskel and Marlow were with me when I saw Saint with my bottle—Marlow senior said, "You boys have nothing to say about it"—the tea that was poured into one of their hands was blue—I asked one of them to go with me to Mr. Bird's house to get something to take, and Hughes came out and said, "I will go along with you"—some one in the lobby told me to put my fingers down my throat; I did so, and vomited a good deal along the road—we went to the house, which may be about 200 yards—I only went into the hall, and the servants gave me some salt and water to drink—I had vomited twice—I did not vomit after taking the salt and water—Mr. Ernest Bird put some of the stuff from the can in a glass, and it was a bluish-green dirty colour—he also gave me some mustard and water—I was then taken in a cart to the West London Hospital by George Ball—I was sick in the cart—there was a lot of straw in the cart—I was unconscious—at the hospital I saw Mr. Mortimer, the surgeon, perhaps 20 minutes after my arrival—I remained five days under his care, and came out on the sixth day—I have been attending the hospital ever since, once a week—the same evening I was taken there I gave information to the police—on 27th July previously I was in my place at the yard gate and saw a carman leaving with some bricks—I saw Saint hand some money back to the carman when some bricks were taken out of the cart—there were 500 in excess—he had no right to take any out when</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187812090029"/>
               <p>there was no ticket, and I turned the cart back—Saint said "You b—Irish s—, who is going to have a peg-legged s—like you watching us?"—I lost my leg in the Royal Navy—I reported that to Marskel senior, fore<lb/>man of the field, Mr. Bird being out of town—on another occasion I reported the prisoner to Mr. Bird for sending out 50 more bricks than the ticket speci<lb/>fied, and he threatened to put my b—light out, and that he would not do any more work as long as I was in the field—I was continually being threat<lb/>ened by the prisoner and two other mates, Davis and Care, from that time up to the 24th October—the mates have <hi rend="italic">threw</hi> pieces of brick at me and threatened to smash my skull in—before 19th October Saint and Davis had thrown bricks at me—on the morning of the 19th I was coming to work, over the line, at 5.50, when I saw Saint just in front of me—he turned round and said "You Irish s—, if I knew you was coming close behind me I would have put your b—head down underneath that train"—an engine was just coming down from the Scrubbs station towards Uxbridge Road—no one was with the prisoner at that time—he then said "A s—like you ain't fit to live, to be going to master's telling tales"—an hour after I was passing one of the kilns, on the top of which were the prisoner and Davis, when a brick came down and struck me on the heel—I don't know who threw it—I heard Davis say "It was very near the top of his b—head," or "skull"—the prisoner said "It would have been a good job if it had broke his b—head"—at 10 o'clock that day I obtained two summonses against them at the Hammersmith Police-court for threatening me, which were to be heard on the 24th—at 7.15 a.m. on the 24th the prisoner was standing by the lobby where we used to go to breakfast about 100 yards away from the kiln, where I left my tea-can, and he said to me "You peg legged s—, I will lay you b—stiff," or "sick, before night, and you can * * * * with the summons."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I went to Bird's on 8th July last—I am not there now—he has told me not to go anywhere near his field again—I have not spoken to the prisoner for two months—I did not tell the boy Ovenden about a week before this that if <hi rend="italic">Dabber</hi> did not mind before he was a week older I would make it hot for him—I do not know that he is still in Mr. Bird's employ—Mr. Bird offered to bail the prisoner at the police-court—I do not know that he did bail him last session before Mr. Justice Hawkins—I did not before the Magistrate speak of the prisoner's threat to put me under the train—I complained to Mr. Henry Bird, not to Mr. Bird my master, I never <hi rend="italic">see</hi> him—I told Mr. Henry Bird of their throwing bricks at me—I don't know whether I told him my life was threatened—I told him I was afraid to go anywhere near the kilns—I did complain to him of Saint threatening my life—I do not know that the attempt to carry the bricks off Mr. Bird's premises was inquired into—I was too ill at the police-court to bear a quarter—I heard Mr. Henry Bird say at the police-court. something about burrs; not bricks—before I went to Mr. Bird's I was working for the Fulham District Board of Works close by his house—I was there for three years, and before that I and my wife were in service for three months—before I went to Fulham I came from home, New Maiden, Surrey—I was there three or four months—before that I was in business at 74, Hobewell Road, Bristol—I kept a commercial boarding house there for nine years—I have no friends in the north—I was never in Dewsbury—James Marskel, junior, and James Marlow must have seen</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Dabber</hi> with my bottle—I used to hang it up under the hack cap when the kiln was that end of the field, and if I crossed the line coming into the field to my work I would have to pass the lobby to go to the kilns—I did not hang my bottle in what is called the kilnman's lobby more than 20 times while I was there—there is more than one lobby—I did not on that morning, before my bottle was tampered with, say to Marlow, "Did you ever see a wooden-legged man dance? and begin to dance—one of them called my attention to Saint interfering with my bottle—I cannot say whether it was Marlow or Marskel—it was not I that called out" There is Saint at my bottle—I went with the two boys Marskell and Marlow to breakfast in the lobby—I went out of the lobby during breakfast, and I drank the tea when I came back—Case was there—I cannot say whether any one saw me drink the pint when the tea was all right—Case at the Kiln could have seen me—I had drank five or six mouthfuls when I detected the nasty smell—I was drawn up seven or eight times after—Hughes was with me—I said nothing at the police-court about being drawn up almost double—I have not heard that strych<lb/>nine has since been discovered in the tea—I vomited twice on my way to Mr. Bird's—Hughes was with me—the others were at breakfast—I never saw <hi rend="italic">this</hi> bottle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), before I saw it at the police-court—I heard it stated in the police-court that it was found a few yards from the place where I hung up my tea-bottle—I don't know anything about it—I am attending the West London Hospital now—I felt the stiffness that nearly doubled me after I got to the hospital—I was under Mr. Mortimer's treat<lb/>ment five days—I complained to him of the stiffness in my joints and pains in my limbs—perhaps it was an hour after I drank the tea that I saw Mr. Mortimer—when I was drinking it the smell was very strong—I continued to taste the disagreeable smell when I got to the hospital—I cannot say what the taste was—I drank nine or ten lots of milk in the hospital, and warm water and other things—I was half insensible—I cannot say if I had any milk before I saw the doctor—some one told Ball he need not stay, and he was not in my company till I saw the doctor—I have attended the hospital since for sickness, and for the nerves of the stump of my leg—three or four months before the strychnine business, I had a little wound where the cork leg had rubbed me, and I used zinc ointment for it, which my wife got in a penny box from a chemist in Bramley Road—I used it and threw the box on the back of the grate—I remember using the last bit of it—nothing has ever been said to me before about the ointment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. Before I took out the summons I had complained to Mr. Bird of the threats being used, and the old foreman Marskel told me I had no right to go to master, but to complain to him about anything that occurred in the field—that was before Mr. Bird—when I told Mr. Augustus Henry Bird of it he said, "You have done right, Collins, but for the future perhaps you had better inform the old <hi rend="italic">moulder</hi> Marskel," and the old <hi rend="italic">moulder</hi> said he should not be able to get the men to stop at the kiln if I got carrying tales—he said that before Mr. Henry Bird—I told Mr. Henry Bird, it was no use my speaking to Mr. Marskel, as I had done so before, and I had a life like a dog in the field in consequence—then I told him I would not work any more round the kiln for some time picking up the brickbats, filling up my time as I had done, because I was afraid, and he told me I could go on the soil hacks, as there were</p>

               <p>carts there throwing in the soil, and keep the soil levelled down, and the ashes—after I took out the summons Mr. Henry Bird told me I had no business going away from my work down to the police-court, as if I had come to him he would have made it all right, and that he would not let the men go down to the police-court, as he should not have anybody in the field to load the carts—I told Mr. Bird I did not wish to harm the men in the least, but my life had been threatened so long that I felt it insecure, and I wished them to be bound over to keep the peace, and I did not wish to go down against the men if they would promise not to molest me again—when I came out of the hospital he declined to take me back, as he said I had brought disgrace on his field and family by taking the proceedings I had—I received these three medals in the navy.</p>

Saint has been in our employ 15 years, and is what is termed head kilnman—he has always borne a good character, and my father is bail for him—he is still with us—before Collins came to us he was in the employ of the District Board of Works, Fulham—I mentioned to Saint that I thought of taking Collins, and thought he would be a good man for our business; he said he thought so too—some complaints were made about taking away a greater number of bricks than ought to have been taken out of the yard, and I inquired into it and was quite satisfied with Saint's honesty in the matter—he is usually a very quiet man—when Collins took out summonses against Saint and Davis, I told him he should have complained to me first—he had made no complaint before—it is not true that I said I would not allow any of the men to go to the police-court—my father does not attend much to the business—it is an extensive property—Saint lives in the neighbourhood of the field across the line, and has been constantly at work for the last three or four years—I have a number of my men here to-day.</p>

                  </hi>. On 24th October I was house surgeon at the West London Hospital, and was on duty when Ball brought Collins there, whom I first saw in the casualty room a few minutes after his arrival—he was lying on the sofa, and complained of being poisoned—I examined him thoroughly, and found a slight trace of froth on his moustache, saliva; I really could find no symptoms at all—I tried his respiration and powers of walking, and he did not vomit—there was nothing abnormal—he complained of certain symptoms—I admitted him into the 'hospital, and put him to bed—I gave him no medicine—the first two days I gave him liquid food-r—I gave him no emetics—he remained in the hospital, I think, from the 24th to the 29th—he then left at my suggestion—he was not in bed all that time—I saw him once about a week after—he came to me amongst the out-patients—he Was to return if symptoms of his poisoning should come on—when he came the week after, in consequence of the cold weather affecting his stump, I bandaged it with cotton wool—he does not come to me now—I am house physician now—soon after he came to the hospital I received this tin bottle—I poured some of the contents into a glass; I could hardly recollect the odour of it at the moment, but I say now it was a decided odour of phosphorus—I kept it under lock and key until it was given to Mr. Davis, the analyst—on the same day I opened this glass bottle which I received from Mr. Bird, of which I made a very slight examination; I found there was phosphorus in it—at the Hammersmith Police-court I also received this packet of powder, on which is written, "Hunter's Dewsbury Vermin Destroyer, poison"—I made no exami<lb/>nation of it; I handed it to Mr. Davis—I saw nothing given to Collins but what was given by my order, namely, warm water and milk, which is an emetic and a dilutant.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The odour from the bottle was exceedingly offensive—I smelt the man's breath, but there was no smell of sulphur—if a man had drunk three or four mouthfuls of the liquid within an hour or two of that time, I should expect to smell it—he had the milk after I saw him and after I had smelt his breath—we get a lot of poison cases—I found no symptoms of poisoning by strychnine—acetate of lead would be sold at a chemist's without an order, it not being included in the schedule to the Poisons Act—</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I saw no symptoms consistent with his having taken an irritant poison—as to the absence of symptoms being consistent, it would depend if vomiting had taken place and the dose of the poison—profuse vomiting would decrease the smell there might be, undoubtedly—Goulard water is a lotion—it would be a matter of difficulty for a person unacquainted with chemistry to extract the powder from it—the saliva I saw, I suppose, would be consistent if he had been drinking a great deal of salt-and-water.</p>

                  </hi>. I am public analyst for the Fulham district—I received this tin can from Dr. Mortimer, and subsequently the flat glass bottle and this paper packet—I analysed the contents of the tin can, namely, 28 1/2 fluid ounces of tea—I found phosphorus—I did not estimate the quantity, and acetate of lead to the extent of 147 grains—I afterwards made an examination, and found the quantity of free phosphorus to be 8.19 grains—on a subsequent examination I found strychnine, which you cannot find unless you specially analyse for it—on the first occasion I was not looking for it—the tea had been so far used by that time that I could not by analysis estimate the quantity, but I had reason to suppose that the powder, the remains of which I found in this packet, was identical with the powder in the tea, and if that were the case there would be about half a grain of strychnine in the whole quantity of tea—I examined the glass bottle, and found phosphorus and acetate of lead—I afterwards found extremely minute traces of strychnine—the inside of the bottle was coated to a greater extent than now—it had contained fluid which must have contained those elements—I endeavoured to ascertain in what form the phosphorus was present, and I concluded it was in the form of match heads, not with the wood attached—that was a microscopic and analytical examination—in the powder I found 94.3 percent of acetate of lead and some starch and blue colouring matter—the blue would be ultramarine, and innocuous—in my first examina<lb/>tion I found nothing noxious except the acetate of lead—I subsequently found strychnine—I cannot tell how much, as I had used almost all the powder in my preliminary examination—there was no phosphorus—acetate of lead in large quantities would be poisonous—phosphorus is very poisonous—it if taken as a medicine—in the tea there was probably enough poison to poison more than one person—the quantity of strychnine in it has produced death in only one recorded instance—that was not in what was left for me to examine, but arguing from another set of facts altogether.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I did not look for strychnine till the prisoner was com<lb/>mitted for trial, so that it was not mentioned at the police-court—I am told this case was postponed from last session in order to prefer a fresh indict<lb/>ment because strychnine was found—strychnine would produce contraction of the body—I believe the phosphorus in the tin can to be the same as in the bottle.</p>

About 12.30 in the morning, 16th August, I was on duty in Lower Bland Street, Borough, near the Royal Oak public-house, kept by the prisoner—I heard a cry of fire—I went to the house, and saw him with his head and part of his body out of the first-floor window, which is about 10 feet from the ground—he said "I have got a fire in my place"—after saying that he jumped out, and I caught him—he was fully dressed with his coat on his arm—he had on his collar and tie, hat, boots, and everything—I asked him if there was any one in the house—he said "No, no one, my wife and children are in the country"—I sprang my rattle, and some other constables came up—I then tried to force the front door open—the prisoner said "It is almost an impossibility to force it in, as there is a strong bolt inside"—Constable Lane got in through another door, and then opened the front door, and I went in—I saw there had been a fire.</p>

               <p>it in his possession a great many times—I have seen it in his hand, and taken it out of his hand; I think that was about seven months ago from the time my sister died; I saw it in his hand in his house, he was then living in Kennington—I saw it more recently when he lived in Pale Street; I went to tea there one day, and they had not sufficient knives, and my sister said to him, "Harry, lend Emma your knife and use your pocket-knife," and when he got it out, she winked at me, and said, "That is the knife he stabbed me with"—I said, "Is it?" she said, "Yes"—I said, "Let us look at it," and I took it in my hand and looked at it and said, "Rather a pretty handle"—I knew that she had been stabbed before—to the best of my belief this is the knife—this was about three months ago, when they were living in Dale Street.</p>

I have not been in the habit of visiting them much—my sister was married to William Gard; I don't know where he is living; I have never seen him but once—I believe my sister was occasionally given to drink—I am not living with my husband—Gard left my sister; it was not on account of her dissolute habits—I did not see her much.</p>

Jane your knife"—he did so, and she said "Jane, that is what he stabbed me in the back with"—I said "Oh, Harry, that was cruel of you; don't use a knife; if you want to do anything, use your hand, don't use a knife"—he looked at me and laughed—he used his pocket knife for his dinner.</p>

On Sunday morning, 17th November, I examined the prisoner's clothing at the station about noon, and found a quantity of what appeared to be blood on the lower part of his trousers and boots, a spot of blood on the right cuff of his coat, and blood about his fingers and the nails of his right hand—he said that he supposed it was done while he was helping the <hi rend="italic">missus</hi>, and that when coming home from Walworth Road with her she had a few words with some man about his change; that she was drunk and rather quarrelsome, and when they got to the top of Dale Street she would go no further, and he left her standing at the corner of Dale Street, where two or three men were standing on the opposite side of the Rodney Road, and went to the door of her lodging, but did not go in; he went back for her, and found her standing where he had left her, and as soon as he reached her she cried out "Oh!" and fell; that he thought it was her courses which caused the blood, and tried to get her indoors, and while doing so a policeman came up, and he had no idea how she was hurt—those were not his words exactly, but the effect of what he said when we were examining his clothes—that was said in nearly one connected statement—I asked him if he had any witness whom I should call for him—he said "No"—that was the same morning that he was in custody and before the knife was found—Mrs. Johns pointed out his room to me at 14, Dale Street; I searched it the same morning thoroughly, and much more carefully a day or two after<lb/>wards, and in Mrs. Johns's presence found a pocket knife—there were two or three very common table knives in a drawer, I think three—a knife was handed to me at the station by Inspector McKenzie—the prisoner was quite sober.</p>
