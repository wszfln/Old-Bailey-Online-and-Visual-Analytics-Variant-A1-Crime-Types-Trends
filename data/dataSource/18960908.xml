                  </hi>. I am a livery stable keeper, at St. Andrew's Pave<lb/>ment—the defendant came to me in September last year, and hired a horse and carriage—at the end of the year his liability to me was £7 10s.—he paid me that—I afterwards had an agreement with him for the hire of a carriage at fifteen guineas a week, from January 1st this year for ten hours per day, and two shillings an hour for extra hours—at the end of January his debt to me was £18 12s. 6d., and for February £19 8s. 6d.—no pay<lb/>ment was made till the end of February; he then paid £15 4s., leaving a balance of £23 owing; in March he paid several sums on account, leaving a balance of £45—he never told me that he was an undischarged bank<lb/>rupt—I did not find that out till some time after May 14th.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> In February this year I did not call at the office of the prisoner's solicitor, Mr. Watts, I do not remember doing so—I know Mr. Watts' office, but I do not remember calling there—I might have called to inquire if Hodges was there—I have seen Mr. Watts, but not to speak to him—on February 14th I went to 77, Gres<lb/>liam Street and asked for the defendant—I did not send in my account for the hiring of my brougham—I am certain of that—I did not ask Mr. Watts if he had any money of Mr. Hodges in his hands—Mr. Watts did not say that Hodges had received from him all the money that he had in his hands, and he thought I should be all right, as he had a large sum coming to him, but that I must be careful, as he had been adjudged bank<lb/>rupt</p>

               <p>—I am quite sure he never told me that—I did not reply, "Oh, yes; I have heard so"—that never took place at any time—nothing of the kind passed—I did not meet Mr. Watts with the defendant—I afterwards took civil proceeding; they were dropped, and, on the advice of my solicitor, I took criminal proceedings—I had got judgment—I never at any time heard from Mr. Watts that Hodges was an undischarged bankrupt—I recollect on one occasion going out of my office with Mr. Watts, and walking down Gresham Street in the direction of the Bank; but that was about March—I don't think I was fidgetty about Hodges til! Feb<lb/>ruary; it may have been about March; he paid me £15, and that satisfied me—he did not complain to me of Mr. Watts having told me that he was an undischarged bankrupt; nothing of the kind passed—I knew nothing about his being an undischarged bankrupt, or I should have stopped the proceedings.</p>

I am a partner in the firm of Burgoyne Watts, solicitors—I have known the defendant six or seven years, he was an insurance agent for some years—he was engaged in the promotion of companies—it was in connection with that business that he hired this brougham—he had met with a severe accident last year, and was unable to get about—he had done some business for us which brought him in £200 or £.300—on February 14th or 15th the prosecutor came to our office as I was leaving it—my clerk makes the entries in the call-book, this is it, as I had not seen it for some time—we got into con<lb/>versation—I knew that the prisoner was making money, and that he owed small sums, which I paid for him—the prosecutor said to me, "I understand you have some money in your hands belonging to Mr. Hodges"—I said, "How much does he owe you?"—he said, "£15 or £16"—I told him that he must be careful an Hodges was an undischarged bankrupt—we walked down the street together, and we met the brougham with Hodges inside we went up to him, and he said, "Mr. Watts has told you that I am an undischarged bankrupt, and I think that was very unfair"—that was said in the presence of Mr. Mudge—Hodges was not a client of mine at that time; he was some time before his bankruptcy, but not since—I am positive that it was in February that this happened.</p>

Burgoyne Watts and Co., solicitors, in Gresharm Street—it was my duty to keep the call-book, and to enter the names of callers as they arrived—this is the book; the entries fire in my handwriting—I set the name of Mudge here as calling about February 14th; that is in my handwriting—he called about 5.30—I have a note here that he was seen by Mr. F. Watts, the last witness.</p>

Thompson"—he took away the plush and the invoice—a month afterwards, in the ordinary course of business, a statement was sent in, and we discovered that Mr. Belhomme knew nothing about it—I gave a description of the person who called to Mr. Hatry and the police—on July 31st I was taken by Inspector Hobson to Jay's hat factory, South<lb/>wark—I passed through one room, in which twenty or thirty persons were working—I looked round, but saw no one I recognised—then I went into another room, in which about twenty-five people were working, and I recognised and picked out the prisoner without difficulty from among them—when I gave the piece of plush to the person who called I believed he eame from Mr. Belhomme.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had been to Messrs. Jay's before that day, and at my suggestion they had procured some of the prisoner's writing, which I compared with the writing on the receipt—I thought it would be better for Voigt to see the prisoner when he was working among a large number of people, rather than at the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> About one hundred people were working in the build<lb/>ing; I did not go into the room in which the prisoner was; I am told thirty people were working in the first room, and thirty in the second.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The letter, addressed to his father and mother, stated that he had been taken into custody on a charge of forgery; that he knew nothing about it, and that he had forgotten the name of the firm.</hi>)</p>

Where did you get it?"—he said, "I picked it up"—I told him about my making up the letter, and said, "Do you mind being searched?"—he said, "No"—nothing was found on him—he was left alone with me—I said, "What have you done with the 5s. order?"—he said, "That will be found in my tunic at home"—I said, "What have you done with the stamps?"—he said, "I tore them up"—I said, "When did you steal the letter?"—he said, "This morning."</p>

At 11.50 p.m. on August 9th I watched the prisoners in Cambridge Avenue, Kilburn—at the top of the High Road I went into a garden and took off my uniform, and got over two walls to the back of the house, No. 29—I watched Wallace go into a window—Ward walked up and down outside—I crossed the road, and lay down by the side of the wall—I saw Wallace come out of the window, and I caught hold of him—he said, "Oh!"—I asked him what he was doing—he said, "Nothing"—I said I should take him to the station—he said, "Very well, I mean to have a go for it"—he attempted to get away, and scratched my face—I was taking him down the road when I met Ward, with a man and two women—I seized Ward, and told him I should take in to the station for being concerned with a man in commit<lb/>ting</p>

I am a gardener, living at Bruce's Row, Edmonton—I know the prisoners by sight—on August 13th, when Walters got out of the prison van, in which he had been driven to the Police-court, he gave me these three papers—I cannot read—I put them in my pocket, and gave them to Jennings—Walters told me to give them to Dick French.</p>

If they ask you how long were you talking to me, say about a quarter of an hour or ten minutes, and then I went down Bounce's Lane; be careful how they go about things, and do not make any <hi rend="italic">bloomers.</hi> Tell Joe I am afraid Wood<lb/>man will split, but he can depend on me getting him out of it if possible, Mick. Drop me a bit a <hi rend="italic">snout</hi> in; if they prove this it means a <hi rend="italic">fiver;</hi> so do your best.

               <p>Riley was a builder—I had an office there—42 is the next house; that also belonged to Mr. Riley—the prisoner was a weekly tenant of those pre<lb/>mises—he carried on a butcher's business there, at the rent of 27s. a week—on July 4th, in consequence of instructions from Mr. Riley, I wrote out this paper and this envelope: "To Mr. C.

I live at 212, Kilburn Park Road—I was in the pri<lb/>soner's employ for about twelve months before July 4th at 42, North Street, assisting in the shop—I was there on July 4th all day—about ten that evening, which was a busy time, I was serving in the shop at the scales—the prisoner was outside, attending to the customers—he had a cutting<lb/>up knife in his hand—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); it is the knife he generally used; he was cutting up some meat with it—he came round the counter to me, and put an envelope in my pocket, and said, "Take care of this, Jim," and he went downstairs into the yard at the back—he was away from about three to five minutes—I was in the shop when he came back—he said, "Jim, fetch a policeman," and he went and sat down in a chair in the parlour at the back of the shop, and said, "I am done, Jim"—I noticed that he was bleeding from his forehead—a few minutes afterwards he said, "Give me that slip back, Jim"—I gave it him—I did not see what he did with it—very shortly afterwards a policeman came in, and the prisoner was taken away—I had not noticed the knife that evening—I saw the prisoner using it all that evening outside—I did not notice the handle; he wooden part of it was broken on one side, chopped—he always put something round it, to keep it together; twisted some string round it—I have seen it used at times in the shop—I had not noticed anything wrapped round it; a piece of cloth is round it now, such as the meat is wrapped in.</p>

               <p>

Shortly after ten on Saturday night, July 4th, I received information, and went with Dr. Miller, the divisional surgeon, to North Street—just this side of No. 40 I met the prisoner, accompanied by Nutt, who, in the prisoner's presence, said, "The man and woman have been murdered at 40, North Street, and I am taking this man to the station"—Ihe prisoner said, "That is right, sir"—I directed him to be taken to the station, and went with the doctor to the house—I went in at the front door, and went down to the basement—at the foot of the steps, on the floor, outside the front-room door, I saw a vast quantity of blood; there was also blood on the door-post and on the walls—I went into the back kitchen, and there I saw the dead bodies of a man and woman lying side by side—I examined them with the doctor—both bodies had been stabbed—I examined the front kitchen to see if there had been a struggle there—I saw no signs of a struggle—just inside the front door there was a pool of blood, and from there I traced droppings of blood to the fireplace of that room; there they ended in a small pool of blood to the left of the fender, the side nearest the chest of drawers—I then traced the droppings back to the door of the front kitchen—those two droppings of blood were distinct—I went again into the kitchen, and standing up against the wall I found this poker and rake—I searched the house par<lb/>ticularly, looking for traces of a struggle, but found none—after that I went out to the prisoner's house next door, No. 42—I entered by the back—the yard is common to both houses—I went up the two steps to the ground floor, which is on a level with the street, and in a corner immediately beside the parlour door in the passage I found this large butcher's knife—Dr. Miller was with me when I found it; this piece of cloth was wrapped round the handle—the knife was covered with wet blood—I then returned to King's Cross-station, taking the things with me—I saw the prisoner in the charge-room, and said to him, "Mr. and Mrs. Riley</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical man, practising at 57, Caledonian Road—a little after ten on the night of July 4th I was called to 40, North Street—I went to the foot of the stairs leading from the shop to the basement—I saw a pool of blood in the passage, extending about a yard to the doorway of the front kitchen; I noticed two bodies lying in the doorway—Mrs. Riley was lying on her face, with her head near to the door-post, and the body of Mr. Riley was lying on its back, with his head and shoulders turned over slightly to the right—his right thigh was lying across the woman's right shoulder—They were both dead—the poker and rake were lying between the two bodies—one end of the poker stood against the door-post, and the poker itself lay over the woman's shoulder; one end of the rake rested against the door-post on my right, and was across over her shoulder—the bodies were afterwards moved into the back kitchen—subsequently, with Dr. Miller, I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—on the man's body I found eight separate wounds; one was a scalp wound on the left side of the back of the head, commencing about half an inch above the ear, and extending horizontally backward about three inches, cutting fight down to the bone; it was an incised wound—such a wound would have bled very freely—on the left side of the neck there were two wounds; one a punctured wound, about two inches deep and an inch and a-half long, and dividing the internal jugular vein; the other was a similar wound, on the same side of the neck, about an inch lower, an inch and a-half long, and two inches, or a little more, in depth, penetrating to the spine, and also severing the internal jugular vein—there was a similar wound on the left side of the breast, about an inch and a-half in length, or scarcely so long, about an inch and a-half from the margin of the breast bone about an inch and a-half in width, penetrating through the first left intercostal space between the first and second ribs, penetrating the subclavial under the arm; and there was another similar wound in the abdomen, a transverse wound, about an inch above the anterior side of the spine, almost on a level with the navel; that was a punctured around right through the abdominal wall to the intestines; it was such a wound as would be made by a butcher's knife—there was a similar</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189609080029"/>
               <p>wound in the left thigh, about an inch below the groin, penetrating up-wards and inwards, and dividing the femoral vein—there were also two incised wounds, one on each thumb, just across the outer side of the thumb, down to the bone, about three-quarters of an inch in length—all these wounds could have been caused by the same instrument, such as the knife produced—the wound in the neck penetrating to the spine would have caused death rapidly, certainly in two or three minutes; both those wounds in the neck were almost equally fatal; both divided the internal jugular vein—the wound in the abdomen was a fatal wound, though not so immediately fatal—the wound in the thigh was also a very fatal wound, but not so immediately fatal; death would have happened after such a wound—after the wound on the scalp the person would be able to move about he would be able to move a limb, but not to walk, after either of the other wounds—I also examined the body of the woman—I found on her four separate wounds—the character of each of those Bounds was similar to those on the man, evidently having been inflicted with the game instrument—there was an incised punctured wound on the left side of her neck, about an inch and a-half in length, and two inches in depth, penetrating the internal jugular vain; another slighter wound in the neck fat under the chin, down to the angle of the jaw; also a wound in the chest piercing the left ventricle of the heart; that was about two inches from the left margin of the sternum, extending upwards and inwards, about an inch and a half in length, and also piercing the ascending aorta to the extent of three-quarters of an inch—the fourth wound was a deep incised one on the palm of the left hand, from two to three and a-half inches down to the bone—the wound in the neck was rapidly fatal; in two or three minutes, perhaps—the wound penetrating the heart would have been immediately fatal; the person receiving that wound would not be able to move in the least; she would fall at once—the man, after aving fallen, might have turned over—the position of his legs gave that idea—the cuts on his thumbs were most likely to have been caused by the butcher's knife sliding along the poker, or rake—in my opinion, the hand was grasping the poker; the wounds on each thumb were identically in the same position; being pierced and carried along the poker, or rake—I did not notice the two tracks of blood from the front kitchen door—I should say the woman died first.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was examined before the Coroner and before the Magistrate, and on the last occasion here—I have not before to-day started the theory of the man holding up the poker in one hand and the rake in the other—if the poker was grasped by both hands the wounds would not have been in that position; one blow would not have cut both hands—the poker was very slightly bent—either the poker or rake if used with sufficient force, would have caused the wound on the skull—the height of the man was six feet, and his weight wa, about fourteen stone—all the wounds on both bodies were in front; they were facing each other.</p>

               <p>

                  </hi>. I live at 210, Gray's Inn Road, and travel in grocery—on July 27th I called on Mr. Osler, a customer, of 3, Matilda Place, Cripplegate, and in consequence of what I was told I went to No. 5—a sewing machine was pointed out to me—I did not take it away then—I called again on the 29th, and saw it in a room on the third floor, and paid 30s. to Mr. Osler; that was all the money I had—it is rather a small house, and appeared to be let out in tenements—I saw a man besides Osler and Bendon's wife; she was present at the conversation between me and Osler; she was in the room when I arrived—she did not see me pay any money—on August 2nd I went to 3, Matilda Place, and saw Osler and the two prisoners; he is a mineral water manu<lb/>facturer—I paid him the balance, £1, and then said, "Have you got the receipt from the company?"—he said, "No, I have not got it now"—I had done business with him before—I said, "You look here, Osler; if you are not acting straight with me I shall punish you"—Bendon said, "I have known Mr. Osler fifteen years, and have not known him to do anything but what was straight; this is the young man it belongs to,"pointing to Turner—I said to Turner, "Have you got the receipt?"—he said, "I have not got it here"—I said, "Give it to Osler before next Wednesday"—I call on Wednes<lb/>days as traveller—Osler said to Bendon, "Hand him the sovereign; I owe you 12s.," and gave him the sovereign, and he gave him 8s. change—I then went away—I called at Osler's on the Wednesday, and he handed me this receipt: "Mr. Turner, 21, High Street, one sewing machine, £3 10s."—the prisoners were not there—in consequence of that I went to 21, High Street; it is a sausage-shop—I called on the following Thursday—I did not see Osler, but Bendon was opposite his house, watching me—I saw his daughter—it is a very narrow turning; No. 3 is opposite No. 5—he said, "Would you mind giving me your name and address?"—I said, "My name in Hardy; I live at 210, Gray's Inn Road; why do you ask?"—he said, "There is a new shop going to be opened in Sidney Street, and Mr. Osler told me he sold sugar, and you might do some business there; the name is Plunkett, and you must tell Mrs. Plunkett you are recommended by a man who sold pickles"—that was the first time I saw him—I was told that the receipt would be forthcoming on Wednesday, and then I went to make inquiries, and saw Bendon; I did not know that he had anything to do with the shop—I did not know that he was present when the order was given and the machine delivered—I never knew his name.</p>

Lavender, 11<hi rend="smallCaps">A</hi>, Wormwood Street"—I called there, but Lavender was out, and then I wrote and received this answer from him. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he had been dealing with Dear for a con-siderable time, and that he was a most respectable man, fully able to pay the rent. The letter enclosed a card, "H.

Henderson and W. Dear, on the office door—Henderson's name was in paper letters, I think—Dear told me Henderson was a friend he had known for a number of years, and that he wished to address his letters there, and he let him do so—I saw Lavender at the office; neither he nor Dear said who he was.</p>

I manage the poultry department upon our farm, Burton Grange, Northamptonshire—in the early part of this year I adver<lb/>tised in the <hi rend="italic">Bazaar, Excltange and Mart</hi>—I received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was headed</hi> "11, <hi rend="italic">Wormwood Street, English and Foreign Produce and Pro<lb/>vision Stores, T. Lavender"; and requested twelve dozen eggs to be sent as a sample, and asked for information as to prices and the quantity that could be supplied per week.</hi>) I believed a genuine business was being carried on at that address by that person, and supplied him with the eggs—on April 19th I received this letter, enclosing a French draft for 187f. 50c.—my brother took that draft to the bank; it was afterwards returned unpaid, and we had to pay expenses—the draft was drawn by Sebar Baring and Co.—we did not supply goods after the return of the draftr—on March 10th, 1896, I received this letter from Lavender. (<hi rend="italic">This asked her, as fa was starting on business for the Continent to consign all goods for him to Hen<lb/>derson and Co., of 11, Paternoster Square, whom he had entrusted with his business during his absence. A letter was also read of March 12th, from T. Henderson and Co., merchants and importers, of</hi> 11, <hi rend="italic">Pater-noster Square, to the witness, stating that they had taken over Lavender's contract, and that all goods must be forwarded direct to them</hi>). I believed T. Henderson and Co. were a genuine firm, and continued to supply goods to them—on March 21st I received this letter, enclosing this bill from them. (<hi rend="italic">This letter stated that they had communicated with Lavender, and awaited his reply, and that, in the meantime, they enclosed a draft for</hi> £10.) That draft was drawn by Sebar Baring—my brother passed it through his bank; it was returned unpaid, and we had expenses to pay—I received these letters on April 2nd and 4th. (<hi rend="italic">The first acknowledged the receipt of a letter, and stated that they had wired to Lavender, who was still away giving him notice of the return of the £10 draft. The second referred to the unpaid draft, and enclosed shares in a Bel<lb/>gian tramway, and in oil wells in Roumania.</hi>) I also received this letter, offering to send £1 at once and £2 monthly until final settlement—I think my brother had begun by this time to write—I then received these two letters from S. Baring, 155, Whitecross Street. (<hi rend="italic">The first stated that, in accordance with instructions from Henderson, he had returned two empty boxes, carriage paid; that he was expecting a further delivery of eggs from Henderson, and as his customers would be waiting for eggs, he wished to know if twenty-four dozen would be sent next day. The second, dated May 2nd, stated that as Henderson's had not carried out their contract, he must claim damages; that he wanted more eggs next week, and that they could have a cheque on account if they wanted money.</hi>) I had nothing to do with suing Henderson in the County Court—I was never paid.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman and contractor, of the Westminster Bridge Road—in October and November, last year, I was employed to take bacon, ham, butter, and eggs from 98, Westminster Bridge Road to Mr. Freeman, a salesman at Central Meat Market, by Bock—I knew him by that name—sometimes I took nearly one ton, at other times half a ton, or fourteen, fifteen, or seven hundredweight—after a time I refused to work for Bock any longer.</p>

I am a salesman in the Central Meat Market—I did business for a person or persons trading at 98, West<lb/>minster Bridge Road, about twelve months ago—Williams called and asked us if we would dispose of provisions for him—Bock looks like Williams; he is slightly altered in some respects, but I should say he is the man—we sold for him five or six hundred weight of margarine at a time, and perhaps a couple or three bales of bacon, and a few hams—we sell wholesale by contract, with no limit, for what the things will fetch—we do not keep goods on hand, but clear out daily, or if not one day we do the next—in consequence of the nature of the transactions I had with Bock, who I imagine is Williams, I communicated with the police, but I heard nothing from them, and so I went on selling for him, and the money I received I handed to Williams.</p>

Lavender, 2s. 6d. for rent of back office, 4, Great Arthur Street"—I found keys on Lavender—on going back to 4, Great Arthur Street I told Bock that on searching Lavender I had found this receipt, signed "Bock," and I asked him if it was his writing—he said it was—I said, "To whom did you give it?"—he said, "I did not give it to the man you took away"—I said, "It was made out in his name"—he said, "I gave it to a dark man with a dark moustache"—I said, "Where has he gone to?"—he did not know—I said, "Where is his office? I will go and have a look at it"—he said he could not get in—I said I could; I had the key—I opened the door with the key I found on Lavender, and I found in the office five 28 lb. tins and seven 1 lb. tins of glue, and several other jars and things—the name on the door was J. Castell—I said, "I believe this to be this man's office; who do these things belong to?"—he said, "They belong to me"—I said, "Where did you get them from?"—he said, "I bought them at Joseph's, at Ball's Pond Road, under the hammer, about five months ago, a job lot"—I locked up the office, and went further through the letters, and on the Monday I went back to the office, and said, from inquiries I had made, I believed it to be Lavender's office, and I should take the glue away—he said again he bought the glue from Joseph, and he took a note of what I took away, and said, "I shall soon have them back"—I saw in his own office on the top floor five 28 lb. tins—I left those there, but took away the five tins from Lavender's office—on July 7th I obtained a warrant for Dear—I first had a conversation</p>

I am a fitter and turner, living at 259, Kenning<lb/>ton Road, Lambeth—on Saturday, August 8th, I was going along the Finborough Road; I saw a crowd—I went up to it and saw Matthews lying in the road—I helped to carry him to the Jubilee Hospital—on the way I asked the prisoner how it happened—he said they were going to fight for a half-crown, and "I hit him; I did not think it would turn out like this"—at the hospital I heard the house-surgeon ask him the same question—he made the same answer—he described where he hit him—he said he had hit him once between the eye and the nose.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner assisted me on the way to the hospital—I did not hear him say he did not wish to fight—he said in the hospital the deceased was pressing him, and he did not want to fight him, but his temper came over him, and he hit him—I do not remember his saying the deceased was pressing him to fight, nor that he avoided the deceased for some time—I called again at the hospital to see how he was getting on—that was the Tuesday following the accident.</p>

About 3.30 on August 8th, I received information, in consequenca of which I went to the Jubilee Hospital—outside the hospital I saw and said to the prisoner, "Do you know anything about this man who has been assaulted?"—he said, "Yes, sir, I did it; we were going to fight for half-a-crown; I knocked him down"—I took him into the hospital, and afterwards to the police station—he was there charged with assault—when I took him he said on the way to the station, "All right, sir, do not handle me; I will go with you."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He also said, "I am very sorry'—I asked him no<lb/>questions—I did not take a great deal of notice of what he was really saying—he did say they were quarrelling a little time before this-happened—he used the expression "Quarrelling," or something similar, I could not recollect the exact words—he said the deceased used offensive language; he wanted to fight him, but he did not want to; not that he tried to avoid fighting him—he did not attempt to escape or run away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner and house-surgeon at the Jubilee Hospital—on August 8th, about 3.30, I saw Matthews brought there—J examined him—he was in an uncon<lb/>scious state, due to concussion of the brain—he had a small scalp wound on the back of the head; it was bleeding very profusely—the nasal bone of his nose was broken, and his nose was bleeding profusely—his left leg was also injured about the ankle, probably a sprain—on the follow<lb/>ing day the eyes became black—he remained in an unconscious state till August 11th, when he was transferred to St. George's Hospital, at the wish of his employer—that was after a certificate by another doctor—I protested against the removal—he was not in a fit state to be removed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It would require very great force to break the nose—I heard Dr. Blackitt's evidence—the deceased did not leave the hospital in a conscious condition—in the hospital he shouted for water—he could not recognise his friends—he did not show signs of concussion of the brain—the treatment I would adopt would be absolute rest—he was not kept in a dark room—he had no ice or cold wraps to his head—his treatment was in abeyance during his removal—I did not know of compression of the brain—I heard of the report of the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> ex<lb/>amination being made—a fracture at the base of the skull is fatal, not always, but as a rule—a man could not go about with a fracture at the base of the skull; he might if he had recovered—laceration of the brain is consistent with recovery—so, possibly, is laceration of the in<lb/>terior part of the right frontal lobe—whether it is fatal depends upon its state, the extent of laceration, and its position—it is not invariably fatal—a clot on the brain might cause compression; it depends upon the part of depression—a clot found on the right side of the brain would cause compression if it was large enough—the prisoner came in with the patient—he said he had struck the deceased, that it was a fight—I did not pay much attention to his statement—he told me how he was struck, and that he fell on the pavement—he said he tried to avoid fighting—he made a long statement; that the patient wanted to fight, and he struck a blow in self-defence, as he did not want to get the first blow—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189609080061"/>
               <p>the signs of fracture on the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination would be due to falling on the road, not to the blow, except the blow on the nose—it was not certain there was a fracture of the crown, which is sometimes not very prominent, and there was no bleeding from the hair; we could only suspect it till the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—assuming effusion of blood on the right side of the brain, an extensive fracture at the base of the skull on the left side which exposed the bone downwards to the cranium, extending on the other side to the right temple bone, laceration at the base of the brain and the interior part of the right frontal lobe, I should think death would be the only result—it would be hardly possible for the patient to survive—compression and concussion may co<lb/>exist.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical practitioner, and one of the house-surgeons at St. George's Hospital—Matthews was brought to the hospital about 8.30 p.m. on August 11th—when I first saw him in the surgery he was in a semi-conscious condition, and answered to his name—he was taken to the accident ward, where I examined him—he had a slight scalp wound at the back of the head, bruising on both eye<lb/>lids, extensive bruising on the left leg, extending from the knee to the ankle—he became unconscious, and remained so till he died on August 16th, about 8.10 a.m.—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—on opening the skull there was found to be an effusion of blood over the right side of the brain—on moving the brain there was found to be laceration at the base of the brain, with effusion of blood, also laceration of the interior frontal lobe of the right side—on examining the bones of the skull there was found to be an extensive fracture extending from about the middle of the left half of the occipital bone, running down-wards towards the foramen of the cranium, and extending on the right side from the foramen of the cranium upwards to the right temporal bone—there was also found to be a fracture of the nasal bones, and slight disease of the aorta, not dangerous to life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The deceased was not suffering from compression when he arrived—he seemed to be recovering from compression or a shaking up of the brain—compression is due to pressure on the brain, under which the patient lapses into a state of coma—it is usually fatal—I said before the Magistrate I did not think the removal was wise—I think so still—the bleeding that I found would be from the lacerated portions—I think it must have occurred at the time of the accident—probably not the whole—symptoms of compression manifested themselves about two hours after he arrived—Dr. Soluble made <hi rend="italic">foe post-mortem</hi> examination; we do not make our own, but we are present when they are made—a fracture at the base of the skull is not jinvariably fatal—laceration at the base of the skull, such as this man had, would be fatal—the immediate cause of death was compression of the brain, due to bleeding from laceration and the fracture at the base of the skull—the fracture was semi-circular—not a V, but a U shape—a fall on that portion would account for the fracture and the laceration, and consequent compression from the bleeding parts, which caused death—the fracture of the nasal bones did not contribute towards his death.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I do not think the removal made any difference—after the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, I think there could have been no other result but death.</p>

He has stabbed me! he has stabbed me!"—I ran upstairs, and saw my daughter in the passage, bleeding from the left arm and the right chest—there was a light—candles were on the bedroom mantelpiece—I went downstairs with her—the prisoner came down a minute or two after wards—he stopped at the bottom of the stairs, and in a second flew to the area door to get out—my husband rushed to stop him—the prisoner passed the breakfast-room, where my daughter was—that was the room where I had first seen him—my husband and the prisoner fell to the ground,</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of the last witness, and live with my parents—I was engaged to, and kept company with, the prisoner since last Easter—I merely walked out with, him—I have known him about a year—I was first introduced to him by my brother—I wrote and posted this letter to him on August 22nd—that evening, about 8.45, my mother came to me upstairs, went down, and returned to me—we had a conversation in my mother's bedroom—the prisoner came to the door and pushed his way in—I pushed on the opposite side—mother was on the mat outside the door—the prisoner said, "Do not let us quarrel"—he sat down at the foot of my mother's bed—I asked him why he had come into the bedroom, but he did not answer me—I asked him if he had received a letter from me—he said he had—I said I had told him in that letter all I wanted to say, and asked, "What do you want here?"—then blew the candle out on the mantelpiece—then I was stabbed in the right chest—he was sitting at the foot of the bed when I blew the candle out—then he stabbed me twice in the left arm—I was between the bed and the mantelshelf—I had this blouse on (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he allowed me to pass him—I had seen nothing in his hand—I screamed out, "Oh, mother, he has stabbed me!"—the prisoner was still in the bedroom—I walked past him, went downstairs, and locked myself in the lower room, the breakfast-room—mother met me on the stairs, and we went in together.</p>

I daresay you think it unkind of me; but I must tell you that I do not seem as if I can make myself take to you. I do not know why, for you have treated me with great respect in every way. You must have seen this, I think, because you have remarked, once or twice, you did not think I cared for you. It is my duty to tell you before letting it go too far, or going for a holiday. I hope you will thoroughly enjoy yourself, and I hope to mine. You would think me very cruel if we had gone for a holiday, and to have told you afterwards. That would have been very paltry On Wednesday I did it for the purpose, when we missed catching each other; I did" not want to see you. It may be wrong, but I cannot help it. It is not that there is anyone else on the scene. No such thing. But I cannot seem to settle to anyone lately. I may write again in a day or two, but no more at present. From L. S."—it is true he treated me with the greatest respect, and had been very affectionate—there was no personal objection to him; nothing in his conduct—I thought he would be upset when I wrote, and that an interview would be painful—I said at the Police-station the meeting would be unpleasant—I closed the door be<lb/>cause</p>

L. and M.," and said that he found them among the ruins after the fire—a little later on he handed me this stock-book and sale-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked if he kept any books which, would verify his claim—he said that in order to conduct his business in London as well, he always kept duplicate books, and kept a check on his brother—those books contain entries which purport to relate to scenery similar to this in the claim—I have examined the claim with the receipt—I have not examined the first nineteen items—the nextitem, "New dio<lb/>rama, 'Round the World,' "corresponds, and so do the words, "act drop," "wood scene," "chamber scene"—on, I think, May 19th, 1894, I went to Brighton, and met the younger prisoner—it is one of the arches which opens on the beach—Madeira Road runs along the arches—I asked him if he was Mr. Batchelor's brother; he said, "Yes"—I said, "You are older than he is"—he said, "Yes; I am his elder brother; I manage for my younger brother"—I asked if he could tell me anything about Shepherd's receipt; he said that he himself conducted the transaction—I asked him where Shepherd was to be found; he said that, in all probability, we should find him in some of the restaurants; I went to three</p>

Batchelor," and in the same writing; it says, "I have made inquiries for Shaw, Shepherd, and Baker"—I made inquiries, but could not find any of those persons, and, in consequence of my report, the office resisted the claim—I was present at the arbitration, when David gave evidence, and saw the elder prisoner in the room the first time; he was described as the father of the younger one; he spoke of him as his father, and said that he spoke of him as his brother because his father did not wish to be known, as he had some legal proceedings—the Arbitrator stopped the case a whole afternoon, and gave him the next day to produce his father—I heard him state that the documents were in his father's writing, and that his father was going to be called—the case was adjourned in the after<lb/>noon, and the whole of the next day given for the father to be produced—the father was called, but did not answer, and he never did attend—I can speak to this photograph being correct.</p>

The younger prisoner handed me these receipts in London; I never saw him in Brighton—he did not hand me any receipts in a sealed envelope; I will swear that they were in an envelope directed to me—he told me that his brother, who managed the business at Brighton, would answer any questions with regard to the claim—I cannot say whether he said, "I found them among the ruins," or" They were found"—he did not say that his brother had sent them to be handed to me—I saw that they were partly consumed by fire—I remember, on the hearing, the younger prisoner's attention being called to some receipts from Shepherd; he was asked about that at the ex<lb/>amination, and I think he said that it was referred to at the arbitra<lb/>tion—he used to advertise, in various names, in the <hi rend="italic">Exchange and Mart,</hi> and other papers—he said that the editor objected to answer advertise<lb/>ments under the heading "Private," and to prevent it being supposed that he was in trade, to advertise in various names, and the advertiser if he continually advertised in the same name, would think he was in the trade, and would not deal with him—I remember Shaw's receipt; he stated at the hearing that he had been in partnership once with Shaw in Culmore Road, and that it was dissolved three or four years before, and that Shaw had destroyed all the stationery they had, which was headed "Shaw"—I never heard that till I was at the Police-court—with regard to all these documents, Mr. Woodhill represented the company—I remember Shaw's receipt for £100, but not that one of the prisoners as Leslie had the payment for these goods for a small sum; I was ordered out of Court—I did not hear the elder prisoner questioned before the Arbitrator as to whom Leslie was, and hear him say that he knew nothing about the transactions of the diorama at all—the correspondence between Leslie and Bailey about the diorama was put to him, and he said he did not know, and that he saw the letters for the first time.</p>

I am a member of the firm of Boulton, Sons, and Sandeman, solicitors, of 21, Northampton Square, Clerkenwell—the firm has been in existence since the commencement of the century, I think—in 1893 Mr. George Boulton was senior partner in the firm—his deceased brother's (Mr. Frank Boulton) widow is Mrs. Emma Boulton, who has a daughter, Miss Frances Boulton—she was a ward in Court, and her mother was her guardian, but Mr. George Boulton acted <hi rend="italic">in loco parentis</hi>—in the year 1890 the prisoner's conduct was brought to my atten<lb/>tion, and, on information that was given to me, I wrote to him, and I also wrote in February, 1891, to him—after that I received from time to time a number of letters, and a large number of letters from the prisoner, and about twenty pamphlets were brought to my attention—at this time Mr. George Boulton was Mayor of Eastbourne—our firm are solicitors to Clerkenwell Vestry—that was an appointment held by the firm—in</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This letter contained the passage:</hi> "As Mr. George B., as and for his firm, published two forged letters to me of Miss E. F. B.'s honoured name of dates July 20th and September 11th, 1892, and as he knew when he published these letters Jjthat they were certainly lies, if not forgeries of Miss E. F, B.'s fair hand, I certainly decline to meet Mr. George B. in the manner his lettei indicates." <hi rend="italic">The letter further stated that he would meet Miss B. in the presence of two clergymen, whom he named, if they consented; asked whether Mr. George B. and Mr. James B. were still members of the firm, and whether the firm still acted for Mrs. Emma Boulton, and concluded with the postscript:</hi> "The letters referrred to were forged, to pervert the course of justice. Will Mr. George B. say from whom he received them?—L. C.") On receipt of that letter, I took the advice of Counsel (I had previously taken the advice of Chancery Counsel), and a summons was taken out at Clorkenwell Police-court for criminal libel, and the case came on before the Magistrate—the prisoner was represented by Messrs. Boulton and Co., and by Mr. Besley, the Counsel—the case was committed for trial to this Court, and a true bill was returned on October 16th, and the trial was fixed to take place on October 21st, but the prisoner did not surrender to take his trial—after that I received a number of communications and pamphlets from him from Boulogne, through 1894, 1895, and 1896—I received this letter of July 29th, 1894, from Boulogne. (<hi rend="italic">This informed them, in order that they might have no difficulty in proving publication, that he wrote and published the pamphlets,</hi> "<hi rend="italic">Honour Proclaimed," and "My Lady's Honour," and they might be included in the indictment particularly as they said the first was libel on Mr. George Boulton, and the second was like the first, and that he was making arrangements to surrender at the September Sessions, and should require Mrs. Emma Boulton and Miss Boulton as witnesses in regard to Miss Boulton's alleged letters of July 20th and Sep<lb/>tember</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1892, <hi rend="italic">and in regard to other parts of the alleged libel.</hi>) I re<lb/>ceived, among the other pamphlets, these: "Oliver for Roland," and "Forgery on the Court of Chancery"—this letter of August 29th, 1894, is in the prisoner's writing—from 1893 down to the other day a warrant was in existence, and in the hands of Inspector Leach; the prisoner was arrested at Dover, and brought to London.</p>

I was on duty in Seven Dials at 10.15 p.m. on September 5th, when I heard a police whistle, and went to 20, Empress Chambers—on the ground floor I saw Doyle holding the prisoner down between two beds—he gave the prisoner in charge for breaking and entering the house—the glass was broken, and had fallen inside—the prisoner made no reply—he was taken to the station—I went back to examine the room, and saw Doyle pick up this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> under the bed—I examined the frame of the window on the west side of the room, which had very distinct marks, corresponding exactly with this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>—I took it back to the station, and told the prisoner the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> was found in the room where he was arrested—he said, "Perhaps it might be; it does not belong to me"—he was then charged with breaking and entering the dwelling-house, and attempting to steal—he said, "I fell through the window, going to the w.c."—I examined the yard, and took two measurements on two occasions—it would be impossible for a man going to the w.c. to fall through the window—it is between nine and ten feet from the w.c., and anyone going there would not go near the window—I searched the prisoner, and found a metal ticket No. 53 and a chain, with two keys attached—he said the keys belonged to his locker, and that he lodged there sometimes—I went back, and found this key fitted a locker.</p>

He threw a knife on the ground, and said, "I have cut a man's throat; I intended doing for him, I give myself up.' "The prisoner immediately said, "That is right, sir; "and added," They have been on to me for a long time, but I have done it, now; I have put up with it for two years, but cannot put up with it any longer: two of them were kicking me, and I just waited on this one, and I am quite willing to die."

                  </hi>. I am Divisional Surgeon to the <hi rend="italic">H</hi> Division, and practise in the Commercial Road—on August 10th, between 4.30 and 5 a.m., I saw the body of Ned White at the Wapping Police-station—shortly afterwards I saw the prisoner at Shad well Police-station—I saw blood-stains on his clothing, and pointed them out to the Inspector—the prisoner said, "Oh, that is from my nose"—I called the Inspector's attention to the fact that the prisoner's nose would not bleed on to the back of his shoulder—the prisoner said, "Oh, that is his blood"—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of White's body—I found nine external wounds, such as would have been caused by the knife pro<lb/>duced—one was a compound wound, so there were ten in all—on the upper and posterior part of the head was an incised wound, three and a-half inches in length, penetrating to the bone, and going into the super<lb/>ficial portion of the bone—beneath that was another wound, of trivial character, about half an inch in length, which did not penetrate the bone—at the centre of the posterior margin of the ear there was an incised wound of about half an inch, extending to the scalp—on the left side of the throat was a superficial incised wound, half an inch in length—at the back of the upper part of the neck, drawing a horizontal line through the skin to the vertebrae, about three inches from the centre of the spine on the left side, there was a punctured wound, four inches in depth, chipping off the upper margin of the second vertebrae, entering the spinal column, and severing the spinal cord and the vertical artery—within the external orifice of this wound was another punctured wound, which took a direction towards the left angle of the jaw, and taking a line from the top of the second vertebrae, and three inches of the spine horizontally, chipping the upper margin, entering the spinal cord, cutting everything in its course—three-quarters of an inch beneath that was another punctured wound extending to, but not penetrating, the spine; on the left part of the left shoulder blade was an incised wound, two and a-half inches in length, penetrating to the bone, and horizontally towards the centre; about an inch from the lower margin of the breast-bone was a punctured wound extending upwards, about an inch on the superficial surface of the breast-bone—the breast-bone is hard, and merely covered by the skin—it simply cut the skin; on the second joint of the index finger of the left hand was an incised wound—I examined the deceased's clothing and found cuts corresponding to the wounds. (<hi rend="italic">Ths wit<lb/>ness pointed out these cuts on the shirt and waistcoat produced.</hi>) From</p>

               <p>the position of the fatal wound on the back of the neck, the deceased must have been on the ground when it was inflicted—death from it would be instantaneous—the second part of the compound wound was also fatal; also that which goes towards the jaw—the wound beneath it was dangerous, but not necessarily fatal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> That the fatal wound on the neck was inflicted when I the deceased was on the ground is my very strong opinion—it would de<lb/>pend upon the position of his head when lying on his back—the evidence that he did not move does not alter my opinion—if the wound had been inflicted while deceased was standing we should have found a quantity of blood down the back of the clothing, which we did not—the height of the deceased was five feet ten inches, considerably taller than the prisoner—if the two men were grappling face to face the wounds would have taken a different direction—the wound entering the spinal column could not have been inflicted without some opposing force—it would not have chipped off the upper margin of the vertebrae—the wound to the scalp was tranverse—it might have been caused by drawing the knife across the top of the scalp with great force when the men were grappling together—the wound was more probably inflicted on the ground—it is improbable the man would fall absolutely on the broad of his back—he may have fallen on his back, and his head rolled to one side—there was a small dark line on the back of his head, and there was a clean cut wound with some contusion—it could have been inflicted on the ground if the deceased's head turned to the right, about a third of the way—I think the wounds were inflicted in rapid succession—the horizontal direction would depend upon the force, and probably on the rapidity, of the blows—the ground supplied the sufficient resisting medium—the wounds would Lot have gone through when deceased was on the ground, because they were checked by the opposite side of the spinal column—one wound would have gone through if it had penetrated the angle of the jaw, but it did not—I form my opinion from the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination; and from what I saw when I examined the body superficially, before I heard the eye<lb/>witness—that opinion has not been shaken by his evidence—the man would have had to stoop considerably to inflict three of the wounds—that would not materially reduce his striking power—I should not expect in that case to find vertical and nob horizontal wounds; if he had been standing I should, but the wounds were at right angles to the ground—on examining the wounds at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem I</hi> could plainly see, from their direction, where one would have to be to inflict them—I have not experimentally tested the position in such a case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If the man had been in an upright position we should have found a quantity of blood down the back of the dead man, instead of, as it was, in the region of the neck—the back portion of his clothing was comparatively free from blood—if the wounds had been inflicted by prisoner grappling I should have expected to find a quantity of blood on him, about the sleeves, and so on, where it was very slight, and there was none about the wrist of his coat—as to the wound on the left shoulder, the deceased might have partially turned—possibly he was standing, but if standing I should have expected blood to run down inside the clothing, which it did not do; the lower portion of the clothing was free from blood; in fact it trickled towards the neck again.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I select the two fatal wounds as being inflicted on the ground; the others might have been inflicted on the ground—I say so from the resisting force required to make the deep wounds—I do not think being grappled by a stoutish man would have constituted sufficient resisting force to account for those two wounds, but I would not like to swear it, because he could hold the deceased by the arm or grapple him by the neck if he was a strong man.</p>

Hamilton Russell—he showed me a photo<lb/>graph of Lord Boyne, who he said was his father, but as he had married, his father would not acknowledge him—I left the Bond Street Institu<lb/>tion, but he continued to write to me—in August I went to nurse a patient at Dover, and corresponded with him, and when I came up to London he met me at the station—I engaged myself to marry him at my brother's at Leicester, believing he was Hamilton Russell—he said that he was very well off, and that he was a director in Simpkin and Marshall's, and had money there—these letters are in his writing; I received them from him when I was in Leicester; they are dated November—I believed that he had an appointment as a director at Simpkin and Marshall's—we both lodged in Kepple Street—I brought £25 with me, and he said he was short of money, and asked me to lend him some, as he did not want to keep drawing out capital—I gave him £39 altogether—I stopped at Kepple Street three weeks, and then moved to 27, Regent Square, where I am now—he always paid that he was short of money, and in February he had £58.</p>

I asked him why he did not attend to his duties as managing director—I really believed he was the son of Lord Boyne—his name would be in the Peerage—at the time he was managing director, the future Peeress, myself, was nursing at Wimpole Street—when I came back from njy brother's at Leicester I went to stay at the Bedford Hotel—it was at his suggestion that I went to my brother's, because it was not right for he and I to live in one house—I did not agree with my sister-in-law, but I did not write to him that I was not comfortable and wished to come back—he did not say that he was hard up—I never asked him what his salary was with Simpkin and Marshall, as he said that he was doing it honorarily, because it would degrade his father—I said before the Magistrate, "We both stayed in one house while there; the prisoner was hard up for money; the landlady there was Madame Lavaune; the prisoner always used to pay the bills for both of us; sometimes lie gave me money to buy provisions for the house"—when I handed the £5 I may have said, "I wish it was £1,000."</p>

(<hi rend="italic">One of these letters statedthat the case was taken out of the hands of the solicitor and put into the County Court, and proposed terms. Another letter, signed "H. J.

Benabo was present when Coles wrote them; he dictated them—on the morning of July 4th I called at Benabo's office, and saw him in Coles' presence—he said that he should have to send my clerk up to the High Court to stop the action, which would cost a guinea and a-half—I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and Coles 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., believing that it would stop the action—Benabo put his hand in his pocket and took out a sovereign and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and Coles went away—Benabo said, "You go to the Law Courts, and take the summons out as quick as you can"—I went at eight o'clock, with my wife, to Benabo's office to pay the balance, and said to him, "Has Coles got the summons?"—he said, "He has just come back from the Law Courts"—I handed him £1 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., believing Coles had paid £1 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked Benabo for an official receipt; he said that they were too busy at the Law Courts to give a receipt, but it would follow on on Monday morning, and I should have it—on the same evening a letter was left at my place by the clerk, in which he offered to settle the matter for £15—I sent it by post to the Water Company—on July 6th I called at Benabo's office with Mr. Cox, a tradesman—I asked Benabo for the receipt—he said, "What do you want it for? You shall have it as soon as I get it"—I saw him afterwards, and asked him for the receipt—he said, "I have got it, but the desk is locked, and the clerk has got the key; what do you want to worry yourself about it for?"—Coles brought this letter to me, and said that there was an account stated between me and Benabo—before I read it, I said, "I don't believe he has paid the £1 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—he laughed, and said that he had, and he had got half-a-guinea returned from the Law Courts—in this account he credits me with the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. said to be returned from the High Court—I did not pay him 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—after he gave me this, I saw a gentleman connected with Bircham and Co., the solicitors to the Water Company—I afterwards saw Coles, and said, "I don't believe you paid the money at all"; he said, "I must stick up for my governor while I am with him; when I leave him, I will tell you all about it"—I consulted Mr. Deacon, and took criminal proceedings.</p>

I am a baker, of 19, Summerford Road, Bal<lb/>ham—on August 26th I was in Cushion Street, Commercial Street, about eleven—O'Brien came up alone and asked me for a drink—I refused, and then a blow from behind struck the back of my head—I could not see who was behind me—I ran for protection into a Jew's shop, but the Jew turned me out—O'Brien came and pulled me out, and then two blows followed—Leary and another man were with O'Brien—I do not recognise anyone else—I had about £10 on me—they knocked me about for a couple of minutes, I daresay, and they took my money—they tried to go away, but McKay arrived, and I gave O'Brien into custody—I went to the station, and charged him—I afterwards saw Leary at the Police-court with about twelve men, and I identified him as one of the men who attacked and robbed me.</p>

I received information about this crime, and about 1.30 p.m. on August 28th, I saw McGrath in Osborue Street—I told him he answered a description of a man wanted for assaulting and robbing a man in Fashion Street, in company with others—he said, "You have made a mistake; I don't know how long ago it is since I was in Fashion Street"—on the way to the station, he said, "I think I can find someone to say where I was on Wednesday night; the landlord of the Goddard public-house can say"—at the station, when charged, he made no reply—nothing was found on him—on the way to the station I met McKay—the same night, at 9.30, I saw Leary—I told him I should take him into custody for assaulting and robbing a man in Fashion Street on the 26th—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I took him to the station, where he was identified, from among several men, by McKay, and charged—he said, "If I had taken it I would have money; I am as innocent as a baby; I was at the Westmoreland Arms all night"—6d. was found on him—on September 3rd, Leary and McGrath was placed among others for identification; Leary was identified from the back of the Court—Leary and McGrath were picked out.</p>

On the night of August 26th I saw the prosecutor at the Commercial Street Police Station—he was in a very excited, nervous condition, and had all the appearance of having been roughly used—his legs were bruised—he complained of bruising and injuries about the back of the head, and I have no doubt it was so, but there were no marks—I thought he was not, in a condition to be capable of self-control, and sent him to the infirmary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by O'Brien.</hi> He was suffering from the effects of having been roughly used, and of alcohol—I have no knowledge that at the infirmary they found out the prosecutor was suffering from a deranged mind through drink.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a journeyman painter, lodging at 32, Francis Street, Battersea—I belong to a club that met at Oak Wharf, Battersea; I believe it is a rowing and social club—I know the prisoner as in the occupation of Oak Wharf—on the night of Saturday, July 25th, I was drinking with some companions, Worthey and four others, in Battersea Square till half-past twelve, when the public-houses close—on leaving the last house we brought with us a gallon stone jar; we had drank the con<lb/>tents on the way to the Square; there were about a dozen of us altogether—when we got to the Square we went to the Bricklayers' Arms, kept by Carpenter, to get more beer, but we did not succeed in getting any more—I was carrying the jar; when I found I could not get any more beer, I took it back to Smith's, the greengrocer's, and placed it on the pavement outside his shop—I never had it in my hands again that night—Fowler, one of Smith's men, took a barrow which was outside the shop, and went round the Square; when he came round the second time I accompanied him—in doing that we passed by Oak Wharf—the prisoner was standing at the small gate just inside, on the threshold of the gate—I said to him, "How about the medals?"—he told me to get off home—with that my friends came across the road; there seemed to be a bit of a jangle then, about the medals, I believe; there were some words, I can't recollect what—there were about five persons at the gates at this time—the jangle went on for about twenty minutes to half an hour, and then the prisoner went inside the gate and shut it; the other gates were shut at the time—I and Worthey then climbed up on the top of the two gates, one on one, and one on the other; I climbed up on the large gate, and Worthey climbed up on the small gate, with our legs hanging over—I saw the prisoner standing in the yard about ten feet from the gates—he said if we came over he would shoot us—then he fired at me, and shot me through the leg—I saw him pointing at me as I was sitting on the gate; I slightly turned my body round when I saw him pointing at me; the bullet struck me in the thick of the leg, on the right buttock—I said I thought he was only firing blank cartridge; I knew I had been hit, but I could not say by what; I felt something burning; I then saw him delibe<lb/>rately walk to the other side of the yard and fire at Worthey, as he was sitting on the gate, and I saw Worthey falling off the gate inside—the people outside then burst open the large gates I was sitting on—there was no other shot; there were three shots altogether—there were about thirty people there, I should imagine, at that time; a rare lot of bystanders got round; he fired two shots at Worthey, immediately after one another—I can't say whether Worthey dropped to the ground before the third shot; I saw that he lay on the ground; he made one stagger and fell forward—I next</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189609080107"/>
               <p>saw the prisoner standing inside the doorway of his house, theatening to shoot Mr. Beach; he told Mr. Beach if he did not get off his premises he would shoot him—the door was shut—Worthey was lying on the ground when I left the yard—I went to try and find a policeman, and I met one coming with the prisoner's wife—it is not true that I had the stone jar in my hand after putting it on the pavement, or that I threatened to knock the prisoner's brains out with it; never at any time—I never asked anybody to hand me a brick while I was on the top of the gate—I never said that I would dash his brains out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am a member of the club—I believe the prisoner was the treasurer—I could not say if there is a president; I believe there is a secretary, I would not be sure—this was the first time I had taken a part in any of these disturbances; I was once in the Square when there was a disturbance outside the prisoner's house, but that did not concern me—I could not say whether the same people were concerned in that dis<lb/>turbance; I did not notice who were there that night—I may have had a glass on that night—I could not say whether the stone jar was in re<lb/>quisition that night; that was some time before last Whitsuntide—that was the only one and this last one that I was concerned in—I have not heard of any more—there was a crowd at the former one, and the time was about eleven—I can't say that any of us were drunk when this shooting affair took place—I could not swear that the gates were forced open on the other occasion; I afterwards heard that they were—I don't know whether the prisoner complained to the police, I never heard—I believe he did summons them—I did not go and offer to put a stop to the disturb<lb/>ance; it did not concern me—on the night in question I began drinking about nine; it was Saturday night; I did not go at it steadily till past twelve; I had about three glasses, one at the Raven, and one at the Old Swan, where we had a benefit; I don't know whose benefit; I was simply asked to go; there was nothing out of place there, only one Or two songs; it went on till closing time—our stone jar did not remain full very long, there were too many of us to drink it; we asked all to have a friendly drink—I don't know that Worthey was more <hi rend="italic">on</hi> than the rest—I did not notice that he was sweeping with a broom outside the greengrocer's; that is about 200 yards from the prisoner's gates—one of my friends did not come up and say, "Symondson is standing at his gate"; Fowler said that; I took no heed of it; I have no idea what made him say it—when Fowler ran round the Square with the barrow, I did not hear him cry out anything—I did not hear him calling out, "Coals a farthing "; it had nothing to do with Mr. Symondson that I know of—Fowler was in the shafts of the barrow like a horse when we first spoke to Symondson—Allen, Rolfe, and Beach were there—two of them had been summoned; Beach was one—at that time there was not a considerable crowd assembled, not twenty people—Symondson was then at his gate telling us all to go off home—I could not say why we did not go; we wanted to know something, about the medals, which some of them were nettled at; they wanted satisfaction from him, and would not go till they had; then the jangle began, and lasted for half an hour—I cannot tell what was said; I was not too drunk to hear—I did not hear anyone say, "Syraondson, you have not paid out the money due to us"—he went in and shut the gate before the jangle was over—I have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189609080108"/>
               <p>no recollection of saying before the Coroner, "I said to Symondson you have not paid the money due to us "; I almost forget—when he closed the gates I did not threaten to get over them—I made a statement to Inspector Reynolds at the station—I have no recollection of saying to him that I shouted out to Symondson that I would get over the gates if he did not pay the money; I was so excited that night I did not know what I was say<lb/>ing at the station; I had just come from the doctor's hands, and had my wound dressed; I have no recollection of saying it—I did not hear my friends outside shout that they would break open the gate if Symond<lb/>son did not give them satisfaction—I have no recollection of saying that before the Coroner—I will not swear that I did not say it; I was a bit excited before the Coroner—I don't think we were all excited and angry; I may have said so, but I don't recollect it; they were excited, I believe; if I did say it, it was true—I did not hear Symondson say, "Go home, and come and see me in the morning, when you are all sober"—I did not reply, "No, you b—; we will paralyse you"—I will swear I did not, or anything of the kind: that I am quite positive of—I then proceeded to climb up the gate; I could not say the height of it; I was not helped up, I got up by my own unassisted efforts; I only climbed up to have a say to him—I could have said it through the gate; I simply told him that he ought to be ashamed of keeping the medals—I did not say, "Let's get over the gate, and smash the b—"—I have no recollection of saying it; I am quite sure I did not say it—I could not say for certain whether I was asked that question before the Coroner—I have no recollection of being asked that—if it was taken down I suppose I must have said it—I cannot tell you what made me get up on the gate; I was on the left-hand side of the small gate—I heard three shots fired—when I was on the gate I did not say, "Give me a b—brick, and I will smash his brains out"—I did not notice Symondson go into his house and come out again—I heard him say to the crowd, "If you come over the gate I shall fire"—I did not reply, "We don't care for your revolver"—he did not then fire on to the wall of the adjoining house—the first shot I heard hit me—I was on the gate when he tired again—it was not after I had got down from the gate that he fired the two shots in succession, after the gates had been burst open by the crowd—I did not have the jar in my hand—after the shots had been fired I ran up the yard as far as his private door; there were two or three standing at his gate before I got there, Mr. Beach for one—I went to have a look—he shut his door—there was no crowd looking at the windows—there were only three chaps there—Worthey was five or six yards from the door—he did not come through the broken glass—I knew that the prisoner's wife and children would be in the house, but I did not know for certain—I fancy the prisoner said, after the first shot, that if we came over we must put up with the consequences—I knew what the consequences would be if we got over; but we did not get over—I was knocked down; I was sitting on the top.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I am positive we did not get down inside the yard, or commence to get down, until the gates were broken open—they were not broken open until after the third shot, after I had seen Worthey fall to the ground—I had not seen the prisoner's wife there before the shooting</p>

               <p>—the only time I saw her was when she went after the constable—I had not seen her about the premises—I had not seen any woman there before I got on the top of the gates—he said to Beach, if he did not get off the premises he would shoot him—he said that through the broken pane of the front door; that pane had been broken before—nobody attempted to get into his house—Mr. Beach was at his door when I left to fetch a policeman—I was not there half a second.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mrs. Hall, a corn chandler, of 4, Battersea Square, opposite Oak Wharf—after midnight on Saturday, July 25th, I was sitting at my door—I did not see Henry Jones till he came up to the prisoner's gate with a greengrocer's barrow—at that time the prisoner was standing at his gate, the small gate—I heard Jones say, "Blind me, there's Symondson"—Fowler and Worthey were with him—they all appeared to be talking together—I did not know Worthey—I did not hear anything that was said—I saw Worthey climb the gate; pulled him down—I saw the prisoner step back and shut the gate—Jones and Worthey then got up together on the small gate, both of them—the risoner said, "If you come over here I will shoot you"—I could not see him at that time—I then heard a shot fired; that was about five minutes after he said that; Jones and Worthey were then sitting on the gate, with their legs over the other side; neither of them moved: one of them remarked, "It is only blank cartridge;" then the second shot was fired; they were still on the gate; before the third shot, Worthey came off the gate inside the yard, and I heard a voice, "Now, boys, for the gate"—I heard a third shot as soon as Worthey went down into the yard; that was after the third shot; about a minute after Worthey got off the gate—Jones was still on the gate—I could not describe in what way Worthey went off the gate; I only saw him go off; I could not day whether he jumped off, or fell off, or slipped off—after the gates were burst open I went up to the gate, and saw Worthey brought out; I did not see him pulled up from the ground; I did not go in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I was at my shop the width of the road was between us—the Square is a wide one, wider than an ordinary road; I was too far off to hear loud shouting; there was a considerable crowd round the gates after the third shot—I had been at my door about half an hour, looking on—Fowler came round with a barrow, shouting "Coals, 1s. 4d. a cwt. "; I think that was done to annoy the prisoner; he is a coal dealer—there was a board over the gate with "Boats to let"—Fowler shouted out, "Let's pull his b—boats down"—they had all had too much too drink—when the two men climbed on the gate, the prisoner said, "If you come over here, I will shoot you;" he had not shot then—he has been greatly annoyed ever since he has been there, about every other month—I had not seen the gates broken open before—I could not say exactly at what time of day these disturbances occurred; it was not as late as one in the morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Yelverton Road, Battersea—on July 26th, about twenty minutes to one, I was in Battersea Square, going home—I saw between six and seven chaps causing a disturbance outside Oak Wharf; I stepped over the road, and looked through the gate, and saw Mr. Symondson there, about two or three yards from the gate—he told them to go home, or else he would fire at them—I had not stood there a minute when he fired the first shot; but he did not fire at the men, he fired rather into the roadway over the gate—the men were standing at that time, nobody was on the gate—two men then jumped up on the gate; I did not know them; they were all strangers to me—I then stepped out in the roadway, and then there was a second shot fired; that was fired at them, I believe; I never saw the second shot; I only heard the report—both men then jumped off the gate into the yard—the crowd then burst the gates open, and I saw Worthey standing about three yards inside the gate, as far as I could judge—I saw Mr. Symondson standing close by his own door, and he fired the third shot, and Worthey dropped—I was then standing on the kerb—I saw the first and third shots fired, and heard the report of the second—the third shot was fired at Worthey, I should think; there was no one by him at the time—I saw a tall fellow with a stone jar; he is outside now as a witness; he picked the jar up, and smashed it on the ground outside in the street—that was after Worthey had dropped.</p>

               <p>about a barber, that he had not paid the man the last time he was cut and shaved—that was the first thing I heard—soon after that I saw two<lb/>men climb up the gate; one on the big gate, the other on the little gate—I heard a revolver go off then, in about half a minute, a minute at the outside—neither of the men moved after the first shot—then another shot was tired directly afterwards; that was a very slack shot, the first was very loud—the two men were still on the gates when the second shot was fired; I am quite sure of that—after that another shot went, a third—I only saw one of the men on the gate then—the gates then went open; the crowd pushed them open—the one man was still on the gates—I then saw the man lying down—Jones came running up to me and said, "I have got one," and he struck a match and looked and saw where the shot had gone in—next morning I looked, and judged that he was about three-yards inside, and near two stone door-steps leading into the private-house.</p>

I am a carman, and live at 18, Church Road, Bat<lb/>tersea—I was in Battersea Square in the early morning of July 26th, when a disturbance was taking place outside Oak Wharf—Jones was arguing the point with the prisoner about some club money—I saw the prisoner go inside and shut the gate—I saw Jones and Worthey climb up the gate—the prisoner first stopped the point about the money, and then he went inside his house, and brought out a revolver—at that time I should think there were a couple of dozen people outside the gate—Jones and Worthey had actually got on the gate—I saw nobody inside the yard but the prisoner—I heard his wife say to him, "Sydney, don't fetch that horrid thing out"—they still argued the point, and the prisoner fired a shot—Jones and Worthey were on the gate at the time the first shot was-fired—then a second and third shot was fired, and Worthey came to the ground: that was after the third shot was fired; Jones was then on the gate—after the third shot the gates were burst open, and Jones fell to the-ground, and after about five minutes I went in, and found Worthey lying about three yards from the doorway and gateway, in the middle, between the side door and the gate; he was lying on his face on the ground, reeling about as if he had fallen forwards—I picked him up, and brought him out on to the pavement—I afterwards saw a stone jar outside, in the Square, opposite the yard, near the Bricklayers' Arms; I picked it up, and brought it over, and sat on it by the side of Worthey till the doctor came and said he was dead; then I got up and walked away, and when they put him on the stretcher I caught hold of the jar and broke it—I had never had it inside the yard, or anywhere near the gate—I did not see anybody have it in their hand at all, not after we first had it that night, when the beer was out of it—I had been with Jones and Worthey</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189609080112"/>
               <p>when the beer was in the jar; I had a little drink out of it, not much—as far as I saw, no one had threatened the prisoner with that jar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Croas-examined</hi>. I was one of the men who had been summoned by the prisoner before this—I had nothing to say at this disturbance; I went there to look at it, from curiosity, to see and hear what they were asking about; I was in a position to see the best part of it—no jar was ever shown to the prisoner at all; I am quite certain about it; nothing was said to him about the jar; I never saw it till I picked it up across the road; I broke it when I saw that he had killed my mate, and I said, "Stop the battle; he has killed my mate"—that was as the prisoner was being taken away—I did not like the bottle shoved in my face—I was not examined before the Magistrate—I met the others between nine and ten; when they came out of the Raven I had not much—then they went on to the Old Swan; we remained there till just about twelve, closing time—then we took the beer out and drank it; I never tried to get more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I was examined before the Coroner—I was not asked about the battle—I was not cross-examined—I was one of the men that was summoned by the prisoner; that summons was dismissed.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at West Kensington, and am a school teacher—I am a sister of the prisoner's wife—I was staying at their house on Saturday, July 25th—I and my sister were inside the house about half-past twelve that night—I did not hear the prisoner talking outside—I heard some people talking at the gate—I went out and saw that the men were talking to him, and I saw him come in and shut the gate—the men outside were talking to him—I heard them ask him to come outside, and they would dash his b—brains out—he told them to go home—he asked us to go inside the house—I stood on the steps for some little time—I saw a man climbing up the gate—the prisoner told him to get down—he waited for a little time—he said, "Get down, or I will shoot"—he had nothing to shoot with then—he came into the house and went upstairs, and when he came down he had a revolver in his hand—his wife said to him, "Oh! don't; don't go outside"—he went out into the yard, and his wife and I went through the house, and down to the raft—my sister went on to the shore, leading to the ferry wharf and the main street—there was a crowd outside, and the gates were shut—I heard one shout when I was on the raft, waiting for my sister.</p>

When I left to go on the raft, no one was left in the house—I went on the raft because I was terrified—my sister ran off to the police—I was on the raft about twenty minutes—I saw the prisoner fetch the revolver before I went on the raft—when I came back from the raft to the house I saw two men standing in conversation with the prisoner, and one of them had a stone jar in his hand—I did not see it after that—the gates were open; we heard a smash—I had been staying in the house a week—I had known of the existence of the revolver in the house for a few days; there was no secret about it; it was kept on the bedroom mantelpiece; I saw an elastic band round it—he never told me what it was there for; my sister told me—they have six children; the eldest is ten and the youngest two—when I saw the stone jar in the man's hand I did not see him do anything with it—I went back to the raft to see if my sister had come back—I then came back to the crowd—the man with the jar was not there then—the gates were then open, and the police were</p>

                  </hi> (436 <hi rend="italic">V</hi>). On Sunday,' July 26th, about twenty minutes past one, I was in Surrey Lane, Granville Street, and met Mrs. Symond<lb/>son; she gave me some information, in consequence of which I went with her to Oak Whatf, and saw Worthey's body lying on the footway in the street; the gates were then open, and there were several people standing round—I sent for a doctor and Inspector Reynolds—I went into the yard, and saw the prisoner at the first-floor window, the bedroom—I said, "Is that you, Mr. Symondspn?—he said, "Yes. Are you a con<lb/>stable?"—I said, "Yes"—he then said, "Now I have protection, I will come down"—he came into the yard, and I said to him, "This is rather a serious affair"—he said, "Yes; anyone hurt?"—I said, "There is a man lying on the footway outside, and I believe he is dead"—he then commenced to say something, but I stopped him, and told him I would I rather he would wait until the inspector arrived—he said, "All I wish to I, say is, that when I fired I did not intend to hurt anyone; I did it, thinking to frighten them; they are always here annoying me; I fired in the direction of the wall"—the inspector then arrived, and he was given into custody.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Inspector V</hi>). About 1.30 a.m. on July 26th I was called to Battersea Square—I found the dead body of Arthur Worthey in the street, close to Oak Wharf—in consequence of information I went into the yard of Oak Wharf, and found the prisoner with the last witness—I said, "I am sorry to say the man is dead, and I must take you into custody for shooting him"—he said, "I am sorry; I did it in self-defence"—I said, "Where is the revolver? have you got it?"—he replied, "No, it is</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I have made inquiries, and the prisoner bears an irre<lb/>proachable character up the time he came to Battcrsea—since then, as a police officer, I have known nothing against him—I took a statement from Jones—I have the notes of it—the prisoner said Worthey and Jones had threatened to get over the gates—this is the point of Jones' statement you want: "Mr. Symondson walked inside the yard and shut the gate, and then me and Arthur Worthey threatened to get over the gates, and we both got on to the gates. I did not get over the gate, but Worthey did get over the gate"—the prisoner had complained respecting men annoying him on one occasion, and in consequence I directed constables on the four beats around the wharf to be about, to prevent any annoyance—the prisoner gave the names and addresses of the chairman and secretary of the club.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The whole statement of Jones is: "About half-past twelve to a quarter to one o'clock on the morning of the 26th inst., I, with Arthur Worthey, and several other men, went to Oak Walk gates. We saw Mr. Symondson standing in the gateway, and we remonstrated with him respecting his conduct in not paying out some money we con-sidered was due to us from the club, of which he was the proprietor. Mr. Symondson walked inside the yard, and shut the gate, and then me and Arthur Worthey threatened to gat over the gates, and we both got on to the gate. I did not get over the gate, but Worthey did get over the gate. I saw Mr. Symondson in the yard, and he threatened that if we got over the gate he would shoot us. I saw him fire at me, and heard the bullet strike, me on the thick of my right thigh. He afterwards fired at Worthey, and I saw Worthey fall inside the yard. I cannot say positively whether Worthey was shot while on the gate or while inside the yard, but the body was lying inside the yard after he was shot. I went into the yard after the gate had been opened, and tried to pick Worthey up to take him inside, I afterwards learned that Worthey was dead." Worthey had lived in the neighbour<lb/>hood all his life—he bore an equally good character with the prisoner—he was in regular employment as a printer.</p>

I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, practising at Battersea Square—I was called at 1.15 a.m. on July 26th to the deceased man, Worthey, who was lying outside Oak Wharf on his back, in the gutter—I found a bullet wound in the breast, about an inch below the left nipple, two inches to the left—the breast was exposed; someone had undone the clothing—he had been dead about a quarter of an hour; the body was quite warm—there was no blacken<lb/>ing or singeing of the clothing—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> exami<lb/>nation, with the assistance of Dr. Kempster, the divisional surgeon—I traced the bullet downwards and backwards and to the right, going through the right ventricle of the heart, through the liver into the abdominal cavity—it was lying loose in the cavity near the kidney—the bullet was the cause of death, which was practically instantaneous—the deceased would stagger forward, which is usual with such a wound—he must have been on the ground when he was shot; he could not have been on the top of the gate.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I am second clerk to the Justices sitting at Wimbledon Petty Sessions—I was acting as clerk on July 21st, and took notes of the evidence on a charge preferred against Charles Thomp<lb/>son of begging, and a common assault, and stabbing Charles Oborne with a knife—the evidence of the police constable was taken, and Thompson was remanded till the next day, in consequence of the prosecutor, the present prisoner Oborne, and his witness not appearing—the next day Thompson was brought up again, and Oborne attended—he was duly sworn as a witness—I took down the evidence he gave—I product these, my original notes, which are correct: "Charles Oborne, 36, North Road, Wimbledon, paper hanger, says, 'On July 20th, about four p.m., I was in Princes Road with Thomas Brice, going towards South Park Road. Prisoner came across, and asked for some halfpence. I said, 'I have got none.' Prisoner struck at me with the stick produced. I took stick away. He closed with me. We struggled, and went to the ground. When we gyt up, prisoner ran at me with knife produced. I do not know if he picked up knife from ground. I had never seen it before. He stabbed me in the hand with knife, and Brice took it away from him. P.C. Longhurst came up, and I gave him into custody. The knife only inflicted a scratch. I went to the Police-station, and charged prisoner with begging and assault. I had come from Bridge Station, and went towards South Park Road. I went into the Freeman Arms at 1.30, and had nothing to eat there. I had a glass of ale, and nothing more. The knife produced was not brought to me with bread and cheese at the</p>

               <p>Freeman Arms. The barmaid served ane with a glass of ale, but no bread and cheese. I first saw prisoner in Princes Road. From Freeman Arms I went to the outside of the Free Library; then to the Alexandra. I had a drop of four-ale there. I stopped there about two and a-half hours. I had two glasses of ale. We then went towards South Park Road. I had had nothing to eat since breakfast. The struggle took place in Princes Road, on the path side of the fence, not on the waste ground. There is no fence. I did not go on to the waste ground to cut off corner. (<hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>.) Prisoner was not lying under tree asleep I did not take stick away from him when he was lying down. Prisoner did not come after me and demand stick. I took stick from prisoner, and he tried to get it from me, I did not take the knife out of my pocket, nor see it until my friend took it from prisoner. I did not handle the knife at all. So far as I am aware, Brice did not go on waste ground. I did not get over any fence, neither did Brice. I did not go over fence and have struggle with prisoner, and go back again. I was sober, and so was Brice. (<hi rend="italic">Re-called</hi>). I do not recollect getting over any fence. When the constable came up we were all at corner of Princes Bead"—Oborne was asked by the Justices whether he was aware Thompson would be very likely committed to prison, and said, "Yes"—Oborne was then asked if he was aware that if his statement was untrue he was liable to be prosecuted for perjury, and said, "Yes"—he said he was fully aware what he was doing, and persisted in his statement—Bryce was the next witness—other witnesses were produced by the police from the Freeman Arms—at the close of the case, Thompson was discharged, and the Magistrate ordered the prisoner and Bryce into custody, on the charge of perjury—they were taken into custody, formally charged, and remanded for a week in custody—the Public Prosecutor was communi<lb/>cated with—this is the original charge-sheet signed by Oborne.</p>

We met prisoner at corner of Princes Road on same side of road. He said, I have got a halfpenny; will you give me three halfpence. I havfe a top of a loaf, and want some beer to wash it down? Prisoner got up off grass and walked towards us. Oborne said he had no coppers to give him. Prisoner lifted his stick, and hit at Oborne with it. They struggled, and fell to ground. When they got up I saw knife produced drop from prisoner's hand. I saw prisoner stab Oborne in hand with knife, and saw blood corning from his hand. I picked up knife irom ground, and gave it to constable. I did not take it from prisoner. Oborne gave prisoner into custody for stabbing him in the hand and begging. I first met Oborne in Morton at 12.30. We went to Dog and Partridge, and had two half-pints of ale; then to the Freeman, and had half-pint of ale there. We had nothing to. eat there. I never saw knife until it dropped from prisoner's hand. I did not have it handed to me at Free<lb/>man Arms. I noticed the stamp on it when I picked it up. The knife was not brought to me with the bread and cheese, nor was it taken by me or Oborue from the Freeman. We went from Freeman to Alexandra, and stopped there until about 4.10. When I saw prisoner first he was coming from inside Held towards fence. He was on same side of road when we met him. We saw prisoner lying down irom, a distance. We weat up to fence. Prisoner was then on his feet, and asked for coppers There was a fence between us. We got over on to waste ground, and</p>

I never saw knife until it fell from prisoner's hand. The struggle took place inside fence. When constable came up we were standing in Clarence Road with prisoner.

I am a wholesale stationer, at 55, Great Eastern Street, Shoreditch—in April last the prisoner entered my employ as traveller on the terms of 7 1/2 per cent, on sales, 1 1/4 per cent. on the collec<lb/>tion of accounts, and a nominal salary of £1 a year paid quarterly—he obtained orders for me—it was his duty when he was in my neighbour-hood to call, and he had to call once a week—my clerk knows more about the details of the business.</p>

I am employed by Lazarus Joseph, a stationer, of 55, Great Eastern Street—I do the clerical work of the office—the prisoner accounted to me once a week for the orders he got, and the sums he collected—our custom is to send out statements to our customers about the 1st of every month—we received this statement, "F," on June 20th, purporting to show the amounts collected for the week up to June 20th—there is no note there of the receipt of 9s. 11d. from Wintle on June 18th or any other day in the week—the prisoner attended at the office on June 29th and handed me this statement, "G," purporting to show the the collections since the previous list—there is no mention on it of 16s. 4d. collected from Castell on June. 25th, or on any other day, or of the £1 2s. 8d. collected on June 28th from Jones, or on any other day, or of the collection of the 9s. 11d. from Wintle—the prisoner did not say he had received any amounts from Wintle, Jones, or Castell—I did not send out the usual monthly statement to the prisoner's customers on July 1st, because we had then received this letter from the prisoner: "I hereby enclose one order which please deliver within a week; I have collected several accounts for May, so please do not send in any May statements until I pay in on Saturday; also please get a list of June statements for</p>
