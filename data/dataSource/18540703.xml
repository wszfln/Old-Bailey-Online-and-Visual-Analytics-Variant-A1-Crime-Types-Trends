                  </hi>. I am resident manager of the Deposit Assurance Company, New Bridge-street, Blackfriars. I was appointed to that office in 1852—in the early part of Feb. the defendant called at the office; he represented that he was a compositor in Messrs. Spottiswoodes' employment, and requested me to supply him with some prospectuses of our Company—the number he asked for was rather large, and I declined at first to do so unless I knew what his object was; he said that it was the practice in Messrs. Spottiswoodes' office, for the partners to give lectures on various subjects, and that they had requested him to give a lecture on life assurance; that 300 of the men had singled our company out, in conse<lb/>quence of some peculiar feature, and he had no doubt but that all would insure, in consequence of hearing his lecture; upon that I gave him about 100 prospectuses, we were rather short of them at that time and were receiving tenders for some—I told the prisoner if these men were going to insure it would be advisable for Messrs. Spottiswoode to tender for the printing of a new batch of prospectuses—he said, "Can you give me any idea of the price?" I said it will be from 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per thousand; he said he would let me have the tender the next day—I spoke to one of the Directors, who said he thought it was a very capital idea—the prisoner brought me the tender in writing, and it was accordingly given to Messrs. Spottiswoode, who undertook to deliver 20,000 prospectuses at 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per thou<lb/>sand—I afterwards received the following note—(<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "Her Majesty's Printing-office, reading department, Feb. 15, 1854, New-street square; to C. W. Bevan, Esq. Sir, permit me to acknowledge the receipt, this day, of eleven prospectuses, and sixteen forms of proposal, of the Deposit Office; as I have been some time awaiting them preparatory to my lecture, at the request of my governor (Mr. Spottiswoode), I should be most happy if you would favour me with an interview personally, at any time you could con<lb/>veniently appoint, either to-morrow, or before Saturday. I am, Sir, yours respectfully, M G. Keating. P. S. I have the Spottiswoodes' <hi rend="italic">carte blanc</hi> to invite any friends to to-night's lecture.

Favour me with 200 of your office envelopes to enclose cards and bills to my friends in the various newspaper offices; or would you deem it better to use plain? M. G. Keating. P. S. May I take the liberty to ask the advance of a cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of printing, &amp;c., as I am just now a little short</p>

               <p>of cash. You will certainly oblige by so doing, which we can settle when the 20,000 prospectuses are completed. An early answer to this will oblige.")—I then sent for the defendant, and on the following Sat. he called; I asked him what he meant by writing to me for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of his master's bill for printing; "Oh! I can settle that with the governor, I always settle things with the governor"—I said, "If you settle things with your governor like that, I do not settle things with my governors like that;" that I had nothing to do with his lecture, and could not give him any money whatever; he then asked me if I would lend him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, "Certainly not," and asked him what he wanted it for; he said he should have to give a <hi rend="italic">spread</hi>—I said it was time enough to pay for the <hi rend="italic">spread</hi> when he had given it—he then asked me to lend him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as he must have a decent coat to lecture in—I said, "I see what sort of man you are," and I advised him to leave my office, which he did—I then received the following letters from him—(<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "Her Majesty's Printing-office, Sat., Mar. 11, 4 P. M. C. W. Bevan, Esq. Dear Sir, I regret to say from the dis<lb/>courteous (I ought to say, 'ruffianly') reception I have just now experi<lb/>enced at the hands of your under-strapper, Norris (who is neither useful nor ornamental to any office), that I shall feel myself perfectly exonerated from my engagement of advocating the merits of the Company of which you are resident secretary, in my forthcoming lecture, unless I hear from you before 7 o'clock this evening; I have disobliged myself and my friends to oblige you and your Directors, at your written request I am sorry you are so short-sighted. Yours most respectfully, M. G. K. P. S. Your announcement at the Angel Inn, Oldham, as reported in the <hi rend="italic">Manchester Times</hi>, of March 1, that 300 of the printers in the employ of the Messrs.

Well, my lecture came off Did I show any ill feeling towards you or your Company?

                  <hi rend="italic">blessings attending the adoption of Life Assurance.'</hi> It is evident from the numerous attendance, and its freedom from partisanship, 'young' or 'old,' that the critiques in the journals are not altogether undeservedly rendered. It is painful to me to go into particulars, but in self-defence I feel bound to state the following facts. In Her Majesty's Printing-office there is a most admirable plan of education for the machine boys, reading boys, apprentices, and even adults (under the fostering charge of those amiable gentlemen, the Messrs. Eyre and Spottiswoode, H. M. printers). The 'readers' or 'correctors' on the establishment (of whom there is a staff of 25) each take a class, to contribute to the local 'treasury of useful knowledge.' I (as one of them) was solicited by Mr. William Spottiswoode to take the arithmetic class. I assented, but said I should prefer 'getting out of it' (<hi rend="italic">as others had done</hi>) by giving a lecture; on learning my subject, <hi rend="italic">'Life Assurances,'</hi> Mr. Spottiswoode was quite pleased, and so the matter was settled to come off in the lecture room attached to the office on the following Wednesday. To be better up in my Subject, I sent my son over to the <hi rend="smallCaps">DEPOSIT OFFICE</hi>, in Bridge-street, Blackfriars, with my compliments, for one of their Prospectuses, as I heard they offered <hi rend="italic">startling advantages.</hi> The Resident Manager asked who it was for, for what purpose, &amp;c. He was answered. He forthwith re<lb/>quested an interview with me; I duly attended. He suggested—would it not be better to give it in some <hi rend="italic">public room</hi>, as our lecture room was so small; to hire Anderton's large room, not to mind the expense; to order a supper for my friends as far as a dozen pounds would go, as he was most anxious for a <hi rend="italic">public</hi> opportunity, under <hi rend="italic">such auspices</hi>, of refuting some <hi rend="italic">dark rumours</hi> relative to his own antecedents, and some charges against the Chairman of <hi rend="smallCaps">THE DEPOSIT</hi>. Further to induce me to yield to his request, he asked me (as he learned I was a printer) for an estimate for printing 100,000 Prospectuses of <hi rend="smallCaps">THE DEPOSIT</hi> (showing me at the same time, <hi rend="italic">in private</hi>, the respective estimates for the same from Manchester, Liverpool, Oldham, Birmingham, and other places). The above estimates varied from 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. down to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per 100,000. He said, Do it for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per 1,000 and you shall have an order for 100,000. I replied, I could do nothing in the matter without submitting it to my principals. I consulted them; they accepted the order, which is now being executed, <hi rend="italic">on my recommendation at the time</hi>, but which I <hi rend="italic">now</hi> regret for <hi rend="italic">their</hi> sakes as well as my <hi rend="italic">own.</hi> At Mr. Bevan's request, 500 copies of <hi rend="italic">The Deposit</hi> (last year's) circulars were distributed to all employed in H. M. P. O., to induce some of them to insure. It was complied with. Two days after he saddled me with the responsibility of an assertion made by him at a meeting of his Company's shareholders at Oldham (see Keating's Lecture on Life Assurance), viz., 'That 300 of the compositors in the Messrs. Spottiswoodes' were about to join <hi rend="italic">The Deposit</hi> after a careful examination,' &amp;c., &amp;c. This gave <hi rend="italic">serious</hi> offence to my principals, who challenged me with it I wrote Mr. Bevan a strong note, condemnatory of his assertion, and as I wished to cease our brief acquaintance, to settle my account. I was met with evasion, and ultimately downright insult from himself and his understrapper Norris (Assistant Secretary), his former companion in the Queen's Bench. The result is, I was compelled to place the matter in the hands of my solicitor (Mr. Archer, Clement's-lane, City), who has instructions to proceed forthwith. It is lamentable, Mr. Editor, that the many responsible names figuring in the list of Directors of <hi rend="italic">The Deposit</hi> should be so tarnished by being associated with that of Charles W. Bevan, Resident Manager. Surely chaos must be come again, or Lord Viscount Drumlanrig, M. P., P. C., Comptroller of Her Ma<lb/>jesty's</p>

               <p>Household, must have been misled, to allow his name to be associated with that of such a scamp as Bevan. The sooner his Lordship publicly dis<lb/>avows all connection with the <hi rend="smallCaps">'DIDDLE-OZIT'</hi> or <hi rend="smallCaps">'DEPOSIT'</hi> the better for himself, for he will stand higher in an <hi rend="italic">Imperial</hi> point of view, than have his name dragged into County Courts and Lord Mayor's Courts all through the backslidings and antecedents of Charles W.

The plan was notable, but required assistance; and a coadjutor worthy his friendship was found in a fellow prisoner named N—r—is, expelled from the Secretary ship of a highly respectable Insurance-office for manipulation of its funds. These prison birds at once confederated together, and found no great difficulty in their way. The chief capital demanded by such an undertaking, on the part of the concoctors, was unbounded impudence; and on that of the public, unbounded credulity. Having joined their purses to produce a flaming</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185407030009"/>
               <p>prospectus, and taken an office in Bridge-street, Blackfriars, their next plan was to concoct a Directory of gentlemen, who, while they attracted public attention, and seemed a pledge for the respectability of the Company, should yet mislead those who were not familiar with the financial world. This was an easy task, and in due time the most honourable names in London were openly published as being Directors, &amp;c. Trusting to the faith of the public in great mercantile firms, there was scarce a banker, a brewer, or merchant, whose patronymic (but with different initials, or misspelling the name) was not used by these Jeremy <hi rend="italic">Diddlers</hi> to forward their views. Everything thus prepared, they turned their attention to statistics; and here, again, there was no great obstacle. In order to procure business, it was necessary to offer tempting terms, so they liberally proposed to serve the public 30 per cent. lower than any other office, although, with all the existing competition, the greatest difference hitherto had been from 1 to 1 1/2 per cent.; and in addition to this, these bad men committed the glaring impudence of granting Life Assurances for much smaller premiums, and selling Annuities on much lower terms than any other office; terms so palpably wrong that a man aged thirty, by paying 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., could obtain a Life Annuity of 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and by paying 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of this to insure his life, could receive 6 1/4 per cent for his <hi rend="italic">Deposit</hi>, and secure his capital to his represen<lb/>tatives. Having thus arranged preliminaries, and secured the Comptroller of Her Majesty's Household, M. P., as chairman, they opened their office and commenced business. They had the precaution to select respect<lb/>able agents, and by giving a commission of 25 per cent. where other Com<lb/>panies only gave 5 per cent. thus stimulated the agents to say all they could in their favour. The terms were very attractive. There is always a large uninitiated class, ready and willing to be duped, and the business went on swimmingly. If a man wanted to insure his life, there was no difficulty about his health. If a man wished to purchase an annuity, they were quite willing to dispense with baptismal certificates in London, Dublin, Edin<lb/>burgh, Glasgow, <hi rend="italic">Oldham</hi>, &amp;c., &amp;c. Large and handsome offices were opened in Bridge-street, Blackfriars, for the reception of <hi rend="smallCaps">THE DEPOSITS</hi> of the unwary, and the public thus induced to play its part in this most serious drama of real life. The poor and less intelligent portion of the community, lured by terms which had never before tempted them, took their spare cash and <hi rend="italic">deposited</hi> it in the safe (?) keeping of these worthies. Rich men were not less dazzled by the golden promises, and one person, who had toiled, and worked, and grown prematurely old in the service of mammon, invested <hi rend="italic">his all</hi> in the purchase of an Annuity; and in order to secure the capital, insured with them his life. He is now a beggar!!! A family, which with great industry, and by doing without a servant for forty years, had saved enough to retire from business, <hi rend="italic">deposited</hi> the principal portion in this <hi rend="italic">Bank of Elegance</hi> just in time to be next day made acquainted, by public advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> and other papers, that the Company (to keep the game alive) were about issuing 100,000 <hi rend="italic">new</hi> shares, at a discount of 25 per cent. from the original shares, but that when the new shares had been paid for, their <hi rend="italic">'Deposit'</hi> would be refunded, &amp;c., &amp;c.

                  <hi rend="italic">un</hi>-prepaid testimony to the zeal of the Resident Manager, in the shape of shameless advertisements (for the payment of which the Directors have to be sued in the various County Courts in Great Britain and Ireland); but the walls of the provincial towns will shortly blaze with coloured posters, cautioning the unwary against being <hi rend="italic">'diddled.'</hi> Even now, not a single advertisement will get insertion in any paper, unless pre-paid. The <hi rend="italic">'Deposits'</hi> thus received are liberally spent. The noble Chairman, being a sporting character, backs 'The Spider' for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 'Johnny Walker' for another 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but in this latter battle (see <hi rend="italic">Belts Life</hi>, May 7, under head 'The Ring,') fearing 'a cross,' directs the 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposited on account, to be handed over to his 'Pet's' opponent. The Resident Manager keeps his saddle horses and carriage horses; servants in gorgeous liveries; fares sumptuously every day; lives in the house in Bridge-street, and, being of a convivial character, astonishes that quiet Assurance-street with gay parties, lighted rooms, musical soirees, and expensive dinners—the last, at Radley's, cost 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—of course, paid for out of his own salary!!! But there are dark rumours afloat since the publication of Keating's Lecture on life Assurance, which should make men hesitate before they give this fellow their countenance or support. It is known they have thrown some difficulties in the way of paying some annuities in the country; and that, without any justice, they have refused to discharge a Life Assurance claim which had become due; still, what is everybody's business is nobody's business, and they thought they had hedged themselves with such a conventional respectability, and gave such good dinners (at the policy holders' expense) that it was not till Mr. Keating had the nerve, single handed, to grapple with the bubble, that they were compelled to yield. So great was their <hi rend="italic">prestige</hi> that, though he came fierce and furious, and bearded them in their own house, and before the very faces of their friends; though he told the ladies and gentlemen present he was swindled, and that their <hi rend="italic">host</hi> was the swindler, ultimately he was compelled to resort to the Lord Mayor's Court for the recovery of a petty account for printing and hotel expenses paid out of pocket for this Resident Manager. The following extract from <hi rend="italic">The Reformer</hi> will close this week's notice of the <hi rend="italic">Diddle-osit:</hi> 'Some time ago there was sent to this office a series of advertisements in favour of The Deposit and General Assurance Company, which were entered and paid for in the regular course of business. We are cautious about admitting indelicate quack medical advertisements, but it never entered into our heads for one moment that an Insurance Company professing to be incorporated by special Acts of Parli<lb/>ment was, in truth, a quack Company, got up for the premeditated purpose of imposing upon the public in matters of life assurance and annuities. Hence the advertisements of the Deposit and General glided through our columns from time to time. But we were astonished this week to learn that it is a spurious mushroom Company, hatched in the Queen's Bench prison, about two years ago, by a pair of scamps bankrupt in character as well as in purse. Under these circumstances, our duty, we humbly con<lb/>ceive, is at once plain and decisive, and therefore we proceed to discharge it, for the sake of the public, whose faithful and unflinching servants we at all times profess to be. In a word, we raise our voice and warn the public against "The Deposit and General Insurance Company." It is a false and fictitious Company. In their policies of Insurance they take care to provide, viz., "That the capital, stock, and funds of the said Company shall alone be answerable to the demands thereupon under this policy." Why, what is the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185407030013"/>
               <p>value of their capital, stock, and funds, if, as we repeat, the parties them-selves, forming the said Company, are utterly worthless, being, in fact, no better than a parcel of tricksters in London, disowned, or repudiated, or condemned, by every respectable person to whom reference is made?

I was coming down Ratcliff-highway, in company with a ship-mate named Johnston—we got into conversation with the prisoner—he said he was the owner of a ship—we all went to a public house in Wapping—the prisoner called for a pint of ale, and paid for it—there were three other persons in the room when we went in—shortly after we went in two of them went out, leaving the prisoner and another man there—another man came in after awhile, and he got in conversation about a dog that he had—there were then five of us in company—the last man came in soon after we got there—he said he had come up from the country to receive some money; that he went to an hotel, and had left a favourite dog of his there; that the dog was stolen, and that they had left a little lock and a string—he showed us the lock, and said there was no man in London who could open it—he said he gave a guinea for it—the prisoner was then in our company, sitting alongside of me—the man showed us the lock, and handed it to the prisoner, and then went out of the room—the prisoner then said that we would bet him a glass of brandy and water round that we would open it, and the pri<lb/>soner and I opened it together—he said to me, "Take hold of it, and see if you can't open it," and between us we opened it—I opened it three or four times after that, and then the prisoner said, "We will bet him a glass of brandy and water round, if it is agreeable to the company"—the man that the lock belonged to then came in, and said, "I will bet you any amount of money that no man in the room will open the lock"—the prisoner took out a sovereign, and said, "There is a sovereign, I will stake this"—he asked me if I would bet anything—I said, "I have only half a sovereign about me, but I will bet that that I will open it"—I took out the half sovereign, and gave it to the prisoner—he handed it, with the sovereign that he had, to the man that the lock belonged to—that was after I attempted to open the lock—I attempted to open it and could not—it was to be opened while the man it belonged to was to count ten—he counted ten, and I could not open it, and the prisoner handed the money to him, and the prisoner then said to me, "Have you any more money? will you bet any more?"—I said, "I have no more money about me"—he said, "Can you get any more?"—I said, "I have a little more money at home, but I am living down at Poplar New Town, which is away from here"—he said that he would go and get some money from a friend of his, it was all in his way—we all five went out together—we went to Blackwall, and I went home and got a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I got it cashed at Mr. Luff's, and afterwards joined the prisoner and the others in the East India-road—we went to a public house in Robin Hood lane—the man to whom the lock belonged then said, "Now we will commence"—one of the party that was to open the lock took out a note—there was a bet made—the man that was to open the lock said, "Give me the money, and I will keep it"—I betted 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with the man that the lock belonged to—I handed my money in, but the others did not put their money down—the prisoner betted—I do not know how much, he did not produce any money then—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Alfred James Waterlow, and others, printers, No. 66, London-wall.

RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you engage him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, Mr. Lipscomb did—he was to collect advertisements on commission, to render an account monthly, on the 5th of the month, and to receive the sum due to him on the 15th—the commission due to him would be on the advertise<lb/>ments inserted in the month for which the account was rendered, to be inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Northern Railway Times</hi>—no commission was to be due on advertisements prospective—if he got an order in June for advertisements to be inserted in July or Aug., or Oct., he would not be entitled to it—these</p>

               <p>advertisements were paid for to a collector, who was authorized to collect them—the prisoner did not generally collect the money—the money for the advertisements was generally paid to the collector—if the prisoner came to us with an advertisement, there was generally a written order—we insert the advertisement in compliance with the order, and we send the collector to get the money—we give credit—if an advertisement is sent on 3rd July, it would not be inserted till Aug.—the money would not be due till Oct.—the accounts would be sent, and the collector would call in course—where there were no written orders there were verbal orders by the prisoner, who was the advertisement collector, and occasionally he would bring in money, but it was not his particular duty—in cases where he came to us with advertisements and no written order he did not render himself responsible for it, certainly not—we never booked an advertisement to him since he has been in our service—if he brought an advertisement to us we should take his opinion as to the person—he never paid an advertisement in advance to my knowledge.</p>

On Sunday, 18th June, I was on duty in the Harrow-road, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the morning, and saw the prisoners—Williams had a bag on his shoulder, and Humphries had something under his left arm—I called sergeant Warren, and we went after them; they were going towards London—we stopped them in Old Church-street, 200 or 300 yards from where I first saw them—they had seen me before, because I was standing at the post at the corner of Hermitage-street—I asked Williams what he had in the bag—he said, "It is my own, I bought it and paid for it at Harrow"—he said, "I have got two loaves, a dish, a pair of old shoes, and a shirt; you can look at them"—I told him I doubted about his buying them, and he must go to the station with me and tell the inspector—he said, "I am b—d if I do, you shall carry me first"—I took hold of him, he resisted, and we both fell together; on Paddington-green we had another fall—I eventually got him to the station, searched him, and found a female's nightgown over his shirt, and a coat and waistcoat underneath the coat and waistcoat he has on now—also a brass watch chain, a purse containing 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he had on a pair of Wellington boots—I after<lb/>wards examined the premises of Mr. Smith, No. 7, Kilburn-terrace—I found marks on the soft mould in the next garden which had been done over on the previous night—these two odd shoes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which I found in the bag, corresponded with the footmarks—I compared them first by putting them into the marks, and then made a mark by the side.</p>

On Saturday evening, 17th June, I shut the kitchen window, between 5 and 6 o'clock—that window looks into the back garden, behind which is Mr. Smith's garden—the cook and I were the last persons up—we went up stairs together—the house was then closed—the cook closed the doors—the cook was down next morning before me—I came down about 8 o'clock, and found the kitchen window open, and the drawers—I missed two shirts, four towels, and a teapot of Mr. Reed's, and a shawl of mine—I know this teapot by the pattern, I have not noticed any mark on it—I have used it—these shirts have Mr. Reed's name on them—the teapot was left on the kitchen table—I missed two pair of boots of Mr. Reed's and one pair of the cook's—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are my master's boots—they had a mark on the sole before they had been in the mud—I am the niece of the cook.</p>

I shut up the house about 12 o'clock on this Saturday night, and I and my niece went to bed—the house was then quite safe—I came down in the morning about 7 o'clock or a quarter past, and found the doors all open, and the back kitchen window wide open—this shawl (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is mine—it had been behind the front kitchen door—I know it by some holes in it—the kitchen drawers were wide open—I know this teapot, and believe it to be my master's—this nightgown is mine, here is my name on it—I missed a dish like this; it is a very common one, there was some pie in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coal dealer, of Cambridge-street, Agar-town. On 19th June, a little before 4 o'clock in the morning, I was in bed with my wife, and heard the window raised up; I then heard a <hi rend="italic">scroop</hi>, rose myself up in bed, and saw the prisoner three parts in at the window, with a toy box in his hand, which had been on the table when I went to bed—I jumped out of bed, and said, "You vagabond, what do you do here?"—he threw it down, and out he tumbled at the window, which was on the first floor, and was ten or twelve feet high—I went to the window, and saw him pick himself up and run away—I slipped oh. my trowsers, ran after him, and caught him in Cambridge-place, 300 or 400 yards off—he was stooping, and burying these scissors (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the ground, hiding them; it was a vacant place, near an iron tank—I touched him on the back, and said, "You come back with me; I have got you"—I picked up the scissors, and he said that they were not mine—I said, "I know they are not"—he said that they were his—he walked back a few yards with me, and I called a constable—the prisoner then said, "You mean to give me in charge?"—I said, "Yes, I do"—he said, "For God's sake, don't; do pray forgive me; think of my poor father and mother; what will they say of me?"—finding that I intended to give him in charge he began to fence with me, and ran away—I ran after him, cried "Stop thief!" and a constable stopped him—I had shut the window myself before I went to bed—it is my dwelling house, and is in the parish of St. Pancras.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Van Sandau and Cumming, the attorneys for the prosecution. These proceedings are enrolled, and bear the seal of the Court—the petition was filed on 12th April, 1854—it is the petition of Thomas Brett and Henry Brett, of Wood-street, Warehouse-men—Peters was adjudicated a bankrupt on 15th April—the bankrupt was examined on 8th May—Simeon was first examined on 12th May—Hart was examined on 15th May, and Simeon's second examination was on the 16th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The examination of Samuel Clarkson Peters, the bankrupt, was put in and read, as follows:</hi>—"Basinghall-street, London, 8th day of May, 1854. I, Samuel Clarkson Peters, the above-named bankrupt, being examined at the time and place above-mentioned, upon my solemn declaration, say: I opened my shop, at Southampton, on 5th September last—I mean my drapery shop, 64, High-street. I afterwards opened another shop, No. 109, High-street, as a furnishing warehouse, about the 26th or 27th January last I commenced business by buying stock about the 12th August last. I then had a capital of 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., all my own—not borrowed. I invested that in the purchase of goods partly, and partly in paying the expenses of alterations in my shop, and furniture, and various things. I stopped payment on the 4th</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185407030031"/>
               <p>of April. On that day I had acceptances coming due to the amount of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I had then but 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and odd shillings, at my banker's, and no other money at the time. At the time of my failure I owed debts to the amount of about 9, 2002. At that period the amount of my assets, I consider, was worth about 4, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I had sustained no losses by bad debts to any amount I ascribe the deficiency of my assets to my expenses and forced sales. I made those forced sales partly to Mr. Moss Hart, of No. 20, St. Mary-axe, and partly to Mr. Simeon, who also described him of No. 20, St. Mary-axe. I did not make forced sales to any other persons. I have sold other goods at my drapery shop under cost price, not to a large amount; I don't know the exact amount, but I can ascertain it from my books and assistants. In other respects my retail trade was carried on at a small profit. My retail trade was a very nice trade, but I am not enabled to say, on the average, how much per day or week I took in my shop. All the money I took in my trade was two or three times a week paid into my bankers, excepting only the expenses of my house, and travelling and current expenses; I mean by the words current expenses what are generally known as petty cash expenses. Upon the average my expenses were (including household and travelling expenses) about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week. Not having kept any cash book I cannot form any computation of what were my weekly takings in my busi<lb/>ness. The books produced are all the books I ever kept; they are the books in the possession of the official assignee. I first became acquainted with Moss Hart about the 11th or 12th November last; he came into the shop to buy goods. He was at that time an entire stranger to me; I had never seen him before, nor did I till that time know his name. He came in and told me he could buy any odd goods or job goods that I might have. I sold him some that day; they were delaines, a few silk goods, and some rib<lb/>bons, I think. I don't think he then purchased any woollen goods. I don't recollect any other goods he purchased then, but he might have done so. I think the amount he then purchased was about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I gave him an invoice with the goods, but retained no memorandum of them myself He paid in cash for the goods at the time. He then packed the goods, and had them sent away. The goods which I sold to Hart were goods which my young men, by my direction, put together as goods they could not sell in the shop. The goods he first purchased were valued in this way: I looked through the goods, caused them to be measured, and priced them. I asked him a price for the lot Hart did the like, and offered me a less price. After some haggling we came to an agreement as to the price. I think I sold these goods at full 30 per cent off. I don't think I paid the precise amount I received of Hart into my banker's that day; I might have done so. The amount I paid into my banker's, of 118<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., on the 11th of November, included all I received from Hart on that day, but I don't think I received the whole of that sum from Hart Hart principally paid me in bank notes, but never gave me any cheque. I always gave him receipts for the monies I had from him. My next transaction with Hart was a few days afterwards; I don't think it was on the next day; I think it was on the 14th of November last On that day I paid into my banker's 106<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I received about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of that money from Hart This transaction with Hart was conducted similarly to the preceding one. The goods comprised in this sale were woollens, linens, and other drapery goods. They were selected in the same way as the others. Some of them were goods I could not sell in my shop, some were soiled whilst painting my shop, and some damaged; others of them were good marketable goods. Hart paid me in cash for those</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185407030032"/>
               <p>goods; I can't say what was the discount off the cost price of these goods; I am unable to say whether it was 50 per cent. discount off cost price, more or less. I gave Hart an invoice for these goods, and a receipt for the money, but kept no memorandum of the goods sold or the amount received of Hart myself. The sale and payment took place on the same day. These trans<lb/>actions with Hart did not take place weekly, but I think he called upon me, and they took place monthly, I think he did call once between the 14th November and December; I think he called on me on the 20th November. I then sold him goods, but the amount of that transaction I don't recollect; that transaction was conducted in the same way as the others. I did not pay the amount I then received of Hart into my banker's, but took it to London, and applied it towards paying my creditors. I am unable to say how much less than cost price I sold those goods; I should say it would be about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent off, but I should not like to take my oath that those goods were not sold at 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent, discount, or more, off cost price. Between the 20th November, and the time of my stopping payment, I think I had but four or five transactions of the same kind with Hart I can't say what precise amount I received from Hart, in the whole, on these transactions; but I think I can get the particulars from him. I should think I received from Mr. Hart, in the whole, about 2,900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but I am not positive as to the amount I received from him. This money was all received of Hart for goods I sold him between the 11th November and 4th April. I don't think any portion of the goods I sold to Hart were sold at less than 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent. off, but I should not like to say that any other portion of the goods which I sold to Hart were sold so well as at 30 per<lb/>cent. discount off the cost price. All the goods I sold to Hart were sold to him from my shops, all paid the same or next day by Hart to me, after the sales had taken place. The goods were taken away by Hart, and sent to No. 20, St. Mary-axe. He occasionally employed my boy to truck them from my warehouse to the railway station. The boy's name is William Stermes. On every occasion I delivered an invoice to Hart of the goods he bought, and gave him a receipt for the money. The invoices contained a full detailed list of the goods on each of those occasions. Sometimes a price was put to each item, at other times in the gross. I never saw Simeon but once, and that was about the 3rd of February last He came to my shop with Hart, and bought some goods. Simeon then bought some cloths, and other drapery goods, and also carpets. Hart introduced Simeon on that occasion, and told me that Simeon could advance any sum of money, even 50,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if I wanted it for goods. I am unable to say what amount I then received from Simeon, I think about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I am unable to say what proportion the sum I received from him bore to the cost price of the goods I sold to him. I should not like to take my oath that the goods I sold to Simeon did not cost me more than twice the amount I received from him for them. I never had any other transactions with Simeon but that one. Simeon paid me for those goods in Bank notes. I paid the amount into my banker's the same day. On reference to my banker's book, I find that on the 7th of February I paid 314<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in to my account, and I think that my transaction with Simeon took place on or about that day, and not on the 3rd of February, as above stated, and I have no doubt I received that 314<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Simeon. I gave Simeon a detailed invoice of the goods I sold to him, and a receipt for the money, but whether the invoice specified the gross price, or so much per yard, I don't know; I kept no particulars of my transaction with Simeon. My transactions with Hart</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185407030033"/>
               <p>took place, from time to time, between the months of November and March last inclusive. I made large purchases of goods from August to March last inclusive. I made a large purchase on 4th March last; I may have done so on the 5th or 6th, but I don't think I did so after the 8th March last. The goods I sold to Simeon he did not himself select; I and my young men looked them out and offered them to him. There was only that one trans<lb/>action with Simeon; but I have since heard that Hart sent a number of the parcels of goods which he had from me directed to Simeon. All the goods which I purchased were forwarded by the warehousemen of whom I bought them, to me at Southampton, and all were received by me at one or other of my shops. I will swear positively I never sold, on any one occasion, goods I had purchased in London before the goods reached my shops. I have, besides my sales to Simeon and Hart, sold occasionally an entire end of cloth. I had three or four customers who would occasionally buy an end of cloth. My proper business was a retail business, but I went once in three weeks to the shops around, and made sales to them from patterns, on the average from 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it may be more or less; and this occurred regularly every three weeks. Those sales were at a small profit, but not so much as I got from my retail customers. Those sales were paid for monthly. I never sent any goods away from my shop which were not paid for or entered in my books, and that I swear to solemnly. The last time I received money from Hart was about the 28th of March last; at any rate, it was the latter end of the month. The amount I then received from him was about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and was for goods delivered on the same day. That money I paid away to discharging creditors and small debts about Southampton; 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I paid to Mr. Ford, of King-street, Cheapside; 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Hammon, in Southampton, and the remainder, for which I have vouchers, for small debts in Southampton. The last pre<lb/>ceding sum which I received from Hart was on the 4th of March last; the sum I then received of him was about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I on one occasion borrowed money from Hart to the amount of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; this was on the 3rd March last. He on other occasions lent me small sums. For the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he lent me I let him have goods, at the end of March. It was the parcel of goods mentioned in the paper writing now produced and exhibited, marked A, headed—"Goods sent by the carriers from Southampton, sent to Hart on the 31st March last." For all the monies which I borrowed of Hart he had goods in payment I can't say at what per cent off the cost price the goods which Hart had in payment for the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. were sold to him at, as one of my young men, Sampson Hopkins, or whose name was Hopkins, but the Christian name I am uncertain about, looked out those goods, and arranged with Hart as to the price, but I finished the agreement with Hart as to those goods. I think the discount was 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent., or thereabout; I should say it was not 60 or 50 per cent off When Hart lent me the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 3rd March, if that was the day, for I am uncertain on what precise day it was, I gave him an I O U, but I don't recollect if anything was said as to goods, or how much profit he was to have for the loan, nor when the money was to be repaid; the reason I paid him that sum in goods at the end of March was that Hart called and asked for the money or for goods in payment On all other occasions when Hart lent me money I gave him I O U's. I cannot positively say whether all the goods specified in the aforesaid paper writing marked A, came from my warehouse, but I can say that many of them did. I would not venture to swear that any one parcel therein mentioned did not come from my warehouse. The last parcel in paper A, under date of 1st April last, weighing 3 cwt, I sold to Hart about the 28th or 29th March last; about</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185407030034"/>
               <p>the same time I sold to him the parcel mentioned in the said paper A, under date of 31st March last, as weighing 8 cwt. and one quarter. For those goods he gave me about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash, before referred to, and kept the remainder for the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he had advanced me, and for which he held my I O U, but he did not; return to me such I O U. The goods referred to in paper A., under date of 17th and 18th March last, as addressed to Simeon, weighing respectively 8 cwt. and three quarters, mast have been I believe one transaction, and were sold by me to Hart on or about the 17th March last; but I cannot say what sum I received from those goods, for I have no recollection of the transac<lb/>tion, excepting that I believe that the 79<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid into my banker's account on the 17th March last, was part of the proceeds of those goods. I have no recollection of the particular parcels mentioned in paper A., under date of the 11th and 13th March last, but they may have formed part of the goods I sold Hart on the 4th March last I do not recollect any transactions with Hart on the 11th or 13th March last; on looking at my ledger I find I paid Rogers, Lowring and Co., 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 11th March, and therefore I have now no doubt but that on or about the 11th March last I sold the goods to Hart mentioned in the paper writing marked A, under date of 11th and 13th March last. I find I also paid on the said 11th of March, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Hugh Jones and Co., and 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Spence Baggally and Co. The papers shown to me are my invoices of goods delivered to me in March, amongst those papers there is an invoice of Messrs. Southall and Ponsford, of goods sold to me to the amount of 321<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I gave the order for those goods on the 4th or 5th March last; that is for a portion, the other portions were bought previously. Those goods were received by me alto<lb/>gether on the following day at my warehouse; nearly all of those goods are now in my warehouse; that is to say, when I made the assignment to Ponsford and Bodger in trust for my creditors; some portion may have been sold in the ordinary way of business over the counter before the 4th of April. I won't swear a portion of those goods were not sold to Hart or Simeon, but the bulk of them remains in my warehouse; I don't think that any of the goods purchased by me, and received in March last, have been paid for, some of them I think were paid for that I purchased in February; but I am not sure. The last goods I had from Candy and Co., was on the 20th of February last, amounting to the sum of 286<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., those were partly sold and partly not. I cannot say if any were sold to Hart or Simeon, but some of them were sold retail, and some are now in stock. The ledger is principally in my wife's handwriting. Her name is Mary Anne; I looked over the book from time to time as my wife kept it. There are some sheets cut out of the ledger at the commencement I learnt from my wife that Grovecock's account had been written in the first page, and that she had entered that account in another part of the book, and had cut that sheet or sheets out. I learnt this from my wife about the latter end of March; or it may have been when Mr. Honey came down on the 4th of April last, my attention was then for the first time called to it. The book called "Pay outs," was written up by my young man, "Edwin Oakshot," I think in the last part of March, from vouchers and receipts, and by my dictation partly from memory: the latter part is written up by myself from vouchers which were omitted to be entered, and from my memory. The four last pages are the portions I refer to, as written by myself By that book, my payments out, amount to 1,299<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; but I don't think they contain all my payments out, I know there are various omissions. I state positively, that every sum which is entered in that book as having been</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185407030035"/>
               <p>paid was paid, and that no payment is therein stated to have been made which I do not believe was made. <hi rend="italic">Examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. FITCH</hi>.—Hart is a job draper. It is customary for drapers to sell job lots. Mr. Hart has told me that he has bought job lots of others in Southampton, besides myself. The summer is the best time for my business. The period from No<lb/>vember to March, is the worst part of the year. In the lots sold to Hart, the price was fixed on each article. The amount fixed on each article was not at the same discount off cost price. During the time the sales were made to Hart and Simeon, I was constantly making payments to my creditors. The usual credit I had from my creditors was three or four months bills. I made large payments to my creditors in February and March last; but I did not pay for the goods supplied in February and March, because the credit had not expired; I made the sales to Hart and Simeon, to meet my payments to my creditors and the bills falling due. The money I borrowed of Hart in March, was to meet the bills coming due on the 4th of that month. I asked Hart to lend it to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The examination of Most Hart, on</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">th May</hi>, 1854, <hi rend="italic">was ready as follows:</hi>—"Moss Hart, of No. 20, St. Mary Axe, in the city of London, wholesale job draper, being sworn and examined at the time and place above mentioned, upon his oath, saith as follows:—I have no warehouse or shop, mine is a private house. I have no clerk or assistant in business; the only book I keep is the one produced, marked A. I generally buy and sell for ready money; I don't keep any account of my purchases or sales. I have been lately from home. I returned home on Thursday last. I was at Man<lb/>chester on Wednesday, and had been there some few days; nearly a week. I was staying there at the house of Mr. Ezechial, or some such name; the name of the street or number of the house I can't tell you, I think it is called South Parade, and near the Market-place; it is a general boarding house. It is the first time I was ever there, but I was called by my name in the house. I went to Manchester from Liverpool; I was at Liverpool about three or four days, and stayed at the Saddle Hotel, in Dale-street, there; I stopped in the room, No. 13. I think I left London on the 1st May, or it may have been the 2nd of May. I had not previously been permanently at home, but I had been there occasionally; for some weeks past I had been at different places. I went to Manchester and Liverpool with another person to buy there; but the cause of my going to Liverpool was to see some parties on board the <hi rend="italic">Great Britain</hi>, in consequence of the accident. The parties I went to see were Mrs. Ellis and family. I did no business at Liverpool; I called at several places. I am in the habit of calling at every house in my line of business at the towns I visit. I called with Mr. David Davis, the son of Moses Davis, of Wormwood-street, Bishopsgate, on Messrs. Watts and Co., wholesale warehousemen at Manchester, and purchases were there made in the name of Davis. I also, when at Manchester, saw Mr. Barnard Bohn of Great Ailie-street, Goodman's-fields, diamond-merchant, and also Mr. Solomon Marks, of Great Prescott-street, Goodman's-fields, wholesale print-seller. I am acquainted with James Simeon, he was also a passenger by the <hi rend="italic">Great Britain;</hi> I saw him at Liverpool after the 1st of May. I first be<lb/>came acquainted with Simeon about eight or nine months ago; I was intro<lb/>duced to him by an Australian friend of mine who is now in Australia, his name is John Jacobs, and he left England by the ship <hi rend="italic">Mirzapore.</hi> I have not been connected at all with Simeon in business, excepting that I have sold him goods, and recommended him to several houses of business to pur<lb/>chase</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185407030036"/>
               <p>goods, for which I had a commission from Simeon, and sometimes from the parties to whom I introduced him to buy goods; I accompanied Simeon once to Southampton. I was as you see in the habit of introducing Simeon, and I thought if he went with me I could recommend him to some one who would sell him goods to suit him; this was about three months ago. I have no memorandum of it; when at Southampton, I introduced him to Mr. Peters; we went down together by the morning train, and returned to town together by the mail train the same night. Before I went with Simeon to Southampton, I did not tell him to whom I was going to introduce him; at least, I don't recollect that I did so. When I arrived at Southampton, we went direct to Peters's house; I don't recollect calling elsewhere. When we first called we saw Peters, who desired us to call again after 2 o'clock. I told Peters I had brought a gen<lb/>tleman down to buy some goods, if he had anything to suit him. I did not state what description of goods he wanted. We returned to Peters's after<lb/>wards, at the time appointed, which I think was about 2 o'clock. Peters has two shops; one a drapery, and the other a carpet shop: we went to the carpet shop. When we returned the second time to Peters's, he had partially looked out, and continued to look out a lot of goods; those goods consisted of carpets, cloths, linens, and other goods, which is specified in an invoice now produced to me, marked C, and was referred to and exhibited under an examination taken the 12th May. Those goods were put together, each description by themselves, as I best recollect, and offered by Peters to Simeon for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as well as I remember. I think Peters had the particulars in a pocket-book, and calculated the prices which he had set against each particular class of goods with reference to the quantities as amounting to 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and offered them to Simeon at that price. Simeon offered 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the lot: then he offered 280<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and ultimately, he got some bargain about discount, and gave 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. The word Simeon, written in pencil on the invoice marked C, as also the rest of the invoice, is in Peters's hand<lb/>writing. Peters did not keep the other articles mentioned in the invoice, excepting carpeting, and rugs, &amp;c., at his carpet shop: it is not usual to do so, and I presume he did not; but I suppose he had caused them to be sent to his other shop after our first visit, in anticipation of our second visit Simeon on that occasion purchased all the goods which Peters then offered him for sale. I know of no other dealings between Simeon and Peters except this one; and if there had been another I should have known it as I was to have had a commission. Peters did not pay me any commission on that occasion. Simeon paid me a commission of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think; that was to the best of my recollection the amount. I will positively say it did not amount to 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Peters was a retail dealer; but I believe served wholesale dealers and shops as well. I first became acquainted with Peters on the 11th November, 1853, by calling on him in the same way as I am accus<lb/>tomed to do on other parties in Liverpool, and elsewhere. It has been my custom so to do for the last eighteen years. When I first called on Peters, I asked him if he had anything to dispose of that was 'Jobbish.' He said that he had got some cheap stuff he could sell me. I then said, 'Put out what you have got to dispose of, and I shall see whether it suits me.' He then looked out the goods mentioned in invoice No. 1, now produced and exhibited. These goods were bought at the drapery shop; I think they were all drapery goods. The invoice No. 1 contained the whole of the goods he offered me on that occasion; he put a price on them, and offered them to me at that price. I think I bantered with him about the price,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185407030037"/>
               <p>and got them according to the invoice. There was not a very great differ<lb/>ence between the price he offered them to me at, and what I gave for them; but I do not recollect what the difference was. This transaction took place about the middle of the day. I paid him on that occasion 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes, leaving 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. remaining due; it being understood that the transaction was to be completed on the next day. At the following day I purchased 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth more of goods. I paid 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the balance of the previous day's pur<lb/>chase, in two notes; one of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and one of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I returned to London on the 12 th. I next saw Peters about the 18th November; I may have gone down the day before, but that was the day the transaction took place. On recollection, I think the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the balance of the 1st transaction, and the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the amount of the 2nd transaction, were both paid to Peters, in London, and not at Southampton; he on that occasion came up to London with me—on the 18th November last I purchased other goods, specified in invoice No. 3, amounting to 201<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., of Peters, and paid him 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes. This transaction, as far as I recollect, was conducted on precisely the same manner as Nos. 1 and 2. I returned to London after that transaction; at least, I left Southampton immediately after it. On the 3rd December last I purchased other goods of Peters, specified in invoice No. 4, amounting to 229<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and paid him at the same time in Bank notes. On the 17th December I purchased other goods of Peters, specified in invoice No. 5, amounting to 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and also paid him at the time in Bank notes. On the 19th December I purchased other goods of Peters, specified in invoices Nos. 6 and 7, amounting together to 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and also paid him in notes on the same day. On the 30th December I purchased other goods of Peters, specified in invoice No. 8, amounting to 128<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and paid him in notes on the same day. On the 3rd January last I purchased other goods of Peters, specified in invoice No. 9, amounting to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and paid him in notes the same day. On the 18th January last I purchased other goods of Peters, specified in invoice No. 10, amounting to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and paid him in notes the same day. On the 19th of January last I purchased other goods of Peters, specified in invoice No. 11, amounting to 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and paid him in notes the same day. On the 2nd February last I purchased other goods of Peters, specified in invoice No. 12, amounting to 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and paid him in notes the same day. On the 3rd February last I purchased other goods of Peters, specified in invoice No. 13, amounting to 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and paid him in notes on the following day. On the same 3rd February last I also purchased other goods of Peters, specified in invoice No. 14, amounting to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic"> d.</hi>, and paid him in notes on the same day. My next purchase of goods of Peters was, as I best recollect, speaking from the invoices, on the 27th February last; on that day I purchased goods of him, specified in invoice No. 15, amounting to 199<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and paid him in notes the same day. On the 1st March last I purchased other goods of Peters, specified in invoice No. 16, amounting to 151<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and paid him in notes the same day. On the same 1st March, I also purchased other goods of Peters, specified in invoice No. 17, amounting to 99<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and paid him in notes on the same day. On the same 1st March I also purchased other goods of Peters, specified in invoice No. 18, amounting to 174<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and paid him in Bank notes the same day. On the 3rd March last I also purchased other goods of Peters, specified in invoice No. 19, amounting to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and paid him in notes the same day. On the 4th March last I purchased other goods of Peters, specified in the invoice No. 20,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185407030038"/>
               <p>amounting to 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and paid him in notes on the same day. On the 10th March last, I purchased other goods of Peters, specified in invoice No. 21, amounting to 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and paid him in notes on the same day. And on the 11th March, I purchased other goods of Peters, specified in invoice No. 22, amounting to 129<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and paid him in Bank notes on the same day. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It appears that the several invoices, numbered from 15 to 22, both inclusive, excepting the invoice numbered 21, purport to be sales to Mr. James Simeon: was Simeon or you the real purchaser?—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was the pur<lb/>chaser, on my own account. How happened it, then, that the invoices were made out in the name of Simeon?—Because I thought Mr. Simeon would have bought them, as the Australians generally like the invoices in their own names, and that was the reason why I had them made out in the name of Simeon. Was that the only reason?—It was. Did you offer those goods to Simeon?—I showed them to him, but did not tell him they were bought in his name. Did you offer them to Simeon immediately after each pur<lb/>chase?—If he was at his counting-house I showed them to him; if he was not I sold them without. Did he from time to time refuse all those parcels?—As he did not buy them, I presume he did. Then, notwith-standing he refused some parcels, you continued to have other parcels invoiced in the name of Simeon: how happened this?—Suppose Mr. Peters made out the invoices in the name of Simeon, and as I did not care much about it, thinking he would ultimately make a purchase, I let it be so. Did Simeon purchase any of those goods?—No, I do not believe he did. On the 18th of March last I purchased other goods of Peters, specified in invoice No. 23, amounting to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and paid him for them in notes on the same day. On the 31st March last I purchased other goods of Peters, spe<lb/>cified in invoice No. 24, amounting to 186<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., off which he allowed me a discount of 10 per cent., leaving a balance of 168<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. And on the 1st of April last I purchased other goods of Peters, specified in invoice No. 25, amounting to 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., to which is added the balance of invoice No. 24, 168<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making a total of 231<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I had previously, on the 4th March last, lent Peters the sum of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the goods specified in the paper marked No. 26, amounting to 61<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and those goods were packed up and sent to me at Hiscocks', the Red Lion, Southampton, as I had not purchased those goods I did not wish to take them to London, and therefore left them in the care of Mr. Hiscocks. Some time after, Mr. Peters asked me to oblige him with those goods, as he wanted them; believing the amount to be good, I left word with Mr. Hiscocks to deliver them to Peters on having a receipt, which receipt I suppose he now holds. Subsequently to the 4th of March last, and before the 31st of March, I lent to Peters a further sum of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; again, on the 30th March last, I lent Peters a further sum of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. These all making together 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., were written off the 231<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., being the amount of the two invoices Nos. 24 and 25, leaving a balance due of 81<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which last mentioned sum I subsequently paid to Peters in a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.'s on the 1st April last The above mentioned invoices above referred to, and numbered from 1 to 25, both inclusive, comprise the whole of my purchases of Peters, and also comprise all the goods I have ever had from Peters, except those mentioned in the paper, No. 26, which were returned to him as before stated. The goods I had from Peters were all marketable goods, and in good condition; there may have been some goods which I considered old stock, although they may not have been old stock to him. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does the paper writing, marked E, comprised in twelve sheets of paper, which</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185407030039"/>
               <p>was delivered to me this morning by your attorney, Mr. Saul Yates, contain true copies of all the several invoices from No. 1 to 26, both inclu<lb/>sive?—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe they are: they were made by a law stationer, but I have not examined them; I will leave the originals with you so that you may exa<lb/>mine them; upon your undertaking to return them. Were all purchases made by you of Peters, at Southampton, made at Southampton?—They were. Did Peters occasionally call at your warehouse in St. Mary Axe?—Oh yes, he has occasionally. Did he solicit you to visit Southampton to make purchases?—Yes, occasionally; sometimes I went down on my own account. When he solicited you to go down, what did he say?—He gene<lb/>rally stated to the effect that he thought if I came down he had goods that would suit me, he did this by letter; I do not think he ever called upon me to tell me so. Did you ever tell him what kind of goods you wanted?—No. Had you other business at Southampton with other people when you went to see Peters?—At those times I had not time to attend to other business with other persons, but I have done business for the last 14 or 15 years in Southampton. Were all your purchases of Peters conducted in the same way as the first?—Yes. Did he on each occasion show you the lot of goods which he offered you for sale, and ask you a price for them?—He told me the price at which he was prepared to sell; we discussed the prices, ulti<lb/>mately agreed upon the amounts, and then the invoice was made out. Were the prices agreed on generally, considerably less than the prices asked by Peters?—Sometimes they may have been, and at others very little less. Were not all the sales and purchases what are generally called job sales and purchases?—They were. Did you think it necessary to ascertain the ordi<lb/>nary selling price of these goods in the retail shops?—No. Did you think it necessary to ascertain the cost price of these goods?—No. Did you ascertain from whom the goods had been purchased—No. Did you see any of the invoices Peters had received with the goods?—No. Did you learn from him whether the goods had been paid for or not?—No. Did you learn from him the state of his affairs?—No. What representation did he make to you to induce you to lend him money?—Being short for a few days. When he delivered you goods in payment of your loans, did you return to him his I O U's, or acknowledgments for the loans?—I had but the one I O U, which has been produced, annexed to exhibit No. 26. How happened it that when he repaid to you your loans, you retained the I O U?—Because I had some difficulty in getting the goods in part pay<lb/>ment, and I thought it was right I should keep it, which I told Peters I should do. Had you any acknowledgment for the two other loans of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?—No. Where were those two loans made?—At Southampton. Were the goods which you purchased of Peters always delivered to you at Southampton, or where and how were they delivered to you?—They were generally sent by his porter to the railway; or if it was too late, or it was a particular occurrence, I may have sent some to the Red Lion; but I do not think, to the best of my belief, that this occurred on more than two or three occasions. Who packed and who addressed the goods?—The porter; and I may have assisted sometimes in packing them: they were generally addressed by some one of Peters's young men. Can you recollect which of Peters's young men assisted on the occasions of the several purchases?—Some assisted looking out the goods, but I can't say which, in particular; I don't recollect the names of any of them. Did any of Peters's young men assist in the bargaining as to the goods, or to fixing the prices?—Not that I recollect Were all the goods which you had of Peters addressed to you</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185407030040"/>
               <p>personally, and to your own place of business?—Yes, they all came to my house; but those which were invoiced to Simeon were addressed to Simeon, but came to my house for me, and were received by me. Were the goods which were addressed to Simeon, but which came to your house for you, always acknowledged by you in the carman's delivery book?—When I was present I signed my own name; at least, I think so. I can't say how those which were received in my absence were acknowledged. Did you ever acknowledge the receipt of any such goods in Simeon's name?—Not that I recollect. Who, in your absence, would give the acknowledgment?—Any one present; either my wife or servants. What are your servants' names? Sarah; I believe her surname is Pate; and I presume it would be Sarah who would acknowledge the receipt of the goods, if my wife or myself did not Have you resold all these goods?—Yes, I believe I have sold them all; there may be some few things still unsold. Did you ship any of these goods?—No. Did you cause them to be repacked?—I have sent some of the cloths with others to my packers, Messrs. Britten and Sons, Basinghall-street, to be re-measured, which is the ordinary way in the trade: the other goods were not sent to the packers. To whom have you princi<lb/>pally sold these goods?—This is a question which it is impossible for me to answer, as I buy and sell generally for cash; and if cash is paid at the time of the sale, I do not enter or book it. Can you state from recollection to whom you have made any considerable sales of woollen cloth since the 11th of November last?—No, I cannot. When you made the purchases of Peters, were the goods measured before you paid for them, or did you take his statements as to the measurements? The goods were not measured; I took his statements for the lengths. What goods have you sold to Simeon?—I sold to Simeon 143 handkerchiefs, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, and 12 dozen purses, at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., amounting together to 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on the 23rd January last. I can't say if I had any of these goods from Peters. I also sold Simeon 125 handkerchiefs, at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each, amounting to 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., on April 4th last. I also find I made another sale to Simeon on 22nd March last, of 22 pieces and 4 handkerchiefs, at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; 3 pieces and two of spun, at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., amounting to 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I can't say whether all or any of these goods came from Peters or not; if they did, Simeon was not aware of it. When did you see Simeon last?—At Liverpool, when I was there, as before' mentioned. When did you last see the bankrupt?—The bankrupt was at my house, with his attorney, Mr. Fitch, after the bank<lb/>ruptcy, and I then saw him. What took place on that occasion?—They called to ask me some question; what it was I don't recollect; they were only with me a few minutes. I have never since had any communication with the bankrupt or Mr. Fitch, either directly or indirectly. Was the invoice of the purchase made by Simeon of Peters, on the 6th of February last, left in your possession at all, or for any time?—No. Did you take down the particulars of the goods purchased by Simeon on that occasion?—Yes, I did it upon a long slip of paper, it was taken down by me at the time in pencil. I think I have this paper still by me, but at present I don't know what has become of it. I now recollect that since the bankrupt has been in prison, 2 or 3 days since, he wrote me a letter, asking me to let him have a shirt and collar, which I had borrowed of him once when at South<lb/>ampton, and asking me if I could find him bail, but of which I took no notice. That letter is now in the possession of my attorney, Mr. Yates. Did you know Simeon's clerk, Christopher Mower?—Yes. Did you assist in making up an invoice of the goods purchased by Simeon of Peters?—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185407030041"/>
               <p>did assist in making up an invoice, but I will not say whether the goods included in that invoice were all had from Peters or not What was the amount of that invoice, as made out by Mower?—I think about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as near as I can recollect, including clothing, which I did not know came from Peters. What was the amount of that clothing?—I can't say. Can you positively say that that invoice did not amount to between l,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 1,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?—I can positively swear that it did not. If I had the paper here which assisted Mower in making out the invoice, I could tell you. I will look for it, and shall no doubt succeed in finding it, and if so I will send it to you. Do you know of whom Simeon had the clothing included in that invoice?—I can't recollect. Do you know what that clothing cost Simeon?—No, I don't. Did you ever pack, or cause to be packed, goods for Simeon?—No, but I have been to Britten's with him, and given instruc<lb/>tions, as he did not understand that sort of packing. Was Simeon in the habit of having goods sent to your house for him?—Yes. Can you state why he had them sent to your house?—For his own convenience, not for any profit for me. You deal largely in all drapery goods?—Yes, I have done so for the last 18 years. Do you buy any goods of the large wholesale dealers of repute in London?—I have not done so for some years. The only consideration I suppose with you when you purchase goods is, whether it is worth your while or not to buy them?—That is my only consideration. I do not trouble myself to inquire into the cause of the sale, so that I buy them of a respectable shopkeeper. Did you take the trouble to inquire into the respectability of Peters before you dealt with him?—No, I did not; from the position he appeared to hold I thought there was no necessity to do so."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The examination of James Simeon, on</hi> 12<hi rend="italic">th May</hi>, 1854, <hi rend="italic">was read, as follows:</hi>—-"James Simeon, at present of No. 10, Bedford-street, Covent-garden, in the County of Middlesex, and of Melbourne, Port Philip, merchant, being sworn and examined at the time and place above-mentioned, upon his oath saith as follows:—I arrived in England per the <hi rend="italic">Sarah Sands</hi> steamer, from Port Philip, about the latter end of May last, with the intention of settling here, and educating my children, and shipping goods to my house at Melbourne. I have been resident as a merchant at Melbourne for about 15 years, alone, until just previous to my leaving. I am now in partnership with a Mr. Raphael, and my firm is, 'Simeon and Raphael,' in Melbourne. I have not carried on business elsewhere; I have a store at Melbourne, and have had it there for the last 15 years. I am acquainted with many of the well-known firms there; I know Jacob Montefiore, of Melbourne; I don't know whether he is connected with the firm of Montefiore, Graham, and Co., at that place. Most of the merchants at Melbourne know me. Mr. Westgarth, of the firm of Westgarth, Ross, and Co., is, I believe, in this country, to whom I am known. I can't say that I am particularly known to any of the Australian houses in this country. I buy goods, and pay for them by money or check; and it is not material to me to make myself known to them. My business at Melbourne is to receive goods on my own account I have not received my remittances or rents from Australia, and I am in consequence returning there. When I myself was at Melbourne, my business was the purchasing of goods in the Colonies to resell there. I have never made any consignment of goods from the Colonies to this country. I have no business correspondent here. After I came to London, about July, I took a small office or counting-house at No. 21, St. Mary Axe, for the purpose of my business, having previously taken a house and furnished it at No. 8, Bloomsbury-street, at which latter</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185407030042"/>
               <p>place I continued to live until a few weeks of my leaving, when I removed to my present apartments; No. 21, is next door to Mr. Moss Hart's, in St. Mary Axe. Before I took that counting-house, I did not know Moss Hart, and I do not recollect to have previously seen him. I am not at all connected with Mr. Hart in business. I have bought goods of Hart. I produce 2 invoices of goods which I purchased of Hart, which are marked respectively 'A' and 'B;' I have no recollection of any other transactions with Hart, excepting one of some handkerchiefs, to the value of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., according to the best of my recollection, which went by the <hi rend="italic">Mirzapore</hi>, which sailed from London in September last; and some lace, which went by the Colonist to Hobart Town, long before September last. I now recollect that the 2 invoices which I have produced, 'A' and 'B,' re<lb/>present the only purchases which I have made of Hart, since September last; the handkerchiefs I was taking out in the <hi rend="italic">Great Britain</hi>, are packed in my trunk, and form part of my luggage, together with some other small parcels of merchandize. I have made many shipments by other vessels since September last, but I cannot from memory detail all of them; my young man will tell you better than I can. I always shipped through the agents of the respective ships. I have only employed two packers to pack my goods; Watson and Clark, and Mr. Britten. They have not packed all my goods; the venders did it sometimes. I have purchased goods of J. J. Wilson and Co., of Kynaston and Co., Fox in Basinghall-street, and other parties who have packed goods for me. I never bought goods of Hart save those I have previously mentioned. He has introduced me to other persons of whom I have purchased goods, and I have allowed him a commission for the introduction, and the others did the same. As I was a stranger here, and unacquainted with houses of business, I accordingly paid Hart a commission for introducing me. Hart introduced me to Grant Brothers, tie and cravat manufacturers. I can't think of any other now, but I will furnish you with more particulars of them through my attorney; my purchases were always for cash. Hart has done no other business for me, save what I have before stated. I became acquainted with the bankrupt on the 6th February last, by the introduction of Hart, at Southampton; Mr. Hart induced me to go to Southampton. He said he could recommend me to a party that had some goods for sale there; I can't recollect that he said anything else to induce me to visit Southampton. He did not to my knowledge mention the name of Peters to me before I went to Southampton. He did not tell me that he had made any purchases of Peters himself He told me what sort of goods the party had for sale there; they were the description of goods which I was anxious to buy. I now recollect more particularly the circumstances. Hart went with me to Kynaston's, to buy carpets and rugs; I looked at some, but I thought them dear, and I said they were too dear. When we came out of Kynas<lb/>ton's, Hart told me that he would take me to a place where I could get them cheaper, if I would allow him a good commission. I think this occurred on a Friday. On the following Monday, when I saw Hart, he told me if I would go with him he would take me where I could buy those goods he spoke to me about. He then told me it was at Southampton, but did not give me the name of the party, nor any other information to induce me to go to Southampton. I consented to accompany him; and we accordingly went that day, the 6th February last, and returned to London the same evening by the mail-train. After I had completed my purchase of Peters, Hart returned with me to London. We arrived at Peters' at about 1 o'clock.</p>

               <p>We saw Peters standing at the draper's shop door. Hart introduced me to him. Peters then said, 'I can't attend to you now, but if you will come in an hour I shall be ready for you.' That was all that took place at that interview. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I wish you to consider carefully, and to add anything that you may think necessary to your last answer, viz., 'Peters then said, I can't attend to you now, but if you will come in an hour I shall be ready for you;' that was all that took place at that inter<lb/>view?—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was not said by Peters to me, but a few words on that occasion passed between Hart and Peters, which I did not overhear; and Hart then represented to me that Peters had said, 'I can't attend to you now, but if you will come in an hour I shall be ready for you.' That inter<lb/>view occupied but a moment. I afterwards, in about an hour, returned with Hart to Peters. We then went into his furnishing and carpet shop. Some conversation then took place between Hart and Peters, which I did not hear. They were a few minutes together alone. I was then called into the ware-room with them. Peters then showed me some carpeting and rugs, or cloth; I can't say which first. He then asked me if I would purchase some shawls; I answered him 'Yes.' He also asked me to purchase other goods, and I answered also 'Yes.' The goods I proposed to purchase were, I believe, distributed amongst the stock: I selected the carpets and rugs from the stock, and they were put apart for sale to me. I also selected all the articles specified in the invoice marked 'C,' and now produced as being those I was willing to purchase. Peters entered these in a book, and put prices against each item, and added them up; and I believe they amounted to about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. according to his prices, and he asked me that price for them, I then made my calculation of what I was willing to give for each item, and the total amounted to about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I offered him 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 260<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or there-abouts; he declined to accept that sum. I did not think they were worth more to me, and went away with Hart for about an hour. I did not think them worth more than I offered, because some were damaged and others soiled. Hart persuaded me to go back, and to give 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them. Hart told me he thought the goods were worth a little more, and induced me to offer the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them. I went back with Hart to the same place; Peters was not there then, but was sent for, and came to us. When Peters came back, I offered him 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the goods. I mean to say that Peters, before I left the shop the first time, had offered me the goods for that sum. On his coming to me after my return to the shop, I offered him 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but said I would have a discount of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent for cash. Peters objected to this, and I again went out of the shop; I had not gone twenty yards, when either a shopman or Mr. Hart called me back. I returned, and went into the warehouse; Peters and Hart were there when I returned. Mr. Hart, as well as I remember, then said, what is the use of being so particular about a bargain? I then told Mr. Hart I would pay him for his trouble, and have nothing more to do with it. When I made that reply, Hart said to me, what is the use of splitting straws? and Hart thereby suggested that Mr. Peters should throw two pieces of carpet into the bargain, in lieu of discount; and upon that I consented to give 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the goods. The invoice was then made out; I paid the money, and took Peters's receipt for the amount. I mean to say the goods were first packed and sent to Pick<lb/>ford's, and when I saw them carted I paid the money; this might have been between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening; I can't say positively as to the hour, but when the goods were sent away it was gas light. The goods were not measured in my presence; but I took Peters's word, as a respectable</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185407030044"/>
               <p>man, for the lengths. The goods were forwarded by Pickford's to my private house, No. 8, Bloomsbury-street, aforesaid. All the goods I pur<lb/>chased of Peters were in the same warehouse where I purchased them; at least, I say this to the best of my belief. All those goods were sent in the same condition as I purchased them, to Mr. Britten's, to pack. How happened it that these goods were addressed to your private house, and not to your place of business, or to your packer's, Mr. Britten's?—The goods were not addressed till they reached Pickford's; I accompanied them there. It was then a few minutes of the mail train starting, and I then gave to the clerk a card, and requested him to address them. I gave him by mistake my card of my private house, instead of Mr. Britten's, the packer's, address. These goods arrived at my house about 5 o'clock in the evening; and on the next day, after their receipt, I went to Britten's, and directed them to send for them, and they did so on the next day. These goods were all packed by Britten, and sent by the <hi rend="italic">Harbinger.</hi> They were not the only goods I shipped by the <hi rend="italic">Harbinger;</hi> I shipped other goods by that vessel to the value of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I believe Britten packed other goods besides those I purchased of Peters for the <hi rend="italic">Harbinger.</hi> Without pledging myself to the accuracy of the exhibit' D,' now produced as being a true extract from Britten's books, according to the best of my belief the goods therein mentioned are the goods I bought of Peters. Those cases contain other goods besides those I purchased of Peters; at least, I think that is probable, but I believe they contain all the goods which I purchased from Peters. I have not transmitted a copy of the in<lb/>voice I had from Peters with the goods for the <hi rend="italic">Harbinger;</hi> my reason was, that I consigned them to myself at Melbourne, and expected to arrive there before the goods. I purchased them on my own account, and not on account of my firm. I have not entered the invoice I received from Peters, in any book, I keep no books; I mean by that, I do not keep a regular set of mer<lb/>chant's books, but I do keep a book called a journal, or rough invoice book, in which I enter the contents of the cases and particulars of the goods sent to the Colonies. Did you ever show the invoice marked 'C' to your clerk Mower?—I can't say that I ever did. I think I heard from Hart that he had done business with the bankrupt, that was how I was introduced to him; this occurred on our journey to Southampton. I did not learn from Hart the particulars, but he told me he had purchased goods of him. I never heard from Hart since my journey with him to Southampton that he, Hart, had had any dealings with Peters; what he did say of Peters was said only on that journey; excepting the one transaction before referred to, I never had any dealings with the bankrupt, nor have I ever seen him since that occasion until yesterday. I never in my life, to my knowledge, received goods at my place in St. Mary Axe belonging to Hart, for Hart, nor were any goods ever addressed there for Hart, to my knowledge. If such has been the case it has been without my knowledge or consent. If any goods were addressed to me at St. Mary Axe, my place of business, from Southamp<lb/>ton, on or about the 27th February last, the 3rd, 4th, 11th, 13th, 17th, and 18th days of March last respectively, it was without my knowledge or privity, and no such goods were, with my knowledge or privity, received by me or at my place of business at St. Mary Axe aforesaid. I never heard, until yesterday, that Hart had caused goods to be addressed to me at St. Mary Axe or elsewhere; what I did hear yesterday about it I heard from my clerk Mower. I saw Hart last at Liverpool, about the 1st May; I met him. I do not know where he now is. I have had no communication with, nor have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185407030045"/>
               <p>I heard from Hart, since I last saw him at Liverpool. I can't tell you if the book previously referred to, contains the particulars of the goods I bought of Peters. I will with pleasure, if required, at the expense of the assignees, go to Liverpool and bring up those books, and give you the benefit of their contents without prejudice to myself In what capacity did you go to the Australian Colonies?—I was sent for by my uncle, of Hobart Town. Messrs. Moses, Son, and Davis, of Aldgate, as my uncle's agents, paid my passage money out. I have looked on the anonymous letter marked' E,' now exhibited; all therein stated with regard to my character is positively untrue. The Mr. Moss mentioned in that letter lives at No. 24, St. Mary Axe, is a looking-glass manufacturer, and his Christian name is Emanuel. I have occasionally, since I have been in England, purchased job lots of small dealers."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">A further examination of James Simeon, on</hi> 16<hi rend="italic">th May</hi>, 1854, <hi rend="italic">was read, as follows:</hi> "I have been in Liverpool since I was last examined in this matter, and now have my books and papers, at least, I believe all; I have not undone them, nor do I now produce them, but they shall be produced to Mr. Van Sandau, at his office, to morrow. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know the signature on the South Western Hallway delivery voucher, dated the 28th February last, of 'J. Simeon?'—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never saw the writing before'; nor the writing of the name,' Simeon,' on the voucher dated the 2nd March last; nor the name, 'Simeon,' on the voucher dated the 3rd March last; nor the name, 'Simeon,' on the voucher dated the 4th March last; nor the name, 'Simeon,' on the voucher dated the 13th March last; the signature, 'C. R. Mower,' to the voucher dated the 18th March last, is like Henry clerk's, it looks' certainly something like his; I do not know the signature, 'J. Simeon,' on the voucher dated March last. Do you know the writing of Moss Hart, or of Sophia Hart, his wife?—I don't think I could swear to Hart's writing, and I never saw Sophia Hart write in my life; I have looked at the several signatures, 'S. Hart,' 'M. Hart,' 'Simeon,' and 'J. Simeon,' on the several vouchers produced to me, and I can positively swear that none of them are of my handwriting, and I cannot swear as to my belief or otherwise whether; any of them are in the handwriting of Moss Hart or his wife. Have you frequently seen the handwriting of Moss Hart?—Not frequently; but I have two invoices of his now in my attornies' possession. Have you seen Mr. Hart write occasionally?—I cannot tax my memory that I have done so; I may have done so, but I have not taken particular notice of his manner of handwriting. Did you ever know of goods or packages being addressed to you, or in your name, for Hart?—No, certainly not. Did you ever hear from Hart, or any one else, that goods or packages had been brought by the railway carriers addressed to you, but which were intended for Hart?—Yes, on one occasion; I believe it was after I was examined at the Justice-room, on Thursday last, and before I was examined here, on Friday. Mower, my late clerk, mentioned to me that on one occasion goods had come addressed to me, and which had been delivered at Hart's; I then asked my clerk why he had not previously mentioned it to me, and he told me he attached so little importance to it, or words to that effect, that he had not thought it worth while to mention it If goods were bought in your name by Hart, was it with your privity or consent?—Certainly not. Did Hart ever offer to you large parcels of goods which he had purchased of Peters?—I can't answer that; he has very frequently offered me goods for sale, but I cannot say whether they came from Peters. Did he ever show you invoices he had of goods bought of Peters, and offer them to you for</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185407030046"/>
               <p>sale?—When he has offered me goods he has had papers in his hands, but I can't say if they were invoices of Peters, or not; I simply saw that the goods were not of that class I required. When Hart went with you to Southampton, and you made your purchase of Peters mentioned in your former examination, what payment did you make to Hart for his trouble and the introduction?—20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Has there not been a great intimacy between you and Hart?—Yes, we have been very friendly. Have you not spent many hours together, of a day with him?—When I have had no business to attend to I have been very glad of his society. Did not that occur frequently?—Fre<lb/>quently; I was with him and went about with him; this may have been almost daily."</p>

                  </hi>. I was clerk to Mr. Simeon; I first became so about July last year; his office was at No. 20, St. Mary Axe; his house was No. 8, Bloomsbury-street, New Oxford-street; he carried on the busi<lb/>ness of a general agent, a general merchant. He knew Hart—Hart lived next door, at No. 21, St. Mary Axe—Simeon used to be very often at Hart's—he had a room at Hart's, where he had his goods delivered, left there for safe custody—I do not myself remember any goods coming to Simeon's private house; but Mr. Simeon told me that some goods had arrived—that was about Jan. or Feb., I think—it might have been Jan., Feb., or March—I do not know how the goods were packed—I did not see them when they arrived at the private house—I did not see them afterwards—I heard from Mr. Simeon that they were packed up, and sent by the <hi rend="italic">Harbinger;</hi> they were packed by Britten's, of Basinghall-street—Simeon told me that he had those goods from the country—he did not say where-abouts in the country at that time—he told me to tell Brittens to send their cart for some goods that he had received from the country—I told Brittens that—he did not show me any invoice—I asked for one at the time of making out the account, the general shipment; I generally made out a shipment account for each ship—he told me to make out the account of the shipment by the ship <hi rend="italic">Harbinger</hi>—I told him that I could not do so, because I had had no account of those goods that he had received from the country—I had no invoice from him—he said he had lost it in the railway train coming up from the country—I did not make out any account at that time; it was put off for that day—I afterwards made a list of them—I made it from an account that Mr. Hart gave me—I went to Mr. Hart's, by Mr. Simeon's direction—he told me to go to Hart's, and he would give me an account of the goods—I went, and Hart gave me the particulars; I put them down from his dictation—he read from a paper that he had in his hand; I saw the paper—I wrote down what he read on a sheet of paper that he gave me, and afterwards copied that into a book—I gave both the paper and the book to Mr. Simeon.</p>

The witness to whom it was made was not a person in any authority as a policeman or prosecutor, so that nothing he could say could be likely to operate as a threat or promise; he was merely sent to make inquiry as to the bank<lb/>rupt's affairs, and therefore no communication to him could be considered as privileged.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">also contended that the statement was admis<lb/>sible. The rule which excluded evidence of this description, was framed upon the notion that any threat or promise made, was likely to elicit not truth but falsehood. Here the only suggestion made was that the bankrupt should dis<lb/>close the true state of his affairs, and if the truth was thus obtained it ought not to be excluded. In Reg. v. Clewes, where the inducement held out was much stronger than in the present case, evidence of this nature was received.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">was clearly of opinion that the statement could not be given in evidence. The argument of Mr. Ballantine went to set aside the rule altogether; but it had been repeatedly held that a statement made after threats had been held out by a person in a certain position of authority, were not admissible in evidence. In this case a threat of the nature stated, from a person in the position of the witness, would be infinitely more likely to have effect than from a policeman or any other person—he could not understand the grounds of the decision in the case referred to, but he was decidedly of opinion that the statement ought not to be received.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Mr. Peters's employ from Sept. until the time of his bankruptcy—I know Moss Hart, he was often in the habit of being at Mr. Peters's; every fortnight or three weeks, or more—I remember goods being sent away from Mr. Peters's; they were sent away in trusses occa<lb/>sionally; I remember those same goods being sent to Mr. Peters—I do not know whether they had been unpacked between the time of their coming and the time of their being sent away; they were directed to Mr. Hart, or Mr. Simeon—I do not know what goods were in the trusses; Hart was present the same day that the goods were sent away—I recollect some car<lb/>pets being sent away in Jan. or Feb., in Pickford's wagon; the wagon came to the door for them—Hart accompanied the wagon in which they went away; those goods were not packed up before they were sent away—I had not seen Simeon at Mr. Peters's at that time—he had been there once.</p>

                  </hi>. I went as apprentice to Mr. Peters in Oct., it was a retail business—I have seen Mr. Hart there often, and have known of goods being sold to him, I cannot say how often—they were in small quantities at different times, but none in very large quantities—I do not recollect two or three large packages coming somewhere about Feb.—I recollect packages coming down several times—I do not recollect any packages being sent away without being unpacked, only to the creditors; they were returned—no one told me that—I was examined at Guildhall; I made a mistake there in saying that the packages were returned to Mr. Hart or Simeon; they were returned to the creditors a few days before possession was taken—I had seen Simeon at my master's before those trusses were sent back to the creditors; it might have been two months before that—I had not seen him recently before—I directed three cards to Mr. Hart, and they were put on the trusses—the goods were not sent back to the creditors with those cards put on them, these were goods taken out of stock; I do not know in what month, it might have been a month before the bank<lb/>ruptcy—a day or two after I had left Guildhall, I found out that I had made a mistake, and I told Mr. Peters's attorney so, Mr. Fitch—he sent for me and I saw him at Southampton, and then I found out that I had made a mistake at Guildhall.</p>

               <p>few days before possession was taken—Mr. Hopkins, Mr. Peters's assistant, directed them—I am now living at home with my parents at Farringdon, they live independent now—I was rather frightened at Gnildhall, a ques<lb/>tion containing the answer almost was put into my mouth, and I said, "Yes"—when Mr. Fitch sent for me at Southampton, I told him this without being questioned—I was apprenticed to Mr. Peters, and have lost the benefit of my apprenticeship.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the Eastern Counties Railway Police. On 16th June, about 20 minutes to 5 o'clock in the morning, I received instructions, and saw Driver on a van with two horses, which was coming out of the terminus, loaded with packages of fish—he took up Ivans on the van, and then drove at a very rapid pace along Norton-folgate and Bishopsgate-street; there was nothing unusual in the pace—Ivans seated himself on the back of the load; I ran all the way, and saw him open several packages, and put what he took out into something which he had—he then shifted his position about on the top of the load, and continued opening the packages until he got into Houndsditch, when Driver putted up the horses by Aldgate church, and Ivans handed him a large bundle of something, which he put under the footboard; I afterwards found a sack there, which I believe to be what I saw—Ivans did not get down, but he moved on to the box and rode with Driver; he got down at the top of St. Dunstan's-hill, locked the wheel, and then went to the bottom of St. Dunstan's-hill; when the van got there, he took the chain off—I then saw him looking towards me, and I think, from his sudden disappearance, that he saw me, for he ran into the market—when the van stopped at the market, I went to the footboard, took a bundle from the driving-box, just behind the driver's feet, and found twenty-one mackerel in it, which were afterwards produced at the Mansion-house—I asked him how he came to have them there; he said he did not know; he knew nothing at all about it—I asked him where the boy was, who he had taken up; he said he had gone somewhere, he did not know where; that the boy threw a sack up on the load, at Shoreditch station, as soon as the van was loaded, and got up himself; and that he did not put the fish there, and he did not know who did—I took him into cus<lb/>tody—I took Ivans three days afterwards at his father's house, and told him</p>

I am the master of the barque <hi rend="italic">Albert</hi>, lying in the London Bocks—she arrived on 16th June—the deceased, Charles Heckley, was first mate—the prisoner was cook—on 16th March the ship was lying at a place called Appevista, on the coast of Africa; that is on the high seas—I was writing in the cabin, about a quarter past 9 o'clock in the evening, and heard a scuffle—I sent somebody to see what it was, and then went on deck—there is a ladder, up which you have to go from the deck to the poop, which is raised between four and five feet above the main deck—as I came out of the cabin I saw the mate staggering towards me; he appeared much intoxicated, and was on the steps to go down to the cabin—I said, "Mr. Heckley, you don't go down into the cabin in that state, to make the cabin in a mess"—the prisoner, who was behind him, snatched hold of his belt, which was round his waist, and dragged him very fast from the companion towards the edge of the poop—there is a rail there, but not across the gangway—I cried out, "Leave the mate alone! don't strike him"—I was afraid he had been thrashing him, because he was throwing himself about very furiously—the prisoner left him alone for a second or two, and the mate turned round and stepped into the front of the poop from two steps of the ladder going down to the main deck—he still appeared to be in a state of intoxication—he stood on the front of the poop, and was aiming a blow at the prisoner, and I being behind the prisoner, expected the blow as well, therefore I turned over from the larboard side to the starboard, and as I was crossing the deck I heard the mate fall from the poop on to the main deck—I then went, and saw him lying down on the main deck—I went down on the main deck, and said, "Mr. Heckley, this is very bad conduct of you"—he made no reply—he was lying on his back, with his face upwards—I did not speak to him a second time, I touched him—he was very much flushed in the face, and mutilated rather about the cheek bone and about the lips; I mean bruised; it was black, and swollen about the lips and both cheek bones—I called the second mate and the carpenter—I raised the deceased's head and shoulders, and tried every means to animate him, but was not able to do so—he died about a minute or more after I first went to him—I examined him, and found two small wounds on his eyebrows, which I compassed next morning with the prongs of the cook's tormentors, which is a sort of fork to get meat up with, and found that they were rather nearer together than the prongs, but I can account for that by the prongs contract<lb/>ing a little (I had not seen any fork in the prisoner's hand on this occasion)—they were not serious wounds—I rather think his nose was broken—he became discoloured behind the ears immediately after I went to him—I tried a blood vessel on the arm, but the blood would not flow—I know, from the prisoner's statement to me in the afternoon, that there had been a quarrel between him and the mate; he said that the night previous the mate had gone forward about midnight and thrown a deal of dirty water on his bed—I told him to go to his cook's house, and not to speak to the mate at present, as I thought he was rather intoxicated, and I did not wish to broach the subject; that was about 2 o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

O my God, give me strength to go through it!"—before I heard those words I heard a faint noise in the room, the same as before, but not so much as before—I met <hi rend="italic">Tommy</hi> in the passage with the brandy; he went up stairs, and I heard him cry, and his mother cry, and just after<lb/>wards she went out of the house—I looked out of the window, and saw her pass with the child in her arms, with something over it—she said the child was convulsed, and had got the rattle in its throat, but I did not speak to her—she went towards the hospital.</p>

I recollect the child being brought there by the prisoner, I saw it directly—it was dead—(it was as near as possible 6 o'clock in the afternoon)—it had a horizontal wound about two and a half inches long, and three quarters of an inch wide, directly across the forehead; the bone was exposed by the wound—there was also a severe contusion on the head, about two inches above the ear; the upper lip was much contused and swollen, and there were bruises about the face and the body generally, but not serious ones; and various scratches—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination; on removing the scalp I found contusions almost all over the head, both the sides and the posterior part—on removing the skull cap I found extensive extravasation and blood on the surface, and in the membranes of the brain; particularly on the left side, and about an ounce of blood effused on the posterior part immediately, behind the head—the ventricles of the brain were full of bloody serum, but in other respects the brain was healthy, and the other organs of the body were generally healthy; the heart was quite healthy—some of the mesenteric glands were enlarged, and the liver was enlarged—I attribute death to concussion of the brain, with extravasation of blood—they were such injuries as would be produced by a child being thrown on the floor or against anything.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the wound on the forehead the principal cause of death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it was of secondary importance—it went directly across the forehead, and had completely torn the flesh—this wound contributed but slightly to cause death; there was no extravasation corresponding to it on the brain.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer, and live in Chancery-lane. On 13th May I was chief engineer on board the steamer <hi rend="italic">Karl Johann</hi>—we went down to see the launch of the <hi rend="italic">Royal Albert</hi>, at Woolwich—about 3 o'clock that afternoon there was a barge along side of us—the <hi rend="italic">Royal Albert</hi> had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185407030069"/>
               <p>been launched—the barge had been about a minute alongside of us when an escape of steam took place from the engine—I was at that time very near the steam chest—that escape of steam was accidental—the steam was then just rising—I think there were persons standing close to the valve, but I cannot say—I was very near the valve; so near as to be wetted by the escape—all the people who were near got wetted—I got to the valve, knowing it was likely to stick—we had not put the complement of weights on it—I stopped it, and I had not been away half a minute when it rose again; I went and put a weight on it—the defendant was in the barge alongside of us, seven or eight yards from us, and I had just left the valve when I saw the defendant distinctly level a bottle at me, and I received a violent blow on my head—I have not the least doubt it was him that threw it—the top of my ear was cut and hung right over, and my head has a severe cut in it—I am suffering from it to the present day—I have been obliged to place myself under medical treatment—I could not attend to business for a fortnight—I did not cause the escape of this steam—is was from natural causes—when a steamer stands by long, there is an accumu<lb/>lation of water at the top of the valve, and when the steam rises it comes out.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this what is commonly called a safety valve? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; a safety valve passes to the escape pipe—there is nothing to cover the top of the escape pipe—I went to put down the valve with my hand—on raising the valve the steam would get into the escape pipe—there is a handle, and a piece of iron projects to close the pipe—it should have had weights on it, but it had but one—when I went to it the second time I hung on another weight—that was just prior to my receiving the blow—when I went to it the first time, I merely put my hand to it to put the valve down—there is a handle and a lever beside, which I should call a fixed lever—I touched the lever—I did not touch the other—the one that I did not touch is far raising the valve or pressing it down—I pressed it down, which would close it—it is a usual thing for the steam to escape when the steam is rising—there was only one weight on the valve instead of three—if we were moving or going to move, there ought to have been three weights—I had given instruction to get the steam up; it would have taken about a quarter of an hour to get it up—the weights would not have been put on till we were going to move—when I received the blow, I had just left the lever—the barge was near our stern, I do not think she touched the stem—she was near us—it was on the same side that the chest was that I was standing near—I was on the port side—the right—the other is the starboard side—I was on the right hand side of the steam chest, which extends to the stern of the vessel—it is round the funnel, but it is more toward the stern than the front—while I was touching the fixed lever, my back was partly towards the barge—I was struck on the right ear as I was leaving the lever—the people on the barge complained of being wetted—there were some ladies on board—I suppose there was a refreshment there—the steam, however, it escaped, wetted the people on board the barge, and us too—there must have been water collected in the escape pipe, and the steam rushing out would be turned into water, so that altogether there would be a considerable quan<lb/>tity of water thrown on the people—when the first escape took place, I went to the valve—the second escape was after I touched it—but it stopped immediately after I touched it—on the second escape little came out—I touched it twice, only to put it down—on its rising the second time, I touched it again, and put a weight on it, and then I was struck—I saw the</p>

               <p>defendant with a bottle in his hand, I think it was—it appeared to be a ginger beer bottle—I saw him raise his hand and throw it at me—I was struck immediately on leaving the valve—I think there were many persons near the defendant—I noticed him—I did not notice any one else—I did not hear the defendant say anything before I was struck.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer, and reside at Islington. I was on board the steamboat—I did not see the first escape of steam; I saw the second—I saw the effect of the first escape on the persons in the other boat—there were very few wetted on board our boat, because there were very few persons on board—the persons who were there were wetted, and it wetted the decks—I did not see Mr. Grafton go to the valve to stop it—I saw him at it, and he appeared to me to be endeavouring to close the valve—just as he left the valve, the bottle struck him, and cut the top of his ear, and he stooped and picked the bottle up—I did not see the bottle thrown; I saw the direction in which it came; it came from the direction of the barge—I saw the defendant on board the barge immediately after Mr. Grafton was struck, and the defendant instantly addressed me, and said he would give me another, or he would give me one too, holding another bottle of this descrip<lb/>tion in his hand—I had not the misfortune to receive another—an escape of steam is a matter which may accidentally take place—it always takes place when the steam rises to a certain pitch—this was quite an accidental escape—nothing took place to indicate that the escape was caused by premedi<lb/>tation of anybody.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Woolwich, and am collector of rents on the estate upon which Lyme Cottage is situated—it was untenanted on 9th June—I was there on Thursday June 6th, and saw the copper and the lead quite safe; they were fixed to the premises—on Friday June 9th, about 6 o'clock in the afternoon, I was going there, and when I was within a few yards of the cottage, I saw the two prisoners coming through a gap in the hedge with the copper (the house stands about fifty yards from the road); the gap in the hedge is about two yards from the garden wall, which is about four feet high at the back, and ten feet at the front—a person after getting through the gap, could not get to the house without getting over the back garden wall—I knew the copper when I saw it, but I said nothing to the prisoners, but opened the garden gate, run down to the bath house, and found the window open, and the front door forced open—it is a' brick building in the garden—I had the keys with me—I then went after the prisoners, and found them on the turnpike road carrying the copper—I asked them where they got it; Cope said they found it in the <hi rend="italic">hollow</hi>, where they had gone to gather elder blossoms—they both said that—I told them it had been stolen from premises which I had charge of—they said that I knew them both, and I could not suppose that they would steal the copper—they are both tenants on the estate—one rents a piece of ground, and the other a cottage and garden—they said that rather than get into trouble, they would take the copper back to where they found it; and in order to gain time for a policeman to come, I told them to take it back to where they found it, which they did—they took it through the gap in the hedge. I found the</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge at No. 2, Reed's-place, Newington-causeway. Mrs. Rose Murray was the owner of that house—she was a widow—she occupied the back room on the ground floor—the prisoner occupied the front room on the ground floor in June last—there were other lodgers in different rooms in the house, and amongst them was a brother of the prisoner, who lived in a room up stairs—I do not know how long the prisoner had been lodging in the house; I believe four or five years—I have only been there three or four months—he was there when I came—on the morning of 7th June I was awoke by Mrs. Larter, a lodger in the house, about half past 5 o'clock—I got out of bed—Mrs. Larter called me, and returned to her bed—I went to the stairs, and saw the deceased, Mrs. Murray, two steps up the stairs from the ground floor—she was trying to get up the stairs, with her legs and hands on the stairs, trying to walk up as well as she could—she was in her night dress—the prisoner was close behind her, on the floor—I saw him draw a knife across her left thigh, and she fell back, down the three steps—the prisoner had all his clothes on, and his hat—he then walked towards the front door—I ran down, and caught hold of Mrs. Murray's left hand—I looked along the passage, and the prisoner had a clasp knife in his hand; he drew it through his hand, shut it, and put it into his pocket—there was a sound proceeding from the deceased, like a gurgling in her throat, when I had got hold of her left hand—she was not able to speak—the prisoner came back while I had hold of her left hand—he put the knife</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185407030082"/>
               <p>into his pocket, and said to me, "Mr. Puxty, the <hi rend="italic">big bear</hi> has done it"—the prisoner's brother came down the stairs—I went at once for a surgeon; I could not find one—I went to the station, and a police sergeant came back with me to the house—when I came back the prisoner was standing at the door—the policeman said, "Who has done it?" and the prisoner made answer, "I have done it"—he was then taken into custody—the deceased was lying in the same place, at the foot of the stairs, where I had left her—there was a great deal of blood about the place—she was taken to bed—she had not quite done breathing, but she was dead before she was on the bed—I went into the bedroom—there was blood on the bed and on the floor—she was conveyed into the other room, not into the same bed that she slept in—the surgeon soon after came, and examined the body.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Mrs. Murray was the best friend the prisoner had in the world? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and she was very fond of him—I have observed in the latter part of the time that his conduct and manner have changed very much, and I told both his brother and Mrs. Murray that he ought</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185407030083"/>
               <p>to be put under restraint; and I begged of Mrs. Murray to do so—she was like a mother to him—when she was told he ought to be put under restraint she did not like to do it—I have said it repeatedly within the last five or six or eight months before Christmas—it was my impression from the observation I made on his conduct, that he was not in his sound senses—I expected some mischief either on himself or some one else—I heard him talk about the <hi rend="italic">Great bear</hi>—he said, "I'll not be amongst the Russians; I'll not be a Great bear; you'll be a <hi rend="italic">Great bear</hi>, and Mrs. Murray will be a Great bear" and at this time I noticed his appearance was wild—he would pass my door and not speak, and he would raise his two hands as though he was dreading something coming after him.</p>

I sleep in a shed of his—I went there last Saturday night, and saw the prisoner there—I asked him what he was doing there—he said he came to lie there for the night—I said that was not a place for anybody to lie—I told him to come and lie on the green grass—I brought him out of the shed, and told him to pull out some from the side, and make a bed and lie down—about 8 o'clock the next morning I said to him, "Are you going to lie here all day?"—I said, "Are you at work here?"—he said, "No, I can't get work"—he swore at the country, and said he could not get work, and he had no money—I took out a small loaf and gave him half of it, and he went away.</p>
