                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The direction of the wound was from front to back—if the pistol was fired from the back it must have made a wound in an opposite direction—grains of gunpowder cannot be washed out of the skin—the wound was a <hi rend="italic">cul-de-sac</hi>—the bullet would have to come back to get out—a sharp stone could have caused the wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The direction of the wound was consistent with the man standing on the girl's right side—it would be possible to wash out the discolouration from the smoke of the revolver—there are small toy revolvers which throw no powder at all.</p>

If I had not heard anything about shooting I should have said that something had penetrated the skin—if it had been a stone it would make a big bruise, and if it was a sharp stone it would scratch the skin—a fall on a spike might have caused it, or any sharp instrument, except a knife—it had not the appearance of a knife—it would have to be something larger than a pin.</p>

On April 9th I went to Smith's coffee-house, Broadway, London Fields, about 12.30—I told Lewis I should take him into custody for being concerned with others in wounding two men and a woman at Lea Bridge Road on Bank Holiday—he said, "They put <hi rend="italic">Denny</hi> Winn through it; I was there, but I did not hit him; he asked for it; if there is anything done it is always put on to me"—he was taken to the station and identified by Winn from a number of others—when the charge was read over to him he said, "Palmer does not say</p>

               <p>that I hit him"—he was charged with being concerned with others in wounding Winn, Mrs Winn, and Palmer—on April 10th, about 6 p.m. I saw Millard at the Police-station—I told him he would be placed amongst others for identification for being concerned, with Lewis, in custody, and others not in custody, in wounding two men and a woman in Lea Bridge Road on the previous Monday—he said, "I can prove an <hi rend="italic">alibi;</hi> that is easily done"—when the charge was read over he made no reply—he was identified by Winn and Hull.</p>

I am a registered practitioner, and assistant medical officer at the Hackney Infirmary—I examined Daniel Winn there about 5.30 on Easter Monday—he had a scalp wound on the left side of his head, an incised wound on his left temple, and a straight transverse cut on the first finger of his left hand—they could be pro<lb/>duced by some sharp instrument.</p>

               <p>April 17th, about 6.15 p.m., I was in St. Martin's Lane, walking towards Charing Cross; a man struck me, snatched my watch and chain, and ran up a court—I followed him, and found it led into another court, and came back to St. Martin's Lane, shouted, "Police!" and went to Bow Street and gave a description—the following Monday, April 22nd, a constable fetched me to Bow Street, where I recognised the prisoner's face and the back of his neck from eight or nine men.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the Islington branch of the Capital and Counties Bank—early in January the prisoner called and said that he had come into the neighbourhood, and had taken a public-house, and that he had property at Brighton—I did not know him at all—his brother-in-law, Mr. Medcalfe, the manager of a public-house, has been a customer of ours for 14 years, and that was the reference he gave—he said his property at Brighton, four freehold houses, was mortgaged for ₤900, and he wished the bank to advance ₤900 to pay off the mortgage, and that when he took the public-house he might need a small temporary advance—the name of the public-house was the Rodney—I said that the matter would be looked into if there was a margin on the house—he was going to transfer the mortgage to the bank—nothing has come of it—on February 18th he called again and said, "I have sold the Rodney at a profit of ₤500 without going in, which sum I shall pay into the bank to my credit"—I believed that statement and allowed him to take a cheque-book of 12 cheques—this is it (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—on the following day I cashed this cheque for him for ₤5, which came out of the book—on February 25th I cashed this cheque for ₤15 across the counter; that came out of the book—a day or two afterwards he came again and said he had been obliged to take the purchase money in bills, and on March 9th he brought me these bills (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), amounting to ₤350, which he said was part of the purchase money; they are three, six, nine, and twelve months' bills; they purported to be accepted by "C. Greenfield"—he told me that that was Charles Greenfield, late of Montague Street, Brighton, butcher, but now living at Penge, who had property at Worthing, and he said, "I consider he is as good as the Bank of England"—the bills were in the form of promissory notes when he brought them, "I promise to pay," but they have been altered—the ac<lb/>ceptances were on them then—I wanted that alteration, and on March 11th they were returned to me with this letter: "Dear Sir,—I enclose the bills, I find I made a mistake as regards Mr. Greenfield; he does not live at Worthing, but his property is at Worthing. I will call one day this week and give you a satisfactory reference. W. Young"—I accepted the amended bills as securities, and agreed that he might overdraw ₤20 or ₤30—on March 9th I cashed this cheque for him for ₤5—on March 12th this cheque on Parr's Bank for ₤20 was presented, and I gave him credit for it, and he tendered me this cheque, for which I paid him ₤3—that made ₤30 upon five cheques—four cheques are left in the book, two were returned unpaid—after that date I refused to pay him any more money.</p>

               <p>broker named Rolfe, of Great Russell Street, for ₤9,000, or that he would not give it, and offered ₤8,900—the question of price was not gone into at all—I took no note of what took place, but I made certain notes at the time to give to the manager—I had no personal authority to let him open an account, and obtain an overdraft—that is why I took down the particulars—he mentioned the Bell in February, but he did not say any<lb/>thing about the negotiations for the Rodney's Head being off: he said he had sold it at a profit—he asked me to inspect and view the Bell—I said if the title was shown to be good the bank might, as a temporary matter, lend him ₤200 when he went into the Bell, as a temporary overdraft for the "change"—I cannot say the date when he said he had sold the Rodney for ₤500, and was negotiating for the Bell—we could not arrive at the value of the property, because the mortgagees had been in possession seven years—we never got to the bottom of it—I have never seen the statement—I really mean to say that I gave him the cheque-book on April 18th on his own representation—it was not given in the solicitor's office, that he might draw a cheque for ₤200 as the deposit on the Bell—I did not inquire of the brother-in-law—I called at the Rodney's Head after he had negotiated the bills after March 11th—I let him have the cheque book without any document, and upon his <hi rend="italic">ipse dixit</hi> only—we knew he had property at Brighton, and that it was valued at ₤1,300—we did not know there were three mortgages upon it—we saw him on several occasions about the Brighton property—I do not know that I mentioned on February 18th that we had a difficulty in seeing the deeds—I thought there was no fraud whatever as to the property—the Rodney's Head is about 450 yards from the bank, but I made no inquiries about the sale—I was present when Mr. Hepple was examined at the Police-court—I cannot recollect exactly what he said, but it was that at the end of February the defendant told him he had purchased the Rodney's Head and sold it again, and "expected" to receive a profit—he said to me that he had, in fact, realised ₤500 on it—I mean to represent that Young said that the bills were accepted by <hi rend="italic">Charles</hi> Greenfield—I wrote on March 12th to inquire who the acceptor was, and found that there had been a Mr. Charles Greenfield 20 years before—he had property at Worthing—these bills were accepted at Fortice Road, Paddington Green—I asked him for an explanation, and he said he should have put Greenfield's address, but he often stopped at his brother's, and so gave his address; but I wrote to Worthing because the property was said to be at Worthing—he after<lb/>wards said that they were accepted by Charles Greenfield in his presence—I do not suggest that he asked me to discount the bills—I swore an information on April 13th, and on April 17th I wrote to the prisoner, and said, "I shall be glad if you will meet me at Mr. Hepple's"—that was done at the suggestion of the police, in order that he might be arrested—I should have been satisfied if he had paid the money at any time at the commencement of the criminal proceedings—I named no time; I asked him to name a time.</p>

I am a solicitor, of Frederick Place, Old Jewry—I was instructed to investigate the title to some property at Brighton which the prisoner said belonged to him and his wife—I saw him at the end of February or the beginning of March—he said he had purchased the Rodneys Head—I cannot say definitely whether he mentioned the figure, but he said that he expected to get the amount in cash, but sub<lb/>sequently he said that he should have to take bills for the amount—after the bills had been lodged at the hank I spoke to him about them—he produced a bill-head of a butcher with "15, Montague Street, Worthing," on it—there were a few lines on it to the effect that certain bills would be met at the end of the mouth—he said he would not have taken them if the amount had been guaranteed, and referred to some gentleman of position in the City.</p>

I am assistant resident medical officer at the West Ham Union and Workhouse—I do not remember seeing the child the first time it was admitted—I remember seeing it on April 17th, the day it was discharged—it was then robust and thriving well; with average care it would have lived—it could take its food—I could see no reason whatever why it should not have lived—I next saw it on April 24th—it was very thin and weak, it could hardly take any nourish<lb/>ment, and it had a blister on its cheek, that could have been caused by exposure to the sun—it was weighed the following day—it weighed 9lb. 1oz.—the normal weight of a child of seven months is 15 1/2 lb.—it died on April 27th—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination on May 2nd—I found no traces of any organic disease which would have caused death—it died of inanition or inability to assimulate its food—the condition of the child on April 23rd could have been caused by irregular food and exposure; being fed regularly by the bottle and being cared for would have kept it in sound health—being carried, as the police say it was, having irregular food, and sleeping in empty houses, would be likely to injure its health.</p>

I am the prosecutor's wife, and live at 44, Prince of Wales Road—when I came out of the public-house my husband was talking to Riley—I heard him ask Riley for the purse, as his work ticket was in it—Riley threw it over the school fence, and said he would throw my husband after it, and struck him on the shoulders, and others came on—Castile punched him in the back—I called to another coloured man, "Thomas, Thomas, come quick; my husband is in a fight"—I had a glass in my hand—I made for Castile, who was kicking my husband—Parsons rushed up and caught my wrist, and said, "I will have you arrested for striking me with a glass"—I said, "Oh", master, what would your wife do if she saw five or six men kicking you?"—he rushed to my husband, kicked him with his foot, and said, "You black bastard!" while he was on the ground—Thomas and I got my husband into the Prince of Wales public-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 5, De Laune Street, Kenniagton Park—I am a cook at 317, High Street, Borough—I was in Newington Causeway on April 22nd about 6.8 a.m., walking towards St. George's Church—about 25 to 30 yards before passing No. 143 I met the prisoner with a dirty brown bag, on the same side of the way, and face to face—as I walked towards the shop the man came out and said, "Stop him," and I went after the prisoner—he had gone out of sight—that evening I went to the Southwark Police-station, and picked out the prisoner from 15 or 16 men as the man I had seen in the morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was going towards London Bridge on the right hand side—the pavement is very wide—I ran towards the Elephant to stop the man—I did not know whether it was murder, or what it was—I ran to the corner of the Old Kent Road—I was walking in the centre of the pathway.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective, M</hi>) On the evening of April 21st, in con<lb/>sequence of a description supplied to the police, I went with Inspector Godley to Walworth Road in search of the prisoner—about 8.15 I saw him with a young woman—I called him by his name, and said, "We are going to take you into custody on suspicion of burglary"—he became violent, and said, "Let me go, you f—bastard! I'll do for you"—he threw me up against the shop front, and tried to kick me—Inspector Godley got hold of him on the other side—he struck Godley three times across the head with his stick—after some minutes' struggle we got him into a cab, where he was so violent that I sat on him, and had to throw my whole weight on him—he said, "You b—! you are going to try to do me with that job this morning"—as I was holding his hand down and sitting on him in the cab he bit me on my right arm—he was very violent, and threatened us all the way to the station—we told him we were going to search him—he said, "You are not going to search me," and again became so violent that we had to get two constables to hold him—I searched him, and took several things from him, including this piece of paper, on which is "48 W, 193 R, 133 C, 112 B, 11 B, 69 bra."—that is bracelets—the paper fell from my hand to the floor—he made a dive for it with his mouth, and rearly got it,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190105130062"/>
               <p>but I picked it up—a little later he was placed with 15 other men, and identified by Adams—he was then told the charge, and that he had been identified as being in Newington Causeway—he said, "Well, I suppose I can walk along the Causeway at 6 o'clock in the morning if I like; the road is as much for me as it is for you"—I showed him this piece of paper and said, "This piece of paper I found upon you, and which you were so anxious to get, is almost a complete list of the property stolen"—he said, "Yes, I know it is"—when the charge was read to him he said, "Yes, that is right; you must have some one for it; of course it would be me; I am innocent."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He did not say that the paper referred to horse-racing—a list from the prosecutor had been supplied in the morning—I had seen it, but did not go carefully through it till late at night before the prisoner was charged—I compared it in our office with the prisoner's list—I showed the prisoner's paper to Mr. Tatnell, and he said, "Why, this ap<lb/>pears to be a list of property stolen"—the prisoner's replies at the station were not all in one sentence.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector, M</hi>) I was with Neil in Walworth Road—on April 21st, about 8.15 p.m., Neil spoke to him—he at once commenced to struggle—the serjeant held his arm—I took hold of his left arm—he had a walking-stick in his right hand, and he hit me over the head three times with it—he said, "You f—bastards!"—we put him into a cab, and a young woman who was talking to him at the time we arrested him got into the hansom cab with us voluntarily—on the way he said, "You f—cow! you have put me away"—I heard him say some<lb/>thing to Sergeant Neil—the woman at the time was between him and me, and he bit Neil on the back of the upper part of his right arm—I tried to prevent him, but the woman got between us—I was going to strike him on the face to make him let go—he said, "I will do for you, you bastard!"—we took him to Southwark Police-station—there I said to him, "I am going to search you"—he was searched by Neil, two constables holding him on account of his violence—this piece of paper that Neil had taken from him fell to the ground—he made a dive, and nearly pulled the two constables down in trying to get it, but he did not succeed in getting it—he was afterwards placed with 15 other men and identified by Adams, but not by Thomas—I told him what he would be charged with—he said, "I suppose I can walk along the Causeway as well as you; it is as much for me as for you"—when the charge was read over he said, "Yes, that is right; you must have someone for it; I am innocent; I will do for you;" and he made a movement towards me which I stepped back to avoid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I made a note of what he said immediately he was charged—I went to my office and wrote it in my pocket-book—he did a lot of talking; I put down as far as I could remember the exact words, but he said other words as well—he was in a very bad temper—four were in the cab—he said, "I can walk along the Causeway as well as you," that is right; "You must have someone for it," and half a minute elapsed before he said, "I am innocent"—that was when the charge was read in the usual way—I do not see how he could have heard of the burglary—he was arrested 14 hours after the burglary was</p>

               <p>committed—we first received a description from Thomas, and that was sent in the printed information round to the Police-stations by 10.30 that morning—Thomas described the bag as black, and Adams as a rusty brown—one, Thomas, I think, said the colour of his overcoat was brown, and the other that it was plum colour—Thomas might have said the man he met had a dark coat—I did not hear Adams say it was a light coat.</p>
