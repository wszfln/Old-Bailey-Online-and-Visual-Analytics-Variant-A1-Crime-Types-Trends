Gardiner's, Upper Street, Islington; I nave bought a suit of clothes, and it will be returned with the suit of clothes that I have bought there; I asked your wife whether I might take it as it was likely to be a wet day"—nothing came from Gardiner's—he expressed his surprise the things had not arrived—the coat was not returned—I have since seen it at the pawnbroker's—it was worth about £2, I should think.</p>

Shoolbred for several years about four years previously, and which had been fully paid for</hi>)—we did not carry out that order—on 4th June this year some correspondence was put before me, and in consequence I caused this letter to be written to Rev. J. Wright, Ingrave—(<hi rend="italic">This stated that as they did not appear to have had his previous patronage, they should prefer him to remit for the goods already supplied, and to provide them with an introduction in future business; that he had referred previously to Mr. Shipley, but had not given his address</hi>)—I received this letter of 5th June in reply—(<hi rend="italic">This stated that in future Mr. Wright would prefer to pay his account at the end of each month; that he believed Mr. Shipley was travelling on the Continent with private pupils; that he had sent part of their price list to a clergyman who was furnishing a rectory</hi>)—I received another long letter on 7th June—on 14th I went down with Mr. Harrison, a salesman, to Ingrave, Brentwood, Essex—the prisoner was living at the post office kept by Mrs. Wood—I knocked at the door, the prisoner opened it—I said to him, "The Rev. Mr. Wright?"—he said, "Yes; step in"—I and Mr. Harrison went in—I said, "I have come with regard to a letter of yours of 5th June, and wish to draw your attention to certain items for which we have not given you credit"—he said, "Thank you; was it not a pity to come so far when a letter would have done?"—I replied I had not merely come on that business; that he had been kind enough to give us a further order for a coat and vest, which I had taken the liberty of bringing down with me in order to try on—he said, "Have you them with you? then if you will allow me I will take them upstairs and try them on"—he took them out of the room, came back with them on, and I suggested certain altera<lb/>tions</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188907290010"/>
               <p>—I produced an account I had taken with me, containing the full items—I showed it to him, and I said that if he would be kind enough to go through the account by the items, I should be able, as I had his letters with me, to examine with him any article or item to which he would like to draw my attention—I had several letters with me which have been read to-day—I produced several of them as he went through the account, referring to items and taking exception to them—in the course of conversation he said, "I was recommended to your house by Mr. Shipley, who told me he had done large business with your house, and spent a great deal of money there, and spoke very well of your house, and said 'You can get everything there'"—I said, "Yes; in one of your letters I noticed you referred to Mr. Shipley, but we were unable to take any notice of the reference because you did not give his address"—he said, "No; for the reason I gave you, that I don't know the gentleman's address; I believe him to be travelling on the Continent with two pupils "; and he said he did not know whether he would have the privilege of giving his address, for it was only in an incidental conversation it had arisen—the amount of the invoice is £16 9s. 6d.—no portion of it has ever been paid.</p>

Shoolbred in years past when I was in better circumstances, and I wonder they did not recollect the handwriting of the letters"—I said to him, "Well, I don't know, but I believe this case came about in that way; that one of the ledger clerks noticed a similarity in the handwriting and drew attention to it"—the prisoner said, "Oh, I did not attempt to disguise my handwriting"—I said, "No; I don't suggest you did"—the prisoner said, "No; there was no attempt to disguise"—in the course of other conversation the prisoner said, "Shool-red's people called on me recently and brought a coat and vest which I fitted on; they went through the account with me, and asked me if I</p>

               <p>could give them a cheque now; I said, 'No; but I will pay so much a month'; they asked if they might leave the coat and vest, and I said, 'No, not until I have paid this account'; when I obtained the goods from Shoolbred's, I had no intention to defraud, and I believe that if I had had the money to pay when they called, these proceedings would not have been taken.

                  </hi>. I am in charge of a telegraph office belonging to the Midland Railway Company, near Child's Hill Station, Hendon—about three o'clock in the morning of 12th July William Leys, who was in the service of the company, brought the prisoner to my office—he left the prisoner there and went out—in about three minutes the prisoner took a pistol from his left waistcoat pocket—I asked him if it was loaded, and</p>

               <p>he immediately fired at me—I saw he could not work the second chamber, and I saw my chance and escaped out of the office—he was seven or eight feet from me when he fired—he missed me—I had not gone above fifteen or sixteen feet when I heard a second report; again I was missed—the first barrel was loaded with a bullet—I heard it strike the side of the office and then enter the ceiling—it fell, and was picked up after wards.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Midland Railway Policeman</hi>). About three in the morning of 12th July I was on duty at the Brent Siding, close to Child's Hill Station—I saw the prisoner about thirty yards off running in the direction of a shunting engine that was at work—I ran and got between him and the engine, shouted to him, and prevented him from getting to it—he was about two yards from the engine when I intercepted him—the engine was moving at the time—he turned and ran away—I ran after him, and caught him, and asked him what he was doing on the railway—he made no reply, but again moved towards where the engine was—I said, "There is no thoroughfare that way"—he said he knew his way, and wanted to go down among the engines—I said, "You must come this way, along with me;" and after a struggle I got him to the telegraph office—I took his name and address, "Philip Percy Spriggs, 5, Featherstone Buildings, Holborn"—I asked what he was; he said he was a solicitor's clerk, to Bannister, Williams and Ram, of John Street, Bedford Row—I did not observe anything peculiar in his demeanour—I asked him what account he had to give for being on the railway—he made no reply—I quietly told the clerk to keep an eye upon him, at the same time telling the prisoner to sit down to have a rest—when I saw him trying to get to the engine I thought he was trying to commit suicide—I left the prisoner in the telegraph office, and when I had got about seven or eight yards away I heard a report of firearms—I turned round and saw Welch running out at the door; I saw smoke, and I heard the report of another shot—the prisoner was not pursuing Welch, he was sitting down in the office when he fired the second shot—I ran to the office door—the prisoner had then shut the door—I looked in at the window, and saw him sitting in front of the door with the revolver in both hands, pointing it directly at the door—I went towards him, sprang upon him, and seized the revolver by the muzzle; he had hold of the back—he shouted to me to let go the revolver or he would shoot me, and I shouted to him to let it go—he struggled hard, and tried to turn the revolver towards me—I had great difficulty in holding it down—he fired, and the bullet went right between my legs through the flooring—during the struggle he got the trigger up again—I called for assistance, and Thurlow came and took the revolver from him; this is it—two spent bullets were afterwards found, one on the floor, the other was underneath the flooring—he was searched at the station—this strap was found round his body—five cartridges were found loose in his pocket; they fit the revolver—I fired two shots out of the revolver into the fields—while doing that he pulled this large sheath knife out of his pocket, and Thurlow knocked it out of his hand before he could use it; his initials are on it—I then saw him put his hand into his outside coat pocket—I seized his hand, and found this razor in his pocket.</p>

I am the medical officer of Holloway Prison—the prisoner came in there on the night of 26th June—I saw her on the morning of 28th, the day before yesterday—I have had three long interviews with her, with a view of forming an opinion on her state—she said she was subject to fits, apparently of an epileptic character, up to the time when she was about fifteen; that they then ceased until about three months ago, when she was seized with a fit in the kitchen, in which she lost consciousness, and in which her underlip was bitten, which rather tends to show that it was an epileptic attack—she said that for the last three months she had been extremely depressed, with constant severe headaches, and a feeling as if she could not do the work she ought to do about her house and home—she is in a weak, debilitated state, in my opinion aggravated by prolonged suckling—she said she was very frightened at the thunderstorm that was taking place, and that she let the baby drop and fell down after it, and remembered nothing more—I certainly think, from my examination of her, that she was irresponsible</p>

Kemp, Croydon, regretting that he had not been at his office, and making an appointment for</hi> 9. 30 <hi rend="italic">or</hi> 10 <hi rend="italic">on Monday morning</hi>)—on the 25th I received this letter, "Dr. Sir, you can enter into my service forthwith as my clerk and companion, at a salary of £56 per annum, payable in weekly or fortnightly instalments, &amp;c., B. T, <hi rend="smallCaps">KEMP</hi>."—I went into his service, and on the 25th February I paid him £20—he said he had a ledger in which the names of all the subscribers to the association were, and about £50 worth of circulars—he did not say a word about the probability of his being bankrupt—I knew nothing about a solicitor being engaged in the business—I never saw any money collected—I paid him £20 more on March 9th, believing it to be a <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> business—I signed this document at Croydon, which I believed to be an agreement (<hi rend="italic">This purported to he a mortgage of the prisoner's business to the witness</hi>)—subsequently to the bankruptcy I wrote this letter to the Official Receiver, at the prisoner's dictation:—"London, 13th March. Dear Sir,—I beg to inform you that B. Kemp mortgaged his business to me. The securities I hold are the books, papers, and receipts till I am repaid, together with the expenses I am put to"—I did not understand when I entered his employment anything more than that I became his clerk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not understand that I was to have an interest in the association he was conducting—I parted with the money believing the business was solvent—I never saw any business done—I was to pay him £50, and I paid him £40—I paid £20 on the Saturday when I signed the agreement; and told him I could not pay him any more then, because £20 was in the savings bank, and I could not get it out then—I saw the names and addresses of the subscribers in the journal in the hands of the Receiver—I believe the names in this circular are the same as those in the journal—Kemp said nothing to me about being in need of money—he did not say he was pressed for money, but the Traders' Association was a good business, which he had carried on for years—I made no inquiries as to whether this was a <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> association—I saw from the books that there were about seventy subscribers at the time I entered his employment—some paid £2 2s., some £1 1s., and some 12s. 6d.—no actions came on in my time in which he received considerable profit—after the receiving order was made I wrote a letter to Mr. Harding, the Receiver, at the prisoner's dictation, in which I claimed books, papers, and receipts, for the purpose of carrying on the business—I was duly furnished by the Official Receiver with a statement of the debtor's affairs; the last paragraph refers to my mortgage or agreement—on 1st April, 1889, I had entered into possession of Kemp's business, and was carrying it on, but I could not see anything to carry on—I wrote at the prisoner's dictation to the Official Receiver, informing him that I was carrying on the business, and I may have made out in my own writing the particulars of the mortgage, and sent them to the Official Receiver—I do not understand anything about mortgages—I received my salary for about two weeks, I got £2 8s., and after that £1 10s. and two ten shillings, about £5 altogether—I was there five or six weeks, but was</p>

               <p>doing nothing at all; I could not see any business to carry on—I was in possession of the office till a date in April—I occupied the office at 58, Cheapside; the papers and circulars and receipts were removed there on April 24 from 41, Wych Street, and the prisoner wrote to the Post-master-General to have the address altered to 58, Cheapside—some of these circulars may have been sent out, but very few; I believe the prisoner sent some, but I did not attend at the office very often; I had left and stopped at home, as he promised to return me the money as soon as the business was all right—I have not attempted to ascertain whether any one of the names on this circular was placed there without the permission of the person himself—a letter was sent to someone named Fox, purporting to be a notice of a change of solicitors—I wrote that at the prisoner's dictation—at the end of April I attended with the prisoner before the Official Receiver, and the prisoner suggested that we should go and get the journal containing the subscribers' names—I was given permission to copy them, and I did so, after which I signed this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is in my writing—this is my letter: "To Mr. Somerville. May 8th. I undertake to conduct and carry on the business of the subscribers, free of any charge except travelling expenses, until you have completed negotiations for taking over your mortgage, which will be immediately after I receive my discharge from the Bankruptcy Court. <hi rend="smallCaps">B.

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I did pretty much what Kemp told me—the whole of this document is in my writing—as late as 14th May I had some confidence in him—£2 8s. salary was paid me at the time I paid the £20, and for the sovereign from Mr. Kemp I gave an I O U.</p>

                  </hi> Low. I am a secretary, and live at 42, Hurstfield Road, South Croydon—in February or March, 1888, I received this circular (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and subsequently the prisoner introduced himself to me in the train by saying that he was a nephew of Mr. Kemp, Q. C.—he told me about the National Traders' Association, and said that if I had any business on he should be happy to do it for me; that there were a very large number of subscribers, and it paid 33 1/2 per cent, dividend—upon that I became a subscriber—I paid him £2 2s., and he gave me this receipt—about that time I had a grievance against the Assam Tea Company, and instructed the prisoner to commence an action against them—he said that this association would do it much cheaper than any other, and that his uncle would act as Counsel—he told me he had a list of solicitors, but I have never been able to see it—he said Mr. Sidney was a very able man, and I put it into his hands—I paid the prisoner £7 10s. in June for the purpose of paying into Court, for the discovery of documents, and subsequently £11 10s. for interrogatories, which he said was to be paid into Court—he gave me this receipt—I paid him altogether over £60—I have changed my solicitor now, and the action is entered for trial—I parted with my money believing his statement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have not changed my solicitor four or five times since the writ was issued—I did not employ Mr. Wheeler—the first solicitor on the record was Mr. Sidney, who occupied the adjoining offices to Kemp—I was told he was one of the solicitors to the association—his name is on the circulars and on the business door—I do not consider that he acted for me at all; he acted for the prisoner; I did not instruct him—he acted for Kemp about a year and three months—it was in February, 1888, that I paid the money—I left the matter in the hands of the association fifteen months, and could not get a satisfactory answer from the prisoner—I do not know that Mr. Sidney incurred heavy expenses out of pocket in conducting my case—I paid everything before it was due, and have not seen any bill of costs—by the circular Counsels' fees are free; it says, "£2 2s.; subscribers are entitled to have counsel's opinion free, when necessary"—counsel's advice was all I had—I paid the counsel's fees out of pocket—I never had any account from Mr. Sidney—I paid whatever I was asked—I have never been furnished with any account or bill of costs, but my solicitor has—I only saw it the day before yesterday, and I do not acknowledge it—I have not read it; I will look at it now; it is a list of counsels' fees—the amounts I paid were paid for a particular purpose—I was not perfectly cognisant of the fact that the prisoner was simply paying these sums to Mr. Sidney for the purpose of carrying on the action—I took this receipt for the £7 10s., signed, "B. T. Kemp, for and on behalf of Frederick Sidney"—I did not employ Sidney, I employed the prisoner, but I never looked at it; I am very foolish, and trust people too much—Kemp has never informed me that I am in his debt for money expended by him in my service—he never told me I owed him £38, or I should have asked what he meant—the prisoner used the word" nephew," and it was well known in the train that he had given himself out so—it was on the faith of his being the nephew of a Queen's Counsel that I employed him; I thought I was dealing with a respectable man—I was dissatisfied with the way the litigation was being conducted, and complained</p>

               <p>—Mr. Sidney did not tell me that I owed him money; but he told me that Mr. Kemp had not paid him the money he received from me—I know Mr. Hallett; I borrowed £10 from him some months ago, after fifteen months' litigation with the Assam Tea Company—I did not get it net, I paid £2 for it; and I am under the belief that Kemp got the £2—I borrowed £10, and now I am asked to pay £12—I was not satisfied that the money I advanced to carry on the litigation was properly applied; I paid £10 in April, and the agreement was never sent—I was not perfectly satisfied with Mr. Kemp when I asked him to do me the favour of becoming my surety; I was very suspicious all the time, and told him many times that I was dissatisfied with him.</p>

               <p>back to the studio, left the parcel there, locked the door, and went with Mr. Tussaud to the Police-station—Sergeant Morgan was directed to go to the establishment; I and Mr. Tussaud got back before him; Morgan followed shortly afterwards—I took him up to the studio, and showed him where the parcel was—he took hold of it, and cut the cord—it was bound round with this piece of gold lace cord—he first took off the paper which was sealed on, and was going to open the box; I stopped him from doing that, and asked him to take it to some open space before he did anything else with it—we took it into the garden, an open space at the east end of the building—Morgan there opened the box, as far as it would go, about 1-16th of an inch, and shook all the powder out on to the grass; I should say there was about half a pound—I picked up about an ounce of it, and gave it to Morgan, leaving the other, on the grass—it was in very good condition—two days afterwards I ignited the other powder; I threw a match into it on the grass, and it flared up, as nearly as I could tell, from 15 to 20 feet high; I had no idea that such a tremendous lot of gunpowder was left—since I have become managing director I have seen the prisoner on three or four occasions; he only came once direct to me; I don't know what he came about—I had no conversation with him.</p>

Quin—Mr. John Tussaud is the prosecutor—my father sanctioned the prosecution; we asked his permission before any action was taken—I did not know of the prisoner's photograph until a day or two after Quin had got it—I think it was towards the end of the week that the box was received—I never spoke to the boy, except just to say good morning—he has been to Tussaud's—I did not see him there till after the warrant was applied for—on the first day of the remand I gave him my card as an admission to the exhibition—Quin asked me for it for him—I did not see him there—I knew nothing of the arrangement made to identify the prisoner, till afterwards—my knowledge of gunpowder is only from using cartridges.</p>

I am fourteen years of age; I am employed at the London Parcels Delivery Office in Fetter Lane, and have been there twelve months last March—on Saturday, 22nd June, a small brown paper parcel was brought to me addressed to Mr. T. Tussaud, Exhibition, Marylebone Road—it was brought by the prisoner—he said, "I want that sent"—he paid me 4d. for it—I said, "Who is the sender, please?"—he refused to give the sender's name—he said, "As it is paid for it is sure to be taken in"—I then booked the parcel on the booking-bill, and put it on a counter on the opposite side, the proper place for the men to collect—I made an entry in the parcel-book—on 26th June Inspector Quin came to me in Fetter Lane; he put some questions, which I answered—I did not then know who he was—I saw him again on the 27th, and had some conversation—ho did not then say who he was—I had seen this about Tussaud's on the placards, and I guessed who he was—on the 29th he came and took me and my father to the Duke of York public-house in Marylebone Road, about half-past ten at night—I remained there till eleven—I was sitting on a stool, opposite a table, in the bar—Quin had told me to do something—about from forty to fifty people came in and out—after I had been there about three-quarters of an hour I saw the prisoner come in; I recognised him, and I said something to Quin—I have no doubt about the prisoner being the man who brought the parcel to me—I identify the parcel by the handwriting on it.</p>

               <p>to inquire into this matter, and as a result of those inquiries I went to the Parcels Delivery Office in Fetter Lane, and saw the boy Baker—I had a conversation with him—he gave me a description, which I have with me—on the following day I showed him seven photographs, among them being one of the prisoner—he did not identify either of them—they were Scotland Yard photographs, not all of well-known criminals, of persons who have been reported as missing—I have not got them here; they are at Scotland Yard; I can get them—I saw the boy again on the 29th June, and went with him and his father to the Duke of York public house—Mr. Babington Tussaud was with me on that occasion—I gave the boy certain directions; we went inside the bar—the boy sat alone at a table, his father, Mr. Babington Tussaud and I were at the bar—it was about three-quarters of an hour before the boy made any communication to me; neither I, his father, nor Mr. Babington Tussaud had any conversation with him from the time he was seated at the table until he made some sign to me—there might be about thirty people in and out of the house during that interval—Saturday is a busy night in a public-house—at the end of the three-quarters of an hour the boy nodded his head in the direction of the door—I looked in that direction, and saw the prisoner; he was talking to Babington Tussaud—I left the prisoner in the bar, and went outside, and I was followed out by Baker, his father, and Tussaud—the boy then made a communication to me—from the time I was first instructed I had the whole conduct of this matter, so far as the police were concerned—I received a warrant for the prisoner's arrest on 10th July, and on the 11th I arrested him, at 3 in the afternoon, at 10, Percy Road, Shepherd's Bush, where he was living—I read the warrant to him—he said, "You astonish me! there is a suspicion, but if they cannot prove it it will show them up"—I took him to the station, where he was charged—the charge was read over to him—he made no further statement—he was searched—I found some letters on him (<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—I was reading one of them, beginning, "My dear boys," and the prisoner was looking over my shoulder; he said, "Will it be necessary to produce that letter?"—I made no reply to that—when I got towards the end of the letter he said, "You see what my feelings were when I wrote it; one's feelings sometimes get the better of one "(<hi rend="italic">The letters were put in and read, they expressed grief at his being dismissed from his employment, and attributed it to John Tussaud</hi>)—I have produced this box to-day; it has been in my custody—when I first saw it I noticed these two fusees in it—the explosive part of the fusees were on them at the time, quite complete—I received it at the Police Office, 21, Whitehall Place.</p>

On 24th June I was instructed by my superintendent to go to Tussaud's Exhibition—I went there, and was taken up to the studio by Mr. Poyser—I was there shown a brown paper parcel covering a box; the paper was fastened with wax, and this gold cord was tied round the box inside the paper—I took off the paper and cut the cord—I took the box into the garden, as they objected to my opening it in the building—I opened the lid slightly, indeed it opened of its own accord after cutting the cord, and some gunpowder fell out—I turned it up and shook it gently, and a quantity of gunpowder fell out, about half a pound, more or less—I inserted my finger, and found there was a connection from the lid to the inside—I succeeded in disconnecting this piece of sandpaper from the lid; and on removing the lid I found some paper pasted over, carefully hiding the contents—I broke that away, and then found this sandpaper in contact with the fusees right away to the bottom of the box—the sand side of the paper was in contact with the heads of the fusees—if violently opened this would come in contact with the fusees; the fusees were fixed tight against the sand paper—I tried the sandpaper gently, it would not give without some force—I then took it to the police-station, and reported the matter to the Commissioner, and by his direction it was taken to the Inspector of Explosives, with about an ounce of the powder, which I gathered up off the floor—the box was taken from Col.

Majendie by direction of the Commissioner—I was present when the boy gave the description that was written down—he was asked what sort of a hat the man was wearing, and he said a black felt hat—I did not weigh the contents of the box—I know nothing about what kind of powder it was—I have not got the powder that was submitted to the inspector.</p>

I am sixteen years old—I entered the service of Barnett and Phillips two years and nine months ago as light porter, and the prisoner came about two months afterwards—he came to the warehouse two or three times a day—after a time I was put into the same room with Mr. Boack in the basement—he gives out the ribs, and I was his assistant—all the materials necessary for making umbrellas were sent out from that room—Stevenson came there for work—Mr. Boack books how much is given out, and when the work is brought back it is taken to the third floor and signed for, and he receives the money due to him—I have taken goods belonging to my master without his authority—the prisoner asked me to do that—on 4th July I took eleven vulcanite handles—I gave the prisoner some ribs before 4th July, but I cannot say whether these are the same—I did not enter them in any book—Mr. Boack knew nothing about my taking them—the prisoner mostly put down on a piece of paper what he wanted, and I used to give them to him when there was no one there—he gave me money for them—this was about Christmas—I gave him some a week before this case came on—he gave me 6d. a dozen for common ones, and 1s. a dozen for best—I recognised these as a half dozen set of 22-inch Nests—I saw Mr. Boack give them to the prisoner, and an entry of them was made in the book—I have heard Mr. Boack two or three times ask the prisoner to bring them back—I recognise them, and can refer, if necessary, to an entry in the book of their having been given to him.</p>

I live at Chapel House, Holloway Road, and am ground-keeper of the Chapel of Ease—Chapel Road is at the back of a row of houses in Holloway Road—about 2 a. m. on Wednesday, 17th July, I was awoke by my dog barking—I got up and went down, I saw nothing; I heard two or more men running along the top of the roof of my shed, which is my back premises—it is situated close to the churchyard—I got out; I heard two or more men jump off the roof and run in the direction of Liverpool Road—I put on my things—a police inspector and a policeman arrived, and we searched the grounds—I found King secreted behind the shrubs against the wall of the chapel—he said he just came to do a nap—the policeman took him to the station—about 9 a. m. I examined a tree right against the chapel at the Liverpool Road end, and near it I found <hi rend="italic">a jemmy</hi>, which I handed over to the police.</p>

"in it—I said before they took it out that it was a red book with a little gold rim round the inside, and that it had a mark where I had spilt some condensed milk on it on the voyage out—I identified this as my property—I bought it at Bunston's, Wheat Street, Maidstone, about five miles from my home, before I went out to America—I bought at the same time a Bible, which I had in my pocket—the prisoner was very abusive at being stopped—he was not detained, but I got permission to search his bunk, and there I found this bottle of cod-liver oil; it is mine; there is the name of "Rowcroft, Family Chemist, Maidstone," from whom I bought it, on it—inside is a piece of floating cork, and my bottle had a piece which I had forced in—the prisoner said ho bought the memoranaum</p>

I am a plain-clothes dock policeman—on Saturday, 22nd June, about 11. 30, the prisoner and Day came up to the Royal Albert Dock gate, where I was stationed—Day said, "I have reason to think that this man has got some property of mine in his bag, and I wish you to search it; I have lost my clothes on the voyage from New York"—I said, "Very well"—I said to the prisoner, "You hear what this man says; we shall have to search your bag"—he said, "It has already been searched"—I found a book on searching—Day said, "That is my property"—the prisoner said, "No, it is my property; there is sixpence marked in it"—Day said, "I know there is a sixpence in it; there are other marks I can identify"—I said, "All right, you had better not say any more at present; we will see if there is anything else"—the prisoner turned out the remainder of his bag, and Day identified a rug as having been stolen from the ship on the voyage out—in it were grass seeds; it had evidently been in hay or fodder—the prisoner said, "That rug I bought in Petticoat Lane; I have also a witness to prove I did buy it there"—I said to him, "Ishall have to take you to the station"—the inspector at the dock station told me to take the things back to the chief officer of the ship—at the station Day pointed out to the inspector the milk stains on the book-cover, from the tin of condensed milk that he had in his box on the voyage out, and also a gold beading round one side—the prisoner in answer said, "I have bought this in Stratford"—I spoke to the officer at the ship, and then searched the prisoner's bunk—I found a sack of maize—Day found this bottle of oil on a shelf over the prisoner's bunk—afterwards I went to the engineer's store-room, which the prisoner had had charge of—it was locked up at this time—I found there four sacks containing maize—that would not be the proper place for com to be stored—as far as I know the prisoner would not have anything to do with corn on the vessel—when arrested he said the bottle of oil was a lotion for his leg, and it contained carbolic.</p>

I am chief officer of the <hi rend="italic">Denmark</hi>, a British ship voyaging between this country and America—in the ordinary course complaints would be made to me if anything were lost on board—on the voyage out Ziegland complained about a rug—he was taking horses out to New York—he slept on hay to watch the horses at night—at the docks Wilcox brought me this book and this rug, which was full of hay seeds; it appeared to be new and perfectly clean—on the Monday after we got into dock, the prisoner asked me if I had the rug and book—I told him I had—he claimed them as his—I said I could not give them up—he subsequently said he had bought the rug in Petticoat Lane, and paid 3s. 6d. for it, and that he had been using it for three voyages—when I refused to deliver up the rug and book, he said he should prosecute me—I have not been prosecuted—at the North Woolwich Police-station, when he was charged, he said he had got a bag of maize from Mr. Ross, the chief steward, who had asked him to drop it at his door on his way home—Ross said he had given him about a quarter of a bag of maize, and that he took it from him from the bar towards the engine-room—the vessel coming back from</p>

               <p>America was laden with a general cargo, and 1,200 tons of maize and 190 cattle—the maize was cargo entirely, and not to feed the cattle with—the maize found in the engine-room is similar to the cargo—it is threshed out, and is different to the fodder, which is in the husk—about two bags were consumed on the voyage.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Wood Grange, Forest Gate, and am a registered chemist—I have examined the contents of this bottle, labelled cod-river oil, and I find that it contains cod-liver oil—I could not detect the slightest trace of carbolic acid, which has a very characteristic smell—a bottle of carbolic acid should have "Poison" on it—I never heard of carbolic acid being mixed with cod-liver oil as a lotion.</p>

               <p>acid does not evaporate; it is not of a volatile nature, and I do not think the smell would get less if the cork were left out—you could always detect it by its smell, if weak or strong—if it were put into cod-liver oil in a crystallised form it would not dissolve, if in the liquid form it would make the oil cloudy; this is bright—the degree of cloudiness would depend on the amount of carbolic and the amount of oil—I have only tried the one test mentioned in the British Pharmacopœia.</p>

I am a corn merchant, of Bow, trading with my brother—the prisoner was our traveller, at 10s. a week salary and one third of the profit of the business he brought in—he had been in my service when I was with Mr. Haslam, with whom I dissolved partnership in March this year, and the prisoner continued on the same terms—the Guarantee Society were security for him—I wrote to him on June 18th, and he came on the 20th—I went through his commission account, and found £5 6s. 3d. was due to him—I was present when he paid two amounts to Thomas Haslam, the cashier—I had some conversation with him, which resulted in his discharge—I wrote to him on June 20th, and received this letter containing an account—so far as I know he has never paid in or accounted for any of these amounts in this list prepared by himself—he had no authority to retain any part of an amount received by him—he would not come in at all, and that is why I discharged him—he had no right to deduct his commission, I always paid it to him, and the cashier always took the other money—we call it commission, but it was not commission that he had—there may have been some salary due to him at that time; we were just clearing it up when he went out of the office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was in partnership with Haslam first—he had £100 a year as managing partner—the prisoner had a horse and trap, which he used in the business—the prisoner had one-third of the profits, and shared one-sixth of the bad debts, but this share of the bad debts was never enforced—he was not entitled when he was short of money to carry on the business, to keep money from customers and apply it to pur<lb/>poses</p>

               <p>of the business—he kept back half-a-crown once; that is the only instance I know of—my clerk would know if he had any more—sometimes he received money from customers in instalments; he was authorised to do that—when I saw him on 20th June he had not been attending to the business for weeks before—I had not given him a week's notice, because I was away for my holidays in June—I had written to him before, and told him to come in—I cannot say he was neglecting the business for many weeks, but he did not pay—I did not know he was doing business for others; I asked him at last, and he said he was not—£10 was lent to him to buy the pony and trap—I don't know what they cost; I should not think they cost much more; he might have paid £1 or £2—I won't swear he did not pay £10—he rendered an account every two days—I have only been managing partner for two months—on July 5 I commenced criminal proceedings—he still claims commission out of the profits—I received a letter containing this passage: "I shall certainly not take any more orders for you from my customers, nor shall I accept any more money from them"—I did not answer that—10s. a week was not for his travelling expenses, but for salary—he contended at the Police-court that it was for expenses—he had to keep the pony; we told him not to have it; we said he would do it cheaper without; but he knew best—I gave Mr. Haslam notice of dissolution of partnership, and said to the prisoner, "You will talk of these notices to your customers, you know all about it"—he said, "I do."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He kept on the same as before—if he received instalments he should have paid them in, not kept them till he received the whole amount—he travelled in London and the suburbs—he lived at Stoke Newington, so that he could always come every two days.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief clerk in the claim department of the Prudential Insurance Company—this form of proposal was sent to the office about 31st January, 1888, purporting to come from the boy Sidney Bolton, proposing an insurance of £10 on his life, at a weekly payment of 1d.—only half was to be paid in the event of his dying within twelve months—we accepted that, and on 13th February issued this policy (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which is strictly in accordance with the terms of the proposal—on 3rd April, 1888, we received this second form of proposal from the same person for the same sum, and on 23rd April this second policy was issued to the boy under the same conditions—the premiums were regularly paid down to February 11th this year; it is not true that the policy lapsed—about February 12th I received this claim from my agent, and believed it to be genuine, purporting to be by the mother of the deceased boy—there are several questions which have to be answered, and she does answer them—she says that the mother is living, and that they are insured in our office and another office—it is signed, "Sarah Bolton, her mark; witness, Emma Greenaway"—we require a certificate of identity, which I find is signed, "Emma Greenaway; witness, W. Coleman"—it says, "I not being a relation of the deceased"—that is one of the rules of the office—I believed it was genuine, and caused this cheque</p>

                  </hi>. I have been agent for the Prudential Insurance Company since December 3rd, 1883, and live at 25, Edward Street, Deptford—I have been in the habit of calling weekly at 153, Church Street, to collect the premiums due to the company—Mrs. Winters usually paid them, but sometimes the prisoner did—I claimed 5s. a week when I started, and then it increased to 5s. 3d.—among the premiums there was 1d. a week on each of two policies in the name of Sidney Bolton, and on February 11th I received notice of his death, and called that evening at Mrs. Winters', and saw her and the prisoner and Mrs. Greenaway—we went into the back room—a light was procured—I placed this form of claim on the table—Mrs. Winters had told me at my house that the father was dead, so I said, "Which is the mother?"—Mrs. Winters pointed to the prisoner, and said, "This is the mother"—I said, "Are you the mother?"—she said, "I am"—I filled up the claim by putting questions to the prisoner, and writing down the answers—I said, "I want your name on this paper"—she said, "I cannot write"—here is printed on the claim: "The person claiming has attained the age of twenty-one years, and is the mother of the deceased," and another question is, "Are the deceased's parents alive?"—I filled in "The mother"—"Are there brothers or sisters of the deceased living?"—I put in "Sister"—I got that information from the mother—"Was she insured in any other company or society?"—I put that question, and the answer was "No"—it then states: "I do hereby declare that I am the holder of the policy, etc., and as the mother of the deceased I claim payment to me of the said policy, 11th February, 1889"—when she said that she could not write, I referred to the Registrar's certificate of the boy's death, and said, "You have got your mark on here?"—she said, "Yes"—I asked her name—she said, "Sarah Bolton "; and I wrote it down, and "153, Church Street, Deptford"; and asked her to make a cross at the end of the name, which she did, with a pen—I asked Mrs. Winters for a witness to the signature; she said she could not write, and beckoned Mrs. Greenaway forward, who wrote her name as a witness; she had been there all the time, and heard what took place—I asked for a witness to the identity of the deceased, who was not a relative, and Mrs. Winters again beckoned Mrs. Greenaway—I said, "Are you a relative of the deceased?"—she said, "No"—I was not aware that she was the prisoner's sister—I produce the certificate of identity—it begins, "I, not being a relative of the deceased"—it is signed "Emma Greenaway," and she filled in the address," 53, Reginald Road, Deptford"—I received from Mrs. Winters two policies and the register of death and the premium receipt-book, and forwarded them to</p>

I live at 4, Eveline Road, Forest Hill, close to 119, Devonshire Road—on 28th May, at three o'clock, I heard cries of "Stop thief!"—I ran out and saw Wear running up the road—Miss Adams, who was calling "Stop thief!" was twenty yards behind me—I ran in between them from the other side of the road—it was broad daylight—I followed Wear, and I caught him about the middle of a field into which he turned—I had a knife in my hand—he saw it, and asked me what I was going to do with it—I said, "Never mind what I am going to do with it"—he said, "What are you following me for?"—I said, "For a little affair down the road"—I told him to come back—he said he knew nothing about it—I asked him why he ran away—he said because somebody cried out after him, I believe—my mother had followed me up to the fence of the field, and she screamed out—the prisoner whistled, and Jones and Davis joined him—I believe they had followed after me—Jones was convicted at Greenwich Police—court for being concerned with two others in this offence—Wear said, "You had better leave me alone"—he offered to let me search him—he said, "You had better take your b——y hook, or it will be the worse for you"—they then ran down the field, jumped a gate, and went into Manor Road, all three together—I was about ten yards behind them—I shouted "Stop thief!" and followed them about a quarter of a mile to Queen's Road, keeping the three in sight all the way, except when they turned a corner, and then I saw them again directly after—when I got into Walden-shaw Road, opposite Queen's Road, a coachman named Leishman came to my assistance from another direction and caught Wear—the other two ran up Queen's Road, a blind road—Wear was handed over to six or seven men there, among whom was Christmas, and I followed Jones and Davis over enclosed ground—a policeman found Jones lying down; I don't know where Davis went to, I could not detain him—some few weeks ago I went to the Police-station—I saw eight men there, I think—I picked out Wear and Davis at once—I had had a good look at him at the bottom of Queen's Road, and noticed his face was angular; he had no beard then; it has grown since—I have no doubt whatever he is the man I saw running in front of Miss Adams.</p>

I am going"—I had never seen him before—I did not want to have a struggle and get hurt, and he walked away, and then took to his heels and ran—I followed, and caught Jones—I went at the beginning of July to the Police—station, and saw ten or twelve men in the court-yard—I stood on the top step, and when I first looked at the men I could not recognise them, but immediately they moved I recognised Wear—his beard had grown since I saw him before, and his clothes were different—I said, "That is the man, I am positive"—I have no doubt he is the man—at the station he said the detectives had told me who was the man; they had not.</p>

I was the prosecutor's housemaid two months—I have since left—on 13th July, about 9.30, the prisoner, who had been out on errands, came in not bringing anything, and asked if Mr. Snow had had his supper—she went upstairs—when she came down into the kitchen she had this piece of Astrachan in her hand—she said, "I have made a snatch; this will do to trim your cloak"—I thought she meant she had stolen it—I did not answer her—as I would not have anything to do with it, she put it into the clothes-basket under the table, where it would not be seen—soon after the young ladies came down, and I attended to them, and that put it out of my mind—after they had done supper one of them went to the basket to get some clean linen, and found the Astrachan there—they all asked how it came there—I said nothing—the prisoner said, "I don't know how it came there"—it was taken upstairs—Mr. Snow afterwards asked me how it came there, and I told him—the prisoner was very much under the influence of drink—she told me she was housekeeper, but really she was general servant; there was no housekeeper.</p>

I live at 145, Asylum Road, Peckham—I live on my property—on Thursday morning, 25th July, I was in Amersham Road, and I was suddenly pounced on by the prisoner and another one, who got away—they got on my back and on my head—they took my purse, containing about 18s., my knife, handkerchief, and a key—this is my handkerchief.</p>

On Monday, 25th July, I was on duty in Park Road, which turns out of Amersham Road—I saw the prisoner running through Amersham Road—I followed him, running on the other side of the road till I got ahead of him—I then crossed over and caught hold of him—he put his right hand to his trousers pocket—I caught hold of his left hand and found this knife in it—I asked him what he had got in his left hand, he said, "A knife"—I said, "How do you account for this?"—he said, "Me and my pal have been having a row, and I ran away with his knife"—I took him back to Amersham Road, where I found the prosecutor lying on the road near the kerb—I got assistance, and took prosecutor and prisoner to the station—the prosecutor was bleeding from a wound in his head—I cannot say whether he was drunk or suffering from the effects of the blow—I searched the prisoner at the station, and found three keys, a large clasp knife, 3s. 1 1/2 d., and a handkerchief—the knife and two keys and 1d. were in his left trousers pocket, the other money, small key, and handkerchief in his right trousers pocket—I showed them to the prosecutor, who identified the knife, small key, and handkerchief—I charged the prisoner with assaulting and robbing him—he made this statement at the station to the inspector—I made a note at the time: "I met another chap on the tramp, about my own height and age, with a peak cap; I never saw him before—he said, 'Halloa, here is a toff, let's upset him'; the prosecutor asked us the way to the Asylum Road; the other man struck him, knocked him down, put his hand in his pocket, and ran away with his purse; he gave me the knife to square it, and said, 'That will do for you, won't it? we both ran away together"—the prisoner could see I was taking it down in writing.</p>

               <p>Lewisham High Road—on the morning of the 25th July I examined the prosecutor at the station, and found a cut about one inch long on the top of his head; part of it extended to the membrane covering of the skull—it might have been caused by a blow from a blunt instrument or a fall—being on the top of the head, it was very unlikely to have been received by a fall—he was not drunk, but rather confused—my impression was that he had been drinking, and that he had had the blow on his head, and the two things together produced the condition he was in—he confessed to have been drinking.</p>

Rogerson; I paid him the money, believing that was the butcher's signature; it was included in the 36s.—shortly afterwards I gave him notice to leave, and he left on June 27th, after which I received a bill from Mr. Rogerson with "Bill delivered, £1 4S. 9 1/2 d." on it—I saw him, he repudiated the receipt, and I gave the prisoner in custody—this (A memorandum) is the prisoner's writing, to the best of my belief.</p>

I am a carman, of 54, Cabul Road, Battersea—on 27th April Hurstwick came and asked me to give him change for a cheque for £3 2s. 6d.—I asked him to endorse it—he did so—this is his endorsement—I could not change it—he asked if I could get it changed—I said it would be difficult, as it was Bank Holiday—I sent it to Mr. Cross—before that I said to Hurstwick "Is this cheque all right?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Who is Mr. Bromwich"—he said, "He is a patient of mine; I have been over to Balham and got it"—I said, "Have you had any before of him"—he said, "Yes, and he has a coachman and servants"—I got £2 from Cross and gave it to Hurstwick—I thought Cross had a banking account, but he had not, and he kept the cheque for some time—I saw him going to London, and ran after him and said, "This man wants 10s. very badly," and he gave him 10s.—I saw Hurstwick afterwards, and told him the cheque had been returned marked "No account"—he said, "I will go and see Bromwich about it"—he went and saw Mrs. Bromwich, who said Mr. Bromwich had gone to Manchester, that he expected £200 to be paid into the bank in a day or two, and then it would be all right.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ticket-inspector, employed by the South London Tramways Company—the prisoner was a conductor in the same employ—on 13th June, a little after 10 p.m., I was in the Albert Road, Battersea Park Road—I got on the car, of which the prisoner was conductor, to examine the passengers' tickets—I found several inside passengers' tickets which ought to have been punched by the conductor's machine were not punched, and there were five too many passengers inside—those are both matters that ought not to occur, and that I ought to speak about—I came out on the platform and told the prisoner he had some tickets not punched inside, and "You are overloaded, and you ought not to carry so many"—he said, "I can't help that, you see how I am "; he meant overloaded—I said, "I can't help that"—I went on the roof, and found there five passengers too many sitting on the rail—I told the prisoner when I came down he had five too many upstairs and that it was very dangerous—he struck me as I stood on the platform two terrific blows in the jaw with his right fist, saying, "Take that, you b——'—I got down from the car at the Prince's Head, and went in search of a policeman—the prisoner came running after me, saving he would kill me—I found two policemen, and told them what had occurred; that was about twenty yards from the car—while I was explaining the matter to them the prisoner struck me a terrific blow in the front of my jaw, breaking off and knocking five teeth down my throat, and breaking my" jaw, which is now in splints—I had given him no provocation, except to remonstrate with him—I had had no previous quarrel with him—the constable took him away, and I was taken to a doctor—on the second occasion I did not know he was going to strike me, I was taken unawares—I had not struck him, or anything of that kind—I have been in the hospital ever since—I had known him as a conductor about three months—I am a small man as compared with the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 56, Mallinson Road, Wandsworth Road; I am a window-blind maker—previous to this occurrence I knew neither conductor nor inspector—on this night I was a passenger in the car, sitting on the left-hand side next to the door as you get in—I saw the inspector get on the car, and go round and examine tickets, and go on the roof and come down again—he said to the conductor, "You have too many passengers here; you have four or five inside and likewise five outside; you know that is very wrong"—the conductor said, "If you cannot behave yourself don't come on my b——y car again"—I had not heard the inspector use any language calculated to cause a breach of the peace—the conductor said, "Get off, get off," and struck him a violent blow in the face—the inspector then went towards the Prince's Head, and the conductor, who seemed rather excited, ran after him, saying, "I will kill you, you b——y bastard"—he came back and got on his car, and the prosecutor came up with two constables—after standing for some time talking, the prisoner struck the inspector again another violent blow on the face—the constable took him into custody—from first to last I did not hear the prosecutor use any bad or exciting language to the prisoner—I should have been bound to hear it if he had.</p>

On this night, at 10 o'clock, I was on duty outside the Prince's Head—the inspector called me—I followed him to the other bide of the tram-car, about 2 1/2 yards from where I was—I found the prisoner on the car—while the inspector was making a statement to me the prisoner struck him a violent blow in the jaw—I did not lose sight of the inspector from the, time he came to me till the blow was struck—nothing was said or done by him to aggravate the prisoner, or make him strike him—the only this said was, "I want to charge that man with assaulting me on the car"—the prisoner had one foot on the footboard and one in the road when he struck the inspector, who was in the road, on the left jaw with his right hand—I told the prisoner I should take him into custody—he said, "Well, he should not torment me so much; he never would leave me alone; I will kill the b——r yet"—he repeated this several times on the way to the station—he was very excited.</p>

                  </hi>, M. R. C. S. I am assistant divisional surgeon to the police at Battersea—I examined the prosecutor on that evening—I found his jaw was broken in two places, on each side of the central line—he had the bleeding sockets of five teeth, as if they had just been knocked out—I found there were some teeth in the gullet, more than one; I could not say how many—they had gone down too far to extract, and as they</p>

               <p>threatened to suffocate him I pushed them down the gullet—a severe blow with a fist might cause such an injury to a slight person like the prosecutor, whose jaw is thin—one blow might break the jaw in two places and throw down the teeth—it is a very serious injury indeed—the man has been in the hospital ever since—I have seen him since, but not examined him—he is likely to be in the hospital some long time yet—they have just wired the jaw together to allow him to give evidence today—I do not think he will recover completely; he is in such a bad state of health his bones will not join readily—he is a man of weak physical calibre.</p>
