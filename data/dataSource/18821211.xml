I manage the Queen's Arms public-house—about 10 o'clock on the night of 26th November the last witness showed me a bad half-crown, and I broke it in two and gave it back to him, and he gave it to the child—I went to the till and examined it, and found this half-crown lying on the top—I examined it, found it was bad, and sent for a constable—I saw another man there—he asked for some liquor after the boy had been in, and after I had sent for the constable—I had not told them I had sent for one—he tendered a bad half-crown—I said "Another bad one," and he picked it up and went out—he had been talking and drinking with the prisoner—I jumped over the counter, and went to the door and gave the prisoner into custody—I gave the constable the half-crown, and said I should give the prisoner in charge—I think the prisoner said that he had not tendered any coin larger than a shilling.</p>

I am a clicker, and live in Cambridge Road, Bethnal Green—on Sunday night, 29th October, I was in Crossley's beerhouse with William Henry Jackson, John Jones, and others—about 11 o'clock we came out, and about a dozen yards from the beerhouse we were just going to disperse—Jackson went up to the palings to make water, while he was doing so two gentlemen came down the street arm in arm—the prisoner was one of them—they went across the way to my friend and asked what he was doing there—he half turned round to them and said "I am doing no harm, no offence meant"—the prisoner up with his arm and struck him in the face—he staggered back—I stepped forward and took him by the arm, and asked him to come home with me—the prisoner struck at me, I backed, he caught me on the hat and knocked it off—I missed my friend's arm to avoid the prisoner's violence, and he gave him a blow, straight from the shoulder, right in the face, and he fell straight back on his head—the prisoner's brother ran up and pulled him away, and I ran up to my friend to pick him up—I found blood flowing from his head, he had fallen on the flags—I laid him down again and ran for help—Jones came to my assistance, and we conveyed him to the London Hospital—he was sober.</p>

Herries, Farquhar, and Co., of 61, St. James's Street—we have a customer named Dora Birch, a married lady—in June of this year 20 circular notes were issued to her—before 30th November 19 of these notes had come back to the bank bearing her genuine endorsement—on 30th November, about 1.30 p.m., the prisoner Thennee came and presented this note purporting to be endorsed by Dora Birch—it is one of those issued to Mrs. Birch—I at once saw the endorsement was a forgery, as I knew her writing perfectly well—I said "How did you get possession of this note?" he said in very imperfect English that a friend had given it to him—I said "Where is your friend?" he said "He is outside"—I then sent a messenger out with him—I saw that he was lame and could not escape—the messenger returned with him and with Rohleder—I asked Rohleder where he got the note from, and he said a friend had given it to him—I laid the facts before our partners, and Mr. Farquhar gave the prisoners in custody—the circular notes bear Mrs. Birch's endorsement.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Thennee's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Interpreted</hi>). I think I have proved my innocence. I received the cheque from Rohleder; he has stated so several times. He sent me into the bank. I did not want the cheque, nor did I know when I went in that it was forged. When I got to the police-station I did not know what I was there for. Before I went into the bank I went to Rhemhardt, a money changer, and asked him if it was a genuine cheque. He said "Yes, the cheque is a good one provided it comes from honest hands. "I communicated that answer to Rohleder, who said "Yes, this cheque came from honest hands," and instructed me to go to the bank. I went to the bank, and the cashier asked me where I got it. I told him from a man who was standing outside. I called Rohleder in, and he was asked "Did you send this man with the cheque into the bank?" He said "Yes. "He was asked where he got it. I understood him to say "I had it from a friend," but the rest of the conversation, which was in English, I did not understand. Then we were taken in custody, and at the station Rohleder told the inspector that he gave me the cheque. Before the Magistrate he twice stated the same thing, and to-day he states it again. When 1 went out to fetch Rohleder in, he, without the slightest hesitation, came back with me, although he might have run away. All I did was for Rohleder, and I am sorry for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Rohleder's Defence.</hi> On 30th November, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I came to the Black Swan, and there saw Becker. I knew him for three weeks, and lent him some money some time before. I asked him for it and he gave me that cheque and said it was all the money he had, and I could give him the change to-morrow. I believed it to be genuine, and as it was written in French I asked in the public-house frequently if they thought it genuine. Some said yes, and some said they did not think it was a cheque. I met this man next morning and asked him if he knew anything about French cheques. He said he was well acquainted with a man named Reinhardt, a money changer, close to Coventry Street, and could go there. He went inside and came out and said "The banker says the cheque is all right, and has told me where to go to the bank, in St. James Street." We went there. I said "It is no use both going in with one cheque; you go in and I will wait outside." I waited ten minutes and saw him come out with a porter. I believed the cheque was genuine. They called me in and I went in directly, and the governor told mo it was a forgery. I said that it was given to me partly in payment, and I asked the inspector to allow a constable to go with me to fetch this man. I gave every information at the station about Becker, who has been knocking about the place for weeks, and the police have not given themselves any trouble to trace him. If I had known it was a bad cheque I should not have gone to the head bank where they knew the customer's signature.</p>

H. Boulton"—Smale and the cashier were present besides myself—Barnett then walked downstairs and said he had no change—he came up again about some other goods and went away and the van left—he had paid the charges—I saw him again two or three weeks ago; he presented this document <hi rend="italic">"C"</hi> to me—he signed for the samples up in the office, "Received samples ex three casks brown sugar lead, 23/11/82, pro MacEwen Anderson and Co., per J. Burrell"—on the other side is "6, Crosby Square, London, 21/11/82, Messrs. the Carron Company. Please give bearer samples of three casks of brown sugar of lead lying to our order at your wharf. Signed Mac-Ewen, Anderson, and Co. "Barnett signed that "J. Burrell" in my presence—he first signed "J. B. "—I told him to give the full signature and he did, "Burrell"—Spence had come up and halloaed out "Burrell, the man here wants a sample"—the samples of sugar of lead were handed to him and he took them away.</p>

On the afternoon of 28th November I went to the Hackney Police-station, where I found Leary in custody—I asked him for his address—he said 17A, Overbury Street, Clapton Park—I went there with Chapman and Fletcher, and found it was a marine store dealer's—Thomas was in the shop behind the counter; I asked him if Leary lived in the place—he said "Yes, upstairs"—I said I wanted to see his room—he said "Wait till Mrs. Myers comes back"—I waited some time, Mrs. Myers did not come back, and I went with Thomas upstairs—he pointed out a room on the second floor to me, the back room I think—I found nothing there—1 then went to the front room on the first floor, which Thomas said was Mrs. Myers's room—I searched it, and in the chest of drawers I found this sealskin bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I went down to the shop and searched that—I found a box underneath some rags—I asked Thomas what was in the box—he said "Rags"—I opened the box and found 28 of these sealskin bags—I said "How do you account for these being in your possession?"—he said "I can't account for them"—I found a number of other things in the shop, which I took away; among them were 89 yards of cloth—I took Thomas into custody and handed him over to another detective, and took possession of the shop.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Constable</hi>). On the morning of 17th December I went to the warehouse at 89, Bartholomew Close—I saw marks of two instruments on the door; the lock was forced, and on the doorpost were twenty or thirty marks of some rough instrument—on 29th November I went to 17A, Overbury Street—Fletcher, Mackenzie, Hunt, and Wade were there at the time—I saw Fletcher find this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the sideboard near the fireplace—Hunt found this file (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) I afterwards compared these instruments with the marks on the door—the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> is not a straight edge; if it is inserted one way it will make a different mark one side to the other—it corresponded with some of the marks, and on one edge is some brass from the lock—the file has one flat and one oval side—on the doorpost the flat side fitted exactly, and on the door the oval side—there were also prints of the cut file in the plate—I was not at the police-court when the prisoners were together in the dock.</p>

On the afternoon of 28th November I was called to Humberstone'S shop, where I found Myers and Ince—Mr. Humberstone gave them in custody and handed me a diamond ring—I told them I should take them into custody for being concerned with a man in custody with breaking into a warehouse in the City and stealing a large quantity of sealskin bags and other articles on the 16th—Myers said she knew nothing about it—I took them to Hackney Police-station—Myers gave an address at 15, Overbury Street, and afterwards said "17A, Overbury Street"—I went there and found it in the possession of Wade, Chapman, and Fletcher—I assisted in removing a large quantity of stolen property to the police-station at Hackney—I told Myers I had found a large quantity of bags and other articles in her house—she made no reply—I then took her and Ince to the Snow Hill Police-station, where the other two prisoners were—Hoffman came and identified the bags in the presence of the four prisoners as his property, or the property of his employer—the male prisoners said both together "We done the job ourselves; the woman had nothing to do with it"—the charge was afterwards read over to them, and they made no reply.</p>

On 18th November I went with Sergeant Frost to Tindall's Buildings, Gray's Inn Road, and saw the prisoner coming out of No. 11, a common lodging-house—I had the letter with me and asked him whether he wrote it to Mr. Gladstone—he said "Yes, I wrote that letter to Mr. Gladstone, and I did so for the purpose of bringing my case before the public"—I said that I was a police inspector, and should take him in custody for sending a letter to Mr. Gladstone threatening to murder him—he said "No, not murder"—on the way to the station he said "I was in the Land Transport Corps in the Crimea. I was afterwards in the Royal Artillery and servant to Colonel Brackenbury. I deserted and was apprehended, tried by court martial, and acquitted, the evidence of identity not being sufficient. I then went to live with Mrs. Pinkerton, the keeper of several common lodging-houses. I had 12 months' imprisonment for assaulting, her, which I underwent in Coldbath Fields Prison. I also</p>

               <p>had 12 months' imprisonment for threatening the same person, which I underwent in Holloway Prison. I have been examined by Dr. Gibson, the surgeon of Newgate, who certified that I was a dangerous lunatic. Since 1867 I have been in several lunatic asylums. I was at the asylum at Stone, that is near Dartford, and also at the asylum at Darenth, where I escaped and was recaptured. I was also in the City of London Asylum at Bow. I have been three times in America; twice I had my passage paid, and once I worked my passage"—I searched him at the station, but only found this clasp knife.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Interpreted</hi>). I am 72 years of age—I am unable to speak English—I am a Russian, formerly living at Odessa—I was a magistrate there—I had a brother named Ivan Savitch; he died in Italy—I was entitled under his will to a certain number of bonds—on 22nd August I went to my solicitor's office in Cornhill with the prisoner—I knew him some time after my arrival in London, one or two months before I went to the solicitor's—he used to interpret for me, I took him for that purpose—I also went to the bank—Mr. Heriot and I were the executors under my brother's will—the bonds were delivered over to me, and I signed a receipt for them; they were Russian and Italian bonds—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the particulars of them—I had a bag with me, and they were put into it; the prisoner assisted me in putting them in—I consulted him as to the bank where I should deposit them, which I was not quite decided upon—I wanted to put them in safe deposit—he said "God preserve you from putting them into <hi rend="smallCaps">MESSRS</hi>. Hambro's hands, because who is to know what might happen with Hambro's in the course of a few years?"—after having some luncheon we went to 34, York Place, where I was lodging—I there wanted to cut the coupons off, but as there were no scissors in the place the prisoner proposed to me to go to his place, and I went to 16, Blandford Street—we there cut off the coupons from the bonds—I think it was 3 o'clock when we commenced cutting off the coupons, to between 5 and 6—after that we dined and played at chess—at 6 o'clock I went to visit Mdlle. Glasenoff—I had the bag with me—that was the lady who had money left under the will—the prisoner accompanied me as a sort of body-guard, not</p>

               <p>wishing to go with such valuable property upon me—I did not find Mdlle. Glasenoff at home, and we went back to Blandford Street, and there played chess till 10—I had the bag and the bonds with me—I then put on my hat, and prepared to go away—I went from the drawing-room towards a small room where my bag was deposited on the table, when the prisoner came behind me and placed himself in front of me, at or near the table where the bag was; I lifted up my hand to take the bag up, and he took hold of me by the throat, gave me a kick, and threw me down, and then began to strangle me by squeezing my throat—I do not know what struggles I made, but I cried out, and probably when he heard steps on the staircase he let go of me, took up the bag, and ran away—my hat was knocked off although there was no struggle, because it was only the affair of a moment—I don't know whether he had his hat on or where it was—I immediately got up and went down after him, and just caught sight of him going out of the door—he had no hat on then—I called out—I saw a policeman afterwards near Madame Tussaud's, but could not speak to him—I afterwards found a man at my lodging who could speak for me—I then went to the police-station and gave information—the bonds are payable to bearer—the total value is about 15,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I next saw the prisoner in custody at the police-court.</p>

Hambro's office and seen Mr. Heriot; he spoke to me in French—I don't know that there are persons there who speak many foreign languages—three days after passing Blandford Street I saw the prisoner, who said he had just returned from Paris—after he had accompanied me as interpreter about 8 or 10 days I spoke to him about this matter—I had received about 1,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Messrs. Hambro's office before receiving these bonds, in various foreign securities, no English—I don't think the prisoner was with me when I received them—I believe Mr. Heriot gave them to me at the Bank of England, and I took them home to York Place—when I went to the Bank of England on the 22nd with Mr. Heriot the prisoner did not carry the bag, I carried it—the prisoner was present when the bonds were handed over to me; they were not handed to the prisoner—Mr. Heriot counted them; the prisoner did not, nor take them into his hand—after we left <hi rend="italic">The Bell</hi> we went to Mr. Parker's office, and the bonds were divided and afterwards counted—I being rather clumsy at counting, and the prisoner being very clever at it, he commenced to count them—I put them in a bag, and he assisted me—I carried the bag—I gave this medal to the prisoner; it is to C. Hertzen on the death of his father—Hertzen was a celebrated writer in Russia on the education of the peasants—his paper is called <hi rend="italic">La Cloche</hi> (<hi rend="italic">The Bell</hi>)—I found this medal among the old papers belonging to my father—I was a Justice of the Peace in Odessa for three years, receiving 4,500 roubles salary—gentlemen are only elected to that office for three years—the right of reappointment exists, but I resigned because it was too much fatigue for me—I do not know that the circulation of this medal is prohibited in Russia—I have not belonged to any society of any kind in Russia—there is no secret society in Odessa to my knowledge—my brother Ivan was never a member of a society in Odessa, you must</p>

               <p>not throw dirt upon a dead person—I never had any conversation with my brother about any disposition by him of his property, except that in the two wills—I promised to pay the prisoner handsomely for his services according to the Russian habit, but I never promised to hand him over half the bonds, less 10 per cent., or any portion of them, nor had I given him any instructions whatever as to what he was to do with any portion or the whole of them—I have not been to the Russian Ambassador since these proceedings commenced—I went to the Consul, and on the first occasion I spoke to him about the robber; on the second I went to pay the expenses of publishing a description of the man, which came to about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I only went twice—I had no scissors in Mr. Parker's office, and the prisoner proposed to me to go to his house—there were no coupons to cut off the 1,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bonds, they were detached—we had wine at dinner at Novitsky's house, but no coffee—I said that violence was used to me—I did not correct my deposition when it was read over to me, and say that no violence was used—I corrected the sum and something else, but not about the violence.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> To the best of my memory the prisoner was present when I gave them to the prosecutor—we received them at the Bank of England, took them to Mr. Parker's office, and gave Mdlle. de Glasenoff what she was entitled to, 8,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. nominal—she only took five under the will, the actual value was about 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Nicholas took what he was entitled to, and gave me an order to deliver to her the extra bonds and I did go—I took Mr. Savitch's receipt for them, and wished him to count them—he did not do so, but the prisoner did; and placed them in a black bag—I think it was mainly the prisoner who placed them in the bag, and the impression on my mind is that the prisoner took up the bag and went away—when he was counting the bonds he appeared to be checking the amounts, for which purpose he must look at each bond, and he did his work properly as far as I could see—Mr. Savitch is acquainted with two or three languages—almost every one in my office speaks many languages—our relations are very large with foreign countries—there was no necessity for an interpreter in my office between Mr. Savitch and any one there—I do not speak Russian, nor is it spoken in my office—the general conversation is in French—I am not executor under the torn document—I know of no suggestion about a third will—I never heard of any other except the torn document—I think I first saw Nicholas in June, and after he had made the prisoner's acquaintance he generally came with him to the office.</p>

I am a tobacconist, of 2, Green End, Woolwich—on 4th November two soldiers, one of whom was a corporal, came in—I am unable to identify him—he bought a sword-stick similar to this for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he seemed to me to have been drinking, and he said "You must excuse us getting a little jolly occasionally "—I said "I don't mind that, but 1 hope you will not get into any trouble through getting too much to drink.

On 4th November, about 8 p.m., I received information, and went with Inspector Webber to the dispensary, where I saw the body of the deceased—I sent for Dr. Sharp, who pronounced him dead—I examined No. 1 room and found a quantity of blood on the floor at the foot of the deceased's cot—I examined the deceased's clothes and found holes through the left breast of the tunic and shirt—I found the prisoner in the guard-room strapped down—he appeared perfectly mad, he was halloaing, shouting, struggling, and asking to be released as he was in great pain, but lie did not say from what.</p>

I have done it on the drink, and I shall go to the gallows like a man; I am not afraid to meet my Maker; I should like to give you a little advice as you have been kind "—I cautioned him that what he had to say he had better reserve till he reached the station—he said, "Very well," but he repeated, "See how I will go to the gallows"—he also said, "I have suffered a great deal, I have been flogged"—we got to the station at 10.30 p.m., and he was placed in the dock and charged.</p>

Upon that it is objected, that the taking of the deposition and the signing by the witness and the Magistrate ought to be one continuous act, and if not signed by the Magistrate at the time it would be an invalid deposition. In order to read the statute in that way you would have to import into the section the words 'then and there' shall put the same into writing, and 'then and there' the same shall be signed. Those words are not in the statute; that may be a matter for the Legislature to consider, but being bound by the simple language of the statute, conditions cannot be imported into it which the Legislature has not put into it.

I was always in good health before she came. I became poorly first about three months ago. I felt queer and sick, and the doctor ordered mo some medicine. Mrs. Taylor always gave me the medicine; I could not say whether she took it out of a bottle; she took it out of this bottle—two table<lb/>spoonfuls. It caused me to be very sick after taking it. I felt sick three months ago after taking the medicine. I saw two bottles used at a time, both of this size. The doctor ordered me one bottle at a time to be used every four hours. I saw some white powder put in by Mrs. Taylor; I tasted it, and said 'I can't take that; it is nauseous stuff, and as sour as vinegar. 'I took it, one dose; I don't know whether it was two or not; I won't say for certain. I know now it was two doses. I went to take some</p>

I haven't seen her do anything to the medicine after the occasion I mentioned. It made me quite ill, and quite in a stupor. In about about an hour after I felt a burning heat in my throat. I was very sick indeed; black vomit came up about an hour after I took the medicine. I thought I tasted the same medicine again afterwards, but not so strong. I was sick again two months ago after taking the medicine. "</p>

                  </hi>. I am a M. R. C. S., of 89, Plumstead Road—I am a general practitioner, and have a retail shop there—on 23rd August I went to Naylor's Cottages; I can't say who fetched me—I went upstairs to a back room, and there saw Mrs. Tregellis in bed—I had seen her before, but not as a patient—she was lying on her back—she seemed very low and weak, and complained of sickness and cold shivers and perspiration, and tenderness of the pit of the stomach and abdomen—her complexion looked sallow, and she complained of confined bowels—I asked her age; she said 82—her teeth were dark, and her tongue was also dark brown, not all the way, but at the back part—I thought that she was probably suffering from an attack of ague—Plumstead is an agueish place, and I thought it was probably ague, debility, and old age—I continued to attend her for 11 days daily, and then every other day, till 6th September—I think the prisoner was almost always present—I sent in medicine, and gave the prisoner instructions what to do and how to give the medicine—I never saw the woman sick, but she frequently complained of being sick; in fact she said everything made her sick—I frequently asked the prisoner to save the vomit—the prisoner described it to be of a darkish green character, with a yellow shade, but I never saw it—the prisoner said it was so very offensive she really could not keep it; at other times she told me the motion was with it, and she could not save it that way; that it had got mixed in the utensil—on 6th September I ceased to attend her; the sick<lb/>ness had abated to a great extent, and she was getting better—the teeth seemed to get darker—I asked the prisoner about the teeth and also about the tongue, and she said the teeth had always been so—she did not make any remark about the tongue—I had no suspicion of anything—there was no powder in the medicines I sent; it was mixtures and pills, no white powder whatever—Í don't think there was anything in my medicine that was likely to make her sick—some people are sick at very little—there was nothing in the nature of an emetic; it was not my object to produce sickness, but the reverse, to allay the sickness—on 9th September I was called in again; the symptoms had returned, except the shivers—she was very much as before, lying in bed. but she had removed to the front room—when I left her she was up and walking about, and I then gave orders for her to be removed to the front room, as it was brighter and more airy—Tregellis, I believe, sent for me on the 9th—I saw the prisoner there—I continued to attend about every other day till 16th September—during that period I believe she was sick as before—she complained very much of sickness still, but I never saw the vomit—the teeth were still black, and she was very low, very feeble, but I thought, considering her age and the health she had had, that she was fairly well, and I left on the 16th—the medicinen I sent in from the 9th to the 16th were mixtures and pilla, no white powder—on Friday, 6th October, I was called in again—I saw her then in bed, she was very much weaker, very feeble indeed, very</p>

               <p>yellow, sallow, and the sickness and everything had been making her weak—she was almost too weak to speak—she was suffering from muscular tremor of the fingers—all the fingers were moving; she could scarcely lift her hand—that was a sign of great weakness—I have frequently seen it in old age—she complained of sickness and vomiting, and great pain in the stomach and abdomen, and general feebleness—I could see she was very much worse—I noticed that her teeth were black, as before—I think they were much about the same as before, but I examined her gums then and found a blue line on the gums next the teeth especially were very dark blue, showing evidence of chronic lead poisoning—I may say also that where the tartar was on the teeth it was very much darker than where the enamel was clear—I have been in practice at Woolwich getting on four years—I have seen cases of lead poisoning, and I have no doubt on the subject—this blue line is a very distinctive feature of chronic lead poisoning—the pain in the abdomen and tenderness at the pit of the stomach are also signs—I noticed that the whites of her eyes were very yellow—I can't say whether I examined her eyes in the first instance—the darkness of the teeth might be caused by other things than lead—some mineral poisons, sugar-of-lead in solution, would do it—sugar-of-lead in solution would produce a burning sensation in the throat, if given in large quantities—a very minute quantity probably might not be detected; 20 or 30 grains would—if given in large quantity I believe it would produce sickness, and it produces costiveness—I have not seen it given in quantities—lead does not produce costiveness where it is not taken in quantities—this is the first case I have seen where sugar-of-lead was given; it has been lead in some other form—it makes the urine of a high colour, I believe—I saw the urine in this case; it was dark red—that was after I had been called in the last time—sugar-of-lead is a white crystalline powder without any lumps—it is not perfectly soluble in water; it produces a white deposit in ordinary water—it gives a milk-and<lb/>water appearance—the effect is cumulative; it is not an active poison—it gets absorbed into the blood and the whole system—it accumulates in the body; it is not discharged as fast as it gets in—arsenic continually passes through the body, and in vomiting till it is ejected—it produces its effects immediately, and on its passage through the body—after 6th October Mrs. Ellis attended to Mrs. Tregellis, and acted under my instructions—on the 9th I got Dr. Sharpe to see her, and we both saw the blue lines on the jaw—I continued to treat her as suffering from chronic lead-poisoning—she died on 23rd October—I believe she was not sick at all from the 6th to the 23rd—she never complained of sickness—she rallied very much the first week or 10 days, and then gradually sank, paralysis coming on—chronic lead-poisoning does produce paralysis, but not the paralysis described in this case—probably it had not been sufficiently long to produce general paralysis—I saw her urine during that period; it was of a dark reddish colour—I requested Dr. Sharpe to make the post-mortem—I was present and Dr. Atkins was present representing the prisoner—I prefer Mr. Sharp giving, the details of the post-mortem—I saw small pieces of the large intestine constricted, about four or five inches, narrowing certain parts of it—I did not attach much importance to that—there was nothing in the state of the organs to account for death—the blue lines still remained quite as much, and the dark teeth'—in my judgment the cause of dearth was chronic lead</p>

               <p>by the Home Office in these cases—on 26th October I received two jars from Sergeant Morgan—I sent a message by him, and received a third on the 28th—they were internal portions of a body—I analysed them—there were portions of liver weighing 27-Joz.—I did not see any sign of disease there—in one pound of that liver, 16oz, I found 256 of a grain of lead, a little more than a quarter of a grain—the average weight of a whole liver would be about 35oz. for a woman upwards of 80-the lead was in the liver, and I have no doubt it had been absorbed during rife; I have every reason to think it would be absorbed fairly equally throughout the whole liver, therefore the whole would be 56 of a grain, rather more than half a grain—the spleen was of the usual size—it contained a trace only of lead, not enough to estimate the quantity—the kidneys, as would usually be the case in a woman of her age, were wasted in the secreted portions—they were of full average weight for her age, upwards of 80—I found a small quantity of lead there, about one-thousandth of a grain; it was too small to be absolutely sure of the exact quantity—that was in one kidney—the stomach had been cut open, and was empty—I noticed the blackened appearance of it which Mr. Sharpe has described, at the end next the intestine more especially and in streaky patches—that might be due to the lead in the stomach—I analysed half the stomach; I found lead, the '216 of a grain, that is nearly one-half of a grain—I received the other half—I might say that it might not be equally developed over the whole stomach—there was a portion of lung—I examined that, and found a trace of lead, but not enough to estimate the quantity—1 noticed a peculiar appearance, dark slaty patches on the inner or mucous coat of the intestines, which I have several times observed in cases of lead-poisoning—I analysed the darkened portion and the undarkened also—the darkened portion contained lead—I could not detect any in the undarkened—the portion of brain weighed 10oz.—I could not say it was healthy—the arteries were atheromatous—it was quite pulped—the arteries were diseased, as they would be found in old people—I found in 8oz. of the brain 049 of a grain, that is nearly the twentieth part of a grain of lead—I should think it would be probably equal y absorbed over the whole brain—it is found in the nervous system generally—a woman of that age would probably have a brain weighing 40oz.—one-third of the whole would be diseased, 245, or nearly a quarter of a grain—I think that was all the viscera I had—a woman taking sugar-of-lead internally might account fear its pre<lb/>sence there—I think the dark condition of the stomach might be due to it, and the appearance of the intestines was entirely in accordance with what 1 have seen in lead-poisoning—acute poisoning by acetate of lead has pro<lb/>duced a red colour of the urine—I cannot say that I have observed it myself—a solution of lead coming in contact with this teeth darkens them if it is not washed away—blueneas of the gums is a characteristic of lead<lb/>poisoning—it is observed in the great majority of eases where lead has been taken over a lengthened period-—it is not commonly observad after one dose—it has been said that mercury does the same—I have never aeon that myself—I do not think two competent men would be liable to make a mistake upon such a subject, not if they observed with care—if sugar-of<lb/>lead were given for a time and then Ms administration stopped I should expect sickness would cease, that being one of the symptoms produced by</p>

               <p>it—I could not say how long it would take for the lead to be absorbed into the portions I found—I think it must have been given at no distant period before death, and in considerable quantities, probably a month before—if sugar-of-lead is taken in considerable quantities it has a sweetish taste—it is said to be followed by a nauseous sensation and burning in the throat and stomach and frequent vomiting, very great depression, cold perspiration, pain in the region of the stomach, sometimes, not always, tenderness throughout—it may produce looseness of the bowels, but more commonly costiveness, and the motions are often black from the action of the gases in the intestines—it does not affect the mind immediately, but sometimes a kind of semi-stupor has been observed—the symptoms as a rule pass off quickly after one dose—the skin becomes yellow and dingy—I have heard the evidence given in Court—I do not think there was any disease in the organs to account for death—assuming the account given by Mr. Smith and Mr. Sharpe to be correct, I think death was hastened by taking some com<lb/>pound of lead.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Earl of Beaconsfield public-house, Alpha Road, Deptford—my brother George is a builder, at 257, Southwark Park Road—I did not know the prisoner before November 24th—1 know now that he is a police constable—on the night of 26th November Fern and I secreted ourselves in a loft. on my brother's premises—there is a window there through which we could see very clearly—the pantry is about 15 feet from the window—you can see more clearly from the door—the gate is in Bombay Street, about 15 feet from the pantry, which is between the loft and the gate—from that loft we could see any person coming in at the gate—I had previously marked three pieces of meat with a cross, by sticking a knife right through, so that if anybody cut a piece off they could not cut it out, and I rubbed it over with fat—about 1.30 I was looking from the door, saw a constable look in at the gate and go away again, and again about 2 o'clock, and about 4 o'clock the gate opened, and I saw an arm put through and remove the bar and throw the gate wide open, and then I saw a constable, the prisoner, come in on tip-toe; it was moonlight and I could see his face and his number, 62—he caught hold of the pantry door, which moves on rolling wheels, and rocked it about three inches, then looked up at the loft, and then pulled it three more inches; he then pulled it a third time and walked into the pantry—he came out in about three minutes and looked bulky behind—he had his bull's-eye lantern—he went out and closed the door behind him, but left the pantry door undone—I went into the pantry and missed two ribs of beef, about 1 1/2 lb., which I bad marked—I followed him in about four minutes, and seeing a constable on the other side of the road I thought he was the person, but he was not, and I went to the end of Bombay Street, to a dark corner, and ran up to the prisoner and said "I want that beef you have got"—he said "You won't have it; that is my supper"—I saw the same number again—I said "You are eating my meat"—it was cooked—another constable came up and I gave the prisoner in charge going to the station he ate every bit of it and threw away the bones—it was worth about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 16, Henslow Bond, Barry Road, Peckham Road, and am a merchant's clerk—on 29th September my attention was called to an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph,</hi> and I made this copy of it: "To small private capitalists; 20<hi rend="italic">ll.</hi> wanted for 21 days; security valued at over 70<hi rend="italic">ll.;</hi> value of 70<hi rend="italic">ll.</hi> deposited, and a bonus of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. will be paid; address Mr. Hope, 190, Oxbridge Road"—I communicated with the person at 190, Uzbridge Road, and about four days alter, on 3rd October, the prisoner called on me—he produced my letter and handed me this card, "Mr. G. W. Childers, Merchant Jeweller, Holbrook House, Canterbury Road, Brixton "—he said he was a merchant jeweller, that lie was temporarily pressed for money, and had been obliged to pawn part of his stock; that he had a large wedding order in hand, and was in</p>

               <p>want of a further 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that it was a very common thing for people in his trade to pledge part of their stock in order to raise money temporarily, sometimes to the extent of a couple of thousand pounds—he then pro<lb/>duced a number of contract notes and pawn-tickets, which he was pre<lb/>pared to give as security, and he said "The goods are pledged for about a third or half of their value "—I said I did not like the security, as I was unacquainted with the value of pawn-tickets, and suggested instead or in addition one or two articles themselves from his stock—he said the tickets themselves were ample security, as there was a margin of over 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but he took this watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from his pocket, and said it was a gold lever and worth about 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I then agreed to let him have the money—I could not let him have the money that night, but I arranged to meet him next day at London Bridge Station about 3 o'clock and bring it with me, when he was to hand me over the watch—he left the tickets with me that night, and wrote a promissory note for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at 21 days—on the next day I kept the appointment—he did not attend, but on the next day, the 6th, he came to me about 9 o'clock in the evening—he handed me over the watch and I gave him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash—when I parted with my money I believed the statements he made—he left a list with me showing the articles that the duplicates referred to and the amounts they were pledged for, which comes in the aggregate to 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he wrote down beyond mat a margin of 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—those are his figures, "Gold lever watch and 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." in pencil—the bill would become due on 26th October—it was not met—I did not see the prisoner after 6th October till I saw him at the police-court after the bill became due I made inquiries as to the watch of <hi rend="smallCaps">MESSRS</hi>. Strabb and Hamptings to ascertain its value, and the result was that I did not pursue my inquiries with regard to other articles—I subsequently filed an information, on which a warrant was issued—I have never received any of the money I advanced to the prisoner.</p>

I received a warrant for the prisoner's apprehension, and on 2nd November I followed him to 2, Caxton Road, Shepherd's Bush—he entered—I followed, and read the warrant to him—he said "Mr. Hough lent me the money upon my promissory note, and I am prepared to pay him. I should have paid him when my second note became due "—he afterwards said "The articles, some of them, are worth two or three times as much as they are pledged for, and if Mr. Hough had come to my place at Brixton I could have paid him "—I took him to Southwark Police-station, and charged him—he made no reply—he gave me the address Holbrook House, 9, Canterbury Road, Brixton—I searched and found on him 45 pawnbrokers' duplicates, 28 special contract notes, four blank bill forms, several business cards, "G. W. Childers, Merchant Jeweller, Holbrook House, Brixton," also a piece of paper torn from a news paper, with two advertisements on it, and a number of receipts for adver tisements, a silver watch and metal chain, which he was wearing—the advertisement was for a loan of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. till 8th instant; offering a bonus of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and deposit of security, with the address "Mr. Hope, 2, Shepherd's Bush Green"—he had also on him a postal note for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, carrying on business at 45, Blackman Street, and am secretary of the Pawnbrokers Protection society—I received from Martin a list and a number of pawn-tickets which corresponded with the list, and I went round to all the pawnbrokers named in the list, taking the duplicates with me to see the pledges—I saw all but two, one at Mr. Solomon's, Gray's Inn Road, and the other at Mr. Smith's, Hoxton—[ made an examination of the jewellery to see what the value was, and I found they were pledged for about as much as they would fetch as second-hand jewellery; putting the whole together in bulk, I should think a little more than what it was pledged for—about a quarter was pledged for a little more than it was worth, half for its fair value, and a quarter for a little less than than its value—in no instance have I found anything pledged for half its value as second-hand, half its cost not half its selling value—I should say the whole of it cost con<lb/>siderably more than it is pledged for, but I should not like to say double—the bulk of the articles would be worn by ladies who hadn't the means of going to first-class houses—an auction would be a good market for them—I have seen this watch; its outside value would be 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. second<lb/>hand—generally speaking, all the things I saw would be treated as second-hand in the trade—that is the value I gave you and the value I expect they would realise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Directly a thing is pawned, although it is new we call it second-hand—we bring it as near as we can to a new article if it has just been bought—I have known pawnbrokers buy new stock and sell it as second-hand, but it is very exceptional—in some instances people rely on the opinion of the pawnbroker, who can therefore sell new things for more than they would fetch in a shop—since the pawning to R. Atten<lb/>borough's of the single-stone brilliant ring in September, diamonds have fallen 10 per cent., about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound; they were cut brilliants—I told the Magistrate that pawnbrokers' value is what the things will fetch at a forced sale—if the article is destroyed by fire, the pawnbroker will return the value and 25 per cent, after deducting his principal and profit—if an article were pledged for <hi rend="italic">U.</hi> and the interest were 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., if that was for 12 months we should deduct the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. before we paid anything to the customer if it was destroyed by fire—<hi rend="italic">if</hi> it were pledged lor 12 months and destroyed at the last month, he would get nothing for interest—a pawnbroker or his assistant has to put in pledge his judg<lb/>ment of the value—nearly every respectable pawnbroker in London lends more than the value, because they wish to do business and people want to redeem—if it runs out we may lose on the transaction—we do not always lose—we have to keep it for three years, and if we make an extra amount on the forced sale, we have to pay it over to the customer—I have paid such a balance over myself; it does not often happen—pledges that</p>

               <p>have run over are sold at Debenham and Store's—there are many dealers in jewellery and precious stones who principally keep their stock at pawn brokers' shops, because it is easier to sell a ticket with the judgment of the pawnbroker on the value of the article than it is to get people to buy on their own judgment—the person wanting the article sees it described on the ticket, goes and looks at it at the pawnbroker's, and then buys the ticket—I think that is the best market—it is usual to demand the interest up to the time of showing—Mr. Beaumont, a pawnbroker of Goswell Road, went with me—I should think the watch if bought in an expen sive market cost 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. new—I should say it would be sold at more than 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Bond Street but less in Whitechapel—in Bishopsgate Street, where ships' captains come, I should say it would have fetched about 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should not quite like to say that the price of an article in a shop would on an average be double what it was pledged for—jewellery does bear a large profit—I should say a quarter of the articles I saw appeared to be new—half were in good condition—I said it was not jewellery concocted to look worth more than it really is; I also said, "A man buying jewellery to sell by auction could realise some by pawning, and then if he could borrow money on or sell the ticket he would make a clear gain "—the amount of advance on the tickets is 228<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and then there are eight which I have not seen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If a man sells the ticket for the value disclosed on it, he gets double value for the article, and the man who buys the ticket has to pay that sum over again to redeem the article—all articles above 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. are obliged by law to be sold, and the ordinary market is the auctioneer's market—we charge 25 per cent, on the amount we advance up to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 20 per cent, above 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and above 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. anything the parties choose to contract for—it is an advantage to the pawnbroker to lend up to the full value because of the interest he gets—I might lend 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on this watch if offered by a person likely to redeem it—if offered by a person I did not know I should not lend so much: I should regard it as a speculative pledge at 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
