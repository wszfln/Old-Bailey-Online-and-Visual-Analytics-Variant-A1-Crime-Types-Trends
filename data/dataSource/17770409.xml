               <p>Did Mrs. Baker go into the room? - I cannot say whether I went farther than the door in my fright; I cannot tell but I might.</p>
               <p>Did you see the deceased? - Yes she was leaning against the servant; she was blood; she put up her hands and said, He has killed me.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing in his hand? - I cannot say that I did; he said something, but what I really cannot tell; I was frightened and ran away; I fetched a countryman of their acquaintance whose name is Lavendar; the prisoner went away, Lavendar went with me up stairs, and then he went and fetched a surgeon.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any conversation between the deceased and Lavender? - No; I went down stairs directly; I went afterwards to see the deceased in the hospital, and she said, Her husband had struck her with a poker.</p>

               <p>Do you remember how long it was after that that he was discharged out of custody? - I think he came out that very day or the next, and went back again.</p>
               <p>I believe he was out of custody a long time before she died? - About a week, I believe.</p>

               <p>Mr. CHARTER. The woman never made any such declaration to me, nor never said any thing like it, nor never made any such enquiry;

               <p>What room was this iron chest in? - The parlour.</p>
               <p>All your servants go into that room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many are there in your family? - Twelve or fourteen.</p>
               <p>There is a great number of keys upon that bunch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>All the keys of your house? - No.</p>
               <p>You often part with this bunch of keys when things are wanted? - I generally serve them myself.</p>
               <p>I believe you suspected a variety of servants besides Donnovan? - No, none but him; there was a pocket-book found upon Kerwin which was in the chest at the same time; it has a silver clasp to it.</p>
               <p>Did not you suspect a maid-servant that was gone away and send after her? - I did not suspect her stealing any thing, but thought that she might know something about it.</p>

               <p>Was it open? - No; I know it by a bit of the clasp being loose on the side.</p>

               <p>Did you ever receive a note from her? - Yes, on Wednesday the 5th of March; the prisoner had owed me 100 l. and upwards for two years, for houshold furniture; she came to my house with a pretence to pay me part of this money.</p>
               <p>Where had you delivered the furniture? - At Chelsea; she told me on the 5th of March that she had a note drawn upon Mr. Tutte, for 50 l. she said, if I could discount it she would pay me 10 l. of it; knowing that there were so many forgeries about I rather suspected the note; I told her I had not cash enough in the house to discount the note, I would go and ask my neighbour that lived just by; I meant to know what he thought of it; my neighbour, Mr. Atkinson, suspected it to be a forged note; when he saw it he came back to my house and asked Mrs. Thomas if she presented that note as a true note of Mr. Tutte's? she said she did; he asked her again; she said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177704090017"/> again that she did; he told her he rather suspected it, because the signature of the note was not like the hand of a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Who is Mr. Tutte? - A <rs id="t17770409-17-viclabel84" type="occupation">clergyman</rs>

               <p>Did you know him? - Yes; I should not have refused the note if I had known it to be his note.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said about who he was, or what he was when the prisoner was present? - The prisoner knew that I knew Mr. Tutte very well.</p>
               <p>Where did Mr. Tutte live? - At Kensington-gore; Mr. Atkinson proceeded to ask several other questions; whether she would chuse that he should enquire of Mr. Tutte concerning this note? he said he would discount the note for me, but he did not chuse to discount the note without he knew the person well that it was drawn upon; Mrs. Thomas said that Mr. Tutte was at Oxford; he asked her if he should write to him? she did not chuse that that should be done; he asked her how it came if Mr. Tutte was at Oxford that the signature should be one hand and the body of the note another? her answer was, that the note was written by a person in town and sent in a letter to him to Oxford, for him to sign, and then returned back to her; Mr. Atkinson said, he would decline having any thing to do with the note; he went out of my parlour, I followed him to the door: said he, I will go to one Barnarda, I think the name is, that keeps a confectioner's shop in the Haymarket; for there Mrs. Thomas said she had paid a note of Mr. Tutte's a little before, and that Barnarda would give satisfaction that this was a real note; Mr. Atkinson said, if I would keep her in suspense a little time he would go and enquire; he came back and said Mr. Barnarda told him he had received such a note; he said, if you go to Mr. Strong who is attorney for Mr. Tutte, he will know the signature as he does business for him; when Mr. Atkinson told me that, I asked Mrs. Thomas for the note again, and told her I would try elsewhere to get cash for it; we took it to Mr. Strong; he said it was not Mr. Tutte's hand-writing, and advised me to take Mrs. Thomas before Sir

               <p>Upon the afternoon of the 25th of March Mr. Blades brought me a note; he told me he was to receive some money out of it in part of the payment of an old debt contracted by Mrs. Thomas; I went to Mr. Blades's house; I asked her, do you present this as a true note of Mr. Tutte's? she said, she did; I asked her again, do you present this as a true note of Mr. Tutte's? I observed that the name Francis was not rightly spelt; I said it does not appear to be the hand of a gentleman; she said, gentlemen you know frequently write very bad; it is done in haste; I said, Madam, you will pardon me, there is a deal of care taken in writing of it; but it is done by a very bad writer; it appears to me to be the hand of a lady; no, said she; I said, Ma'am, will you give me leave to ask, how had you it from Mr. Tutte, from his own hands? she said, no, not from his own hands; how then? she said Mr. Tutte sent it me; said I, if you will be kind enough to leave this note with Mr. Blades, he shall walk over to Mr. Tutte's this evening; if he acknowledges it to be a true note of his, you shall upon my honor have cast for it to-morrow morning; Sir, said she, that will by no means do, for Mr. Tutte is now at Oxford; at Oxford, Madam? yes, says she; how had you the note then from Mr. Tutte? said she, I received it by a letter; I said, the note seems to be of one hand writing, the signature of another; how do you account for that? said she, I sent the note down to Mr. Tutte, and he returned it by the next post to me signed; I still objected to it; she said, it was a matter of indifference to her, if Mr. Blades or I did not chuse to give cash for the note, there was a Mr. Barnarda, who kept an 'Italian warehouse in the Haymarket, who was perfectly acquainted with Mr. Tutte and his hand-writing; that the last week he had given her cash for a note of Mr. Tutte's; hearing this, though it was a very suspicious thing, yet I thought if my friend Mr. Blades had an opportunity of getting 10 l. of the money that he did not expect to get a halfpenny of, it would be an advantage; I was in hopes it might be a true note; I wished her a good evening and walked through the parlour into the shop; Mr. Blades followed me; I told him I should be exceeding glad if he could get 10 l. and that I would step across the way to Mr. Barnarda to know the truth of it; I went to Mr. Barnarda and told him the story; he said he was neither acquainted with Mr. Tutte or his hand-writing; he had seen his hand-writing once, and from seeing it that once he had an opportunity of knowing a person who could acquaint me of every circumstance; he referred me to Mr. Strong; happening to have some knowledge of Mr. Strong, Mr. Blades and I went to Mr. Strong.</p>

               <p>Enough for her to understand you? - Sufficiently so.</p>
               <p>She directed you to a Mr. Barnarda who had discounted a note of Mr. Tutte's? - No; and if you please I will give you my reasons for saying that.</p>

               <p>Was that the first application that was made to you on the part of the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you go with him to the Counter? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to him? - No.</p>

               <p>How did his mother know you knew any thing of it? - I cannot say, that I did not enquire about; she came to me and said, a person told her I was there and saw him stoop.</p>
               <p>Who was that person? - Upon my word I don't know.</p>
               <p>Did you mention this to any person? - I mentioned it to several people, that I saw a man taken up that used the Ship and Baker over the water.</p>
               <p>Did you think the man was falsely accused? - I did not know what to think; I should think, if he had done any thing he would not stay to stoop, but run away.</p>
               <p>How came you not to go to the Counter, and say you saw him stoop and pick up something, if you thought him innocent? - I did not want to trouble myself about it.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A dyer.</p>
               <p>Where do you work now? - No where now; I worked journeyman with one Mr. White in Ratcliff-highway last week.</p>
               <p>Had the man that stooped a hat or not? - That I don't know.</p>
               <p>To ANDREE. Look at the prisoner; is this the man that was carried to the Counter upon whom the things were found? - It is.</p>
               <p>Suppose you had not been able to take him at that time, and had not found the things upon him, should you know him to be the same man you had the struggle with in the house? - No; but he was never out of my sight till he was taken.</p>
               <p>JURY. You are sure the prisoner is the man you pursued from the house? - I am.</p>

I said, yes; the Black took one out of his pocket, and the woman one out of her pocket; I asked the price of them, and he said seven guineas; I told him he asked too much for the watch es, and I believed he did not come honestly by them; he said, that was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177704090027"/> no matter, I should have them worth my money; I should have them for two guineas; the woman said, if I had them for two guineas, I should give her a few shillings for her trouble; I told the prisoner I had no money about me, I would go and fetch the money; he said, very well; instead of going for the money I went to Litchfield-street and fetched an officer, who took the prisoners with the watches upon them.</p>

               <p>I am a plumber and glazier: in the evening of the 6th of March, passing by Mr. Harrap's house, I saw a person jump out of the one pair of stairs window into the street and fell down; he was near a minute before he recovered again; I knocked at the door and was informed they had lost a watch; I pursued the man and called stop thief; I lost sight of him on the twinkling of an eye; I got sight of him again, he ran up a court that was no thoroughfare; I took him at the top of the court stooping down against the wall as if he was easing himself: I am certain the prisoner is the person that jumped out of the window.</p>

               <p>Mr. Laycock sent for me and said, he was informed that his corn was stole by Mad Tom, which is a name the prisoner goes by, and desired me to sit up and watch him; I did; and about half after nine o'clock he came and looked into the place where I was for about four minutes; he went and took the key and went up into the granary and came down with a sack on his back; and as he went out my fellow servant laid hold of him and the sack; he let the sack down, and we pursued him about 200 yards and took him; there were oats in the sack.</p>

The prisoner was afterwards taken by some persons who were set to watch him; and was carried to the society's room where I saw him; he was afterwards carried before Sir

               <p>I never was in the shop; these goods that I have sold were given to me by this Roche; none of these goods were ever in my possession; it was not my room they were found in; my room was next to Roche's; when Mr. Solomon came to me I was in Roche's room; this man coming up into the room, Roche immediately decamped and left the boxes open, I then shut the boxes and put the keys in my pocket; then Roche advised me to decamp as soon as possible likewise; but I knowing myself to be innocent did not care to stir; and knowing Roche to be the thief, I gave all the instructions I could for Roche to be taken: I followed all the instructions of Roche; it was he that directed me to these places, and told me to give that direction; I came over to England with Roche because he owed me some money; I did just what Roche bid me; I had not been in England above a week; I had no acquaintance here at all; I did not know what Roche did, nor how he came by the goods, nor any thing about it; but all these files and things that were found were in Roche's box, and were Roche's property; when I found that key that was found between my shirt and skin, I knew what sort of key it might be, and was afraid of some consequences upon the occasion, and that caused me to secrete it; I have no one to appear for me but a gentleman that is gone out of town.</p>

               <p>I am a carpenter: when I went to the Bell to see after Baker, my wife came to me with the key in her hand and said, she was afraid to stay in the house for fear of her life, or that they would come and take the things away; I went home and found Baker tying up the bed things; the bed was gone; there was a man at the door; I laid hold of both of them; I called out for help, but in the struggle they both got from me.</p>

               <p>I have known the prosecutor three or four years; we were drinking together at the Bell almost all that day; he went away in the evening; as there was some reckoning to pay, I enquired where he lived and went to his house to enquire for him; I sat down with her by the fire and two men came in; I heard a bustle in the room; she said, she believed it was thieves; I got up to see who it was and tumbled over some cloaths; she called to go for her husband; I had not been long gone before I heard Hudson had lost his bed; he came to me and said, he believed I was concerned in it; his wife and he lived very unhappy; he came to me and asked me to help him to move a large chest of things, for he was afraid his wife would break it open and carry his tools and things away; his wife and he quarrelled and she was sent to Bridewell; he took up another man first, and charged him with the robbery.</p>
               <p>PROSECUTOR. She was not sent to Bridewell through me: I was at work at the Bell; she said I should not work there, and came and broke the windows, and was sent to Bridewell; for that I paid for the mending the windows and to get her out of Bridewell.</p>
               <p>What did you want him to help remove your chest for? - For fear I should lose my things; it was my chest of cloaths.</p>
