               <p>John Thomas. About 9 at Night, the Prisoners came to my Master's House, and going into the back Yard; they call'd for a Tankard of Beer. It being, as I thought, too cold to sit in the Yard, I ask'd them, If they would not go into a Room? But they said, No; and so I carry'd a Silver Tankard to them in the Yard, and was going to fill a Pint for another Customer ; but was not got down more than three or four of the Cellar Stairs, when I heard a Noise in the Passage, upon which I step'd up again, and found the Prisoner Cave there; he was going out, but had stumbled in the Dark against some Tobacco-Boxes which were in the Passage. I stopp'd him for the Reckoning, as thinking he was going off without paying. He said , he had not paid, but his Friend was behind. My fellow Servant,

            , call'd to me, and said, May be he has got the Tankard ! Upon which, I ask'd Cave, What he had got under his Coat? He said, Nothing; but feeling about him, I found the Tankard, and call'd my Master to take care of him, while I went to secure the other Prisoner, Turner, who was endeavouring to get away backwards, for we have a back Door into Fetter-Lane, but it happen'd to be fast; and so I seiz'd him, and brought him to my Master, who ask'd him, why he went to run away? And he said, he was afraid of Trouble; but that he had no Acquaintance with Cave, any farther than that he had seen him once before, at Reading-Fair, and met him again accidentally, and so came to drink with him.</p>
               <p>Cave. I went to the Cellar-Head , to deliver the Tankard safe to the Man that brought it to us ; and desir'd him to give me Change for the Reckoning.</p>
               <p>J. Thomas. He was got two Yards beyond the Cellar-Head, and instead of offering to deliver the Tankard, he deny'd that he had it when I charged him with it.</p>
               <p>Turner. I had seen Cave once at Reading-Fair,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173310100003"/> and meeting him again by Temple-Bar, we went to drink together, and the Tankard being empty, he said he'd take care and deliver it to the Man we had it from.

The Prisoner said, that when she first came to the Pond she was taken with Labour-Pains, and was taken with such a Fit that she lost her Senses, and if she had not held by the Rail, she must have fallen into the Pond herself; at which Time, she said, the Child dropt from her. It fell down a Slope two Foot deep, and might be killed by the Fall. She told me, her Husband died in Kent 6 Weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Coming by the Pond, very sick and weak, I was taken with a Fit, and took hold of the Post, and the Child dropt from me. I was going to my Friends in Ireland, and did not expect to be brought to Bed till a Fortnight after Michaelmas. My Husband died in Harvest-time at Kings-Down in Kent, where he was buried.</p>

No? says she, but I know you; won't you make me drink? No, I can't stay now, says I, for I am going over the Water, and besides, I have no Half-pence. But I know better, says she, for you have got two Pence in your Hand to pay the Boat-man; and with that she took hold of my Coat, and I gave her the 2 Pence to get rid of her, not thinking of my Lace, which was in my Coat-pocket, and so we parted; but when I came to the Water-side I miss'd the Lace, and enquired of the Watermen if they had not seen such a Woman about the Wharf? I happened to find a Woman something like her the same Night, and took her up; but when I came to see her next Morning, I found she was the wrong Person, and so I discharged her. Upon farther Enquiry, I heard of one of the Prisoner's Comrades, Sarah Whittle +, who had pawned the Lace. I took her up, and she was committed to New Prison, and next Day I took the Prisoner and carried her before the Justices in the Tower, where she said, that I had lain with her, and owned that she took the Lace out of my Pocket, because, as she said, she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173310100006"/> was not well paid for her Trouble, and therefore would pay herself.</p>

I got it of a Chap who promised me 3 Pence to lye with me; but afterwards, having no Money, he gave me this Lace: But nobody buy_ing it, she said to Sarah Whittle, If you'll pawn it for me, I'll satisfy you; so Whittle pawn'd it to Ann Garner for 16s. and fetch'd it out next Day, and then I went with Whittle to Mr. Smith's at the Cheese and Pump in Rag-Fair; and says I, Will you lend Sarah Whittle a Guinea upon this Lace? No, says he, I'll lend her nothing upon her own Ac_count,if she was going to Tyburn; but I'll lend 20s.upon your account; and so he did. But the Day after this, the Lace was blown about and the Prosecutor came to me, and I told him all that I knew of the Matter.</p>

Mrs. Banks told him she had no Watch, and soon after I saw him take a Gold Watch out of the Coach, and then turning his Horse, he said, your Servant Ladies; and shaking his Head and Pistol at me, as he went off, he swore if I turn'd back he'd shoot me dead.</p>

He turn'd again towards Piccadilly; I follow'd him thro' May-Fair, by the Course of the People, but before I came to Charing-Cross, I lost him, and the People were at a Stand, and did not know which way he was gone. I enquired of several, if they had seen a Man without a Hat, on a Bay Horse, and in the Hay-Market, I heard, he had left his Horse, and taken Coach, and one

            , who belong'd to the Reading Coach, knew the Man. Clark and I went to the Bolt and Tun-Inn, in Fleet-Street, where the Reading Coach put up, and there we found Bunch. Says Clark to Bunch, The Man you saw riding without a Hat, has robb'd a Coach, and you said, you knew where he liv'd ? Yes, very well, says Bunch, I have known him several Years - And do you think you can take him? - Yes. So we went together to Temple-Bar, and then, they said, they'd proceed no farther, except I was absent, for they were afraid he would know me, and they told me, they'd give me notice when to come again. So I went home; they sent me word, the same Night, that they had seen him, and desired me to come down to Temple -Bar. I acquainted my Master with it, and he, and a Friend of his went with me to an Alehouse in the Butcher-Row. We sent to Clark and Bunch, and Clark came, and said, they had decoy'd him into a Brandy-Shop. I went back with Clark, and we brought the Prisoner to my Master. The Prisoner fell on his Knees, and begg'd my Master to have Mercy on him, and said, he was the Man who robb'd the Coach. My Master ask'd him, where the Things were? He said, At home, and he'd fetch 'em. My Master sent us with him: Clark and Bunch went in with him, and I waited at the Door. In a little Time they came down, and we all went to my Master. The Prisoner pull'd out the Gold Watch, the Snuff Box, and 5 s. 6 d. in Money, and laid them on the Table. He fell on his Knees again, and begg'd Pardon, and Bunch and Clark desir'd Pardon for him too. My Master said, he could not do that, for if he did, he should be liable to be prosecuted himself. Then we went in a Coach, to a Tavern by Golden-Square, where my Master left us, and return'd with Justice Lambert, who order'd the Prisoner to be Hand-cuffed. The Prisoner fell in a great Agony, like one distracted, and stampt, and swore, that if he had a Pistol he'd shoot himself, and that he was sorry he had not brought one.</p>

I bid Orson go home, and told him, I'd send him Word as soon as we wanted him: He went away. Bunch and I waited about the Prisoner's Door for his coming home. It was near two Hours before he came, and then he went in, stay'd about a Quarter of an Hour, and came out again, and went towards the Temple. We follow'd at a little Distance, and he return'd in 5 or 6 Minutes. Then I went into the Shop, and cheapen'd some Herrings; and after some Talk about 'em, I ask'd him how he came to lose his Hat? For God's Sake, says he, hold your Tongue, or I am a dead Man I told him, he must go with me, and so we and Bunch went to a Brandy-Shop, where we had nine penn'orth of Punch. I ask'd the Prisoner, what was become of the Gold watch, Snuff-box, and 2 Purses, that he took from the two Ladies? He said, he took but one Purse, which was a Red one, with 5 s. 6 d. or 6 s. he could not tell which, and he had that and the Watch and Snuff-Box at home, and would go and fetch them. While we were there, the Porter, whom I had sent to Orson, came back, and told us, the Gentleman was come to an Alehouse in the Butcher-Row; we all went thither. The Prisoner fell on his Knees, and ask'd the Gentleman's Pardon. Bunch, and I, and Orson went thence, with the Prisoner, to his House. He went up two pair of Stairs, brought down the Watch, Box, and Purse, carry'd them to the Alehouse, and laid them, and 5 s. 6 d. on the Table - I know him to be the Man I had seen riding without his Hat.</p>

Coming towards the Town, in the Reading Coach (which sometimes I drive) I saw the Prisoner come riding by, betwixt Kensington and Knightsbridge, I pop'd my Head out of the Coach, and said, How do you do, Master? For I knew him when he was 'Prentice. How do you do? How do you do? says he, and rid along. At Porter-Street End, in Piccadilly, I saw him come shooting out without a Hat, and twenty People after him, crying, Highwayman! I stopt at the White-Bear, in Piccadilly, and then went to the Bolt and Tun, in Fleet-Street, where, as soon as I had taken my Horses off, Orson and Clark came to me, and ask'd me to shew them the House. I went with them, we took the Prisoner, and carry'd him to the Gentleman. He confess'd the Fact, return'd the Watch, Snuff-box, Purse, and 5 s. 6 d. and fell on his Knees and begg'd Pardon.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This was my first Fact, and the greatest Necessity drove me to it. I owed to much Money, that I was almost distracted. I had not the right Use of my Senses, and was about to shoot myself; but, at last, I thought it was better to take this unfortunate Way, which I find, too late, instead of relieving me from my former Misfortunes, has plunged me into greater.

            </rs>.</p>
               <p>1st King's Council. The Prisoner sands indicted for forging and publishing, knowing it to be forged, a certain Writing, or promissory Note, for no less a Sum than 4000 l. in the Names of Ann Shelly, the Mother, and Ann Shelly, the Daughter. It may be proper to inform the Jury, that an Action was brought by the Prisoner, (who was their Plaintiff) for this Note. The Trial was at Guild-Hall. A Defence was made, Council were heard, and Witnesses examin'd; but on the Prisoner's giving it up, there was no Verdict, but only a Nonsuit. And there being Cause to suspect that the Note was forged, the Court order'd the Prisoner to be committed to Newgate, bound the Defendants to prosecute, and Mr. Billingsly, to whose Care the Note was deliver'd, to produce it here. If the Facts appear in this Court, as they did in that, I believe the Jury will have no Difficulty to find the Prisoner guilty; but as the Statute has made the Offence he stands charged with, Capital, I shall not attempt to aggravate it.</p>
               <p>If my Instructions are right, the Prisoner carry'd on the Trade of a Weaver, in Spittle-Fields, tho' it seems he did not so much follow that, as the Business of a Fortune-Hunter. He did not affect to be over-nice in his Choice, Young or Old was much at one with him, if the Lady had but Money. He kept a Gentlewoman in his House, who was sometimes taken for his Wife, sometimes pass'd for his Niece, and sometimes for his House-keeper only; and accordingly, she wet by several Names, Mrs. Bourk, Mrs. Dugdale, or Mrs. Puget. This Wife, or Niece, or Maid, or what you please to call her, was one who was very well qualify'd to start Game for him, for she was a Woman of Address and Art : And hearing that Mrs. Shelly, a Widow Gentlewoman, and her Daughter, who lived at Lawton in Essex, were considerable Fortunes, she went down thither, took a House in the Neighbourhood, and in a little time became not only acquainted, but very intimate, with them both. Having thus far succeeded, the next thing was to bring her Cousin (as she called the Prisoner) acquainted with them too. A Scheme was soon laid, pursuant to which he goes down to inform her, that a great Estate was fallen to her, and that she ought to empower some Person to get it in. He carry'd a Power with him, but this must be Witness'd by two Persons of Credit, and who so proper as her new Acquaintance Mrs. Shelly and her Daughter? and they accordingly are sent for, to sign their Names as Witnesses. At this Interview, the Prisoner fell passionately in Love with the - Mother - or Daughter - he hardly knew which, for some time, though at last, I think, he made Choice of the young Lady. Frequent Visits were paid, and received, till Mrs. Shelly and her Daughter discover'd, his Intention, and then they forbid him and his Cousin to come there any more. The Prisoner, however, comforted himself with this, that if he could not have the Daughter, he would have her Fortune. When he had got their Names sign'd to the Paper I just now mentioned, it was no difficult Matter to add a promissory Note for 4000 l. You know the Names of Witnesses to a Writing, are sign'd on the left Side, near the Margin, under the Words Seal'd and Deliver'd. Now it is but opening the Sheet thus - and you have the whole Breadth of one half Sheet, and the Margin of the other, to write what you please to the Names:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173310100010"/> That the Prisoner took this Method, appears to me very plain; we have his Note in Court. In all Modern Paper there is some Mark in the Middle of the half Sheet, by which, the Maker, and the Time when made, is known; you will see by the Note itself, that this Mark is not in the Middle of it, but much farther from that End, where the Names are signed, than from the other; whence it's evident, that the Length of the Note is considerably more than the Breadth; of the half Sheet, which I need not tell you, is very unusual; you will see, that the upper Part of this Note, near the End where the Names are sign'd, is not cut strait, but indented, and you will judge whether this was not done to prevent any part of the Writing above, from appearing on the Face of the Note.</p>
               <p>Our Indictment is laid two Ways, for forging this Note, and for publishing it, knowing it to be Forged, False, and Counterfeit. If Names are sign'd for any Purpose, and a Man shall cut the Names from the first Purpose, and then write a promissory Note to those Names, with an Intention to defraud any Person, this I take to be Forgery within the Statute, as much, as if he had Counterfeited the Names. However, as 'tis a Moot Point, I shall rather insist upon his publishing the Note, knowing it to be forged. I believe it will be admitted, that the Note was all of his Writing, except the Names of Mrs. Shelly and her Daughter.</p>
               <p>2d King's Council. And if 'tis admitted that the Names were sign'd by Mrs. Shelly and her Daughter, yet if this was done on another Occasion, and the Names were afterwards cut off, and a promissory Note writ over them, I believe, his Lordship will tell you, that this is Forgery - You may observe one thing more on the Face of the Note: By its being indented and rounded off, on this Side, there was a Difficulty to bring in the Words, As Witness our Hands, for they were forced to put, As Witness, lower than our Hands; so that you would naturally read it, Our Hands as Witness. Then there is something so peculiar to the Prisoner, in the Writing and Spelling, that it would not be easy to find any Body else to Write and Spell like it.</p>
               <p>Court. Before you proceed to Evidence let the Act be read.</p>

               <p>Mr. Billingsly. I was Associate to my Lord Raymond. On the 19th of June last there was a Tryal at Guildhall, in which the Prisoner was Plaintiff, and Ann Shelly Defendant. On the Issue, this Note was produced by the Prisoner, and read in Evidence; he stood at the Elbow of his Attorney and instructed him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. We admit the Body of the Note to be the Prisoner's writing.</p>
               <p>King's Council. But we should have it from the Prisoner himself - or we'll prove it; shew him the Note.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Body of this Note is my Hand, and signing is theirs.</p>
               <p>King's Council. We admit the Names Ann Shelly, and Ann Shelly, to be writ by Mrs. Shelly and her Daughter.</p>

            , Stationer. I was desired to inspect the Note. I presently saw it was longer than a half Sheet. We call this Kind of Paper a Fool's-Cap, because it was formerly marked with a Fool's -Cap in the Middle of the half Sheet, but now it has different Marks, according to the Province it's made in. This the Note is writ on has the Arms of Amsterdam. It never has more than 9 Wires on a Side, but this Note has II Wires, and the Arms is not in the Middle; whence I am certain that this is 2 luches longer than the Breadth of a half Sheet, and, I believe, it was cut from some Writing which these Persons were Witnesses to; and the rather because it is indented, which looks as if it was done to keep clear of some Writing that was over it - and here's a piece of Paper pasted on to make it appear even. Besides, I never saw, in the Course of my Trade, a Note of so extravagant a Length.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you ever see a Letter of Attorney with Witness our Hands, at Bottom, instead of Signed, sealed, and delivered?</p>
               <p>Mr. Ridge. I did not say it was a Letter of Attorney, or any thing else in particular, but that the indenting looked as if it was done to avoid some Writing that might have been over it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Could it not have been cut from the back of a Letter ?</p>
               <p>King's Council. The Question is not from what Paper the Names were cut, but if they were not cut from sme Paper, to which they had been affixed; and if you cut can from a Letter, 'tis all one to us.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. We have so many Witnesses to give an Account how we came by the Note, that all you can bring against us will do you but little Service.</p>
               <p>King's Council. Then they were imported since the Trial at Guildhall - 'Tis pity you did not bring all your Forces in an Action for 4000 l. - Call Martha Todd - Do you remember any thing of Mrs. Shelly 's paying the Prisoner any Money?</p>

               <p>R. Jenning. Yes; but not in any Disgust.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had some Acquaintance in the Town where Mrs. Shelly lived, and with her among the rest. I was about to be married to a young Lady at Highgate, which Mrs. Shelly hearing of, came to my House, and after some Discourse she told me, her Daughter was not every One's Money, and if I made Suit to her, I should be very well received. I went that Night, and was kindly entertained, from which Time we grew very intimate; and Mrs. Shelly, the Mother, had so good an Opinion of me, that she told me I should take my Choice, either to be her Son or her Husband. I constantly visited them, at least three times a Week, and they came as often to my House; and if any Time I happened to neglect going at the usual Time, the Mother would come and tell me her Daughter was Sick. When I continued this Course for about a Year and a half, the Neighbours told me that Mrs. Shelly was a cunning old Woman, and bid me take Care of what I did, and so I press'd her to bring Things to a Conclusion. Atlast it was agreed that I should marry her Daughter, and thereupon she gave me this Note for 4000 l. as a Security for her Daughter's Fortune. I was so far from imposing upon her, that I told her when I first came to London I had but 4 s. 6 d. in the World, and what I had got since was all by my own Industry; and so far from making a Secret of this Note, which I should have done if I had forged it, that I shewed it to Mrs. Todd as soon as I had it, and told all the Neighbours that I had got Miss Shelly's Fortune, and I have said the same before Company in Mrs. Shelly's hearing, and she has never contradicted it. This was in December, 1731, and in February following Mrs. Shelly told me, as I was a Tradesman, if I should meet with any Misfortunes her Daughter would have nothing to trust to, therefore she would agree to pay me 1000 l. in part of the 4000 l. before it became due, in order to purchase a Security of 50 l. a Year for her Daughter's Jointure; and accordingly, an Agreement was put into Writing, and signed by her and two Witnesses for that Purpose. The Marriage was to be on Easter Sunday following, and I was to have the 1000 l. next Day. Against the Time appointed the Wedding Cloaths were bought, and I went down with a Ring and a Licence; when Mrs. Shelly told me her Daughter was not to be seen; I was surprized at this, and desired to know the Meaning of it. Mrs. Shelly said it was much against her Will; she was sorry for it, but could not help it, for she fear'd there was a Snake in the Grass, and that her Daughter was either married, or very near being married to her Carter,

He used to call her Mother, and I heard him tell her, that he began the World very hard, and brought but 4s. 6d. to Town with him, and that what he got since was by his own Industry.</p>

The Prisoner wanted to see Miss, and the old Gentlewoman said, she was not at home, and was afraid there was a Snake in the Grass; and that she was married, or going to be married, to her Man Philip Gowen, and desired me to go with him and see for Gowen at the Church, and to tell him that her Daughter's Fortune was all in the Prisoner's Hands; and that if he did not desist, the Prisoner would lay him in Goal.

            's House, about half a Mile off. What do you want? says the Farmer. Why, says the Prisoner, I understand that Gowen is about to marry Miss Shelly, and if he don't desist I'll throw him in Chelmsford Goal, and there he shall lye and rot. You put him in Goal ! says the Farmer, by what Authority? Why, says the Prisoner, I have a Note for all her Fortune and more, under her and her Mother's Hands. Ay! says the Farmer, for how much must that be? For 4000 l. says the Prisoner. This was in March or April, 1732.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. And I offered Gowen to produce the Note to their own Attorney.</p>
               <p>Yates. And when we returned to Mrs. Shelly, we told her what we had done, and she seemed very well pleased.</p>
               <p>King's Council. Did you tell her, that the Prisoner told Gowen he had a Note of 4000 l.</p>
               <p>Yates. No; we only said in general Terms, that we had obey'd her Commands.</p>
               <p>King's Council. Mrs. Shelly might send such a Message to frighten Gowen from marrying her Daughter, tho' she had never given any such Note to the Prisoner - But did you give this Account at Guildhall?</p>

               <p>Yates. Partly I did.</p>
               <p>King's Council. How far did you go - Have a Care - for we remember it - we have it in writing.</p>
               <p>Yates. I gave an Account as far as our going to Church to find Gowen, and then the Court said, there was no Occasion for my going any farther, and I might stand down.</p>
               <p>King's Council. How so? Were not the Plaintiff's Council admitted to ask Questions?</p>
               <p>Yates. I don't know; the Court silenc'd me.</p>
               <p>King's Council. Who do you mean by the Court?</p>
               <p>Yates. It must be the Judge or the Council.</p>

               <p>King's Council. So the Council against you bid you go down, and his own Council agreed to it - Where do you live? - What Countryman are you?</p>
               <p>Yates. I live in Spittle-fields - I am a Brewer - and an Irishman, but I can give a good Account of myself.</p>

            . I am a Merchant in Addle-street, Aldermanbury. In March, 1731-2, I went down with Mr. Risden to his House in Essex. The Prisoner hearing of our intended Journey, desired us to dine with him, at Mrs. Shelly's. We accordingly called, and were received in the Yard by the Prisoner and Yates. They put up our Horses, and then the Prisoner went with us to the Door, where we met Mrs. Shelly. The Prisoner introduced us to her as his Mother. Going into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173310100015"/> the House, the Daughter appear'd and he told us, she was his Wife.</p>
               <p>King's Council. But that was more than Fact.</p>
               <p>Mr. French. By the Freedom I saw between them, I thought they were marry'd; but at Dinner, some Body ask'd When the Wedding was to be? And it was answer'd, On Easter-Sunday next. Indeed by the Prisoner's Behaviour, I could not tell which he had most Desire to, the Mother or the Daughter.</p>
               <p>King's Council. Was you at the Trial at Guild-Hall?</p>
               <p>French. I was not called.</p>

               <p>King's Council. I know not why they call these Witnesses to prove an Intimacy, when we admitted all this an Hour ago. This is the way to make a Cause eternal.</p>
               <p>Mr. Risden. I am a Mercer in St. Martin's. I din'd at Mrs. Shelly's - I have a Country-house about seven Miles farther -</p>

               <p>Risden. No.</p>

               <p>Risden. No.</p>
               <p>- Todd. I am a Farmer at Lowton. As for hearing any Discourse about Matrimony, on the 3d of May was a 12 Month, there was a common Talk about the Parish, and my Wife was uneasy when she heard that Mrs. Shelly had sign'd Writings, and so I went to Mrs. Shelly in the Cow-house, and said, i had heard she had sign'd Writings, and she desir'd me to take no Notice, for she knew what she had sign'd, because she had read it before she set her Hand to it; but for my part, I never saw Scrip nor Scrawl.</p>
               <p>King's Council. Did she say any express Words of a Note of 4000 l. or that her Daughter had sign'd any Writings?</p>
               <p>Todd. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dicks. Last Easter was a 12 Month, I went down with the Prisoner to claim his Wife, Mrs. Shelly gave us a Dram; the Prisoner ask'd her if Mrs. Ann was within? She said there had been some Difference betwixt her and her Daughter, who kept out of the Way, which she herself was not the Occasion of; but was very sorry that the Prisoner had been at the Trouble and Charge of coming down so often, and would make him any Satisfaction, if he'd deliver up the Writings. Then he produced a Note of some Agreement of 50 l. a Year, to be settled on Mrs. Ann, and another Note of 4000 l. and the Wedding-ring, and the Licence; she desir'd him to be easy, and said, she did not care if she gave him 4 or 500 l. if he'd deliver up her Note.</p>
               <p>No, says he, I won't take 1000 l. but I'll put the Note in Force.</p>
               <p>King's Council. Did you read those Papers?</p>
               <p>Dicks. I did not take much Notice of them - he laid three on the Table.</p>
               <p>King's Council. What shape was the Note?</p>
               <p>Dicks. A long slip of Paper; I think it was sign'd by both Ann Shelly's - I don't remember the Substance of the third Paper.</p>
               <p>King's Council. Where were you at the last Trial?</p>
               <p>Dicks. In Leicestershire - At Wickston-Two-Steeples, two Miles from Leicester - I have a small Estate there, of about 30 l. a Year.</p>

            . At the End of April, 1732, I went to the Prisoner's House, in Booth-Street, Spittle-Fields, and found Mrs. Shelly, the Mother, with him. He was walking about very much dissatisfied, and said he had been ill us'd, and she talked very low, and assur'd him it was none of her Contrivance. There was a Gentleman, one Mr. O Brian, and he read a Paper of 50 l. to be settled on Ann Shelly ; and something of a Note of 4000 l. to be paid sometime afterwards by Mrs. Shelly, and Mrs. Shelly said, she had rather give him 1000 l. than have any farther Dispute with him about the Note.</p>
               <p>King's Council. Did you read the Note yourself?</p>
               <p>Bews. No; I can't read.</p>
               <p>Court. It appears plain, that Mrs. Shelly never deny'd the Note, that she was highly concern'd her Daughter had behav'd in such a Manner, and that she was willing to make Satisfaction. The Evidence against the Prisoner,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173310100016"/> is only Circumstantial. There's some Suspicion on the Face of the Note; but that is for from being sufficient to convict a Man of Forgery - I don't say the Note is Recoverable for there being no Value receiv'd, perhaps a Court of Equity, may not allow it. The Council open'd that Mrs. Shelly and her Daughter witnessed a Letter of Attorney; but not one Person has been called to prove it -</p>

And he answer'd as before.</p>
               <p>Court. He might say so, perhaps he was not willing to disclose their Affairs to her.</p>
               <p>Martha Todd. I was at Mrs. Shelly's, when Yates said to the Prisoner, If I was courting a Lady, I'd bring down a Licence, and say, Madam, I must and will have you; and Mrs. Shelly said, I deny that with both my Hands.</p>

            . I liv'd at Mrs. Shelly's, before the Prisoner first came - He lit of them at Midsummer-Fair, and so came to see them, on the Foot of Courtship to Mrs. Ann ; but she made a Rejectment, and said she would never have any thing to say to him that way; and to my Knowledge, she continu'd in the same Mind all along, from his first coming to his last.</p>
               <p>Court. Had she any Lover?</p>
               <p>Gowers. Yes; Mr. Sexton ; the Prisoner reduced him to her, as he told me next Day, and said, he should have got me to a' spoke a good Word for him - and sometime afterwards, he said, I see Miss won't accept of Mr. Sexton, no more than of me.</p>
               <p>King's Council. They have call'd Witnesses we were not aware of - We were prepar'd for the Witnesses he brought to Guild-Hall ; but now he has got quite a new Set, except Yates - and the Agreement is a Piece of Evidence that they did not produce before.</p>
               <p>Court. That might be their Ignorance.</p>
               <p>King's Council. As we are depriv'd of the Evidence of Mrs. Shelly and her Daughter, 'tis impossible to prove the Forgery if Circumstances are not allow'd as Evidence, and I think the Circumstances appear very strong on the Face of the Note - Yates is the only Person we are prepar'd for, and therefore we can only attack his Character. The rest, as we know nothing of them, we must leave to the Jury. Mr. Powel, What do you know of Yates ? - Nay, don't shake your Head, but speak.</p>

When we came to the Gate, at the Bottom of the Hill, by the Meadow Side, they nhors'd me. Butler put his Hand in my Pocket, and took out my Purse with my Money in it, and then unbuttoning my Breeches, shook the Wristband, and ask'd me, if I had any more ? I said, No; but searching farther, he found 2 or 3 penn'orth of Ha'pence, upon which he gave me a great Slap o' the Face, for saying I had no more. Weedon then led me about 60 Poles, sheer a-cross the Meadow, to the farther Side, behind a Hedge. There Weedon and Butler, who, I think, had Pistols, took off my Great-Coat, and laid it for me to sit on. I thank'd them, and then they ty'd my Hands and left me, but soon turn'd back, and Cox felt of my Hat, and saying it would fit him took it from me, and ty'd my Legs too. Then one of them took away my great Coat, and telling me it I shirr'd before they brought me more Company, they'd shoot me thro' the Head; they went away again. However, I made shift to slip my Hands loose, and went to the Crane at Edgworth, where I told Mr. Russel my Case ; some Justices were sitting at that House, and they sent in search of the Prisoners, who were found at the White-Lion, in Edgworth. They were brought to me in about an Hour and a Half. I knew Cox at the first Sight, but was not so positive to the other two immediately, tho' upon Recollection, I was positive to them likewise, the same Night. Weedon was not then in his Regimental Clothes, and Cox, I remember, in particular, when they had ty'd my Hands, wanted to cut the String to take my Clothes off, and leave me naked.</p>
               <p>Weedon. What Clothes had I on ?</p>

I was so daunted that he could not persuade me to change any more that Night, but he past off several himself in our Way to his Lodging, which was in <placeName id="t17331010-24-crimeloc111">Grub-street</placeName>

When we came thither, he bid me call upon him next Morning, and ask for him by the Name of Brown; so we parted, and I went to my own Lodging, which was at my Aunt's in Gardener's-lane, Westminster. Next Morning I call'd at Mr. Brown's Lodging; his Landlady directed me to go up one Pair of Stairs; I did so, and knock'd two or three times, but having no Answer, I went down again; then his Landlady call'd Mr. Brown, upon which he answer'd, and came down with the other Prisoner, who goes for his Wife. We drank two or three Quarters of Gin together, and then he bid me take a Walk in Moorfields, and come again in an Hour; which I did. We went together towards- Piccadilly, and past off several Six- pences that Night; so I used to go to him every Morning, and we used to go out in the Dusk of the Evening. But as I often staid very late, my Aunt as often checked me for keeping such ill Hours. I told the Prisoners of this, and so it was agreed, that I should lye in the same Bed with him and her, which I did for some Time, and I believe their Landlady knew nothing of it, but thought I still came in the Morning. At last I began to be ashamed of lying with a Man and a Woman at the same Time, and then they got me a Blanket, and I laid by their Bedside, and they were very kind to me. Now I'll give an Account of what I have seen them do every Morning that I was with them, except Sundays; he sat down on one side of the Fire, and she on the other; they put a Fire-shovel on the Fire, with some Metal in it like Pewter, and melted it; then he took the Shovel and poured the Metal into something, but I can't say what, for they would not let me see it. Then they put the Shovel on the Fire again; he took out a Six-pence, and threw it into an old Hat behind him, and so they did till they had used all the Metal in the Shovel, and made 20 Sixpences, or more, and I have taken them warm out of the Hat. Then both he and she took a Knife and scraped the Edges round, and nicked the Edges of some of them with a File, and afterwards bent them.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he take out but one Six-pence at a time?</p>
               <p>Macnelly. But one; I asked him to let me see the Thing they made them in, but he would never let me, tho' he promised me that in time he'd let me into the Secret, and learn me how to make them. There was a Table in the Room with Chalk or Whiting, and a flannel Waistcoat, and they set me to rub them upon the Table with the Whiting and Flannel, as hard as I could, which I did. We staid 2 Months in Grub-street, and then removed to Morris's-court in Peter's-street, Soho, where we followed the same Trade; and we always took Care to lock the Door within Side when we were at work.</p>
               <p>Berry. Did you ever know me to put off any bad Money ?</p>
               <p>Macnelly. Yes; many a Time. She had a false Pocket with a private Fob ; I have seen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173310100020"/> her put 15 or 16 bad Six-pences at a time in one Part, and when I brought her Change she has put that in the other Part.</p>

               <p>Macnelly. Brown and I were sent to the Gatehouse for passing this bad Money, and he told me several times there was no Danger, for it was bailable, and we should soon get our Liberty. At Night he was carried before Sir

The Prisoner knocked him down, and he fell with his Head upon the Pavement; he was help'd up; they went in; their Heads were dress'd; they drank to one another ; shook Hands; parted Friends, and the Deceased went home, and not imagining the Wound to be dangerous, neglected to send for a Surgeon till it was too late; his Skull was fractured, and it proved the Cause of his Death. <rs id="t17331010-25-verdict117" type="verdictDescription">

            . Crossing Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, about 12 at Night, I was set upon by 5 Men, 3 of whom, + Richardson , Grace and Smithson were convicted last Sessions. Grace collared me, and swore, Damn you, you Dog, deliver your Money; Richardson gave me a Blow on the Arm, and took my Hat and Wig, and struck me on the Head; two others rifled my Pockets; one took 5 d. and the other half a Guinea - One drew a Knife, and threatened to stab me. A Light coming by the Corner of the Fields, they let me go, and after I was got from them, I heard one of them say, God damn you, why did not you stab him, for he looked back, and he'll know us again - I went off towards Clare-market - I can't swear to the Prisoner's Face.</p>
