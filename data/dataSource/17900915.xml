The prisoner came to me for credit, and brought me this duplicate for a shirt, and a pair of sheets: I cannot tell the day or the month. (The things deposed to.) The duplicate is dated the 28th of November.</p>

               <p>JOHN SPILSBURY sworn.</p>
               <p>I serve in the shop of the prosecutors. On the 10th of July the prisoner came into our shop, and asked to look at some muslin handkerchiefs, as she had before: she came in alone: those handkerchiefs were all sold: I said I had some check muslin handkerchiefs, which I offered her, and if the lady did not approve of them, I would take them back again? she said, no; but I should shew her some lace; I shewed her a box of lace, No. 1, which were not good enough; she asked me the price of some in No. 2; I asked twenty-one pence; and she bid me eighteen shillings for twelve yards, and twenty-four shillings for twelve yards, at two shillings and four pence per yard; I told her we always asked one price; she said she wanted a mode; I turned round to get the mode, and pushed the box a little from me; and I observed when I returned with the mode she had arisen from her seat, and seemed very much agitated: I went about three yards for the mode: I left her sitting; when I returned she was standing by the same stool; she looked at the mode, and sat down; I looked at her very much, and in her lap I saw her pocket handkerchief, and underneath a square card, which I supposed to be the card of lace; she was trying to get it into her left hand pocket, and whether it was too large I cannot tell; but she put it into her right hand pocket; I then spoke to one of the young men to fetch down Mr. Strafford; he came down: I told him the prisoner and me could not agree, and that she wanted the lace a considerable deal less than what it cost; Mr. Strafford then spoke to the prisoner respecting the black mode; she bought four squares not quite a yard each; she then said she would leave the lace alone till another day; but wanted some black ribbon for the neck of the cloak: Mr. Strafford said to the prisoner, I believe our young man says, that through mistake you have taken a card of lace that belongs to us; she said, if I have it is more than I know; and putting her hand into her pocket, she pulled out a number of papers, and then afterwards took out her pocket handkerchief, and the card of lace was inside of it; I asked her to pull out her pocket handkerchief, and the card of lace would be found; she then ordered the card of lace to be measured over, and offered to pay any price we chose for the lace; after that a constable was sent for.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. I believe some money had passed between Mr. Strafford and her before he spoke to her about the lace? - Yes; she was not short of money.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect her desiring he would let his young man go home with her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I think that was before he charged her with the lace; for what purpose was the young man to go home with her? - She pleaded about her character, that if any one would go and make enquiry, they would have a good character of her.</p>
               <p>I would ask you, whether, before Mr. Strafford addressed her as you have described, she had not for some purpose desired that a young man should go home with her? - No, Sir, she had not.</p>
               <p>You are quite sure? - Yes.</p>
               <p>She had not told you where she lived before Mr. Strafford spoke to her? - She had not.</p>
               <p>She had paid all the money due for the things that were bargained for? - She had paid for the mode; the ribbon I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did you enquire whether she had told you the truth or not? - I do not know.</p>

               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - No more than serving her once before.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Strafford. Now relate what passed when you came down? - The young<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150007"/>man was shewing her some mode for a cloak; they disagreed about the price; soon after I came down she agreed to give me the price; I cut it off, and received the money; I then asked if she wanted any ribbon for the cloak? she said, she did; I brought the drawer, and shewed it to her; I stepped aside to ask Spilsbury if he was sure she took the lace; I immediately went to her, and said, I supposed she had put a card of lace in her pocket, it might be by mistake, and should be glad if she would feel if she had it; she was dressed in a very decent manner, and being an old woman, one could not suspect her; she seemed a good deal agitated; she said, no, she never did such a thing; I desired she would feel; and she brought out a pocket handkerchief wrapped round this card of lace; I then thought it proper to have her searched; I took her into a lower warehouse, and sent for the constable; he came and searched her; she dropped one piece of ribbon on the floor, from under her stays; the other the constable found in her pocket, with a pair of gentlemans gloves; I could not absolutely swear to the gloves; there was a paper of them kind of gloves laying on the counter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Had not she proposed to you to let her have some lace for a guinea, and to send a young man home to receive it? - No such thing.</p>
               <p>Did you know her before? - I knew her face.</p>
               <p>How many people serve in your shop? - About eight or nine.</p>

               <p>It is black silk lace; it is worth two shillings and four pence a yard; I searched the prisoner below stairs in the warehouse; I believe there is a cieling to it; I found there two pieces of ribbon in her pocket, and a pair of gloves; one roll is marked, the other is not: I do not swear to the ribbon.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I cheapened no black ribbon at all; I had my umbrella, and the mode; when Mr. Strafford asked me if I had not made a mistake, I immediately felt in my handkerchief, and there it was; I said, Sir, I have it, I beg you ten thousand pardons; the ribbon was my own, I brought it from home to give a little girl, upon my word and honor, if I was to die this minute, and the gloves were my own, I bought them at Mr. Stafford's in the course of the week, and brought them to change them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called seven witnesses, who all gave her a very good character.</p>

               <p>Mr. Recorder. Mr. Barrington, it is impossible for me to decide previous to your trial, what is your property; but when your prosecutor appears, every thing which has been taken from you, and which is not necessary to be identified on your trial, shall be restored to you.</p>

               <p>Mr. Townsend. My Lord, I am the prosecutor in this case. When the prisoner was apprehended, the money was sealed up which was taken from him, together with a snuff-box, and a metal watch, which were also found on him. This was done under the idea, that these articles might belong to somebody or other, who might afterwards claim them. They were intended to be advertised, but were not.</p>

            , Esq. sworn.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you lose your watch? - The first of September.</p>
               <p>Where? - At Enfield, in Enfield Marsh.</p>
               <p>On what occasion was you there? - On account of the races.</p>
               <p>At a race? - At a race.</p>
               <p>At what hour? - Upon my word, I believe it was near two o'clock; that is the time it is fixed for the horses to start.</p>
               <p>Was you on foot, or on horseback, or where was you? - I was on foot most of the time; I went on the ground in a phaeton.</p>
               <p>Did you alight out of that phaeton? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you walking about, or did you stand or move, or what? - I was but a small time at a stand, I was walking about chiefly.</p>
               <p>And at what time did you miss your watch, and where was you? - I did not miss my watch till I was spoken to by Mr. Blades.</p>
               <p>Upon Mr. Blades speaking to you, did you then miss your watch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>A gold watch? - A gold watch.</p>
               <p>A gold chain? - A gold chain</p>
               <p>A metal key? - A metal key.</p>
               <p>Did you miss it from your fob pocket? - No, Sir, from my waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Was it in your pocket? - Yes, the chain and all was put in.</p>
               <p>Do you wear your watch generally in that manner, or did you put it there for any particular purpose? - No, my Lord, I had a new pair of leather breeches on, and I was afraid the seals would dirt them.</p>
               <p>How long had you been on the turf before you missed your watch? - I had been on the ground an hour or an hour and a half.</p>
               <p>Had you any occasion to take notice whether you had your watch in your pocket at any time after you came on the ground? - I felt my watch in my pocket after I came on the ground.</p>
               <p>How long before you missed it? - I think it must have been a quarter of an hour before I missed it.</p>
               <p>Did you recover your watch again? - I recollect very well the watch was given to Lady Lake, and she took it home with her; and when we took Mr. Barrington before justice, I sent for the watch, and the watch was given to me by a servant.</p>
               <p>Have you the watch now? - The Constable has the watch.</p>

               <p>Have you any thing to say to the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, my Lord: the clerk of the course, whose name is Furnish, said somebody wanted to speak to me; I had a horse run there that day, and he won the first heat; I gave a short answer; he said it was something particular: a gentleman at that moment came up to me, and said, he wished to put me on my guard, that he had seen Mr. Barrington follow me about a considerable time, and that he seemed to have some design, and he asked me if I had taken notice of any person; I immediately said, has he a light coloured coat on? he said yes: I then felt for my watch, and found it was gone, for I recollected, after the first heat my horse had won, I was on the stand; I ran out of the stand as quick as I possibly could, and I went and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150013"/>laid hold of my horse by the bridle, and was leading him to the post, where the jockeys are weighed; it is necessary that a jockey should be weighed at a certain place; a great many people pushed round me; but one person in particular came between my horse and me, which I thought rather particular; he had a light coloured coat on.</p>
               <p>Have you any idea of the dress, figure, or the person of that man? - Yes, I had an idea of the dress, figure, and the person of the man the first time.</p>
               <p>What is that idea? - It was a person in a light coloured coat; but as the first push was not a very strong one, I did not notice him much; the person that pushed me fell back upon my looking; that was the person in the light coloured coat; then somebody, that I take to be the same person, as that I have sworn to be Mr. Barrington, came against my arm as I was leading my horse, with a more violent push, which I thought an exceeding rude thing, where a gentleman was leading his horse up, and I lost my temper, and asked him, with an oath, where he was coming.</p>
               <p>You think that was the same man? - I think it was.</p>
               <p>Whether it was the same man or no, he had a light coloured coat on? - To the best of my belief it was the prisoner Barrington.</p>
               <p>Cannot you describe a little more accurately how he came up the second time? - I was walking as I might be here, close by the horse's cheek, I was rather behind the horse's head, as it might be hold of the horse's head, so that there was but little room between me and the horse; I thought it was a rude thing for any one pushing against me; the man came up straight against my arm, rather behind me than before me; I looked round, and the person, whoever he was, fell back; and the colour of his coat, and his figure, was what appeared to me to be Mr. Barrington; the second time he pushed against me I looked very hard at him, and he looked with his eyes as if he did not know what he was looking at, as if he was looking at the scales; what made me take particular notice, was the blow being repeated on my arm, and my immediately turning round and looking at the person, and asking him, with an oath, where he was coming to, it struck me as if the person had a wild look with his eyes, and was looking for something, and did not know what.</p>
               <p>Is that the whole? - Yes, that is the whole.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner, Barrington, that day? - I took him.</p>
               <p>Was he then taken? - No.</p>
               <p>Then afterwards, in consequence of what Mr. Blades said, and what you recollected, you went after him? - Mr. Blades said, I will see for him, and if I can see him, I will let you know; then one of the witnesses, Mr. Kempton, came up to me, and people asked me questions if I had had my pocket picked, and I said no, it was a false report; I said so to keep the matter quiet; however, Mr. Kempton came to me, and asked me if I had lost my watch; I said in a low voice that I had; then, says he, I can shew you the man; he is gone to the starting post.</p>
               <p>Where did you find the prisoner? - I found him by the starting post; the horses started a quarter of a mile from the weighing post; this is about a quarter of a mile from the place where I was when Mr. Blades came to me; I went up on foot; the horses were all drawn up ready to start; I happened to get near to Mr. Blades; I did not know it till I heard his voice; Blades immediately said, there is Barrington, collar him; and I immediately said, that is the man that ran against me; the horses were drawn up, and ready to start; I was afraid to run across the course for fear of interrupting them; I waited till they were passed; I waited till Barrington's back was turned from me; he was walking towards the weighing post; as soon as his back was turned I ran up to him as fast as I could, and I collared him with both my hands, and I said, you rascal, you have robbed me.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not think any thing will turn on the conversation you had with him? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150014"/>Mr. Blades, who was standing by me, came up and laid hold of Mr. Barrington; and Mr. Kempton seeing what we were about, and he being a stoutes man than Mr. Blades, supplied Mr. Blades's place; and we conducted Mr. Barrington with one hand on his collar; and with the other hand I caught hold of his arm, because I suspected he might have the property about him, from his saying to a man (whom I supposed, by his appearance, was an acquaintance of his); he nodded with his head, and calling him by his Christian name, said,</p>
               <p>"Do you walk there." Mr. Kempton and me had him then by the collar.</p>
               <p>Where was that? - That was on my side; and the man did walk for about half a quarter of a mile, half way to the stand; and when he had got about half way, that man came up and said,</p>
               <p>"Sir, do not trouble yourself with that fellow, but let me take him;" and I said,</p>
               <p>"I heard what Mr. Barrington said to you;" and having some friends about us, I said</p>
               <p>"Do not let that fellow walk there any longer;" and one man whom I did not know, took and knocked this man on his back, out of the way; and I never saw him afterwards: when I got near the booth, I met my coachman, who was a very stout strong man; I let Barrington go; and I fancied the coachman suspected he had something in his hand; and he laid close hold of his fist, and the other hand by his collar; and in that way conducted him the rest of the way to the booth; I was walking before; I know no more of the business, only I saw him safe in the booth; and as he was going over the booth, there was a little man with a stick struck him over the head once or twice; I was rather in a disagreeable situation; I did not like to see a man beat, with both his hands confined; and I desired him to desist, and he did not; and I was obliged to tell him that if he did not, I would knock him down; and I thought I should have all parties against me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. You was dressed pretty much as you are now? - Pretty much; I had nearly the same clothes on.</p>
               <p>Does that include that your coat was in the same state it is now, buttoned? - The same as it is now.</p>
               <p>Please to front the jury a little more: the sensation that the man in the white coat occasioned to you at first, was that of a man pushing rudely against the proprietor of a horse that had won? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>No other sensation had been occasioned in your mind till Mr. Blades had spoke to you? - None whatever.</p>
               <p>From the period of weighing your jockey, till the time Barrington was secured by you, how much time had elapsed? - It must have been very near half an hour.</p>
               <p>In the course of what I have to say, I shall express great ignorance of horse raceing; I know nothing about it, therefore have the goodness to excuse it, if I should ask you any ignorant questions. I apprehend, the moment of the conclusion of the heat is a very anxious one? - Yes, Sir, it is.</p>
               <p>And those who have bets on the preceding heat, or have bets to make, naturally wish to see the horse on coming in? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Those that have large bets wish to see it the jockey has any make-weight? - I suppose so.</p>
               <p>Therefore the situation of any person who has a bet, is that of getting near the winning post? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The first sensation you felt, was, that it was a natural pressure? - I did not think it was natural.</p>
               <p>Not for a man to be near the winning horse? - Yes; but I should not have done so, to run against the proprietor of a horse that had won.</p>
               <p>I do not know whether you expect the manners of a drawing room on a race ground? - There is a kind of etiquette that is observed.</p>
               <p>There are decorums that are better observed, certainly; but an unpolished or ignorant man might run against the proprietor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150015"/>of a horse. You did not know the person of Mr. Barrington before? - No, Sir, I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>You told me that several people, after Blades had spoke to you, had come to you to know if it was true you had lost your watch? - Yes; I suppose there were four or five.</p>
               <p>Therefore the thing was not a profound secret? - It was not.</p>
               <p>There had got a rumour about the ground, that Mr. Townsend had lost his watch? - Yes, there had.</p>
               <p>Did you chance to know that Barrington had come to the course on horseback? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I will not trouble Mr. Townsend with any more questions.</p>
               <p>Court. What might be the depth of that waistcoat pocket? - Much the same as this; my waistcoats are all made alike.</p>
               <p>Was it the depth of your finger, three inches? - Yes, full the depth of my finger.</p>
               <p>Was there a flap to it? - No, just such a pocket as this: (a welted pocket.)</p>
               <p>The watch and chain were fairly covered? - Oh, certainly covered, because I thought something of that kind might happen at such a place.</p>
               <p>Where did you put your watch in your pocket? - At home; but I felt it when I was there.</p>
               <p>BUXTON KENDRICK sworn.</p>
               <p>When the prisoner was first brought up into the booth, in custody, I was very near him; I heard something rattle from behind him; I looked that way immediately, and I saw the watch drop.</p>
               <p>Did you see the watch dropping on the ground? - I saw the watch dropping.</p>
               <p>Falling? - Yes, falling; I immediately stooped to pick it up; it fell down on the ground directly behind the prisoner.</p>
               <p>How was you situated? - I was standing to the right of him.</p>
               <p>Which way was your face? - Towards him.</p>
               <p>Was you next to him, or was any body between you and him? - I was next to him.</p>
               <p>How close behind him was the watch? - It dropped almost between his legs, nearly so.</p>
               <p>Did you observe at the time, something rattle? - I could not see either of his hands; they were both behind.</p>
               <p>Were his hands at liberty at the time? - They were at liberty.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect who brought him up into the booth? - No, I do not; there were a great number of people; and a great number of people laid hold of him, at the same time pulled him and pushed him.</p>
               <p>How long after he was in the booth was it, that you heard something rattle, and saw the watch fall, and picked it up? - It was not above half a minute.</p>
               <p>You was on his right hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who was on his left hand? - There were ladies in the other booth, not the next booth; there was a partition breast high between the two booths.</p>
               <p>Then there was no person between him and the partition; and there were ladies in the booth on the other side of the partition: is that right? - Yes, that is right.</p>
               <p>Did you take notice at the time you saw the watch fall, or that you picked it up, who were behind him? - There was nothing behind him but the boards, and a carpet nailed over them.</p>
               <p>Was he placed at the end of the booth? - Yes, almost in the corner.</p>
               <p>Who was immediately next to you? - Mr. Townsend's coachman was next to me.</p>
               <p>Who was next to the coachman? - I do not recollect; the coachman and myself were the two nearest.</p>
               <p>Was there any body but the coachman and you near enough for the watch to have fallen from them? - No.</p>
               <p>Where was the booth? - Opposite the ending post where they come in.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Townsend. Had you been in that booth? - That was the booth I had been in that I came out of.</p>
               <p>Had you been in that corner? - No, I do not think I had, indeed; I am pretty sure I had not been in that corner, because I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150016"/>kept as near as possible; I stood upon a form all the time my horse was running; there was a row of ladies close to the edge of the booth; and I stood up behind them.</p>
               <p>Court to Buxton. Was there any form behind the prisoner? - No, no form at all: a circumstance I forgot; the prisoner attempted to kick the watch back almost at the instant I went to pick it up; he attempted just to push it back again with his heel.</p>
               <p>What did you do with the watch? - I gave it to Lady Lake that was in the booth, a relation of Mr. Townsend's.</p>
               <p>Is Lady Lake here? - No, she is not.</p>
               <p>I suppose you did not know the watch, did you? - No; I had never seen it before I had picked it up; I looked at it when I had picked it up.</p>
               <p>Did you see it again afterwards? - Yes, I did, at the Angel at Edmonton.</p>
               <p>The same watch? - The same watch.</p>
               <p>In whose possession? - I do not know exactly who had it then; Mr. Townsend I fancy had it.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen the watch in Mr. Townsend's possession since? - Not since that day; I saw it that day in his possession, and put a mark on it, that I might know it again.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Townsend. Was the watch that you saw in that gentleman's possession that day, the watch that you lost? - Yes, it certainly was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I understand you can ascertain the watch, you say, again, by a mark on the inside? - Yes, I can.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to be understood, that in the booth you took so much notice of it, that you should know the watch again? - I took notice of it by the hands.</p>
               <p>How many hands was there? - Three hands.</p>
               <p>That on a race course is of great importance? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Because things are minuted on the race ground? - I observed a gold linked chain and a gold seal.</p>
               <p>That is not a very uncommon circumstance. In the particular booth to which Mr. Barrington was carried, there were Lady Lake and other ladies, particular acquaintances of Mr. Townsend's? - Yes, there were.</p>
               <p>That was a booth on the ground? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The next adjoining booth was a covered booth, to which any body was admitted for six-pence? - Yes; the booth was partitioned elbow high.</p>
               <p>Not breast high? - No, not so high.</p>
               <p>And any other persons who could afford to pay their six-pence, were admitted? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now we have heard that the prisoner was secured at the instant the horses were going to run the second heat: was he carried into the booth then or afterwards? - Just as the horses were coming in.</p>
               <p>How long had the rumour of Mr. Townsend's having lost his watch reached you before? - I believe, half an hour; but I did not go out of the booth.</p>
               <p>The thing was pretty well known, however? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>And there was another rumour, I believe, nearly coeval with it; namely, that Barrington was on the course? - Yes, there was.</p>
               <p>Had that rumour reached your ears soon after the first heat? - I did not hear he was on the course before I heard he had taken Mr. Townsend's watch.</p>
               <p>It was full half an hour before he was taken? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see Mr. Barrington searched? - Yes, at the court; he had twenty-two guineas and a half in money.</p>
               <p>A guinea means a pound in the language of the turf? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Townsend. No, a pound means a guinea.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I beg pardon.</p>
               <p>- WALDUCK sworn.</p>
               <p>I am coachman to Mr. Townsend. I know nothing of the matter till the prisoner was in custody; I helped to take him up into the booth; I had one hand on his collar, and the other hold of his hand.</p>
               <p>Which hand? - My left hand had hold of his right hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150017"/>Do you recollect whether his hand was open at the time you laid hold of it, or whether the fingers were closed? - It was open; I laid hold of it when it was open.</p>
               <p>Then he could have nothing in his hand? - Nothing at all; we brought him to the booth; when we got into the booth, my master left me in care of him; I put him at the back of the booth; and there was a carpet nailed at the back of it.</p>
               <p>Was there any body behind him? - Nobody at all.</p>
               <p>Was there any body on one side of him? - Mr. Kendrick, the young gentleman who picked up the watch; he was on one side, and I on the other.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts were the ladies? - In the adjoining booth, about three foot and a half, or four foot; they were looking over the booth.</p>
               <p>Were they looking over the side you was on, or over the side Mr. Kendrick was on? - The side I was on.</p>
               <p>What do you say about the watch? - I saw the watch drop between Mr. Barrington and the carpet.</p>
               <p>By the situation you describe, that must be behind him? - It apparently fell on the left side of him, behind him.</p>
               <p>You say you saw it drop: do you mean that you perceived any thing of it before it reached the ground, or when it was on the ground? - I saw it as it jingled down, before it had reached the ground.</p>
               <p>Then it could not have been on the ground when Mr. Barrington was brought in? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the situation of the prisoners hands or arms at the time? - I did not notice any motion he made at the time.</p>
               <p>Where were his hands or arms; were they before or behind? - His arms hung down on each side of him.</p>
               <p>Could you see his hands? - I did not particularly notice that I did see his hands.</p>
               <p>Who took up the watch? - Mr. Kendrick.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know whose watch it was that was taken up? - I knew it to be my master's watch.</p>
               <p>You had seen it before? - I had it a few days before, one afternoon, in my possession, fetching it from London.</p>
               <p>What became of the watch? - I do not know who Mr. Kendrick gave it to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My lord has asked you whether you knew the watch: recollect yourself: you was asked the same question before the magistrate, and the watch was then shewn you? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did not you at that time say, that you could neither tell that that was your master's watch, nor the watch that was taken off the ground? - I said no such-thing.</p>
               <p>That you are positive of? - I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>You was placed in the situation your master had been in; and left to watch Mr. Barrington? - I was.</p>
               <p>You kept your eyes upon him? - I did.</p>
               <p>If he had put his hands in his pockets you would have prevented him? - I do not know that I was so curious as that.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did he put his hand into either pocket, or attempt any such thing? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Do not you know he did not? - No, I do not.</p>

               <p>On Wednesday, the 1st of September, on Enfield race ground, I met Mr. Townsend; I asked him if he had not lost his watch? he replied, yes; I told him Barrington was on the course; he asked me where? I told him at the distance post; I went down there, and Mr. Townsend had got hold of Barrington; then I went to see the decision of the plate; and when I returned I saw the watch in Mr. Kendrick's hand.</p>

               <p>On the 1st of September I was at Enfield races, close by the stand: I then saw the prisoner, Mr. Barrington, as I thought; I told a friend of mine it was Barrington,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150018"/>to my best opinion; no, says he, it cannot be Barrington, to be along with Mr. Townsend, for he was as close to Mr. Townsend as he possibly could be.</p>
               <p>Did you observe that they had any conversation, or do you know now whether that man was Barrington or not? - I am well convinced it was Barrington: I then went to Mr. Townsend, to be perfectly satisfied; and I asked him if he recollected a tall thin gentleman in light clothes? he said, I do remember seeing such a person, but he is no acquaintance of mine; Mr. Townsend then asked me why I asked the question? why, says I, I have an opinion it was Barrington; he immediately felt at his pocket; says he, I have lost my watch; Mr. Townsend begged the favour of me to walk up and down the course to shew him the person, for he said, he could recollect him; and in twenty minutes time I saw the person, says I. I see the person now; Mr. Townsend said, that is him, is not it? yes, says I, Sir, it is; he went and took hold of him, and said, your name is Barrington, damn me, Sir, says he, you have robbed me of my watch; and I assisted him, and took hold of him; going along, he did not try to get away himself; other people seemed to be trying.</p>
               <p>Court. He could not help what other people did? - I saw him in the booth: I did not see the watch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did not the prisoner immediately say, you are right, Sir, as to my name; but I have not your watch? - I heard him say nothing about his name.</p>

               <p>I was in the next booth to that in which the prisoner was brought in; I was but a very little way off him; there was nobody between him and me; nothing but the partition; I was next the partition; the prisoner was sideways to me when he dropped the watch on his side; he dropped the watch from his hand; I told him of it at the time; I cannot recollect which hand: his hand was by the side of him at the time I saw it drop from him; and I mentioned it to him at the time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was it the side nearest to you or farthest from you? - Nearest to me.</p>
               <p>There were many persons in the same booth with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You paid for your admission? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you go before the magistrate? - No.</p>
               <p>So this is the first time you was examined on the subject? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How was you found out? - I do not know: a gentleman that went with me to the races told Mr. Townsend.</p>
               <p>Pray where do you live? - At Ponders End.</p>
               <p>A married or single lady? - Single.</p>
               <p>Do you know where the prisoner got the watch from? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>You did not see him take it from under his hat? - No.</p>
               <p>If it had dropped behind, and he had attempted to kick it, you must have seen that? - I did not pay any attention to that.</p>
               <p>If he had got before and attempted to have kicked with his heel backward, you could have seen him? - I looked in his face; and I was pulled away; somebody else crouded to the partition.</p>
               <p>Did this gentleman live in London that was with you? - I do not know where he lives. You do not mean the gentleman in the carriage.</p>
               <p>Yes, I do? - Oh! I forget his name; Mr. Townsend, I believe, knows him: he was not in the booth with me.</p>
               <p>Are you an acquaintance of Mr. Townsend's? - No.</p>
               <p>Where did you find that gentleman? - He is an acquaintance of my father's.</p>
               <p>Who was entrusted by your father to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150019"/>carry his daughter to the races in a one horse chaise? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long has he been acquainted with your father? - I do not know: he is my step father. Does any body here know his name?</p>
               <p>Do not ask any body else. - I never was in his company but that one time.</p>
               <p>Did he come from London? - I do not know where he comes from; I believe he comes out of the country; he called at my father's; and as he was going down, my father asked him to carry me to the races.</p>
               <p>Did he bring you back again? - No; I came home in another gentleman's chaise cart.</p>
               <p>What was that gentleman's name? - I do not know him.</p>
               <p>What part of Ponders End do you live in? - I live just by the Two Brewers.</p>
               <p>Do you usually take these excursions? - I was with more company, and it rained very hard.</p>
               <p>What company was you in? - I was with my sisters.</p>
               <p>Try and recollect the name of one of those gentlemen? - I do not know either of their names; I never saw the gentleman that called in the morning, before or since.</p>
               <p>Then he did not come to you with a message from Mr. Townsend? - No, Sir, Mr. Townsend came to me himself.</p>
               <p>Is this a young gentleman? - No, he is an elderly gentlemen; he is a farmer in the country.</p>
               <p>Should you know his name if you heard it? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was it Forrester? - I do not think it was; I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was it Bishop? - I cannot swear to his name.</p>
               <p>Mr. Townsend. I think the young woman's character is in some measure at stake; therefore I wish to clear up this matter: that young woman's father-in-law is a farmer, who has lived a long time in the neighbourhood I live in, and has for a long time been respected; that gentleman to whose care she was intrusted, is an elderly man, whose name was Mr. Chase; he was going to the races in his one horse chaise; he told me of this circumstance; and my coachman said, that when Barrington said,</p>
               <p>"did any body see me drop the watch?" a young woman in the booth said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, I did!" I related this to Mr. Smith, the attorney to the India Company, and he said this was a very material witness.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I submit Mr. Townsend cannot tell the conversations.</p>
               <p>Court. It does not go further than restoring the credit of the witness; therefore it is fit that when any thing seems to bear against the credit of a witness, all manner of circumstances should be related.</p>
               <p>Mr. Townsend. Mr. Smith said, that will be a very material witness: I never could learn any thing about her, till on Saturday last I went by accident to Mr. Chase, who had been a long time a servant to my father, and owed a small rent of five guineas or five pounds; he asked me about losing my watch; and he said,</p>
               <p>"a young</p>
               <p>"woman I carried to the races in my</p>
               <p>"chaise saw him drop the watch."</p>
               <p>Court. The circumstances were certainly such as made it the duty of the council to go into the examination; but it was also equally fit to hear every thing that could be said to establish the credit of the witness, who certainly appeared to have gone to the races in a way that did not appear proper: there is no way of finding out the truth but by examining into all the circumstances.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Prisoner, you have heard the whole of the evidence that is against you: you are to state the matter of fact to the jury yourself, with the observations on the evidence on the part of the prosecution; and, by way of introduction to your own evidence, if you have any yourself. Your counsel are only permitted to cross-examine the witnesses on the part of the prosecution, and to examine your own witnesses; and this is the time for you to make your defence.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>May it please your lordship, and you gentlemen of the jury, to favour me with your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150020"/>attention for a little time. The situation of every person who has the misfortune to stand here is extremely distressing and aukward; mine is so in a peculiar degree: if I am totally silent, it may be considered perhaps as a proof of guilt; and if I presume to offer those arguments which present themselves to my mind, in my defence, they may not perhaps be favoured with that attention which they might deserve; you by no means distrust the candour and lence of the jury; and therefore I beg leave to proceed to state the circumstances of the case as they occur to me, ing but they will meet with some credit, notwithstanding the un- ion I am in. Gentlemen, I the race ground at Enfield, observing the race, on the day that the indictment mentions, where I found myself surrounded by Mr. Townsend, and numbers of others; Mr. Townsend said,</p>
               <p>"Your name is Barrington, and you have taken my watch!" I told him he was right as to my name, but he accused me unjustly; however I would go any where with him: I was removed from thence to a stand, from whence the races were viewed; it consisted of two booths, and they were separated from each other with only a railing elbow high; and it is a great misfortune to me, gentlemen of the jury, that you were not able to observe the situation of those booths; for if you had, you would have found it nearly impossible that some circumstances which have come from the witnesses could be true: I was close to the railing that separated the two booths, and some person said,</p>
               <p>"here is the watch!" this watch Mr. Townsend claimed, and said it was his. I was removed from thence to the Angel at Edmonton, where the examination took place; and I am very sorry to be under the necessity of observing, that a very material difference has taken place in the depositions delivered that day before the magistrate in various respects. A witness (the coachman) positively declared that he did not see this watch in my hand, that he did not see me take it from my pocket, that he did not see it drop from the person, but that he saw it on the ground; and he might have gone so far as to say he saw it fall: I took the liberty of asking him one question, Whether he had seen this watch in my hand, whether he had seen it fall from me? he declared he did not. I then asked him, whether he could take upon himself to swear, from the situation he stood in at the adjoining booth, that this watch might not have dropped from some other person? he declared he could not observe any such thing. Gentlemen, with respect to the evidence of Mr. Kendrick, he made the same declaration then.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Mr. Townsend has brought me here under the charge of having committed felony; he has told you, gentlemen of the jury, that he lost a watch out of his pocket, and that pocket is a waistcoat pocket, that he was in a very extraordinary situation; that he was on the race ground, where certainly the greatest decorum is not always observed; and he was also in a situation which exposed him more to the pressure he complained of than any other person; for, instead of his horse being in the possession of his jockey or groom, he attended it himself; and I must beg leave to observe, gentlemen of the jury, that it is a custom where people bet money at races, to wish to see the horse immediately after the heat is over, so that the pressure which Mr. Townsend had, or what he thought he had from me, could not appear very extraordinary; and I am under the necessity of saying, his fancy has rather been improved on the occasion. With respect, gentlemen, to the last witness that has appeared. I will not say any thing on the occasion; that will rest entirely with you. It was a circumstance, however, of a most extraordinary nature, that this person should never come forward till the present moment; and whether the contradictions and strange accounts she has given of herself, are such as entitle her to any credit, particularly in a situation where the life or liberty of another is at stake, is not for me to observe upon. Gentlemen of the jury, it may perhaps be expected by many persons in this place, that I should say a great deal about prepossessions and newspaper reports, and if I had the ability to do it, perhaps I should not be blamed; for he who has been the unhappy object of much defamation, has surely a right to deprecate its baneful effects; where much pains have been taken to defame, some pains may be surely allowed to abate that defamation. Gentlemen, that it has been the hard lot of some unhappy persons, to have been convicted of crimes they did really not commit, less through evidence than ill-natured report,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150023"/>is doubtless certain; and doubtless there are many respectable persons now in court, fully convinced of the truth of that observation. Such times, it is to be hoped, are past; I dread not such a conviction in my own person; I am well convinced of the noble nature of a British Court of Justice, the dignified and benign principles of its Judges, and the liberal and candid spirit of its Jurors.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, life is the gift of God, and liberty is its greatest blessing; the power of disposing of both, or either, is the greatest man can enjoy. It is also adventitious that, great as that power is, it cannot be better placed, than in the hands of an English Jury; for they will not exercise it like tyrants, who delight in blood, but like generous and brave men, who delight to spare rather than to destroy; and who, not forgetting they are men themselves, loan, when they can, to the side of compassion. It may be thought, gentlemen of the jury, that I am applying to your passions, and if I had the power to do it, I would not fail to employ it; the passions animate the heart; and to the passions we are indebted for the noblest actions, and to the passions we owe our dearest and finest feelings; and when it is considered, the mighty power you now posses, whatever leads to a cautious and tender discharge of it, must be thought of great consequence, for, as long as the passions conduct us on the side of benevolence, they are our best, our safest, and our most friendly guides. Gentlemen of the jury, Mr. Townsend has deposed that he lost his watch, but how, I trust is by no means clear: I trust, gentlemen, you will consider the great, the almost impossibility, that having had the watch in my possession for so long a time, time sufficient to have concealed it in a variety of places, or to have conveyed it to town, it should be still in my possession. You have heard from Mr. Townsend, that there was an interval of at least half an hour between the time of losing the watch and my being taken into custody: there is something, gentlemen, impossible in the circumstance; and, on the other hand, it has sometimes happened, that remorse, a generous remorse, has struck the minds of persons in such a manner, as to have induced them to surrender themselves into the hands of justice, rather than an innocent person should suffer. It is not therefore, I suppose, improbable, that if Mr. Townsend lost his watch by an act of felony, the person who had the watch in his possession, feeling for the situation of an unhappy man, might be induced to place that watch on the ground. But it is by no means certain how Mr. Townsend lost his watch, whether by an act of felony, or whether by accident: it might have fallen into the hands of some other person, and that person feeling for my unhappy situation, might have been induced to restore it. I humbly hope that the circumstances of the case are such as may induce a scrupulous jury to make a favourable decision; and I am very well convinced that you will not be led by any other circumstances than those of the present case; either from the reports of former misfortunes, or by the fear of my falling into similar ones. I am now just thirty-two years of age (shall be so next month) it is nearly half the life of man; it is not worth while being impatient to provide for the other half, so far as to do any thing unworthy. Gentlemen, in the course of my life I have suffered much distress; I have felt something of the vicissitudes of fortune, and now, from observation, I am convinced upon the whole, there is no joy but what arises from the practice of virtue, and consists in the felicity of a tranquil mind and a benevolent heart; sources of consolation which the most prosperous circumstances do not always furnish, and which may be felt under the most indigent: it will be my study, gentlemen, to possess them, nor will the heaviest affliction of poverty, pain, or disgrace, cause me to part with resolutions founded on the deepest reflection, and which will end but with life: I will perish on the pavement before I will deviate from them. For my own part, whatever your verdict may be, I trust I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150024"/>shall be enabled to meet it with a firmness of mind; he, indeed, has little to fear from death, whose fame is tarnished, and who has endured the ceaseless abuse of unfeeling minds; when Heaven accepts contrition; it receives into favour when it pardons; but man, more cruel than his Maker, pursues his offending brother with unrelenting severity, and marks a deviation from rectitude with a never dying infamy, and with unceasing suspicion and reproach, which seem to exclude him from the pale of virtue.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, the thought of death may appal the rich and prosperous, but on the other hand the unfortunate cannot have much to fear from it, yet the tenderness of nature cannot be quite subdued by the utmost degree of human resolution, and I cannot be insensible to the woes which must be felt by an affectionate companion, and an infant offspring; and there is, besides, a principle in human nature, stronger even than the fear of death, and which can hardly fail to operate some time or other in life, I mean the desire of good fame: Under that laudable influence, gentlemen, if I am acquitted, I will quickly retire to some distant land, where my name and misfortunes will be alike unknown; where harmless manners shall shield me from the imputation of guilt, and where prejudice will not be liable to misrepresentation: and I do now assure you, gentlemen of the jury, that I feel a cheering hope, even at this awful moment, that the rest of my life will be so conducted, as to make me as much an object of esteem and applause, as I am now the unhappy object of censure and suspicion.</p>

               <p>Mr. Townsend. My Lord, permit me to say a word.</p>
               <p>Court. By no means in the world, not a word.</p>

            , Esq. and this being the whole of the indictment, I need not state in you, that it is not a capital offence, but it is a charge of single felony, Mr. Townsend tells you - Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence, and then added.</p>
               <p>This is the whole of the evidence; to you see what is the result of it. The result is, that Mr. Townsend having somehow or other lost his watch he not able of his own knowledge to describe the circumstances of having lost it, concludes that his pocket was picked of it somewhere, not that he dropped it: then the circumstances that go to fix the guilt on the prisoner, are these; that he was seen close to Mr. Townsend, in a way that alarmed Mr. Townsend, and he expressed surprise that he should be pushed upon in the way he was, and in a situation that might afford an opportunity to a man who was disposed to make use of it, to have taken his watch: that foundation being laid, they go further, and they endeavour to satisfy you that this watch was in fact in the prisoner's custody; for all the circumstances relative to the dropping of the watch, go to that; and that he endeavoured to get it out of his custody for fear the possession of it should (as it certainly would) be a very evident proof of his having taken it: to be sure, if a gentleman losea his watch on the race ground, and it is found afterwards on a man who does not give a good account of it, and on whom any suspicion can fasten, it calls upon him to answer for such possession; but it certainly is liable undoubtedly to all kind of explanations; because if a watch was found on a man of such character as Mr. Townsend, who could convince all the world that he would not commit such a thing, and he was to say he found it, it would be extremely different: but they do not prove simply that the watch was found there, but that it was seen in the act of falling, and that would have left it open to the possibility of its being thrown down, or falling from some other person: but if it be true that it was in his possession, then it is necessary for him to give you a satisfactory account, how he came by it. He has addressed himself to you, by way of defence,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150025"/>and he has added every thing that could interest you in his favour; in the general turn of his address to you he has also made all the observations that I think could be made, on his part in his favour, and you have heard them with attention, and you will do him the justice to give them all the weight they deserve, but you will give them no more weight than they deserve; and you will therefore judge now, whether to you it appears with sufficient certainty, that that watch fell from the prisoner, when he was in the booth, and if it did, whether that, together with the other circumstances, of his being seen by Mr. Townsend in the way he describes, do not convince you that he must have been either the person that took the watch, or connected with those that did; in either case you will find him guilty: on the other hand, if you, on the observation he has made to you, or on others that occur to yourselves, see any reason to believe, that the charge does not conclude against him, with sufficient certainty, that he was the man, then you will acquit him.</p>
               <p>The Jury instantly found him <rs id="t17900915-10-verdict50" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>After the verdict was pronounced, the Lord Chief Baron thus addressed the prisoner:</p>
               <p>Mr. Barrington, Hitherto I have conducted myself towards you on this trial, as if I had never seen you before; but now, when nothing I can say can prejudice the Jury, I must say that you have been treated with much more favour than you deserve. This ought to have been a capital indictment, and it ought to have reached your life, and public justice very much calls for such a sacrifice; for if ever there was a man in the world that abused and prostituted great talents to the most unworthy and shameful purposes, you are that man; and you have done it against all warning, against the example of your own case, and of a thousand other cases that have occurred; and I am afraid, that now, as the punishment does not reach your life, I cannot entertain the least hope that you will in any manner reform; but that you must be a shameful spectacle at your latter end.</p>

               <p>Mr. Barrington. My Lord, I had a few words to say why sentence of death should not be passed upon me; I had much to say, though I shall say but little on the occasion: Notwithstanding I have the best opinion of his Lordship's candour, and have no wish or pleasure in casting a reflection on any person whatever; but I cannot help observing that it is the strange lot of some persons through life, that with the best wishes, the best endeavours, and the best intentions, they are not able to escape the evenomed tooth of calumny; whatever they say or do is so twisted and perverted from the reality, that they will meet with censure and misfortune, where perhaps they were entitled to success and praise. The world, my Lord, has given me credit for much more abilities than I am conscious of possessing; but the world should also consider that the greatest abilities may be so obstructed by the mercenary nature of some unfeeling minds, as to tender them entirely useless to the possessor. Where was the generous and powerful man that would come forward and say, you have some abilities which might be of service to yourself<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150026"/>and to others, but you have much to struggle with, I feel for your situation, and will place you in a condition to try the sincerity of your intentions; and as long as you act with diligence and fidelity you shall not want for countenance and protection? But, my Lord, the die is cast! I am prepared to meet the sentence of the Court with respectful resignation, and the painful lot assigned me, I hope, with becoming resolution.</p>

On the 24th of August, at three in the morning, my man and I was both in bed in the barge; I heard a noise; I looked out from under the tilt; I saw the prisoner taking up a bar of iron; I called my man; he looked out, and asked the prisoner what he did there; I told my man to lay hold of him; he ran towards him, and he dropped the bar; I went to assist him: I called the watch, and the watchman came to the side of the wharf; we delivered him to the watchman; he had a skift along side our barge, with lines and old pieces of rope that had been cut off; he was taken to the watch-house, and from thence to the Compter.</p>

On Wednesday, the 8th of this month, between four and five, the prisoners were at my shop: I was waiting on two ladies near the door; my shop-woman came and said, she suspected the two women had stole something; I was about ten yards from them: the shopwoman was coming towards me, past them; and one of them asked her to shew them some muslin; she then came and told me what she suspected; I waited on the ladies about ten minutes; after that

             came to that part where I was, as if going out of the shop; she stopped opposite me, and looked hard at me, and came close to the counter, and laid hold of a piece of flannel, and asked me the price of it; I said fifteen-pence halfpenny; she said, cannot you take fifteen-pence? I said, no; she stood about two minutes, and then she walked sharply out of the shop; one of the ladies said the woman had something concealed; I followed her immediately: Kelly was at the further end of the shop then; but she got away while I was pursuing Smith; I overtook Smith about fifty yards from my door; I took her by the hand: she had no cloak on: one piece of the cotton dropped from under her coats; I took it up: it was not in paper: I am certain it is mine; it corresponds with a piece that I had cut off: there is a number on this, and the other piece has the progressive number.</p>

               <p>Where did this lay in the shop? - In that part where the prisoners were: here is another piece that dropped from her: I took her into the shop, but did not search her: Kelly was then gone; she was never searched at all.</p>
               <p>Did they both come in together? - I never could learn that: I do not know how long they had been there: the goods cost me about four pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You say there were a number of people in the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Could any body take any thing without being seen while there were a number of people in the shop? - I think they might; such things have been done.</p>

The prisoner has lodged with me for three months past: about a fortnight ago he left my house; he owed me a score of about thirty shillings and for lodgings for three months; he promised me payment, but he never paid me: in the course of last week I lost money several times; on the 13th I lost money; I missed twelve shillings out of the till; I was told of it: the girl said the prisoner had been in the bar: on the 13th, at night, I marked ten shillings; the housekeeper put it in.</p>
               <p>Court. What is her name? - Catherine: I saw her put it in; it was between ten and eleven; she went to bed, and I went to bed: when the girl came to me in the morning I told her to let the prisoner go into the bar as usual; the girl told me that the housekeeper had caught the captain's hand in the basket of halfpence: the girl brought the drawer up to me, and there was four shillings gone out; the drawer was locked; mean time he went out of the house; he went to the ship, the next publick-house; I went there, and saw him; I asked him to have something to drink; the prisoner pulled out five shillings among some halfpence; I looked at the four shillings, and I said I could swear to them by the mark I put on them: the officer has the other four.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long had the housekeeper been up before the girl came up to you? - She got up before the girl, and I told her she had no business up, and bid her go up stairs again.</p>
               <p>A good careful steady woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>No little disputes in the family about the captain? - None that I know.</p>
               <p>He had the run of the bar and the house. - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath have not you complained that the Captain and Catherine were playing about before you got up, like two kittens, and two lovers in the honey moon? - No; not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Did you never say that the Captain and Mrs. Catherine were more free than welcome? - No.</p>
               <p>Did she never give him change out of the till? - Yes, and set it down to his score.</p>
               <p>Perhaps more than was set down? - I believe there was: I mistrusted there might be a thief come, and I chose rather to trust the girl than the housekeeper.</p>
               <p>Court. Which had the key? - The housekeeper.</p>
               <p>Did the housekeeper go to bed again when she called the girl? - I do not know: she was watching on the stairs, and she ran down.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, Sir, have not you often quarrelled with her, and said she was fonder of the captain than you? - No, there never was the least dispute at all.</p>

               <p>As Mr. Goswell had not got up, you had not seen him? - Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>What before you was up? - That is nothing to you.</p>
               <p>Where was it you saw him? - That is nothing to the purpose.</p>
               <p>Did he give you any orders about the money that morning? - No, he had not given any orders either one way or the other; the maid was up first; I did not call her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Goswell did not tell you to go to bed again, for that you had no business up? - No.</p>
               <p>How long had the captain lived there? - Three months.</p>
               <p>He had pretty much the run of the house? - No more than other customers.</p>
               <p>There never was any uneasiness about the captain and you? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Goswell sleeps by himself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And did that night, and does every night? - I will not swear to that.</p>

I should tell you, that on Monday, the 16th of August, the prisoner Pocock came to my shop, and desired to see some coloured silk stockings; I shewed him a bundle in a blue paper; he looked at them, and did not approve of them; I shewed him another sort of silk and cotton, those were not the sort he wanted; he said the stockings were for a friend of his that was in the country, that would be in town in two or three days, and he would bring him; he appeared to me to be very weak and low, and very faint in his voice; and I took a good deal of notice of his person; I put the stockings back to the place, after he went out; on the Wednesday following, in the morning, about six o'clock, I was called out of bed; when I came down, I found the street door open, the shutter wrenched, two panes of glass broke, and the stile that parted the panes of glass, wrenched out; the last inside shutter of my shop was taken down; and I observed a number of bundles of stockings taken out of their places; I went into the shop; and I had locked in my till about twelve shillings in silver, two shillings and nine-pence in farthings, and two Birmingham halfpence; they were gone; taking a farther survey, I found the paper containing three pair of coloured silk stockings, without any thing in it; that was the paper I had shewn him first; this brought to my recollection immediately, the person of the prisoner, who I had shewed the stockings to; in consequence of that, I had a strong suspicion that he was the man that was guilty of the robbery. Between nine and ten in the morning, I went to Bow-street, and gave information, and described the person of the prisoner, and his dress; and the same morning we took the prisoner; Macmanus knew him, and we took him in Round-court, in the Strand, where he lived; he was in bed in his room; we found three pair of stockings, two pair by the side of his bed, loose, without any paper, and one pair was taken out of a drawer at the foot of his bed; I did not see them found; they did not appear to have been worn, or dirty, or soiled; as soon as the stockings were found, they were shewn to me; I was pretty clear in my own mind, that they were mine; and I found some farthings and two Birmingham halfpence; I do not know the particular number of farthings; there were two Birmingham halfpence in the till; I cannot swear to them, nor the farthings; I have a sample of the farthings in the pocket. Mr. Jealous has two pair, and Mr. Shallard has one pair of stockings: different people found them; Shallard and Jealous were both with me.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Bagshaw: his house was broke open the 18th of August, about a quarter past two in the morning: I heard the door wrenched open; I slept in the kitchen, one story below the shop, directly under the shop; I heard them go into the parlour, and stop some minutes; there appeared to be three: when the second person came, about five, they took down a shutter: about half after two, they went into the parlour, and then into the shop, and took out the till; I heard the door break open, and I heard a foot step along the passage, before the bolts were unfastened, the bolts of the shop door; I heard them go into the parlour, and stop about ten minutes; the parlour was not directly over my head, but the shop was; they took down one shutter of the shop; the first time they came about a quarter after two; then I heard them go round the counter, and step about the shop, several times; and in about half an hour, I heard some person go out; I heard two persons in the house; the first time, I did not hear them speak; then one person went away; and every ten minutes or so, I heard some person step about the shop, till a little past five.</p>
               <p>Do you mean that some one person kept walking about the shop from two o'clock till five in the morning? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes, I am quite confident of that.</p>
               <p>Did you lay towards the street? - It is the kitchen directly under the shop, towards the street; I know it was two o'clock, because, I heard the watchman go half past two soon after; I am sure of that; I knew his voice; I knew him to be the watchman.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him go three o'clock? - Yes; I heard both the watchmen go five o'clock; one stands by the corner of Lincoln's-inn-fields; one of the watchmen neglected going half after three; I heard them go every other half hour; one person staid in the house till a little after five; then a second person came; then he went into the shop to the other person; the shutter was down.</p>
               <p>The door was broke, and the shutter was down? - Yes; they laid it on the kitchen stairs: the watchman, Welch, goes close by the door; he left his stand that morning, I believe, a little past four.</p>
               <p>Does he ever knock at the door? - No, I never observed him do so.</p>
               <p>Are there any lamps thereabout? - Yes, one at the corner of our house: when the other man came in at a little past five, they took another shutter down; and one of them made a noise, and the other said, be softly! be softly! I heard that voice, but it was in a loud whisper; I could not be sure of his voice again; then one of them said, do you think there is any thing worth going down in the kitchen for? the other made reply, no, not now, we cannot stay; a third person came to the door, and said, all is well, you may come away now; that was, as near as I can recollect, about ten minutes before six: then Mr. Clark, a neighbour of ours, next door, was opening his kitchen windows, and he put his burner over our kitchen windows; and I alarmed him; I was so terrified, I could not alarm the watchmen; I might, but I was so afraid; I got up directly when I heard them go away, and I found the shutter of the shop on the kitchen stairs; the shutter was wrenched off the upper part of the door, the fastening broke out of the wood; it made a violent noise; I awoke when I heard the noise; the shutter and the glass made some noise.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. You heard every thing distinctly from first to last? - Yes.</p>
               <p>With great accuracy? - Yes.</p>
               <p>One of these people said to the other be softly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And he said that in a low whisper, not so loud as the people in all corners of the court are talking now? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150045"/>That you could hear in the kitchen distinctly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Can you just give me an idea of that tone of voice, was it thus softly (in a soft tone)? - Yes; there was no voices but those of men.</p>
               <p>In a whisper? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If you had spoke in the same sort of loud whisper to the watchman, do not you think he might have heard you? - Yes; he might possibly have heard me.</p>
               <p>But I will tell you what you might have done; you might have crept softly to the window and called watchman (softly)? - Yes; but I thought somebody was over the area window, but there was nobody over the area window when the watchman passed.</p>
               <p>When the watchman came his round every thing was very hush? - I did not observe.</p>
               <p>Have you a sash window to your kitchen? - No; one is a door, and the other is a casement.</p>
               <p>A casement towards Turnstile? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And the first time only two people came in? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Nor at the second time, nor the third person did not appear to come into the house? - No.</p>
               <p>So that that person might have been a person passing by, and having nothing to with what passed before? - As far as I know he might.</p>
               <p>Did both the watchmen neglect the half past three? - No; our watchman went his round regularly.</p>
               <p>How is the shop secured against the passage that leads to the kitchen? - There is no security at all; no door at the top of the stairs; there are shutters from the stairs; the shutters from the passage of a night, when they are put up between the parlour and the shop.</p>
               <p>When they were asking whether there was any thing in the kitchen worth coming for, you must have been a good deal frightened? - Yes; they were then apparently to me in the passage.</p>
               <p>It was light long enough before they went away? - Yes, it was light, so that I could perceive any thing, at four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Do you think, when you first heard the noise, you should have known a man's face? - No, not at first.</p>
               <p>The breaking had been completed before the third man came? - Yes.</p>
               <p>

I left my lanthorn with the saloop man, and told him I had a suspicion of some people: then I went into Turnstile, the corner of Weston's Park, near Bradshaw's, after three, not quite half an hour: I saw no sign of any breaking, or harm to the shop; I looked at it, and saw the bars and shutters up; the shutter of the door was up, but whether fast, I cannot say; I was not from this door any time, more than a hundred yards, which is the extent of my best from his shop; my stand is the corner of Turnstile.</p>
               <p>Court. Is it so far, but what if there had been a violent breaking of windows and doors, you must have heard it? - I heard none: I met the prisoner in Weston's Park, after three o'clock; I said, halloo, my friend, what are you doing? he said, I am going through; I said, you have been often through, and it is time you was at home; he said he was going home: I looked as sharp as I could at the houses; I did not find any house broke open, the shutters being up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You were the watchman of this beat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You were on all occasions extremely attentive to your duty? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You examine all the doors and shutters - Yes, once a night.</p>
               <p>Court. At what time? - At eleven; I thought the shutters and doors were.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you recollect then that you knew his person? - No; my duty is down Weston Park; I do not come at all into Turnstile.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an officer belonging to Bow-street. On the 18th of August, I went with Jealous and Carpmeal and Bagshaw to the house of Pocock, in Round-court in the Strand: when we came there, Pocock was in bed, about eleven in the morning: we searched the place, and I found a pair of stockings: I found a bag, but nothing in it.</p>
               <p>Bagshaw. I verily believe that is one of the pair of stockings that was contained in the blue paper, where I shewed him the three pair: there is no private mark: I only go on the patent: there is no clock in them: it is a kind of patent stocking: it is not a real patent one.</p>
               <p>Did you make that stocking yourself? - No: I bought these stockings, and five other pair, of Mr. Wright, in Milk-street.</p>
               <p>Is there any mark in these stockings, by which you can swear to them? - There is no mark by which I can swear to them, any otherwise than I think I can swear to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Wright is a very large dealer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is the prime cost of these stockings? - Eleven and six-pence, I paid for them.</p>
               <p>What is the value of the other two pair that you say was found? - One is worth, at prime cost, four and six-pence, the other pair is worth five and six-pence.</p>
               <p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I found a pair of stockings, and in his waistcoat pocket a quantity of farthings: I believe there are thirty-eight, and two halfpence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. He says the farthings are bad.</p>
               <p>(The stockings produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These are a pair of brown thread that I have had in my possession, to the best of my knowledge, four or five years: to swear absolutely to them, I cannot: there is no private mark: I only judge from the pattern of the clock of the stocking: there is something at the top of the stocking that is of an inferior quality to the rest of it, that I think I can almost swear positively they are mine, but I cannot be positive: these are the stockings I have had in my possession, I believe I may say, six years: I know them by the peculiar mixture: I have been in trade for myself for thirty years, and I never, in the course of my knowledge, saw six pair like them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It might so happen, that a whimsical person might desire to have a pair of a particular pattern? - There was only six pair; I took three pair.</p>
               <p>Court. Will you venture to swear these were in your shop the night of the robbery? - I think I can.</p>
               <p>Will you swear? - I will swear I had the bundle open on the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Then you swear these were your stockings before the robbery? - To the best of my knowledge and belief, if it was the last word I had to say, I believe these are the stockings.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to say these are your stockings? - No, I will not.</p>

               <p>I keep the adjoining house to Mr. Bagshaw, a publick-house; on Wednesday, the 18th of August, at six o'clock, I opened my house; the prosecutor's maid called to me over the iron grating, begging I would go and knock at her master's house, for she believed somebody had broken in, and she was afraid of coming up stairs, believing they were in the house; I immediately went to the door, and discovered the door shut, but not fastened; I pushed it and went in, and found one of the inside shutters open, and the till standing on the end of the counter; I immediately called out, Mr. Bagshaw, and the girl came up stairs, and seemed very happy in being relieved, and Mr. Bagshaw came down; I saw violence had been used to the screw of the shutter that pinned the street door; it was wrenched out, and one of the bars of the sash belonging to the door, and the glass broke; there was not room enough for one person to get in by one pane; I conceive they got in that way; I do not recollect I heard from the girl at that time the circumstances.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The girl believed somebody had broken in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And she believed they were then in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then she did not distinctly tell you, that she had heard one, two, or three persons in the house, and distinctly heard them going away? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I submit my defence to my counsel.</p>
               <p>The Jury retired for twenty-eight minutes, and returned with a verdict</p>

               <p>On the 18th of August, I was sent for to Mr. Collins's, to take charge of the prisoners; I took this piece of cloth from the prisoner Hudson, and down her bosom I found this remnant; it appears to be a remnant of the handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Smith. This piece of cloth appears to be the same piece I sold to Hobbs, but I will not positively swear to it; I cannot swear to the remnant of muslin; but the border appears to correspond with this.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hudson. I recommend myself to the mercy of the gentlemen of the Court.</p>
               <p>PRISONER HOBB's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>This young woman told me, that she had sent to the prosecutor, and he had sent word to her back again, if he could convict me, and acquit her, he would do it; an answer was sent back, that he could not, without acquitting us both; then he sent word, that he would not do it; this young woman says, that gentleman was very intimate with her, and often gave her things for the child, and that he gave her these four handkerchiefs; and she told the gentleman, that he was her sweetheart some time back; and I really believe there was a great deal of intimacy between them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hudson. We are both equally guilty.</p>
               <p>Smith. My Lord, it is very true; some time ago, the prisoner Hudson had a remnant of muslin from me; the person whom I served my time with, about four years ago, was very intimate with her father-in-law; she came to town very frequently, and came to the shop to see Mr. Coward, the person I served my time with; about three months ago she came to this shop; I had not seen her for three years and a half; she begged of me to shew her some muslin, about three shillings a yard; I shewed her some; she appeared to be in a very deplorable situation; she desired me to cut off two nails of this muslin; I believe it came to two-pence or three-pence; says she, you will not charge me any thing for this; I told her, I was sorry to see her in such a situation, and I would make her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150050"/>a present of it; the apprentice is here that was present at the time.</p>
               <p>Is that the only instance in which you have given her any thing? - That is the only instance that I can recollect; what I might have given her possibly four years ago, I do not recollect; but nothing else, since I have been at this shop.</p>
               <p>Have you kept any connection or acquaintance with her, since you have been at this shop? - Not the least; I never saw her but when she came to the shop, and I believe she has been three times within three months.</p>

               <p>The Indictment opened by Mr. Garrow.</p>
               <p>And the Case by Mr. Fielding, as follows:</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship. Gentlemen of the Jury: I have the honour to solicit your attention upon this melancholy occasion as counsel for the Governors and Directors of the Bank of England. Gentlemen, the indictment which my learned friend has just stated to you, informs you of the crime now imputed to the prisoner at the bar; and when you are informed that this is a forgery of a receipt for money, in a transaction which has been carried on at the Bank, you at once receive the impression of all the importance that such an enquiry is of: it is not proper, on the present occasion, to travel out of the business which is the subject of the present charge; I shall not therefore seek to throw into the present business any of the other circumstances that bear on the prisoner at the bar, however it might seem to bear on the present prosecution, and fairly to be introduced into that prosecution, as they might, by possibility, seem to carry the appearance of charging, with accumulated imputation, more than was necessary to a matter that is extremely simple in itself: I shall only inform you now, therefore, that the prisoner at the bar has been for, I think, twenty years nearly, a servant of the Bank of England, and having continued so long in such employ, bespeaks his character and reputation, till the time of this discovery, certainly a fair one:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150051"/>indeed, gentlemen, it is of the utmost consolation to the Bank, when they contemplate that vast machine of public credit, the Bank of England, that no occasion has arisen wherein we have been called upon to question the wisdom of the regulation, the vigilance of the directors, or the fidelity and integrity of their servants; and till, unhappily, the present occasion arose, I think there has been no such occasion: acting, as the prisoner has done for so many years in the Bank, apprized of all the regulations made by the directors, unfortunately for himself, he has disobeyed one of those principal regulations which has involved him in the difficulties of this prosecution: as a clerk in one of the principal offices, he was expressly forbid to act as a broker; and, on the present occasion, he has violated that regulation: Gentlemen, the prisoner, while he was in this employ, not only gained the esteem and friendship of those around him, as well as the approbation of his masters, but likewise the confidence of several of his friends, who had intrusted him with the whole management of their concerns in the different stocks in which they had placed their money: among those people with whom he had obtained this confidence was the present prosecutor, Mr. Papps, who had employed him frequently in purchasing stock, but never in transferring any stock; on the 8th of May, as mentioned in the indictment, Mr. Papps, having at that time some money to lay out, applied to the prisoner, told him his intention, and desired that he would compleat the business for him; the money that he had on that occasion was 47 l. 10 s. 6 d. this was to be laid out in the purchase of so much stock, 50 l. in the four per cent. annuities; Mr. Papps having communicated his intentions to the prisoner, and he having received the money from him for the purpose, he expected the whole transaction should be compleat, till it was necessary for him to appear to accept a receipt, and to sign his acceptance of the stock; Mr. Papps very soon after having intrusted the money in the prisoner's hands, was told by him, that every thing was done and ready, and nothing more was necessary, than that he should sign the acceptance, and have the receipt; Papps, therefore, went with him to the desk, where a book was produced, and an instrument laid before them, and in signing that, which Papps conceived was an acceptance of the stock, he did, in fact, put his signature to a transfer of 450 l. stock of his own; this instrument laying before him, and to which, without any hesitation, he immediately put his signature, had within it those marks which immediately caught his eye; among those was the name of J. Pierce, of the Stock Exchange: soon after this, the prisoner delivered to him a receipt, signed J. Pierce, for that money which he had entrusted the prisoner with; here then terminates the transaction. I do not at present call your attention to that imposition made on Mr. Papps, in getting his hand to the signature of the transfer; this is a species of fraud, about which we are not at present enquiring; but you will see at once the relation which the name of that transfer bears to the name signed to the receipt given to Papps; that transaction, therefore, I say, in itself, rests here. Now to the evidence of this transaction, so as compleatly to bring home the charge of forgery to the prisoner, it will be necessary for you to pay particular attention to the circumstances which I shall now state: Mr. Papps had been in intimacy with the prisoner at the bar for many, many years; he had transacted all the business for him at the Bank; and as the prisoner was well known to Mr. Papps, and as Mr. Papps was well known to the prisoner, it is impossible that any person can have imposed on the prisoner, assuming the person of Papps, where there was so intimate a knowledge of one and the other between the parties: Gentlemen, the instrument of transfer is further material in the present business; you will find the very signature as the witness to this transfer, is that of the prisoner; that of course links him immediately to this transaction, as being concerned for Papps, when he first persuaded him to sign this transfer; then Mr. Pierce will come before you, and tell<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150052"/>you, he was willing to become the purchaser of a share in the stock, if any such was to be disposed of; the prisoner having obtained this signature to the paper, was therefore enabled to proffer this as a proper transfer, in order to turn it over to Pierce, and to get Pierce's acceptance; in truth, he did so; but Mr. Pierce, being a man conversant in the transactions of the Bank, he, in consequence of seeing this transfer, at once signed his acceptance, and there was an end of the business, and Pierce himself had no receipt; but the subject on which we are at present enquiring, being the receipt put into the hands of Papps, purporting to be the receipt of J. Pierce; I say, the name instantly suggested itself to the prisoner; he instantly made use of the name of Pierce to sign to that receipt, which he was to turn over to Papps, as a satisfaction for the money Papps had paid into his hands: so far you see this transaction is then perfectly compleat; the prisoner's knowledge of Papps cannot be doubted; Papps, therefore, will come before you, and tell you, that he having engaged for this, he received this very receipt from the hands of the prisoner; Pierce will tell you, that on the same day he was at the Bank, and had the transaction I have related; that he never signed such receipt, and that it is a fabrication, and a forgery: Gentlemen, therefore, you perceive that the object of your enquiry lays within very small compass; but as it is always satisfactory that the minds of a jury should be made up from all the circumstances that attend the transaction, so I am ready to trust that on your view and consideration of every one circumstance, you will be enabled to make up your minds most compleatly, and without hesitation, that the crime imputed to the prisoner has been effected in the way I have described: now, gentlemen, with respect to the testimony, it appears to me that there cannot be a possible imputation upon any of the evidence which I shall call to you: Mr. Papps comes forward here to give his testimony against his ancient friend; at the same time, Mr. Papps has no interest in the present prosecution; indeed, I am anticipating those objections which can have no force, and therefore I stop and check myself: these gentlemen, when they tell you the simple transaction that I have explained to you, will, I trust, leave no doubt in your minds; as to the receipt given to Papps, and upon which it is the charge of forgery is now established, the very prisoner himself is a witness to that receipt: then, gentlemen, it seems to me, that the case is precluded from every possible observation; those little matters which now and then, indeed, arise in other cases, I think are totally shut out: but, if your minds were not compleatly satisfied on account of the receipt, it would still remain a forgery; and a forgery, as I conceive, proved, assuming that the witnesses will prove all I have related, whether they have a relation or not to that Mr. Pierce with whom the other transfer was transacted, for it still is a forgery by the prisoner; imposition, it is impossible to conceive, in the present case, being made by any person whatever; but, when you come to compare the two transactions together, and when you take into your consideration the result of that comparison, you must be persuaded that the mind of the prisoner was wickedly bent that morning, when Papps applied to him. Therefore, the trouble you will have in your attention to this case, will be short; the charge is confined to the simple circumstance of his having forged that receipt, and the evidence will lay in a very small compass. Gentlemen, lamentable it is, indeed, to see a person of the prisoner's appearance and description, standing at the bar, on a charge like this; it must, on the present occasion, and indeed it does, in the minds of a British Jury, excite emotions of compassion, and every tender feeling: and so far from wishing to interrupt the course, nay, the full indulgence of those feelings, the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, I am sure, will rejoice at every evidence of them; those feelings being at all times the best assurance of the faithful discharge of your respective duties, whether you consider<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150053"/>yourselves as citizens, or advert to that more important duty, which you are now to discharge as a jury of your country.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. You come here under expectation to have all that stock replaced of which you was possessed; do not you come here under a promise to have four hundred and fifty pounds replaced to you on condition of giving evidence against the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you not had that expressly intimated to you, that on condition of giving evidence against this man you should be replaced in this sum of four hundred and fifty pounds stock? - No.</p>
               <p>How then did you form the expectation of having this stock replaced to you? Have not you had hopes given you that you should have four hundred and fifty pounds, or some sum on condition of giving evidence on this trial? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean to say that there had been a bargain between you and the Bank? - No; none at all.</p>
               <p>That if you gave your evidence you should have your four hundred and fifty pounds again, and if not you should not? That you expect shall be replaced to you? - Yes, I hope so.</p>
               <p>Have you made your bargain with the Bank about that, and have you stipulated with them, that provided they will do that, you will then give evidence, and if they do not you will not give evidence? - Not from the Bank.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. From whom then was it that you had that hope given you; was it from any servant, any person employed by the Bank in any manner whatever.</p>
               <p>Court. Has there been any consideration between you and any body on the part of the Bank, respecting your giving your evidence in this case, making you any promises if you would do it? - No; none at all from the Bank.</p>
               <p>Do you know the solicitor of the Bank, Mr. Winter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it intimated by him? - Yes; he gave me some hopes of recovering it.</p>
               <p>Court. But was it on condition that you would give evidence on this trial? - Yes, my lord.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You perceive this four hundred and fifty pounds transfer is not immediately connected with any other indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. Suppose it is not, if this man will come here and say he expects four hundred and fifty pounds in money for giving his evidence, to be sure I shall reject his testimony.</p>
               <p>Did you make a bargain with the Solicitor? - No; I made no bargain at all.</p>
               <p>Did he on his part promise you, that if you would give the evidence then he would transfer to you? - He did not mention any such thing.</p>
               <p>Did he make it an express condition, that on condition of giving your evidence it should be replaced? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long? - Some years.</p>
               <p>During that time have you been very intimately acquainted with him? - Not very; he used to come backwards and forwards to my house.</p>
               <p>Did you ever employ him to do business in the Stocks for you? - Yes, as an acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Did you employ him to buy any stock for you in May, 1789? - Fifty pounds, four per cents.</p>
               <p>Did he undertake to do it? - Yes; and gave a receipt for it.</p>
               <p>How soon did you see him after this business? - Not for some time afterwards.</p>

               <p>When you wrote your name to that transfer book did you consider yourself writing your name to the transfer book or to the acceptance book? - I did not know it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150054"/>was a transfer book, I thought it had been an acceptance book.</p>

               <p>At the time you signed your name? - At the time I signed my name, and he put the figures on the back.</p>

               <p>How much did you receive for your dividend? - I received twelve pounds for six hundred and fifty pounds of Mr. Fonton.</p>
               <p>Was the dividend you received last Lady day the whole amount of your stock, suppose that four hundred and fifty pounds was standing there? - Yes.</p>

               <p>How came Fonton to pay you the dividend; was it his business? - He never paid me but twice; he used to give the dividend he said, to save me the trouble of waiting.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I would ask you whether you did not say yesterday, about five in the afternoon, to any body, that you had been promised by Mr. Winter, to have your four hundred and fifty pounds stock replaced, in case you gave evidence on this business, and all your expences, and that if you did not you would not? - No, there was nothing mentioned about expences; there were three gentlemen called upon me yesterday in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Did not you say to these three gentlemen, that you had been promised by Mr. Winter to have your four hundred and fifty pounds stock replaced, in case you gave evidence on this business, and all your expences, and that if you did not you would not; and that you would not have come if that promise had not been made? - No, I said no such thing; they called upon me about appearing against Mr. Fonton, and I told them I must appear, I could not do otherwise: I never made any such promise to any body.</p>
               <p>Did you relate to any body yesterday, that such conversation passed between Mr. Winter and you? - I did not say any such words as not appearing.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell them that you had a promise made you by Mr. Winter to have your four hundred and fifty pounds replaced, in case you gave evidence on this business, and if you did not you would not? - Mr. Winter said, he hoped it would be replaced, as I understood him; but I never made any agreement or bargain about it.</p>
               <p>Then did not you tell somebody yesterday, that Mr. Winter had promised you that the stock should be replaced if you appeared, and gave evidence on this trial? - No; not to the gentlemen that called yesterday.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell. What gentleman was that that called yesterday? - The gentleman is in court.</p>
               <p>Point out the man? - That gentleman is one that called, Mr. Slack.</p>
               <p>What did he call about? - He called about Mr. Fonton's affair; Mr. Slack mentioned to me to know if I should appear, and I told him I was obliged to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150055"/>What passed between you about it? - I cannot recollect very particular.</p>
               <p>Try; what did he want of you; what did he come to you about? - He came with intent like, as for me not to appear against him.</p>
               <p>What did he say to you on that subject? - I cannot recollect the very words.</p>
               <p>I do not want the very words, but the sense of them? - It was something concerning the not appearing against him.</p>
               <p>What was it? - It was, that if the money was replaced by any person, that I would not appear against him: I told him I was obliged to it.</p>
               <p>What more? - Nothing further that I can recollect: I said, I was obliged to come because I was subpoened to appear.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. You are Accomptant to the Bank of England? - Yes: I believe this to be the hand writing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Look at this transfer book; do you believe the name subscribed as witness to the transfer of Mr. Papps is the hand writing of the prisoner or not? - I do; the body of the receipt, which is not printed, and the filling up of the transfer, is his hand writing.</p>
               <p>JOHN PIERCE sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Queen-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields.</p>
               <p>I believe you are sometimes described of the Stock Exchange? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You do business there frequently? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Be so good as to look at the signature of that, is that your hand writing? - It is not.</p>
               <p>Did you on the day that appears to be dated have any such transfer as that receipt imports? - No.</p>
               <p>You did not transfer fifty pounds stock on that day to any body? - I do not know to any body, but not in his name.</p>
               <p>Did you sell any sum of fifty pounds stock to the prisoner Fonton on that day? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any transaction that you had respecting stock with the prisoner upon that day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>State what it was? - I bought four hundred and fifty pounds of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Look at this book and see whether that acceptance of a transfer belongs to you? - That was the four hundred and fifty pounds that was paid by me; the person who transacts business for me, who is in court, one Mr. Brown, paid it to Mr. Fonton.</p>
               <p>You gave directions to Mr. Brown?</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose you have other witnesses to prove that this is not the hand writing of another Mr. Pierce; because I doubt a little whether Mr. Pierce is a proper witness to prove his own hand writing.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect how you paid it? - I do not exactly; it was in cash and bank notes.</p>
               <p>Did you take a stock receipt from him? - No, Sir; I had no receipt.</p>
               <p>Do these kind of transactions frequently pass between the brokers without receipts? - Very frequently in the multiplicity of business: we see the transfer is made.</p>
               <p>Did you on this occasion satisfy yourself that the transfer was made to your principal? - Yes; I was satisfied of that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Then you do not consider the receipt as absolutely necessary among yourselves? - Not as a jobber.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Pierce. Did you take any receipt on this occasion? - No.</p>
               <p>How happened that? - Oh, we frequently do them without a receipt; I went and looked at the books, to see if there was any transfer.</p>
               <p>How long have you known the prisoner? - A great number of years.</p>
               <p>Are you acquainted with the character of his hand-writing? - I have seen it frequently, because I have a great number of receipts of his.</p>
               <p>Look at that receipt? - I believe it to be his.</p>
               <p>Look at the written part of the body of the transfer: do you believe that to be his? - Yes, I believe it is his.</p>

               <p>Look at the body of that receipt; is that the hand-writing of Fonton? - Yes.</p>

That, whereas, that receipt expresses that this was received for the consideration of fifty pounds, transferred by Pierce to him; there is no transfer by any Pierce to him of that sum; and it is witnessed by you, the body of it; and therefore you are now called upon to satisfy the jury, if you can, how you came to put into the hands of Mr. Papps, such a false receipt.</p>

               <p>Court. If his witnesses should happen not to be here, he certainly will suffer nothing by that means, because the circumstance of his having been employed seventeen years and upwards, at the Bank, is a decisive evidence of his good character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Edwards. I have known him eighteen years; he has always borne the character of a punctual orderly well-behaved man, very inoffensive in his manners; so much so, that he would have been one of the last in the house that, I should have thought capable of such a transaction.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five more witnesses who gave him an exceeding good character.</p>

On the 14th of August, we had occasion to employ many men; I locked the stair-foot door of the building about half past seven; they had done work; I locked the door on purpose to search the men when they came down, to see if there was any had taken any sugar; we searched them one by one; the prisoner was up stairs as one; I thought he had some sugar concealed in his breeches; I searched him in the compting-house, and found a handkerchief of sugar in his breeches; I challenged him with it, and took it from him, and kept him till I fetched an officer; and he was committed; I weighed the sugar; it was six pounds.</p>
               <p>Was it possible to have taken it in, and worked with it? - I think not; he could get at the sugar; it was two story below where he was working.</p>

               <p>I live with Lovell and Curtis, wholesale hosiers, in Wood-street. On Thursday, the 22d of July, about two, I was passing the house of the prosecutor; accidentally, on turning round my eyes, I observed a hand rush into the window, in the inside, where there were some stockings; and that hand

             some stockings from the window, which I have in this basket; that person was the prisoner Brown; I am sure of it; I waited to see if he made a second attempt, but he did not; I then went into the house, and he had this basket in his hand; I have kept it ever since; these are the stockings I took from him; I asked him what he had in the basket? he made no answer, but seemed quite astonished. With respect to the woman prisoner, she was standing between two gentlemen, who were serving by the last witness, quite to her obstruction: and the man was secreted behind her: it was morally impossible for her to see the man. Mr. Burgher went to Bow-street for an officer: he searched Brown, and found nothing in his pocket but a nail: he then searched the prisoner

               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner Smith's Counsel. The woman was standing near the counter, as close as she could, by the two gentlemen? - Yes.</p>

               <p>You had no difficulty in seeing the stockings taken? - Not the least.</p>
               <p>They were not taken slily? - It was entirely slily to the person that was serving.</p>

               <p>You say the prisoner Brown was secreted behind the woman? - Yes: where he stood was close against the window: the two gentlemen were nearly close to the window, not so close as he was: the woman was standing in a direct line with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any conversation between the woman and the man, the two prisoners? - None.</p>
               <p>How was the prisoner secreted behind the woman? - I only mean to say that the woman stood before the man.</p>
               <p>Did the woman stand otherwise than any other two persons would have done? - I do not directly say to secret him, only in imagination.</p>
               <p>(The stockings deposed to by Mrs. Bridges, being marked A. in the foot.)</p>
               <p>They are the property of Mr. Burgher; I saw them in the window not five minutes before the prisoners came in: the value of them under valued at eight shillings a pair, is thirty-nine shillings and six-pence.</p>

               <p>Prisoner to prosecutor. How did you come by the pigeon that you cut the nail off? - I bought it of Mr. Kemp, about two years ago.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I bred that pigeon two years ago, and better; I sold that pigeon a dozen times, and it has come home to me.</p>

               <p>I am a headborough; I apprehended the prisoner, on Thursday, the 19th of August; the prisoner said, I hope you will speak to the prosecutor as well as you can; I said, I would speak to him; I asked him what became of the rest of the pigeons; he said, he had only these thirteen pigeons; the gentleman declared then that he had fifteen; I understood him fifteen; I am not positive either fifteen or fourteen; but I am pretty sure he said about thirteen; and if the prosecutor would let him go, he would be bound to fetch the other three; but he would suffer death if he would otherwise.</p>

               <p>On Wednesday morning my wife was taken very ill; she was with child; I wanted to make a little money; I sold some pigeons; I went to work; in the evening, when I came home, they said Mr. Merryman and a constable had been at my house two or three times, enquiring for me; I said, if he wanted me, he must come to me in the morning; I went and fetched some peppermint for my wife; I came home again, and cut my allowance of victuals, and went to go to work, and this constable took me.</p>

               <p>There were several other counts laying it in different ways.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Counsel for the Prosecution, informed the Court, that, after a very accurate attention, he found he could not support the present indictment, and that there was another indictment presented, and found for a misdemeanor.</p>
               <p>Lord Chief Baron. I must take notice of a circumstance which has now twice occurred in the course of this sessions, that is, of indictments being preferred at the same time for a capital offence and for a misdemeanor; I do not think it is a proper course; I think it may produce many inconveniences; I think the capital case should always be entirely disposed of, and that the question, whether a conviction should be founded afterwards for a misdemeanor, should depend a great deal on the sense and judgment of the court; but to have them both found at the same time is abominable; the jury cannot with propriety find two at the same time, and I desire that the officer will understand, that as far as my judgment goes, bills for capital offences, and for misdemeanors, on the same case, should not be prepared at the same time; and I desire notice may be sent to Hicks's Hall, that the Court has taken notice of such practice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Grose. They never can be properly found to be sure.</p>

               <p>Had you such observation of him to say that you can safely and positively swear to him? - Yes; I am positive that is the man that robbed me.</p>

               <p>The fair was very full, I suppose? - There was nobody pushing about but them; I bid them go, and they would not.</p>
               <p>Was the pushing violent or not? - He forced very much against me in the front.</p>
               <p>Were there not many people behind him? - I was behind him: my watch was very tight in; the pocket was torn out in taking out my watch.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am wife of the last witness; my husband had some business in Cow-lane, and I had a mistress in Foster-lane: my husband and me went through the fair on account of buying some toys; we were in the middle of the fair, and there was a mob of people came round us, and three in particular attacked us; they came up to my husband, and pushed him one way and me the other, and I said to my husband, for God's sake take care of that man, for he is robbing you; that was the prisoner, though in a different dress; but his features are very remarkable; he took my husband and hove him up by the hips, and the other hove him by the arms; he had hold of his breeches and waistcoat at the same time he pulled out the watch (that said gentleman) and my husband, and me, both flew at him, and we called for assistance; I saw the watch in his hand, and likewise a piece of my husband's pocket; he pulled something out of his waistcoat pocket, and stabbed my husband three times, and me in my arm; we held him; my husband's hat was pulled off his head; and he let him go, and catched him again: I was kicked down into the kennel, and my cloak torn from my back, and my handkerchief; I scrabbled at the cloak, and some men came to our assistance, pretending they would take care of them; two of them had soldiers coats; I saw them men come up afterwards; they pretended<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150077"/>to take care of him; and we saw them take him some way.</p>
               <p>Before the prisoner laid hold of your husband had you made any observation of him? - Before they came to my husband I saw three of them playing; the prisoner was one; I saw him half an hour before he robbed us, and about us; I saw him in the whole for three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>When you first observed the prisoner had he a hat on? - He had; but when they took him away he had not.</p>
               <p>Was it a round or a cocked hat? - A round hat, bound particularly about the brim.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that the prisoner is positively the man? - I should not swear positively if I had not held him so long a time; I looked so much at him, and begged him for mercy's sake to give me the watch again: I saw the prisoner since at Guildhall: he was in a different dress, the next day but one: I went with my husband, and we met him as he came out of the Compter; he was handcuffed: I saw nobody but him: the first day he had a light coloured coat, and the morning, at the Compter, he had an old black coat, and much disguised; but his features are so remarkable, I knew him again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. I suppose his features are the most remarkable you ever saw? - He was remarkable to me; I should know him in twenty different dresses: I know him perfectly well: the two men lifted him up under each arm, and the prisoner was in front: the watch has never been found again.</p>
               <p>Had you ever been in that fair before? - No; I never gave my mind to such places.</p>
               <p>Before you went to the magistrates your husband had told you he had taken the man that robbed him? - Yes; or else we had no business to go.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean that the prisoner standing in front, and one of the men lifted him under each arm, or that the two men lifted him? - The prisoner was too busy at work in robbing my husband of his watch: the prisoner at the time he took the watch heaved up my husband by the waistband, and the other two men lifted him under the arms.</p>

I said I was willing; he tore my coat right open; they searched all my pockets, and no watch was found; the mob insisted on his letting me go; and I walked away; I staid in the fair an hour or two; the next day the man caught hold of me, and said, you are the rascal that has got my watch, value 4 l. and I will do for you, and get forty pounds, and that will buy me another.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. When this woman came up to you, what did she say to you? - She said, my dear, how do you do? and fell a bugging me; and in three minutes she took and robbed me: she snatched out my watch: I endeavoured to prevent her; and then she knocked me backwards: I tried to push her from me, to guard myself: they had got the watch before the blow was struck.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Brown. Did you see me at the pawnbrokers? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Jupp. They were both at the door together: I think he must have seen the woman.</p>
               <p>Brown. I was not at the pawnbroker's at that time: I was there about eight or nine in the morning: I did not notice any woman at the door.</p>
               <p>Jupp. The constable was not there till night; the prosecutor was there with another constable in the morning, and with this constable at night.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What do you say to that? - I was there never but once, till the day before yesterday: the first time, I was there with the man where I lodged, and the constable: I was only there at one time.</p>
               <p>Court to Jupp. How often was the coachman there? - I believe he was there twice.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of it? - Yes: he was there twice: first of all he came there with some of Mr. Hyde's officers, from St. Martin's-street, about the watch: he came to my master, and begged leave to look at the watch, upon which he took the watch (that officer is not here) and put it into his pocket: says he, this is my property: my master asked him what he meant to do with it? and he said, to keep it: so my master sent me immediately to Mr. Hyde's, and one of Mr. Hyde's runners went along with me to this court to see for

               <p>Elliott. Brown never went with me; I went by myself.</p>
               <p>Court to Brown. Did you ever go with Elliott to the pawnbroker? - Only once in the morning part; that was between eight and nine in the morning of the 19th.</p>
               <p>Court to Jupp. How is that? - I do not know rightly whether the man did come in the night or in the morning.</p>
               <p>But are you sure whether Brown was there once or twice? - He was there with the runners, on the 18th, in the morning, between eight and nine; and he was there on the 19th, in the evening.</p>
               <p>Was he at your house once or twice? - Twice; I think he was with Elliott on the 19th; and he was there without Elliott.</p>
               <p>Jury. What kind of a woman was Williams? - Rather a broad faced woman.</p>
               <p>Was she such a sort of a woman as this? - A middling sized woman.</p>

               <p>I am widow of the deceased: I saw nothing of the accident; he was conveyed to my house on Friday: he said he was very ill-used by the young man of the turnpike: that he came running after him, and hit him a violent blow with the key over the eye, which knocked him down directly; and then he said the young man said he had done for the Jew: he was attended by one Mr. Vannoven: he died on the Wednesday after the Friday that he was removed.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon. I saw the deceased on Saturday morning after the accident: I found him laying on the bed in a state nearly delirious; that is to say, that he answered rationally to my questions, but occasionally at random: when I asked him any question beyond the first idea, I could get no answer: I asked him as to the accident, and he said he was struck by the man at the turnpike gate: I then examined his head; and while I was about it, he complained of great pain withinside his head: I found no fracture, but a vast deal of contusion about both eyes: the left eye particularly was very black indeed: the right eye appeared to have lost the sight: I found he could not see: I apprehended some injury to the brain: he was treated by every means that we can suggest on such occasions; and on Wednesday morning he died. On Thursday the coroner desired me to open the head: I wished them to send for another gentleman: they sent for Mr. Bliss, the surgeon of the work-house: I opened it alone: he came in at the latter end of the operation; and we found in the pasces of the scull, the bottom immediately above the orbit of the eye, a quantity of congealed blood, the consequence of his death, and the loss of sight, it must have been evidently occasioned by some external injury.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing at all to say.</p>
               <p>- BARNEY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon, at Sudbury. I attended this man after he came from the hospital: he came to me on Sunday, the 11th of July, with a large wound in his leg; from his mode of behaviour, from his conversation, and in a word, the whole line of his conduct, it was such, that I judged him at that time, a lunatic: I continued to see him daily from that time: but the 17th, when I found there was no doing any thing with him, and that he was a dangerous man to society, I recommended him to be got into St. Luke's: and till then to be conveyed to Mr. Harrison's private mad-house: that I would fill up certificates, and get a friend in town to sign them, and to take them with him: the certificates were, that in my judgment, he was a lunatic: after that, he was a little more peaceable for a few days: his father, I understood, was out on business, and there was no conveyance for taking him: his leg got better, and he continued under my care, in order that he might be got into St. Luke's: he continued with his leg getting considerably better, till this accident happened: but I have no doubt in the world of his being a lunatic: for I had filled up the necessary certificates ten days previous to this.</p>
               <p>Court. When was the last time that you saw him? - I saw him on the Sunday and Monday before; the day before.</p>

               <p>You then judged him to be in the same state? - Undoubtedly; and I particularly recommended his being taken to the madhouse;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150085"/>and I desired his friends to take every care of him: in his conversation he was perpetually threatening them, particularly his mother.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, if I saw the least reason in the world to hesitate about this, I would go on: but I think it is such a clear case of lunacy, I think we may with perfect confidence rely upon it, that he was a lunatic at the time the fact was committed; if so, it is to no purpose to continue it.</p>
               <p>The Court ordered the prisoner to be detained till an order for removing him to a proper place.</p>

               <p>Did the prisoner call out to you? - No, Sir, he never saw me, I believe; I only observed he had a large nosegay in his hand; a person called to me, and I turned, and the horses were within four yards of me; I did not think they were so near; I did not see the accident; I was in a shop when it happened.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Did you know the deceased gentlemen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was a very old man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Extremely deaf? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I have heard he was so deaf, that if a gun had been discharged at his ear, he would not have heard it? - I do not know that; I never spoke to him in my life.</p>
               <p>Court. You said, this was a pretty wide road? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any foot path on either side, and on which side? - Yes, on the right hand, where I was.</p>
               <p>Was there any path on the other side of the road? - Yes, where the gentleman was.</p>
               <p>Did the accident happen after you went into this shop? - It happened while I was in the shop.</p>
               <p>How wide was the horse-road, at the place where you left the dray? - It was pretty wide; very wide; about two carriages might go.</p>
               <p>When you left the road, was there any people in the road? - I saw nobody at all.</p>
               <p>Were there any other horses in carriages? - No, I did not see one.</p>
               <p>The dray was going the same way you was going? - No, I met the dray.</p>
               <p>Did you look after it? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see any people in the road, in the way you was going? - I met the gentleman about three minutes before I saw the dray.</p>
               <p>Was he in the horse road, or in the foot road? - He was in no path at all; he was just against the side of the horse road, on one side.</p>
               <p>Not in the patside? - When I met the dray there was a path on the right hand.</p>
               <p>Was the gentleman going the same way as the dray was? - Yes, he was.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a labouring man; on Whit-Monday, the 24th of May, at Lampton, I was wheeling a barrow to London towards my own house, and I saw the deceased, about eighteen yards from the place where the accident happened, and about thirteen yards off, on the right hand, the dray came by me; the dray was on the trot.</p>
               <p>A slow or a fast trot? - I did not mind; the prisoner was either on the shaft or carriage, I cannot say which; his back was towards me, his face towards the horses; he was looking, I believe, towards the near side of the dray, and when I had gone about eighteen yards, to the best of my remembrance, I heard the prisoner cry whoy, sharply; I looked back, and saw the gentleman either under the carriage, or under the horses, at that distance I could not say which; I ran back, and saw the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150089"/>endeavouring to pull back the horses; I picked up the gentleman from the wheel, and I believe the prisoner had pulled back his horses; when I came back the prisoner was by his horse; he came round as soon as he could; the gentleman was then speechless; I said, you have killed my master; I heard him make no answer; the drayman came round to my assistance, to the off side, where the gentlemen was; the gentleman was very much hurt; I believe the wheel went over his left leg, and I believe the driver, in pulling the dray back, put it over the same leg again, to the best of my knowledge; there was the appearance of blood; I assisted in taking the gentlemen home; he died the Wednesday night following; he lay in the off rut, nearer to the foot road on the right hand side.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. He lay in the rut of the off wheel of the dray? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you never said that the prisoner answered that he did not see the gentleman till he was down; that he was extremely sorry for the accident, and that he had not intended it? - He did seem to be very sorry for the accident.</p>
               <p>But did not he say so instantly? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>You was examined before the coroner? - Yes; on Saturday, the day he was buried.</p>
               <p>Of course at that time all the circumstances and conversations were fresh in your memory? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Fresher than they are now? - I do not know that I have studied more about.</p>
               <p>You said nothing before the coroner but what was true? - Not to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>The driver was looking to the left side? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The gentleman met with the accident by the driver's right side; the first you heard of the accident was by the prisoner calling whoy! sharply: you did not say any thing of driving this wheel over the leg a second time? - I was not asked.</p>
               <p>You do not mean to impute that he did it wilfully? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>This old gentleman had the misfortune of being extremely deaf? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you say, you believed if a gun was let off close to him he would not have heard the report of it? - I did say so; and I think so now.</p>
               <p>Was any body in the road? - Not for some time.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you meet a young woman? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you recollect whether the prisoner did not say whether he had seen the deceased before or not? - I heard him say he saw him some distance before.</p>
               <p>Do recollect; because I have the deposition you made before the coroner, and it is very material you should be consistent: did not you say before the coroner, that he said, he did not see the deceased till he was down? - I do not remember I said so.</p>
               <p>Did not you say that he expressed much sorrow for the accident? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I work for my father-in-law; he keeps the Black Horse, at Lampton; I was there the 24th of May: I saw the horse down on his knees, and somebody down too; I saw the dray before that just by Mr. Raper's house.</p>
               <p>How far was that from the place where the accident happened? - About thirty yards: I saw him on the dray towards the near shaft: I did not mind where the prisoner was when I saw the horse on his knees; there were two horses: it was a long trot: I did not see the gentleman before: I heard the prisoner cry out whoey, three or four times; then I ran up; the gentleman was down, and his head cut, and blood on his head; he was nearest towards the foot path, which was on the right hand side of the dray, which was the off side of the dray.</p>
               <p>How long might it be between the time of your seeing the dray, and hearing the cry of whoey? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did you assist in taking the gentleman to his house? - No; I went for the surgeon.</p>

               <p>I live at Hounslow: I was sent for on occasion of the accident of Mr. Rogers; I believe it was the 24th of May, between four and five in the afternoon; on examining him, I found the cuticle of the right hand tore away; and the bones lay bare; on examining the head, I found that the skin of the face, on the right side, was likewise torn off, and his scull laid bare on the head; upon examining the left cheek, I found both the bones were broke, and very large lacerated wounds on that leg, so that the points of the bones were discoverable; and on the right leg there was a very large contusion; from this accident, I apprehended him in great danger of a mortification; and he continued extremely ill till the Wednesday; and in the afternoon, or evening, he died; I knew him before, very well; he was an elderly gentleman, about seventy; he was in very good health before; I have no doubt in the world but that accident was the occasion of his death.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the old gentleman very deaf? - Very deaf; he was always written to; he could not hear at any rate.</p>

               <p>With respect to his humanity and good nature, what was his character? - A very good one; I know nothing to the contrary; he was always a very careful servant.</p>
               <p>Was he a good natured man? - Very good humoured.</p>
               <p>I believe, after he had been taken up, and the coroner's inquisition was over, he was discharged? - Yes.</p>

               <p>The indictment opened by Mr. Garrow. And the case by Mr. Fielding, as follows:</p>
               <p>May it please your lordship. Gentlemen of the jury, your attention you perceive is now called to a capital charge, namely that of forgery: the commissioners of the customs, who are servants of the publick, in a very high department, have found it their duty to submit the present prosecution to you: before I state to you the particular circumstances of that transaction, which has involved the prisoner in the guilt now imputed to him, it will be proper that I should state to you those circumstances upon which the present crime has been established: so long ago as the year 1768 the commissioners of the customs made an order that a certain class of men, called extra tidesmen, occasionally employed by the customs, when employed on board ships, as their employ would necessarily confine them there, that they should be allowed ten shillings and sixpence a week; that this provision might reach their families, and in order to enable those families to receive this money, or themselves, if absent from on board ship, that they might receive the money, they were to produce certificates of the register of the customs, of their having been so employed; and, that on the production of such certificate, they should be enabled to receive it. Gentlemen, the prisoner at the bar most undoubtedly knew of this order of the Board of Customs; he knew that there were printed instruments containing the form of the certificate, and the form of the receipt; he had contrived to provide himself with one of those papers, and on the 19th of June it was, that he, being at the Custom-house, saw there a young man of the name of Smith, who will be called to you as a witness; this young man appearing to be disengaged, he immediately accosted him, and told him, if he would go up to the pay-master's board, and receive such a sum of money as the certificate imported, to be easily received, he would give him a penny for his trouble: then it was he put into the possession of the lad the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150095"/>two papers, one of which you will have in your presence; the boy went to the pay-master; he saw a Mr. Simmonds; he presented to him the paper; it was a certificate to this effect; the paper has these words,</p>
               <p>"Custom-house, London, June</p>
               <p>"the 19th, 1790. This is to certify, that</p>

            ; it would therefore purport that this was the signature of a John Skirrow, who had been an extra tidesmam, and entitled to board's allowance; now in fact it turns out upon looking over the board's list, that no such person is in existence as 
               <persName id="t17900915-78-person763">

            ; first here is the fabrication of Mr. Irwin's name, which is material to the present prosecution, resting merely on the publishing the forged receipt; there being no such person as John Skirrow does not at all alter the nature of the crime; if there had, and his name had been fabricated, then there would have been a different mean of ascertaining the guilt of the prisoner; but there being no such person does not at all alter the nature of the offence. Gentlemen, you see, therefore, the simple charge is, that he has forged this receipt, or uttered it, knowing it to be forged; the money he was to obtain by means of this forgery is, it is very true, most insignificant; but it is of the utmost importance, as these matters have happened before this time, that an example should be made for the sake of the publick, of that person who has committed his sort of offence: now as to the other part of the charge, that this was uttered with intention to defraud the receiver general, there cannot be a doubt; if the receiver general, or his clerk, had paid this money, he would have paid it in his own wrong; but it is sufficient, if the intention to defraud should be made manifest to you: therefore you see the complexion of this business; this man knowing well there was a possibility of imposing on the commissioners of the customs, and of imposing on the pay-master, has presented this to them with a view to defraud the receiver general.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, now it is proper I should state to you the sort of evidence you will have in the present case, and the manner in which you will bestow your deliberation on this testimony: I have already told you this man, when at the Custom-house, did apply to a youth of the name of Smith; he went to Mr. Simmonds, the clerk, who contented himself at that time with desiring the boy to produce the person; the boy went down stairs in order to find the prisoner; he did find him there; and told him, that the clerk desired he would come up himself, and receive the money; upon which, without any hesitation, he immediately seemed going up stairs; the boy was following him into the room; but, as he went somewhat quicker than the boy, before the lad had reached the top of the stairs, he met him running down; he ran past him without saying a word; and it was not till some time after this that the prisoner was apprehended by the boy, in company with a friend; seeing him afterwards, he said, that was the man that had desired him to take up the instrument; of course he was taken into custody; you will see therefore that the publishing this instrument was first to the boy, that the boy carried it up stairs to Simmonds, and you of course should watch that boy's testimony, and examine into it; you will see the manner in which he departs himself; the circumstance of the man's (if the boy tells true, and whether he does or not will be for you to determine) going up stairs and running down hastily again will determine that, if you shall think the boy intitled to credit; then the crime will be compleat on the part of the prisoner; for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150096"/>the moment he gave this receipt to this young man to carry up for this purpose, he in truth uttered it, knowing it to be a forgery, with intent to defraud the receiver general of the customs: therefore, gentlemen, you are now in possession of that testimony which you will have more particularly laid before you: you will be aided likewise with the particular attention of his lordship, in a case like the present: if you find that the boy is deserving of credit in the transaction, you can have no doubt on the present business; and I take the liberty of suggesting to you now, that though the sum is small, yet I trust that your understandings are infinitely of too sober a kind to be at all led astray from your duty, by considering the insignificancy of the sum to be obtained; if there should be in the case any of those circumstances that should intitle the man to a consideration of his majesty, he will undoubtedly consider that circumstance, whether it be proper or not that his royal mercy should be extended to the man; but with respect to the smallness of the sum, with respect to a publick body, these certificates are so numerous; there are a great many of them at the board; and if it could be committed with impunity there would be too much of that which is too often committed in those societies.

               <p>What is your department? - I am the clerk appointed by the receiver general, to pay the inferior officers.</p>
               <p>I believe you have there a paper that imports to be a certificate respecting one Skirrow? - I have.</p>
               <p>Look at it; is that the printed form used on all occasions? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It comes to you, signed by Mr. Irwin, the register of these men? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Be so good as to tell us when, and from whom you received this certificate of Skirrow's? - This certificate was presented to me by a lad, whose name I since understood to be

            , at my office; and the name of John Skirrow being a strange name, I suspected the note was not a good one; I desired the lad to tell the person who gave him the note, to come up and receive it himself.</p>
               <p>Had he said any thing of any such person? - I asked the lad, who sent the note? and he said a man on the stairs; the boy went away to desire the man to come; I kept possession of the certificate; he brought another of them at the same time.</p>
               <p>Did the boy or any body else return to you upon that? - They did not return for some time; but an hour afterwards the lad came and said the man was run away.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you saw the prisoner? - It was a month afterwards, before I saw the prisoner at the bar, not till he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of him, what he was? - He was an officer employed in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150097"/>customs; and I have frequently seen him in the office.</p>
               <p>What was his department: what had he ever been? - Extra tide-waiter.</p>
               <p>Was he at that time an extra tide-waiter? - He was.</p>
               <p>Had he any allowance like that which is made to these men? - Exactly the same as this certificate purports.</p>
               <p>Then the prisoner was acquainted with the mode by which this money was received? - I should suppose so, Sir, as the had often received it himself.</p>
               <p>Are you acquainted with Mr. Irwin's writing? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Look at that, and see if it is Mr. Irvin's writing? - It is so like it that I cannot say whether it is or not; but I should have paid upon it.</p>

            , whose name it bears, in the employ? - There is no such person in the employ.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. How are you able to ascertain that there is no such person as John Skirrow in the employ: do: you recollect that from any writing, any book? - No, I do not, Sir: but I never knew any person of that name.</p>
               <p>Do you keep any list of such persons? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Is there no such lift kept in the Custom-house? - Yes, in the office of the register I did not know myself; but I enquired of the register.</p>
               <p>Then you do not know only by the register, that there was no such person? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you been in this office long? - Four years.</p>
               <p>Is it common for persons who are intitled to this money, to sign a receipt, and pay it away as cash? - It has been practised, I understand.</p>
               <p>I suppose, if a person ever so much a stranger to you, was to come and produce the receipt of a man that you knew to be a tide-waiter, when you saw his hand, unless you had any doubt about it, you would pay it to any stranger that brought the receipt, should not you? - I should, my lord.</p>
               <p>In short, I suppose, among those sort of people, and wives, or the children, or the creditors, that have such a receipt, in them to the money that was to be paid?</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Now, my little man, do you remember being in the Custom-house on the 19th of June? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How far is that from your father's house? - My father's house is facing it.</p>
               <p>What time of day was it when you saw the prisoner at the bar there? - Between twelve and one.</p>
               <p>Look at him now; is that the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Tell my lord, and the gentlemen of the jury opposite to you, what he said to you, and desired you to do? - As I was coming down stairs, he gave me two notes, and said if I took them up and got the money, he would give me a penny.</p>
               <p>What were the very words he said to you? - He said, my man, if you take they two notes up to the pay-master, and get the money for them, I will give you a penny.</p>
               <p>What did you do with those two notes? - I went up stairs to Mr. Simmons.</p>
               <p>Which is Mr. Simmons? - This is the gentleman, (pointing to him.)</p>
               <p>Did you give that same paper into the hands of Mr. Simmons, that you received from the prisoner at the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you say to him when you gave him the two notes? - I gave him the two notes, and he asked me who gave them to me? - I said, a man on the stairs.</p>
               <p>What did he desire you then to do? - He told me to go down stairs and desire the man to come up to him.</p>
               <p>Then you went from Mr. Simmons to look after the man? - Yes; I went down,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150098"/>and he was about two or three steps lower than he was when I first met him.</p>
               <p>What did you say to him? - I told him to go to Mr. Simmons himself; he went up very nigh the office door, and came running down again.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing to you when he passed you? - No.</p>
               <p>When you described him as coming running down again, was he in haste? - Yes; he was.</p>
               <p>He was running then in haste down stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He got out of your sight then? - Yes; I went home, and went to school in the afternoon, as usual.</p>
               <p>Did you call to him to stop? - No: I did not.</p>
               <p>What did you do then? - I went home; and the next day my father came to me, and said something about two notes.</p>
               <p>Did you go back to Mr. Simmons? - No; not that same day.</p>
               <p>Did you go back to Mr. Simmons? - I went to Mr. Simmons then, and then he asked me about these two notes; and then he asked me if I should know the man again; and I said, yes.</p>
               <p>Did any thing more pass between Mr. Simmons and you than that? - No; I went down stairs again.</p>
               <p>When was it that you happened to see the man again? - About a month afterwards; I saw him leaning against one of the pillars at the Custom-house door.</p>
               <p>What did you do upon that? - I went and told my father; and then he told me to go up to the paymaster and tell him; I went up and told him, and Mr. Simmons came down with me; then I shewed him the man.</p>
               <p>Did you tell Mr. Simmons that that was the man who had given you these notes? - Yes, Sir, I did.</p>
               <p>Now are you sure that is the man? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen him before? - I never saw him before he gave me the notes in my life.</p>
               <p>But you are sure that is the man? - Yes, I am positive that is the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding to Mr. Simmons. Is that the little boy that brought you the notes? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>He came to you the next day? - I do not recollect whether it was the next day or the same day.</p>
               <p>To Smith. Are you sure it was the second day, my little man? - Yes; I am sure it was the second day.</p>
               <p>To Simmons. Did you mention any thing of it? - I immediately went to the register's-office to see if it was Mr. Irwin's signature.</p>
               <p>Did you enquire after the boy? - Yes; I saw him, and desired him if he saw the man again to let me or somebody know.</p>
               <p>Had you said any thing that could come particularly to his father? - Not to his father particularly: his father was a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>To Smith. How came your father to desire you to go? - I do not know, I am sure; but he said, Mr. Simmons told him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe your father generally carries those sort of receipts? - Yes, he does.</p>
               <p>What does he charge for that? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You have sometimes I believe been employed by your father to take those kind of receipts? - Yes; I have.</p>
               <p>Then it is not the first transaction of the kind by a great many? - No, Sir, it is not.</p>
               <p>You have done so very frequently before? - Yes, Sir, I have.</p>
               <p>Therefore having receipts given you to take for payment was not at all a particular thing to you? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Then you did not go back to Mr. Simmons, and tell him that the man you was sent after did not come back? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You thought there was nothing particular in it of course, or else you would have gone back to him and told him? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>And you did not see the person that gave you the receipt for a month? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150099"/>And you never saw him before? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. The other receipts which you have at different tines carried up to the pay-master, are those you have received from your father? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then other people have employed you to carry up these instruments? - Yes; but not from strangers.</p>
               <p>But having been there at the office before you accepted this employ of the prisoner? - Yes; I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Smith. Did Mr. Simmons offer you any thing if you could find the man? - No, Sir; he did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he tell you you must find the man? - No, Sir; he did not.</p>
               <p>When did he speak to you about it? - The next day.</p>
               <p>Was there any noise about it? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Nothing said about it? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Your father was not angry with you for taking up this receipt? - To the best of my recollection, I cannot say he was.</p>
               <p>Why do you say to the best of your recollection?</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Do you hear my lord. Why do you say to the best of your recollection? are you sure he was not angry with you? - No, Sir, I am not.</p>
               <p>And when you saw this man again in a month's time, you made the immediate discovery, that you told us of? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. You never saw this man before this day that you had the notes from him, till he was taken up? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Simmons. Was it you, or one of the other witnesses that told me, that the prisoner at the bar was a tide-waiter? - I said he was a tide-waiter.</p>
               <p>Of course then he was backwards and forwards from the time that this note was offered to you to the time he was taken up: did you see him? - I do not recollect whether he was at the office or not; it did not lay with me at all.</p>
               <p>CLAUDIAS SMITH sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You live near the Custom-house? - I do.</p>
               <p>When did you first hear that the boy had been with those notes that were questioned? - I cannot exactly say the day of the month; but I sent up my son with two other notes for two watermen, that use my house, and he brought me the money, the two half guineas; that was the same day as this; there was nothing peculiar in the day; I did not hear of the boy getting those two notes for the prisoner, till the prisoner was gone; I was informed that Mr. Simmons wanted to speak to me, and I went up the next day to Mr. Simmons.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you hear that Mr. Simmons wanted to speak to you? - The afternoon of the same day that the boy had been to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was that the first that you heard relating at all to these notes, or the boy's concern in it? - It was the first I heard; I did not know Mr. Simmons's business till I went up; I went to Mr. Simmons.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Your house is directly opposite the Custom-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The persons that belong to the Custom-house must be in the sight of your house very much? - Most certainly.</p>

            , for whom you gave that receipt, or from the writing itself? - There is a difference in the I, that I am convinced it is not my hand writing.</p>
               <p>Then if any person had put that receipt<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150100"/>into your hands, you would have said at once it was not yours? - I should have had my doubts at first; but on a further inspection, I should have been convinced it was not mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you always fill up the person's name? - No; they are brought to me ready filled up; I constantly examine them by the alphabetical list of the tide-waiters.</p>
               <p>Therefore you never could have signed that by mistake? - No; I could not.</p>
               <p>You say that the prisoner at that time was a tide-waiter? - He was.</p>
               <p>Was he the person for whom it was your duty to certify? - Certainly; he could not get it without.</p>
               <p>So that he knew the method of such business? - I have signed a great many for him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Pray did not you, before the Lord Mayor, say you could not tell whether it was your hand writing or not? - No; I did not say them words; I said, I should have had my doubts at first; but on a closer inspection I was convinced it was not mine; and I likewise mentioned the examining them by the alphabetical list.</p>
               <p>Are the tide-waiters very numerous? - Very much so.</p>
               <p>Do you keep a list of them? - Of every one.</p>
               <p>Have you brought that list with you? - No.</p>
               <p>It is not in Court? - It is not.</p>
               <p>You say you have examined the list; do you speak only from the list, that there is no man of the name of Skirrow there? - I know that there is no such person existing as a tide-waiter of the name of Skirrow.</p>
               <p>Can you take upon you to say that without reference to the list? - Yes, I can; because I have examined it several times.</p>
               <p>This man has been a tide-waiter for six years? - I do not know how long a time.</p>
               <p>They of course are about the Custom-house frequently? - Certainly; it is their duty to be about there.</p>

I lost all my money last Sunday four weeks, between nine and ten at night, at the sign of the Virginia Planter; I had been in there getting a little beer, and I gave her a part of a pint of beer, or two pints, I believe there was; I was at a chandler's shop, and the prisoner followed me to the Virginia Planter, and I gave her part of a pint or two of beer, and a quartern of gin; I paid for my beer, and pulled out my purse, and was going out, and put my purse into my coat pocket, my breeches pocket not being so handy; the prisoner looked at the purse in my hand, but I did not think she wanted to take it away from me; just as I opened the door I felt somebody at my pocket, and I saw my purse in her hand, and she set off; and she did run at such a rate, nothing could be like it, till she got among a gang of thieves, and the gang of thieves tumbled me about, and took a silk handkerchief out of my pocket, and all night long they were ranting and roaring at a terrible rate; I took her up the next day; I came to the

               <p>Court. How long had you been at the Virginia Planter that day? - I had been walking down the hackney road, and had got a little in liquor to be sure, a little matter.</p>
               <p>I suppose you do not give these sort of people beer and gin when sober? - I did not think any harm; sometimes when I have got a little drop of liquor I have given a man a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you cannot tell how much liquor you had had; you was pretty forward in liquor? - No, not vastly forward; I knew the purse directly; a nasty black canvas purse; there was nobody but her and me coming out at the door; there were several people in the house; I ran after back; and the further I ran, the further I was behind.</p>

               <p>I keep this house; on the Friday preceding the 26th, the prosecutor and his wife went out, and left the key with the servant to clean out the room; she did clean the room, and they gave her four shillings for her trouble; on the Sunday they left the key with her, and on the Sunday evening, their not coming home so soon as we expected, the servant left the key with me; on the Monday morning, about one, they came home; on the Monday they went out again, and left the key with the servant; the two dogs I believe were not there; their not coming home on the Monday night, I was under some alarm about the property which they had told me of; I had a great mind to take the box into my own room, but, as I was alone, I did not think proper; on the Wednesday night, their not coming home, I did open the room; then the box was on the bed, and laces and other property was separate in confusion about the room; I called to the prisoner, who lay on the same floor, and had been sent up to bed ten minutes before; I asked her how these gentle-people left their property; and she said, as it is now, Sir; and I said, what, with the box open, and the window open, and all the things about the room I and she said yes, they did, Sir; I immediately went to bed, something easier than I was; on the next night, when they came home, I asked the gentlewoman how she left her property; the prisoner was present; she said she had left her box locked, and the things secure; then I said, I think all is not right, but the prisoner offered her service, and said I will go up with you, and take the candle: when they came up stairs the gentleman missed this property; I was sent for, and when I came, the prisoner was wringing her hands, and declaring her innocence; I said, it is very extraordinary how this could happen, how did you leave the things when you cleaned out the room? then the box was locked; because, said she, I had occasion to look under the box, and remove it; she said, if I die for it, I will speak truth; then I said, how came you to tell me last night that the box was left open, and the things about: the drawers in the prisoner's room were searched, but nothing found; I cannot tell whether she had been out or not; after I apprized her of the danger she was in, she said -</p>

               <p>I was never in the room at all; when the lady delivered the key to me, I delivered it to the bar immediately; I had no time to go up; there was a very great skettle-ground behind the house, where the window looks into, where there is a great deal of gaming the beginning of the week, and great beams that come across, any person might get in.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. The mode of importing Chintz into this country is in a number of bales, carefully packed, or sewed up? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did you look at the other parcels that were left in the bales? - I did, at all of them.</p>
               <p>Dickinson. I compared the pieces that were found on the prisoner with the contents of these bales, and there was an exact similarity, the same sort of goods precisely, though I suspected that the piece of coloured goods was taken from a bale where a piece of the same sort was not left in the bale; but I compared it with the goods of the other plundered bale, and there was the exact pattern.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I understood you that they were both of them ullage goods? - The one that I saw open was, the other I rather think was a compleat bale.</p>
               <p>Court. Which of the bales was it that corresponded with these goods? - From the ullage bale; but there were goods like these, which are ullage goods, in that bale, excepting that bale was described as perfect goods, and there is an imperfect bale.</p>
               <p>This is an imperfect piece? - This is a piece that would not be sold at the Company's sale, as a piece of sound goods.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say then, that you suspect that they came out of the perfect or the imperfect bale? - I suspect that they all came out of the imperfect bale.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I have known the prisoner sixteen or seventeen years; he had a very good character as far as ever I knew; I was the person that was with the prisoner when these three pieces of chintz were bought at Rotherhithe-wall, the 21st of July, on a Wednesday morning.</p>
               <p>Who did he buy them of? - There were three or four sea-faring men; I was going down to Greenwich in the morning; the prisoner asked me to go with him; I was glad; we met with three or four men, that asked us to have a piece of handkerchiefs; there was some handkerchiefs muslin, and these three pieces of chintz; we went into a public-house, I think, to the best of my knowledge, the sign of the Cross-Keys, Rotherhithe-wall; they asked us twenty-five shillings for this piece; the prisoner offered them a guinea, if I thought they were worth it; but he had not the money about him, and he left me at the publick-house, while he went to borrow it; he bought them at a guinea a piece, and he paid for them; he took the pieces; he asked me if I had a handkerchief; I told him I had not, nor I could not go home for one; I was obliged to go to Greenwich; I cannot tell what he did with them; he said he would take them home directly; and I went to Greenwich.</p>
               <p>Did they appear to be foreign? - I cannot judge.</p>
               <p>(Shewn to her.)</p>
               <p>Was any body present? - Nobody, but the prisoner and me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150115"/>I believe they were pieces like this? - I do not know, for I did not mark them; I only thought they were worth the money.</p>
               <p>Court. What time did you meet him that morning? - I met him on the quays, in Tower-street, as I was going to take boat; it was between seven and eight in the morning.</p>
               <p>How did you go down to Greenwich? - I walked it; I crossed the water at Execution-dock, and went to Rotherhithe; he went with me; we gave twopence a-piece.</p>
               <p>He was to go with you to Greenwich? - Yes, he was; but he did not.</p>
               <p>How came he not? - Because he said he should carry the pieces home which he had bought: I went on to Greenwich; I parted with him about nine in the morning, at the Cross-keys; I cannot tell what became of him: when I returned, I heard he had been stopped with three pieces of chintz.</p>

               <p>I live at Rotherhithe-wall; I am a hairdresser; I have been acquainted with the prisoner seven or eight years.</p>
               <p>Do you remember seeing any thing of him in the month of July? - He came to me in the month of July, near the time.</p>
               <p>What time of day? - About eight in the morning; and he asked me the favour to lend him a couple of guineas: I knew him to be of a good principle, and I went up stairs to get it: he said he was going to buy something; I did not take notice: I am a journeyman; I was in my business, combing a gentleman's wig.</p>
               <p>How soon afterwards did you understand he was in trouble? - Two days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Court. Where do you say you live? - Rotherhithe-wall.</p>
               <p>Is there such a house as the Cross-keys there? - Yes, I believe there is; I never was in the house in my life; it is some distance from our house, two or three minutes walk.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with him? - I have been acquainted with him seven or eight years; I have been out with him in company.</p>
               <p>Have you often lent him money? - I lent him once a trifle, and he paid me to my satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Had he generally such a sum of money as two guineas in his pocket? - Yes, he always paid very creditably; I never saw any thing dishonest of him in my life.</p>
               <p>CROFT JACKSON sworn.</p>
               <p>I live at Walworth; a surveyor to the East-India company; I know the prisoner; I have seen him before; he has worked in the craft where I have been delivering the hoys on the quays; he always seemed to work very well, and was very honest and solid.</p>
               <p>I understand he wishes to examine you as to the mode in which the men do their work in the hoys? - There is myself in the hold of the hoy, and two belonging to the King, to take care nothing is pilfered out of the hoy: that day, the 21st of July, the stern of the vessel could only get in; we had no occasion to lay over the after-part of the hatches, because the crane would not reach beyond the beam; we had to roll the bales from forward all the way aft to the crane, before we came to the property; that was the way that the hoy was delivered: he was not there that day; there were three in the hoy delivering her.</p>
               <p>Court. In the bale hoy? - In the bale hoy that day.</p>
               <p>Could the prisoner then have opened a bale in the hoy, and have sewed it up again? - He was never in the inside of the hoy, if he was on the dock; I do not know; I was in the hold all the time: upon deck, he must have been in view of many people; it was impossible: there was one bale, I observed, was rather slack; it was tied up with foreign thread; where it was done, I cannot say; it was not done in the hoy; it was done before she was unloaded: but there was not a broken package that day; which is generally the case.</p>
               <p>How long had the ship delivered those bales into the hoy? - I believe, the day before; she was just arrived.</p>
               <p>Court. How do these hoys lay; what<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150116"/>quay was it? - I do not remember the name of the quay; it was a little above the Custom-house.</p>
               <p>What other hoy besides the bale hoy was there? - There was one that was close to the quay, which was a tea hoy; the bale hoy laid adjoining to the tea hoy.</p>
               <p>What vessel laid next to the bale hoy? - I think they were sugar-lighters, but I cannot be so positive to that.</p>
               <p>Were there a great number lay out for a good way? - A great many sugar-lighters about.</p>
               <p>Is that a place where small boats come in or ply? - There is the stairs just by.</p>
               <p>How near were the stairs? - About the length of a hoy.</p>
               <p>From it or to; which way, up or down? - There is one just above, and another just below, both ways.</p>
               <p>Are those stairs kept free for boats to go in and out? - They are blocked up frequently in the day.</p>
               <p>I suppose, when they are blocked up, the people come over the lighters or hoys, or whatever is near? - They get on shore in the best manner they can, and there are steps to get up on the quay.</p>
               <p>How high is a hoy out of the water? - Sometimes four foot, six foot, eight foot, out of the water; the sugar-lighters laying close to them, you may easily step out of one into the other.</p>

               <p>Could he on that day have opened a bale, and have plundered it, without your observing him? - Which way was it possible, when he was not there?</p>
               <p>Could he by any means have plundered a bale in that hoy? - It is not possible; because he was not there to do it, and when the bales go up; they go on the crane; but he never was below, nor no man else, ever to plunder; there are three of us there.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any alteration in one of the bales in any part of its sewing? - I cannot say; it is Mr. Jackson's business.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you there from the time that the hatches were unloaded? - The hoy came up between seven and eight; we boarded it; and in half an hour after she began to work.</p>
               <p>Was you there from the time that her hatches were unloaded? - The whole time; we never stir from the place as soon as we get entrance to go down.</p>
               <p>You was in the hoy then as soon as this man was stopped? - Yes. I heard there was a man stopped.</p>
               <p>Had you any curiosity to go and see who it was? - That was impossible; we are not allowed to go out of the hoy.</p>
               <p>How long do you remain in the hoy? - Till she is cleared; let her remain as long as she will, if it be a week: we are allowed three hours in the day to go on shore, when she is locked up; and then one remains there.</p>
               <p>But you do not lock down the hoy while you go to dinner? - There is no necessity, because the hoy was out; but we never move, nor go away, till the hoy is locked down; not one of us is allowed to go on shore; we are obligated both of us to be on board, only three hours out of the twenty-four; therefore it was impossible.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an extra porter. I have known him between four and five years, an extraordinary good character; I never heard any thing amiss: I understand that there is a person that has given evidence against him, that was in expectation of having a place from the East India Company; I mean one Jones.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Bristow. You, I think, was the witness that told me you was at the water side attending the landing? - The next hoy to that.</p>
               <p>Who was the officer that was attending the bale hoy? - His name is Heathfield: I knew nothing of the transaction till after the man was apprehended.</p>
               <p>It seems he came on shore from this hoy? - Yes: he must have passed from some other vessel; the situation of the two hoys was in that direction, that he must have come to the best of my knowledge immediately out of the bale hoy.</p>
               <p>What vessels lay beyond the bale hoy? - I really cannot say; there might be a number of sugar lighters.</p>

               <p>How are the stairs situated where the people land? - I cannot say whether the stairs were obstructed by boats or not; I had no suspicion of their coming from any place but the hoy; I first considered it a smuggling business, and gave directions to seize the hoy, till the bale appeared to be plundered.</p>
               <p>But that bale was sewed up again? - I only go so far as to say the possibility that a man might have concealed himself behind the bales, and opened it.</p>
               <p>Dickinson. I understood there was a man that was to prove that he was seen beckoned into the hoy? - There is a ticket porter of the name of Baldwin, that says he saw him beckoned into the bale hoy.</p>
               <p>TATTENHAM BALDWIN sworn.</p>
               <p>I was at work in the crane.</p>
               <p>How near is the crane to the bale hoy? - The chain runs into the bale hoy, to get the goods up: I cannot say how long the chain was.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing of this prisoner that morning? - Yes, I did; there was a lighter of cotton that laid close to this bale hoy, and he laid on the lighter of cotton for some time; then I saw him jump off the deck into the hold of the hoy; he came off of the cotton into the bale hoy.</p>
               <p>Did you see him come off of the cotton into the bale hoy? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long did he remain in the hold? - A very little while, a few minutes: he went on shore over the tea hoy; but he was beckoned by some of them; when he jumped down he jumped down in a particular hurry: I saw the motion of the hand of some of them: there was Shorland was employed by Baker.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What paper is that? - An account of the names of the people; I got a gentleman to write it down, because I would not be mistaken in what I should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150118"/>say; their names employed were Shorland and Milday: I saw a motion from somebody in the hold; and I saw him jump down, and come up again presently; and there was only Shorland employed by Baker and Willoughby; Hurd was not employed that day at all, nor was not paid when we went to be paid; he was in the hold, but he was not employed.</p>
               <p>How long did you see him on the cotton lighter? - A quarter of an hour as nigh as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Dickinson. There is an observation that occurred to me; the committee of directors, that gave me orders to prosecute this man, desired I would use any means adviseable by the Lord Mayor to endeavour to find out the gang, if I could, as the company had frequent losses; at the examination I asked the Lord Mayor what was proper; he recommended me to go to the prisoner; I went back to the warehouse, and when I arrived there one of the porters in the warehouse, who I had employed at the water side, said, he knew this man very well; I took him to the prison with me, and I there asked him who were concerned with him in the business; he was very averse to say any thing to me; I thought it was on account of the turnkey being present; then we went into another room; I said to him, pray what is become of the rest of those goods? he said, he knew nothing but of four pieces; I said, I suppose you know how the rest were taken? he said, he knew nothing but of four pieces, and they went down into the hoy again: the other person is present that was with me, and in court: I asked the prisoner how many pieces were taken; he said, he did not know but of four pieces more; I said, had you your share? there were twenty-six pieces taken; his answer was, he knew but of four pieces more, and they went down in the hoy, that is down the river, when the hoy went away from the quays.</p>
               <p>Court to Constable. Did I understand you right, that when you asked the prisoner how he came by these pieces that were found upon him, that he said, he had brought them out of the hoy? - He said so when he first came to the Poultry Compter; I am sure he said so at first.</p>
               <p>You are quite sure he said so? - I am quite sure, on my oath.</p>
               <p>Jury. We wish to ask the witness Baldwin, what time he saw the prisoner in the hoy? - I cannot tell the hour.</p>
               <p>How long before the alarm of his being taken up? - About a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was you ever in the employment of the excise? - I was.</p>
               <p>How long ago? - It is nine years ago.</p>
               <p>Did you turn yourself off, or was you discharged? - No; I was discharged.</p>
               <p>Is it a fair question to ask for what? - I can tell you what it was for.</p>
               <p>If you please? - My lord, it was a few gallons of liquor laid against us before our board of excise; but nothing was sworn against us.</p>
               <p>Did you say a few gallons or two? - I said a few gallons.</p>
               <p>So, though nothing was sworn, you was discharged? - Yes; we were discharged on circumstances; it was found in the next ship, and they thought it came out of ours.</p>
               <p>That is, in plain English, they were wicked enough to suspect you had stolen it? - No, not stolen it.</p>
               <p>I believe you have said, that you expect a place under the India Company in consideration of your evidence? - I never asked such a thing.</p>
               <p>Nor never mentioned it to any body? - I never in my life mentioned any such thing to nobody, upon my oath that I have sworn.</p>

               <p>I heard Mr. Jones mention that he was in expectation of getting a place, and this man together; they were both working together on the ground, at the scale.</p>
               <p>Baldwin. I did not work at the scale at all.</p>
               <p>Stanton. This was about a fortnight after; Baldwin said he was to be one too; then I said, I expect you will have a bit of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150119"/>a place; why, says Baldwin, in my old age I shall have something done for me, I hope; Baldwin said that as well as Jones; I said, it is in the East India warehouse; says I, that is a pretty thing for you; says he, I desire no more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The other man, Jones, would have been here, but he has fallen down and broke his hip, and is in the hospital.</p>
               <p>Court. Is the constable a parish constable? - A constable of the ward of the tower.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Dickinson. I understand this visit you paid to the man in goal was in consequence of the recommendation of the Lord Mayor; was the prisoner present when his lordship desired you not to say any more in publick? - I cannot be positive; I did stay after he was gone: the reason I took the person with me was, that he knew him.</p>
               <p>Be so good to tell us whether it was not conveyed to this man by some means or other, that it would be better for him to speak out, or speak explicitly? - I said, who are your accomplices? without any introduction: he said, what is to be the consequence if I inform you? I said, I have no terms to offer; if you chuse to suffer me to convey any information to the office, I shall be ready to convey it.</p>
               <p>Did not you feel, and do not you feel, that he did it in hopes of a benefit? - I thought he expected the benefit that he has had, that he was not indicted capitally.</p>
               <p>Did not he expect favor in the prosecution? - Not in the mode the prosecution is carried on; I do not think he had any reason to expect it; I told him, I can have no kind of animosity against you, you have not robbed me; I am merely an agent.</p>

               <p>The man you took hold of was the man in whose hand you saw it? - Yes: then he said, I have not got it, and pointed to the other, to whom he had given it.</p>
               <p>Did he struggle to get away? - He struggled first of all, and I thought he would have been rescued by some of this gang; but I cannot say who is a rogue, and who is not; there was a vast crowd; I was pushed into the crowd; I never got any of my property again: I am a poor man, not able to bear expences.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then you expect some allowance when this is over? - I expect what they please to give me.</p>
               <p>Have you never said you expected to get 40 l. by this? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Have you never had any conversation with one James Hill about such expectations? - I never had.</p>
               <p>Had you ever wore those two pieces of money in your watch-case, in your fob, before that day? - Very seldom.</p>
               <p>Have you ever? - I do not know whether I ever did or no.</p>
               <p>You carried it with the string hanging down, the same as a watch? - Yes, and a couple of iron keys to it; I did not know the men were to stand in the pillory that day.</p>
               <p>The first thing that attracted your notice was a pulling at your watch-string? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Nothing had been said to you before that? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>No violence used against your person? - No.</p>
               <p>No threats? - No.</p>
               <p>No demand of your money, or watch, or any thing of that sort? - No, nothing at all.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with Mr. Murray? - Not till I saw him at the justice's.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Have you been in court during the trial? - Yes; I did not hear any order to the contrary. I am one of the patrol employed by the public office at Bow-street, and I was ordered to attend at the execution of the sentence of pillory; I was there at the time, and I saw a great mob going from the street where the persons stood in the pillory; and I saw the prisoner in custody, with several people; the old man in particular had hold of him; he was calling out, and his clothes were very much torn; I desired them immediately not to duck him, but to bring him to the magistrate: I took my staff out; the man turned round, and said, I will go with this man any where: I said, take him to Bow-street: I asked them whether they had searched him; they said they had not, and they would not.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep the Barley-mow; the prosecutor lodges at my house; the day that the robbery was committed, when he came home, I asked him where he had been; he said, into Berkley-square; and he said he had his pocket picked looking at the sight, and was surrounded in half a minute by 14 or 15 people, and lost his watch; but, says he, I have got the thief, I seized him immediately: I said, who did you seize? Why the man that stood before me. Says I, was that the man that took your watch? No, says he, I felt my watch jump out of my pocket that moment, and I seized him directly. Did you see the man with the watch? He said, no, he did not; but he said the man he seized pointed to another man. The old gentleman I do not think he is capable of knowing what he does say, or what he did.</p>
               <p>Have you ever heard him say that he expected any thing? - I did hear him talk, him and another, about 40 l. I cannot tell what it was; I was in the cellar; he was talking to an old gentlemen that is in the workhouse; I asked him; I told him to be very careful about the business; and he told me he should not have done any thing, he would have put up with it, but only Mr. Murray rather put him up to it: it was still talked of; and in a few days he said it was not a watch, it was the case of a watch, and two crown pieces in it.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that for the first day, and some days afterwards, he represented he had lost a watch? - I am sure of that; I asked him how much the value of the watch was, or something of that kind, and he said the watch was but of very little value, but there were two crown-pieces within-side the case; so I asked him what was become of the guts of the watch; says he, they are gone to be mended. He has been a lodger of mine near three years; I never saw him have a watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150129"/>Court. Nor case? - Nor case; nor the crown-piece. He is a very honest man; he always paid me very honest and just.</p>
               <p>Had he the appearance of a watch? - I have seen a string out.</p>
               <p>Had you the curiosity to ask him where it was that the guts of the watch were gone to be mended? - I did not; I had no doubt about it; I thought he had lost his case, or watch; but I took it to be a watch at first.</p>
               <p>Then you did not suspect the old man? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>You are sure you asked him if he saw the watch in the man's hand? - I did, and he said no: I asked him whether the man made any resistance; he said no; but that the man said, I have not got your watch.</p>
               <p>Did the old man describe to you the manner of the losing his watch? - So far as this: he said there were 16 or 17 all together, and he missed his watch.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Sir, you have thought fit to leave your case to your counsel; but probably the jury will expect you to give some account of yourself; what are you? - I am a waiter.</p>
               <p>Court to Hill. Did the prosecutor describe how the watch was got from him? - No; he said he missed it in a moment; that it was snatched out.</p>
               <p>Did he mention that the watch was snatched out of his pocket by any person? - He did.</p>
               <p>Did he mention any thing of saying that he felt a digging at the watch before? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he use the particular expression of jump out? - No, I do not think he did; he said that he found the watch jump out, or taken out.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>The Jury withdrew for some time, and returned with a verdict,</p>

               <p>On the 4th of August, in the afternoon, in consequence of an information, I went to a house in Black-horse yard; there I saw the two prisoners, and these things, a great part, on a table near them; this little parcel in Spencer's pocket; and she said they were her property, and she bought them that morning of a man in Rosemary-lane, I think it was; I took them and the property before the magistrate; she went willingly, and told the same story before the justice: I had them advertised, and the prosecutor claimed them. (These things deposed to).</p>

               <p>I got my living for some years by buying and selling clothes in Rosemary-lane: between one and two, I saw an old-clothes-man, and bought these things of him, and paid for them; but being taken up, I had not an opportunity to find the man, and I was obliged to pawn the things by this other prisoner; and some of the things were found on my daughter's table; and the officer came and took us into custody, and took us before his Majesty: I have a great many witnesses.</p>

The two prisoners at the bar robbed me of twenty silk handkerchiefs: they came in both together; the woman asked to look at some Irish linen; and Brown came and stood by the window, near a parcel of silk handkerchiefs: I turned my back to them, to take down the cloth; when I had taken the linen down, she held the cloth up side ways, as high as my face, as if it was meant to prevent me seeing Brown, and held it up between me and Brown, that I might not see Brown; she held it for some time, and kept looking me full in the eyes; she said, it is strong cloth, but let me see another; I pulled down another, and then my back was again toward them; she served me the same way again; then she ordered me to cut one yard, which I did; when she came to the door, Brown then remarked to the woman, you have soon dealt, cousin; you sometimes make a long wrangling and jangling; and then they went out; and about a minute after I turned my face towards the window, and saw a vacancy between the silk handkerchiefs and the printed callico; a thought then immediately occurred to my mind, that the prisoners had robbed me; I then stepped to the window to see, and missed a large quantity of handkerchiefs; I believe about twenty, to the amount of five pounds or upwards; I having no one in the shop but myself, called my son down stairs, in hopes to overtake them; but before he came down they were out of sight; I ran after them, but could not see them; I saw them no more till the 22d of July, when in consequence of an advertisement in the paper I went to Bow-street, to see whether they were the same people or not: when they were re-examined I saw they were the prisoners at the bar; I know them to be the same: I never saw them between May and July: I went that evening to enquire if I could hear or see any thing of them, but could not.</p>
               <p>Court. What time of the evening was it? - It was in the evening, after candle light; I suppose about nine o'clock, or past; I had seen these handkerchiefs before, a few minutes, because I had been looking at them; it may be a quarter of an hour, or half an hour, or more; I had been in the shop from the moment I saw them till the moment they came in; and I am sure there were no more customers in the shop.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner Smith's Counsel. The woman paid for what she bought, and went away? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you went to Bow-street, you expected to find the persons, from the advertisement? - I went to see whether it was the same or no.</p>
               <p>You expected to see the same persons that robbed you? - Yes, I did; I thought there was a similarity in the mode of robbing.</p>
               <p>Did you run after the people as soon as you missed your handkerchiefs? - I did as soon as I had called my son.</p>
               <p>The woman looked at the cloth, and told you to cut off a yard, and paid for it, and went away? - She looked at it in a very aukward manner.</p>
               <p>That is according to your suspicions; were I to look at cloth I should perhaps look at it aukwardly.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you ever see the two prisoners before they came to your shop? - Not that I know off.</p>

               <p>Are you sure that that is the man that came with the shoes? - Yes; I am very sure that is the man.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did not you say at Mr. Read's office, that if I was the person I had not the same clothes on, and that you could not swear positively to me? - I did not say so; but when I saw him at Mr. Read's office I swore positively to him.</p>
               <p>And likewise I told you, that if I was the man I never changed my clothes, and even by my tongue you could not be deceived; but they would not let me speak?</p>
               <p>Court. You have heard what the prisoner said to you; did you know his voice again? - No, Sir; I did not take any notice of his voice; but I said, I could swear to him.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you say that in his presence? - No; it was other people that told me of the man when he was taken, before I saw him at Justice Read's office; because then I was not certain whether I should know him or not; but I never said so after I had seen him at the office.</p>
               <p>Was he in those clothes when you saw him at Justice Read's? - Yes; he was.</p>

I told him, that as to the coat, I believed it was his own; but he desired me to think, and to tell him what was against him; I told him the cap on his wife's head, and the stockings on her legs, had been sworn to; that he must go along with me; he desired me to say that I had not seen him; I said it is of no use, for go with me you must; afterwards he said, if I must go with you, I must go with you; I brought him to the justice's: I have often seen him before.</p>

               <p>How soon did you pick him out? - When I got up to him, they had got as far as the middle walk of the mall; after he was searched, he was carried to Bow-street in a coach; there he was examined for a long time; and at last I saw the watch produced, but did not see it pulled out of his pocket; the watch was handed to me by Sir Sampson Wright, and I gave it back again into his hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel. You have been used to see the king go to the levee in this country before? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Then, perhaps, you have known that you have seen as great a crowd before? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>You had no opportunity of discovering any persons faces, but in the midst of that crowd? - I believe I recollect that man before.</p>
               <p>The crowd that happened to you was no more than is common? - Yes, it was done in rather a different manner than common crowds are.</p>
               <p>Was you present when Macmanus searched the prisoner in the park? - Yes, I was; the prisoner never went out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Even at Bow-street, there was nothing found on him but your watch? - No.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. There was a great crowd that day? - No, there was not much crowd, indeed not so many as usual, on that day; I suppose there might be about 100, and sometimes there are 5 or 600.</p>

               <p>- I am a broker; I was in the Park, attending at the King's levee, when this matter happened: there was a piece of work, and I ran to see what was the matter; and the prosecutor said he was robbed of his pocket-book and watch: Mr. Macmanus had the prisoner in custody; we found nothings on him then; Mr. Macmanus delivered him into our custody, and we took him to Bow-street: he had an hearing; and Sir Sampson desired we would examine him more minutely; which we did; and, in searching of him, we found the watch in his left-hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. What time was this? - Between two and three.</p>
               <p>How long was it after the robbery was committed that you had him in custody? - About five minutes.</p>
               <p>You searched him before, and you found nothing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You never thought of examining the pocket before? - Yes, we had done it before, but it was not there then.</p>

               <p>On the 16th of July, between twelve and one, just as the King was getting out of the coach, and going in to the levee, there was a great noise behind where I stood; I looked about, and saw the prosecutor and another man standing; and he said, that is the man there that robbed me: I and the prosecutor followed him, and he rather stood still; I took him and searched him, and found a watch in his fob, which the prosecutor said was none of his; I said to the prosecutor, be careful what you are about, this man having nothing about him as I could see; but he was still suspicious, and we put him in a coach in Pall-Mall; I was obliged to stay at St. James's, so did not go to the office.</p>
               <p>The watch was produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor, as also the seals.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called eight witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>

               <p>I am a foreman to the manufactory of Messrs. Fossetts: after being informed by Mr. Haynes of the transaction he has mentioned (it was about half past six in the morning), I consulted with the last witness, and we thought it prudent to say nothing to her: I went up into her room, but could see nothing; I concealed having made observations, I thought it would be more prudent to let her go out into the street; she went to breakfast, and I followed her, about a quarter after seven, at some distance, that she should not discover me till she got to her habitation: she went from the corner of Chiswell-street to Golden-lane, to her own apartments; I went up into her room after her, and accused her; she immediately gave me these carpets here, fastened up in a paper; she at first hesitated at a little, but soon after that gave me these two carpets.</p>
               <p>What did you accuse her of? - I had examined the things on that counter, and missed two pieces of carpeting; I accused her of taking some remnant bedside carpets out of the warehouse.</p>
               <p>(The carpets produced, and deposed to, being the pattern carpets alone manufactured at that warehouse.)</p>
               <p>Court to Haynes. Do you know what it was the prisoner took from the banister? - It appeared to me to be some kind of carpeting.</p>
               <p>Can you say they were not sold since the time you saw them before? - No, because it was the last thing almost that we took account of.</p>

               <p>I am a dyer; I went with the prisoner from the dye-house to his own apartment; I know not what day, but it was the same day he carried the silk to Mr. Biswell's; he desired his wife to give him the silk, and she seemed to be very much alarmed: when I went with him, it was between ten and eleven in the morning.</p>
               <p>Had you seen the silks at Mr. Biswell's first? - I saw them at our own warehouse, and saw him take them from thence to go to Mr. Biswell's, but did not see him at Mr. Biswell's: he repeated again, give me the silk, for I am a ruined man: she gave him a little parcel of silk, which he took, and put in his pocket, and took it to our shop, and from thence carried it to Mr. Biswell's: he came and laid it on the counter; I went with him: the silk he carried from the warehouse was of six colours, and seven parcels; two parcels of one colour;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150139"/>those he took of his wife appeared to be of the same colours; and, as far as I can judge, I believe them to be the same silk.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It was after Mr. Meadows and he went together, that he and you went together? - It was when Mr. Meadows was gone for an officer, and I went with him to his apartments.</p>
               <p>I do not find you weighed the skeins before they went out in the morning? - I did not: I helped to skain them up.</p>
               <p>This man went to his own home? - I believe he did.</p>
               <p>He was to do two things at one going out; go to Mr. Biswell's, and get his breakfast? - I believe he was.</p>
               <p>The man has got a wife and four children? - He has.</p>
               <p>The man had been home, and got his breakfast, and had gone to Mr. Biswell? - He had.</p>
               <p>When he was charged with stealing he constantly denied it? - He did.</p>
               <p>When he came to his own home he desired his wife to give him the silk, for he was a ruined man; she hesitated, and seemed confused; he said, give me the silk, in a still more peremptory manner; on which the woman went to her drawer, and got the silk? - She gave it to him out of the box.</p>
               <p>Mr. Worth, you seem a good humoured looking man, let us see whether it is so: has the man always persisted he did not know any thing had been taken, and did not he say this, the man having gone home to his breakfast, and having laid down the parcel, and having played with the child, if any was taken out, the wife took it out behind his back; did not the man constantly state this to be the case: did not he say, as to stealing any of the silk I know nothing of it; I went home to my breakfast, I laid down my parcel, and played with my child, and if the good woman has taken some few skains, it is my misfortune? - He said nothing like it; he confessed he took it from Mr. Biswell's warehouse.</p>
               <p>How old are these children? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>What was the value of these miserable pieces of silk taken out? - I do not know.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner; he was in my service once. I lost the mare mentioned in the indictment, between the 18th and 22d of March: the prisoner was employed occasionally in attending this mare, from some time in October, to some time in March: I bought this mare of one Downing, to whom the prisoner was a servant; Downing and he disputed, and he was turned out of employ; about a week or ten days after the prisoner applied to me, and requested me to employ him; I gave him half-a-crown a week to attend the mare: he had often been persuading me that the mare was too small for me: I lost her about the 22d of March; Burrows told me that Alderman Curtis had taken a liking to the mare, and that if I would let him take her to the Alderman, he would give a good price for her; I told him, I had no objection, if I could get a good price, to part with her; he said, I had better write a line; accordingly I wrote, and mentioned, that if he liked her, the price was twenty guineas; the prisoner took it, as I understood, with intent to take her to the Alderman; he returned at night, and said, the alderman was not at home; I told him, I was going to ride her next day, and I had altered my mind; I gave orders that the prisoner should not have the care of the mare, or the keys of the stable; I rode her the next day down to Canons, to Mr. O'Kelly's; I saw her the next day; and about two or three days after that I missed her; I received a letter from Burrows the 26th; that was the first intimation I had of Burrows: (produces the letter.) I had given no orders that he should take her; but the contrary: I never learned where the mare was till the 28th of last month; I saw him in Bolton-street, and I pursued him, and came up to him, and he stopped, and I caught hold of him: he attempted to strike me: a man came up, and I gave charge of him; he was taken to Poland-street; there he confessed that he had taken the mare to Paddington, and sold her for eight guineas; but he would not tell the person's name.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My lord and gentlemen of the jury, I am struck with so great an awe, appearing before this grand tribunal, that I fear I shall fall very short in making a defence to meet so heavy a charge as that on which I stand before you; at the same time I feel myself happy that I am before a jury who are men of property and character, and where I may expect that justice which is the grand characteristic of an English jury. The situation I have always held in life, I flatter myself, has been very respectable; my connections have been amongst the bettermost kind of people; and although from the first of my entering into life I have been unfortunate, I cannot accuse myself of being any ways criminal. At the age of twenty years I found myself in possession of a sum of money very little short of ten thousand pounds, an age much too young to turn it to advantage: I thought mankind honest as myself, therefore I the more easily sell into the snares that were laid for me; for every one seemed to court my friendship; and it was who should be first to serve me. At the age of twenty-five I formed a connection with a man who at this time is in a very great line of business, and lost very near five thousand pounds; and I was almost the only sufferer, as a scheme was laid for me, being known to be a man of property; and I was continually arrested, and sometimes imprisoned, while those who were in partnership with me went unmolested: I do not mean to cast any reflection upon my partner's conduct; but it had been better for me during the distress I have since suffered, if he had been endowed with a more liberal heart. That every one to whom we stood indebted, might receive their just demand, I put into the hands of a worthy alderman all my estates, which were sold at public sale to the best advantage, and paid every man twenty shillings in the pound, after which I believe I had a surplus of near one thousand pounds, which I went into business with in the drapery line, in Cheapside; but still fortune was unkind; I was continually harrassed, and became a bankrupt; but so good an opinion had my creditors of me, that upon my examination not one appeared against me, but pitied my situation, and liberally assisted me afterwards; for the course of seven years I indured every kind of distress and hardship; penury and want were continually my companions; still I did not swerve from that which is just, but bore my unhappy situation with a becoming fortitude, and would rather starve than be guilty of a meanness. Fortune once more smiled, and I found myself happily situated as master of the riding school in Gray's-inn-road; there I thought my sorrows and sufferings were at an end, and that the latter part of my life would prove much more favourable than the beginning; my business flourished, my family seemed happy, and I was quite contented: when, dreadful thought! I took into co-partnership a young man from the country, who soon formed an unlawful connection with my wife, robbed me of most of my property, set off for France, and remained there three years, until they had squandered all away; once more I was reduced to poverty, in which state, gentlemen, I now stand before you: and, gentlemen of the jury, as men, as Christians, and no doubt, many of you fathers of a family, picture to yourselves my distresses; robbed of my property, of the partner of my bed, by whom I had had seventeen children; but what must her feelings have been upon cool reflection; she, that should have been the protectress of her family, in one moment, by one base act, brought into a state of beggary; I hope God has forgiven her. Gentlemen of the jury, I have now living five children, which I am happy to say have been taught a proper sense of their duty both to God and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150146"/>man, that I make no doubt they will make worthy members of society, and I hope will enjoy more comfort than their truly unfortunate father. My lord and gentlemen of the jury, the case now before you is for stealing a horse: can it be supposed, considering the various scenes I have been through, the character I have supported under such distressing circumstances, that I am capable of so base an act? No; I shudder at the thought: the just character that will be given to my prosecutor during the course of my trial, I am sure will operate in my favour, and convince you that it is a malicious prosecution; not content with starving myself and family, he wishes to rob them of their protector, by striking at my life. My lord and gentlemen of the jury, is it possible I could steal that which was partly my own property? as the prosecutor sent one Cook to me, desiring I would call upon him; the purport of which was to propose a partnership; and the first condition, that I should take the mare at the same price that he had given for her; from that time I considered her as part my own; took the whole care and management of her on myself; rode her; kept the bridle and saddle at my own room; and frequently obliged my friends, by letting them ride her when Mr. Moore nor myself did not want her, as will be proved by the evidence of several gentlemen of property and character. My Lord and gentlemen of the jury, can it be supposed; can it carry the least shadow of truth, that I should lend a horse for my friends to ride, that I had no property in? Thus has the prosecutor promised from time to time to advance the money, and kept me in suspence for upwards of five months, until I was under the necessity of pawning all my own wearing apparel, as well as my children's, for support; at last I was obliged to sell my houshold furniture at less than two thirds of the real value; still he assured me the money should be advanced, and that I should be properly recompenced for my time, trouble, and loss I had sustained; that we should not stand still for money, he having it in his power to procure any sum we should stand in need of; and if we went on well, nothing should be wanting My lord and gentlemen of the jury, this language seemed very pleasing to me; my situation required assistance; and a distressed man lays hold of every thing; little did I think I should be so gratefully rewarded, as to be tried for my life! My lord and gentlemen of the jury, I was poor before, but to rob me of all I had, my good name, the only thing left to protect me and my family in this world, is cruel beyond expression: still buoyed up with hopes, I took the resolution of requesting Moore to be open, and acquaint me if he had any doubt of advancing the money, as I had been so long in expectation of it, that I could not wait any longer, as the last thing I had to dispose of was my table-cloth, my sheets, blankets, &amp;c. being already gone; he informed me the money he could have as that day, but was sorry to say upon such disagreeable and unjust terms, as he could not accede to it, therefore required I would endeavour to dispose of an annuity of forty pounds per ann. during the life of Dr. Norris, and set the piece at one hundred and twenty pounds, and assured me, that as soon as sold, I should have part of the money, to immediately begin business with it; every endeavour was used by myself; I made every application in my power to dispose of the annuity, and spent upwards of two guineas in about a fortnight's attendance, on different people, and at different parts of the town; but found to my sorrow, that the annuity was not marketable, as Dr. Norris was advanced in years, and in a very infirm and poor state of health; I waited on Dr. Norris himself, who would not purchase it on any consideration: thus I found I was amused by Moore, to answer his villainous purposes. My Lord and Gentlemen, the latter end of the month of February, Moore rode the mare out, and not paying attention to the road he was going, the mare and himself fell into a place opened in the road to lay down some pipes: the mare received great injury; Moore was very little hurt: he returned home, and immediately<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150147"/>sent for me, but being from home, I could not attend her. In the evening, I went to the stable and found her in the following state; her knees broke, her chest damaged, and her eyes very much hurt. The next morning I acquainted Moore with the state that I had found her in. Moore requested I would immediately fell her, as he was convinced she was not safe to ride. I acquainted him, in the state she was at present, no one would purchase her, unless she was sold on very low terms; therefore we agreed to keep her until the damage she had received should be hid, which, from the attention I paid to her, was accomplished in about three weeks or a month, as it was a time horses shed their coats; and her colour being grey, the blemishes were very little seen. Now, my Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, comes the most particular part of the transaction, and which I hope you will pay attention to, as it will throw a proper light on this cruel, unjust, and malicious prosecution. I informed More, as the mare was unfound, and almost blind, it was necessary a letter should be drawn as though she came from the country, and directed to me at a different place from where I resided: he desired me to draw the letter, bring it up to his house, and he would copy it, at the same time throwing down one shilling for luck, in the presence of the witness, which will be produced. I

                  drew

             the letter (intended only as a copy), Moore read it over, and said there was no need to copy it; it would do as well if he signed it, which he immediately did, and with the same ink. I dated as though he lived at Hendon: this was on the 17th of March. I continued in that neighbourhood, I think about a week, as my landlord will prove, and every day rode the mare out, endeavouring to fell her: but, being unsuccessful, I took her to Paddington, and there sold her for eight guineas, a price much more than she was worth; and acquainted Moore by letter, as soon as I could I would wait on him, but hoped that I should have no more equivocations about advancing the money. Moore, conscious in himself that he meant to deceive me, sent one

             to meet me at a public house, behind Mr. Fozard's Yard, Piccadilly, who informed me he was sent by Moore, and that I had swindled him out of a mare. I told him I had sold the mare; but Moore being indebted to me for trouble and attendance upon him for upwards of five months, I should keep it for my own use, and desired him to send for More, which he did; but, not attending, after keeping me in custody from twelve at noon until six in the evening, he let me go about my business, at the same time saying, had he known the business, he would have had nothing to do with it. Thus matters rested, until Moore met me, and took me before Justice Read, Poland-street, where he swore he had neither signed any letter, or given any verbal orders to sell the mare. Gentlemen of the Jury, the proofs that I shall bring, which are all respectable, cannot leave any doubt on your minds, that he gave both written and verbal orders to sell the mare, and left the disposal of her entirely to me as his partner, but that he now wishes to make a property of me. I rest my case entirely on the candour of the Jury (being convinced I am in a just cause) who cannot fail to see into the prosecutor's intention, and that all the evidence given by himself and witnesses, cannot carry any foundation of truth, and hope this Honourable Court will treat it with the contempt it deserves. I now, Gentlemen, trust my life in your hands, resting assured you will acquit me of the whole of this charge, and restore me once more to my truly distressed family.</p>

               <p>Where did he live, when you first knew him? - When this man was brought to my house, I lived in Duke-street, Westminster; I did not know that he had any place of residence; my son-in-law brought him to my house; I have often seen him write; I have several receipts of his (here is one) I really believe them to be his, or else I would not pay my money for them.</p>

               <p>Tried by the second Middlesex Jury before Mr. RECORDER.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. May it please your Lordship; my Lord, I stand at this moment in a situation, in which I hardly know how to address myself with proper decorum to the Court, because I have to night experienced one of the most uncomfortable scenes that can belong to human nature, in the course of having been called upon as a feeble and very unworthy member of a very honourable profession, to endeavour to preserve the life of a fellow subject; and I have had the good fortune to assist an enlightened jury; I have had the good fortune to be (without any of the affectation of those who talk of the divinity of their nature) able to defeat as nefarious, as abandoned, and as profligate a prosecution as the annals of human depravity can afford; but, my lord, my duty will not permit me to stop here, and your lordship, I will be bold to say, would not do your duty if you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150149"/>caused me to stop here, if you denied me the requisition I ask: my lord, without meaning to give any offence (for it cannot be my interest, and it is not my inclination) I DEMAND of your lordship, that this innocent, this injured, this oppressed man, whose life has been attacked by perjury, and by the denial of the hand-writing of the prosecutor, may be furnished with the means of further vindicating his injured innocence: your lordship knows, you have the means of damming up the fountain of justice; and though he would not have much to lament, I agree, after the reparation which he has already had; after twelve of his fellow citizens; careful, intelligent, enlightened men, hearing this prosecutor's story; after such a jury have, without any directions from your lordship, without any witnesses to his character; with hearing half his case; when they have said, that they cannot see it necessary to continue the trial any longer; God knows, the prisoner is a happy man, and may retire with comfort and satisfaction: he has been deluded into a situation of ruin; and he has after all, after he has, under the hand-writing of that prosecutor himself, proved, by every witness in the cause, not denied even by the prosecutor himself, (for it is not to be added to the aggravated guilt of this man, I should not do him justice if I asserted he did deny it); the prisoner has proved a written authority, produced before the sitting magistrate, for that, for which he is dragged to the bar of a criminal court, charged with a capital offence. My lord, I ask no commitment of this prosecutor for perjury, I repeat it, for murderous perjury; let him go to his bed with that peace he can enjoy; I do not ask you to set him in the pillory; I do not ask you to confine him within those walls, though he is the only man in court who does not feel that he deserves such punishment, for the wickedness of that perjury, which must have been fatal to the life of that innocent man, if indeed the ways of providence were not above the the ways of those weak, miserable mortals, who fancy they can elude its all searching eye; my lord, all I ask is, that you do not deprive the man at the bar of the means of applying to the future justice of the country; your lordship knows, that without a copy of the indictment Mr. Burrows cannot maintain an action against this prosecutor, which, by your lordship's granting that copy, and the assistance of some generous spirits, who are more disposed to do in secret than to proclaim in publick, he may be enabled to maintain, and to prove, that a malicious prosecutor he was; that he aimed a shaft at the life of an innocent man; and to call for a satisfaction before twelve other men, in the character of a civil jury; my lord, will any body say this is not a demand of justice? let this man put his defence on the record; let him justify his conduct, and join issue with us on the fact; I desire to meet an English jury; I desire to come to an investigation, that is all I ask; I only ask the means of bringing an action, which I pledge myself the poverty of Mr. Burrows shall not prevent his prosecuting with effect.</p>

               <p>I am likewise in the excise; I was employed in the service the 22d of April, 1785; I was with my father and brother: there was thirteen or fourteen; they had sticks; we seized three or four ankers from the hindermost of the smugglers; my father pursued after: my father went with many smugglers behind the Island-house wall: I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150152"/>heard the blows: I heard my father cry out; he cried out to me, my leg is broke, Tom; I heard the blows before: I had a cag of geneva: one of the officers fetched him over to the front of the house; there I found him in the condition I described; I knocked for entrance to take my father in; before I could have admittance the smuglers returned again; and they knew my father, and made use of a very bad expression, you b - s, we will murder some of you; then they struck, and knocked down this Taylor, and his leg was broke; he came from the back of the house, where the smugglers were; he came out of the boat, but they did not observe him in particular: the first time I saw him was at the door of the Fortune of War; he came down Liberty-street, with the other party: the attack had been made on my father at the back of the Island-house.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to be one of the party? - He was in the party.</p>

            . You have already collected from the stating this indictment, what the nature of the offence imputed to these defendants is; and as it certainly bespeaks that this is a case which will occupy much of your time, it is undoubtedly my duty to abstain from wasting it; and, gentlemen, in discharging the duty imposed on me as counsel for the prosecution (not a very pleasant one) I shall endeavour to draw your attention to the evidence I shall lay before you, with a very few observations on that evidence. Gentlemen, the indictment charges, that Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150157"/>Jacques, conspiring, with the other defendants, to impute to the prosecutor the crime of murder, did in the progress and carrying into execution that conspiracy, file an indictment against the prosecutor, that the prosecutor was in consequence thereof, indicted, tried, and acquitted. By this time, gentlemen, I am certain you feel that no enquiry can be imagined more important than the present, except that which forms the preliminary enquiry; I mean the enquiry into the guilt of the present prosecutor. Gentlemen, on this occasion I desire that you will feel no alarm, left this prosecution should have any effect to prevent proper enquiries on the death of any of the king's subjects; no man can feel more than I do the necessity of such enquiries being perfectly free, and that nothing should occur to shake such enquiries; on the other hand, nothing can be more important than to guard innocence, and to shelter virtue from the wicked and malevolent attacks of their adversaries; therefore, undoubtedly, though on the one hand, every prosecution that has a probable cause in it, when the death of one of the king's subjects is the point of enquiry, ought to be encouraged; yet on the other hand, if there should be bad men found, equal to the task of forging accusations against others, and supporting such accusations by evidence before grand juries, that also forms a very serious enquiry. Gentlemen, the charge against Mr. Clipson is not that of any ordinary mode of putting another man to death; it does not impute to him, that he brought this man, Hart, to his end, by poison, or by any other violence, but by a specific art, which I am now about to state to you from the indictment, namely, that Hart being a prisoner, and Clipson the deputy turn-key, he placed this man in an unwholsome, damp, and inconvenient room, without his consent, knowing it was an improper place; and that in consequence of that improper treatment and confinement, Hart came to his end; that is the charge. Now, gentlemen, the law is so attentive to the situation of prisoners, that in all cases where a man dies in gaol, it is provided that the coroner's inquest should be summoned, to prevent improper treatment, and to take care that nothing of malice or malevolence should prevail. Gentlemen, in producing the evidence I have to lay before you, I shall first produce the record of Mr. Clipson's acquittal; but I do not stop there; I mean, if I am permitted by the Court, to go into a full and ample and labourious investigation of all the circumstances that attended Hart's preceding illness and death, as fully as if Mr. Clipson was on his own trial; and I do it with this view, to shew you not that he is innocent, but that it is impossible any man alive, from the moment Hart became sick, to his death, or to this moment, can, acting on any fair opinion, on any serious investigation, have believed for a single moment, that his imprisonment in that strong room, either occasioned his death, led to it, or in the smallest degree whatever accelerated it. When I have established the innocence of Mr. Clipson; when I have established the impossibility of any man believing he was guilty, it seems to me I shall have got a considerable way on the journey I have undertaken. I undertake to prove to you that there was malice in those who have indicted him; that there was no reasonable or probable cause for the accusation; if I shew you that you must agree he did not come at his death by those means, I have accomplished a great part of my task. Gentlemen, in general we do not meet with defendants so hardy as I am obliged to state the present defendants to have been; in general, defendants of this complexion shrink from the investigation of the public eye, and do not court public inspection; but I shall shew you, that, antecedent to the death of Hart, that this was looked to as a thing to be hoped for: and that Mr. Jacques, at the head of this conspiracy, talked of it, not doubting but it would prove lucky and desirable; and he did not leave us in doubt of his malice or malevolence; but he stated in terms, in the presence of Mr. Barclay, and in the hearing of witnesses that I shall call, that if Hart should die, then, said he, it will be a lucky<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150158"/>shewn to Dr. Norris, and other witnesses for the prisoner.]</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My lord and gentlemen of the jury, I am struck with so great an awe, appearing before this grand tribunal, that I fear I shall fall very short in making a defence to meet so heavy a charge as that on which I stand before you; at the same time I feel myself happy that I am before a jury who are men of property and character, and where I may expect that justice which is the grand characteristic of an English jury. The situation I have always held in life, I flatter myself, has been very respectable; my connections have been amongst the bettermost kind of people; and although from the first of my entering into life I have been unfortunate, I cannot accuse myself of being any ways criminal. At the age of twenty years I found myself in possession of a sum of money very little short of ten thousand pounds, an age much too young to turn it to advantage: I thought mankind honest as myself, therefore I the more easily fell into the snares that were laid for me; for every one seemed to court my friendship; and it was who should be first to serve me. At the age of twenty-five I formed a connection with a man who at this time is in a very great line of business, and lost very near five thousand pounds; and I was almost the only sufferer, as a scheme was laid for me, being known to he a man of property; and I was continually arrested, and sometimes imprisoned, while those who were in partnership with me went unmolested: I do not mean to cast any reflection upon my partner's conduct; but it had been better for me during the distress I have since suffered, if he had been endowed with a more liberal heart. That every one to whom we stood indebted, might receive their just demand, I put into the hands of a worthy alderman all my estates, which were sold at public sale to the best advantage, and paid every man twenty shillings in the pound, after which I believe I had a surplus of near one thousand pounds, which I went into business with in the drapery line, in Cheapside; but still fortune was unkind; I was continually harrassed, and became a bankrupt; but so good an opinion had my creditors of me, that upon my examination not one appeared against me, but pitied my situation, and liberally assisted me afterwards; for the course of seven years I indured every kind of distress and hardship; penury and want were continually my companions; still I did not swerve from that which is just, but bore my unhappy situation with a becoming fortitude, and would rather starve than be guilty of a meanness. Fortune once more smiled, and I found myself happily situated as master of the riding school in Gray's-inn-road; there I thought my sorrows and sufferings were at an end, and that the latter part of my life would prove much more favourable than the beginning; my business flourished, my family seemed happy, and I was quite contented: when, dreadful thought! I took into co-partnership a young man from the country, who soon formed an unlawful connection with my wife, robbed me of most of my property, set off for France, and remained there three years, until they had squandered all away; once more I was reduced to poverty, in which state, gentlemen, I now stand before you: and, gentlemen of the jury, as men, as Christians, and no doubt, many of you fathers of a family, picture to yourselves my distresses; robbed of my property, of the partner of my bed, by whom I had had seventeen children; but what must her feelings have been upon cool reflection; she, that should have been the protectress of her family, in one moment, by one base act, brought into a state of beggary; I hope God has forgiven her. Gentlemen of the jury, I have now living five children, which I am happy to say have been taught a proper sense of their duty both to God and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150160"/>will necessarily force me to state to you some other offences, in which Mr. Jacques stands involved; and I would not have attempted that, if I had not persuaded myself that my Lord will be of opinion, it is perfectly regular in point of evidence. In 1787, Mr. Jacques was committed to the Fleet, as a debtor; till 1789 he enjoyed the indulgence of the rules of the Fleet; in that time it happened that several actions were brought against the Warden, for the supposed escape of Mr. Jacques, for whether real or supposed, it is all the same: On the 17th of June, 1789, Mr. Jacques was ordered to be brought within the walls, and from that period Mr. Jacques never ceased day nor night to endeavour to work the ruin of the Warden and his Deputy Mr. Clipson; he promised that he would be the ruin of them both, and seems never to have lost sight of that intention. Mr. Jacques accordingly entered into a conspiracy with other persons to procure a person of the name of Shanley to be charged in execution in the Fleet with debts to the amount of a large sum of money, and procured the escape of that Shanley. -</p>

               <p>Mr. Jacques. May I be permitted to interrupt Mr. Garrow. I beg your Lordship's pardon: I have no counsel: I have no sort of objection to his going into that case, if he goes into it fully.</p>
               <p>Court. He must follow his own discretion, as to the use he proposes to make of that case; while he is in the regular way, he must not be interrupted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Gentlemen, I knew too well the great risque I should run in stating any thing improper before his Lordship. I proceed to state to you the circumstances I was mentioning when Mr. Jacques interrupted me, and to shew you, under my Lord's direction, how they appear to me to apply; and I desire, if it should turn out that my judgment is erroneous, you will do Mr.

             the justice to reject it, and then the prosecutor will be the only person to suffer by his counsel: I have stated to you, that Mr. Jacques had entered into the conspiracy to which I have alluded: Clipson was the turnkey of the prison at that time; he was also the witness against Mr. Jacques: upon his testimony, undoubtedly, a great deal of the weight of that prosecution depended. Now for the application of this observation, I shall shew you, that after the escape of Shanley, after Mr. Jacques felt the weight of Clipson's evidence upon that business, Mr. Jacques contrived this prosecution for murder, knowing the active part that Clipson had taken: he spoke of the death of Hart as a lucky event that would enable them to get rid of Clipson; and men who are ready enough to wish to accomplish their intent at any rate, would look upon this as a lucky event.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. I only wish to observe to you, Mr. Garrow, that both your indictments were presented at the same time.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Jacques, with respect to your observations on the opening, the proper time will be for you to be heard in your defence, you will then be heard with just as little interruption on the part of the counsel, as the counsel must now be heard on the part of the prosecution.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Gentlemen, it would have been wise in Mr. Jacques not to have made that observation; because, though the two indictments were preferred together, the escape of Shanley was effected on the 28th of August, 1789, which was antecedent to the death of Hart, and subsequent to his confinement in the strong room, and discharge. Gentlemen, with respect to the different shares that the different persons now before you took in carrying on that prosecution against Clipson, it is not material for me to state to you, though it would be more correct if I was able to do it, which I am not; it is enough to shew you their frequent consultations on the subject, and to shew you the hand-writing of some of them, and various other acts which mark them to be the authors of it. Mr. Jackson was the prosecutor, Mr. Jacques was the foundation of it, and he proceeded step by step to its completion, and has had the merit of not deserting it to the end; and after the acquittal of Clipson, he has been indiscreet enough, even on the eve of this trial, to boast of the share he had in that prosecution of Clipson, for murder. Gentlemen, I have, I hope, satisfied you, in the first place, that Mr. Clipson was innocent of the charge; from whence it seems to me that there is a strong inference that those who knew all the circumstances of the death, must have acted not from virtuous, but from vicious principles; and with respect to Mr. Jacques, particularly, I have stated to you that I mean to prove facts and declarations of his intention to ruin the Warden and Clipson. Gentlemen, more does not remain to me but to call the witnesses; with respect to the punishment, that is in the hands of the court: and if you find the defendants guilty, it will be properly administered.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. My Lord, I am counsel for Mr. Barclay and Mr. Apsey.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. I understand you are a clerk of the papers in the Fleet Prison? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Can you state at what time Mr. Hart, who died in that prison, was committed into custody? - The 24th of November, 1788.</p>
               <p>What sort of man was he in point of health and conduct? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Can you state when he was put in the strong room? - No: I believe he was there about sixteen days.</p>
               <p>How long had he been discharged from it before he died? - I am not clear, but I think somewhere about two months.</p>
               <p>Was you in prison at the time he was put in the strong room? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. I wish to ask you, whether any thing you have said, you have said of your own knowledge; how long you have been clerk of the papers? - About fourteen months; I speak from the office-books.</p>
               <p>Was you clerk of the papers at the time of the commitment of Hart to the strong room? - I believe I was.</p>

               <p>Was you any time a prisoner in the Fleet Prison? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you a prisoner there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. My Lord, the Warden of the Fleet would not permit any of our witnesses to be brought up without a Habeas Corpus; therefore I trust, if these witnesses come without, they come under influence, and I hope your Lordship will not examine them.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you must make the observations to the jury in the course of your defence: it is no objection to the testimony of the witnesses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was you in the Fleet when Hart was a prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you with him in the strong room? - Several times, I heard a noise, that Hart was taken to the strong room; to the best of my knowledge I believe it was about eleven at night.</p>
               <p>What was the sort of noise that you heard? - A kind of uproar: a number of people assembled together and made a great noise, and they said Hart was carried to the strong room. I frequently visited him, not in the strong room, but at the window: It is a room in that part of the prison which they term (it is a very odd name to strangers) they call it

            . I have been confined in that strong room myself: - I found no inconvenience; I smoked my pipe very comfortably.</p>
               <p>Was it a cold, damp room, unwholesome, and unfit for confinement? No: it was a good room; Hart had superfluity of accommodations, plenty of fire, and plenty of good victuals and drink. I attended him, and saw it.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any complaints from him? - I cannot particularly say I did: I heard him say that he would write to a vast number of people, and that it was very improper to put him there: he wanted for nothing. I eat and drank there very often with him.</p>
               <p>How long did he continue there? - I do not exactly know; but I believe sixteen or seventeen days.</p>
               <p>What manner of man was he in his conduct; was he a regular steady man? - He was quite worn out before he went there.</p>
               <p>He was a man addicted to drinking and debauchery? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long did he live after he came out of the strong room? - 'Till he was taken ill; I told him, Hart, you had better not live with us; for we drank too much for him. Says he, By God you are very fine hearty fellows, and I cannot leave you; and soon after he was taken to his bed, as I predicted he would, and he died there.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150164"/>After he came out of the strong room, did he appear in as good health, and as equal to this high living in the Fleet Prison, as before? - He seemed exactly as before.</p>
               <p>Had you any reason to think that confinement hastened his death at all? - Why, no: I cannot say I think it occasioned his death at all: I believe he was ill a few days before his death.</p>

            ? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was at the same time a prisoner in the Fleet? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know Barclay? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you remember Jacques saying any thing to Barclay? - I heard Jacques say, after Hart came out of the strong room, to Barclay, It would be a d - d good business if Hart was to die, for they could lay a good indictment against Clipson, or the Warden, for murder.</p>
               <p>Have you ever, at any other times, heard Jacques or Barclay, or Jackson, or Apsey, or Arnold, say any thing about indicting Clipson? - I have heard Jacques say, that he would never leave him till he ruined both Clipson and the Warden.</p>
               <p>Have you heard Jacques say that more than once? - Several times.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any other expressions of Jacques's about the death of Hart? - No, Sir; no more than his bragging that he had an indictment, and saying, that then he should do for them.</p>
               <p>After Clipson was indicted, what did you hear Jacques say? - I cannot expressly mention the words; but he, in a bravo kind of stile, mentioned several times that he had got the better of him, and would do for him, and never leave him till he was in Newgate.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear Jacques say any thing to Cane about Clipson? - No, Sir: not relative to that business; but when Shanley made his escape, I heard him tell Cane to write to Clipson's securities to withdraw them, or else, by G - , they would be fixed to the amount of Shanley's debt. Cane wrote a letter, but, I believe he never sent it.</p>
               <p>Do you know who carried on the prosecution? - I believe it was done by subscription, because I have seen letters written by a gentleman, a clergyman, the Rev. Sir

            , or any body else, in conjunction with the present defendants? - I know, of my own knowledge, that Barclay conducted the prosecution: he made no application to me, but I believe I can mention several who put their names to the subscription, though I believe they never paid it: Barclay was the principal.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Are you a prisoner now in the Fleet? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Are not you very intimate at this time? - No; not very: if I meet him I say, how are you? but no more.</p>
               <p>I believe he indicted you for an assault against him; did he not? - He did.</p>
               <p>I believe he never pursued that prosecution? - I believe he pursued it.</p>
               <p>Did he ever call you to a trial on that prosecution? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did not he execute a release for it? - Yes; but I was brought to the Old Bailey before I was released.</p>
               <p>I believe that release was subsequent to this indictment? - It was.</p>
               <p>I believe Mr. Lane was included with you in that prosecution? - He was indicted for the same assault.</p>
               <p>You often was with Hart? - Very often.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did not Hart, both to you, and to a great number of other persons, in your hearing, declare frequently that he believed the imprisonment in the strong room would carry him to his grave? - He never did in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Did not he say to that effect? - Never to my knowledge; I am sure he never did.</p>
               <p>Did he never to your knowledge complain to the warden, that he believed it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150165"/>would be the cause of his death; and desire to be delivered? - I cannot say I recollect any such circumstance: I know he wrote to the warden to be released.</p>
               <p>You were at this time on terms of intimacy with Hart? - Quite intimate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. That appears to be in writing, and the warden is here? - I recollect the warden sending in a surgeon, to see if there was any danger; I heard the surgeon's report, which was, that it was mere nonsense, and that there was no danger.</p>
               <p>He thought it a very disagreeable place? - I never heard him mention any other circumstance; but I am pretty sure he did give such a hint; because there was a surgeon sent, as I have mentioned.</p>
               <p>How long have you been in the Fleet prison? - I do not exactly know the day, but I believe near two years.</p>
               <p>Have not you now the run of the key? - No; I never had in my life.</p>
               <p>Was you threatened with the strong room when Hart was there? - Not to my knowledge; I was once there previous to Hart's being there.</p>
               <p>I believe there have lately, since Hart's enlargement, been alterations in that strong room? - I can see no other alterations, but that some panes of glass that were broke have been mended; and I believe it has been white washed; something to that purpose.</p>
               <p>What kind of place is this strong room; is there any window in it? - It is the best strong room, I believe, in any prison in England.</p>
               <p>What have you been in so many prisons? - Never but one; that was in the strong room of the King's Bench; I have been an officer in the army about seven years, and about two months a private.</p>
               <p>Was you never taken up for desertion? - No, Sir; I was discharged as a private soldier; I once did inlist as a private: I was very much vexed: I paid for my discharge, and came away; or at least I came away, and paid for my discharge; I have a certificate from the Duke of Dorset, for four years good behaviour as a soldier.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. At whose suit are you in the Fleet? - It was at several suits; but at present at the suit of my grandmother.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, why was you detained at the suit of your grandmother?</p>
               <p>Court. I do not think you have a right to enquire into the private affairs of this man and his family.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. If I should put my questions improperly, it is not intentionally.</p>
               <p>Court. I will set you right as far as I can.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. Was not you a deserter? I mean to shew that he was detained in the Fleet prison to prevent his being taken up, for desertion and selling his accoutrements? - That is false, Mr. Jacques.</p>
               <p>You was indicted by Clipson? - Yes; and I recollect you put a vast number of enormities in my hand, which I believed were all true then; but I have found were all false since.</p>
               <p>Was there not a petition drawn up to the judges? - I believe there was.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the contents of that petition? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that it was for the purpose of obtaining the liberty of Mr. Hart? - I do not recollect such a petition.</p>
               <p>Did Hart never tell you that he had presented such a petition? - I understood he had wrote to the warden; but I cannot say I recollect it.</p>
               <p>Is that strong room under ground or not? - It is the same as the rooms in

               <p>Did Mr. Beckford or Barrington never tell you so? - No; if they had I should not have attended to them; because I knew better; having been there myself.</p>

               <p>Were there at the time Hart and me were confined? - There was a grating, and wooden shutters.</p>
               <p>At whose expence was the bed and fire? - Either your's or Hart's.</p>
               <p>It was our property, and all the furniture: have the other rooms a privy in them? - No.</p>
               <p>Is there not one in this room? - Yes; because the gentlemen are not allowed to go out at all times.</p>
               <p>Did not you find an inconvenience from the nauseous smell arising from that privy? - I was but a couple of hours there: I cannot say much about the inconvenience; I did not smell any thing myself, because I smoaked a pipe.</p>

               <p>He did not appear to be in bad health then? - He looked of a very yellow colour; I believe it is his usual complexion.</p>

               <p>What was the situation of his health after he came out? - I cannot charge my memory; he eat and drank exceedingly well, if that is a good sign.</p>
               <p>And he appeared in very good health? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Then you mean positively to say, that the strong room was not damp? - I consider it as every other room on that suite.</p>

            , Esq; sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was you confined in the Fleet prison? - Yes, four years; I messed with Mr. Jacques and Mr. Barclay: I remember the time when Hart died; I think it was last August: I recollect his being placed in the strong room; I was not present when he was put in; only from hearsay.</p>
               <p>Do you know the situation of the room? - I thought it then a much worse place than I now find it.</p>
               <p>What sort of a place is it? - Why, Sir, it is walled; there is no boarded floor, nor to any of the rooms on that floor; I have lived two years nearly, in a room somewhat smaller, but nearly in the same manner and form.</p>
               <p>Was it an unwholesome damp place, likely to occasion death? - By no means likely to occasion death; but not so pleasant as the other rooms were.</p>
               <p>Was Hart accommodated with bedding and fire? - Sir, I believe better than most rooms in the prison.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect at any time hearing any conversations respecting the death of Hart, and the taking up of Clipson? - Barclay, myself, and Jacques messed together: the constant conversation of Barclay and Jacques was respecting this prosecution of Clipson; and their idea was, that Hart's death was occasioned by this confinement of Clipson's, and that they would exert their utmost abilities to prosecute Clipson for the murder, conceiving that he had occasioned the same; that was the general conversation: I did not leave the mess; I frequently left the room when the conversation was unpleasant respecting the matter being mentioned by Jacques and Barclay; I frequently reproved them for it, that it was not my conception that the room was the occasion of the death; I wished them to change the subject: I knew Hart drank<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150167"/>very hard, and was unwell in other respects.</p>

               <p>How long did he live after he came out? - I do not exactly know; it may be three weeks or a month.</p>
               <p>Was the course and habit of his life known to Jacques and Barclay as it was to you? - I should suppose so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You formerly thought this strong room was a bad room? - I did: I have since seen the room.</p>
               <p>I believe you have frequently remonstrated with Clipson on confining them there? - I may have done so.</p>
               <p>There was a petition? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I conceive it was, that they had not done any thing to deserve being put into the strong room? - I recollect something of signing a petition; but I do not recollect the particulars.</p>
               <p>Did not you likewise swear, that the contents of that paper was true.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You must produce the original.</p>
               <p>Court. There was a petition on oath presented? - There was; I swore to the petition; but do not recollect that petition.</p>
               <p>Did you go to visit Hart in this room? - Never in the room; but to the grate several times.</p>
               <p>Now did you never hear Mr. Hart declare that he believed that confinement would be the cause of his death? - I do not recollect I ever did: I believe a few days before we were put into the strong room we were not upon such good terms, nor only on speaking terms till his death; we were not at enmity.</p>
               <p>Have you ever declared that you have heard Hart say so, that that confinement would be the cause of his death? - I believe I may have heard Hart say, that he thought the confinement would be the cause; but I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Where was it that you believe you heard him say so? - In the strong room: I do not recollect before whom.</p>
               <p>You was prosecuted by Clipson for an assault upon him? - I believe I was.</p>
               <p>You know you was? - Yes; I think I was.</p>
               <p>That was before this indictment? - Yes; I think it was.</p>
               <p>Did not he release you from that prosecution? - No; he did not: I was acquitted without having spoke to him for a long time: he did not urge the prosecution: my acquittal was subsequent to that indictment.</p>
               <p>Were there any glazed windows in this strong room at the time Hart was confined in it? - I believe it was broke.</p>
               <p>What was Hart's state of health before he was confined in this room? - I believe very indifferent; I have heard him say he was troubled with a very great asthmatic complaint.</p>
               <p>He was confined in this room part of July and August? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There was a fire in this room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. Did you never say since the death of Hart, that you verily believed the strong room hastened his death? - I do not recollect it; I may have said it.</p>
               <p>Have not you said it a hundred times? - If I have said it a thousand times I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Did you never say it before Mr. Beckford? - I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Did not you say it to Captain

            ? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Have not you repeatedly heard me declare I so believed; and have not you as repeatedly said, no, I do not know it was the cause; but it hastened his death? - I recollect I have checked you in saying it was the cause of his death; whether I said it might hasten his death I do not recollect; I will not say I have not said so.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Sambridge? - I do.</p>
               <p>Have not you repeatedly said, that you might thank Mr. Sambridge for not being prosecuted on that indictment? - I believe I may.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. My lord, with respect to the petition, I have given notice to the warden and Clipson, to produce all the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150168"/>original papers; now I can prove this to be a correct copy.</p>
               <p>Court. You may ask him as to any facts that may be mentioned in the petition; but your notice will not oblige them to produce papers which they have not in their custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. Do you remember signing a petition? - I do.</p>
               <p>Court. Any fact that the petition stated, you may ask him whether those things happened.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. What was your opinion of the conduct of Clipson, in putting Hart into the strong room? - I was not present that day.</p>
               <p>What was your opinion the next day? - I thought he went too far.</p>
               <p>Did not you express yourself frequently alarmed for the safety of Hart, while he was in the strong room? - Never, Mr. Jacques.</p>
               <p>Did not you visit him frequently? - Very seldom, Mr. Jacques.</p>
               <p>Do you think it is a wholesome room at all, or fit for a man of a good constitution to be put into; I hope you will give me a candid answer? - There are better rooms; but I think it would not kill a man.</p>
               <p>Court. No; but would the room injure a man not in a good state of health? - No doubt, my lord; a man in a bad state of health being prevented from air would injure him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. But would this room be particularly dangerous to the health of a sick person? - I think not.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know how long Mr. Hart was confined there? - I believe about fourteen days.</p>
               <p>Were there any glass windows? - If there were they were broke.</p>
               <p>Has it been altered at all? - I believe it has.</p>
               <p>Do you think Clipson conducted himself as a humane good man ought to do, in such a situation, to Mr. Hart? - I was not present when he was taken to the strong room.</p>
               <p>I believe what you have heard me say on that subject has been open? - Yes; very open.</p>

               <p>Please to state to my lord and the jury, in what condition you found him, and what occasioned his death? - I found him in a fever, under which he laboured some days; and by his appearance, I conceived it was an advanced stage of fever; as to the cause, it is extremely difficult to ascertain; I understand,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150169"/>and was informed he had been a man very much given to debauchery and drinking: I never saw the strong room in the Fleet prison.</p>
               <p>Were there any symtoms in your patient, that induced you to think that his death was either occasioned or haslened by improper confinement? - I never had any such thing suggested to me; I saw him the 1st of October, and he died the following Saturday in the night; I saw him twice on the Friday, and once on the Saturday; there was some delirium upon him at first: I thought him better the Friday morning, but not at any time quite competent.</p>
               <p>Was you examined before the coroner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The subject of the enquiry was, what brought him to his end? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And neither then nor now did you suspect any violence? - I had not the least idea of any such thing; he was a stranger to me; I was called in to see him.</p>

               <p>At whose desire? - He sent himself.</p>

               <p>Please to describe the state and condition of your patient? - I was called in the 28th of September, in his last illness; the itch had left him for a fortnight or more; he complained of an astma which he had had for some years; I did nothing for that.</p>
               <p>How long was it after you had left him, that you heard of him again as a patient? - The 28th of September.</p>
               <p>Did he at that time make any complaint of any injury sustained by him, in consequence of his confinement in the strong room? - I never heard any thing of the strong room from him.</p>
               <p>In your judgment what occasioned his death? - A fever.</p>

               <p>When was that? - After the death of Mr. Hart; I lived there, and eat and drank there myself, that I might let my room; I lived there, and found nothing at all, any more than I do from the room I now live in.</p>
               <p>Then it was fit for habitation? - Clearly so; he was hurt, not from the room, but from the manner of living in the room, by drinking spirits, brandy, and wines, from the time he got up in the morning till he went to bed.</p>
               <p>How did he get supplied with those things? - By his friends, that were then prisoners.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the coroner's jury fitting on his body after he died? - Yes; as the coroner's inquest were coming down stairs, after they had set on the body, after they had viewed the body, I heard Mr. Jacques and Barclay, Mr. Jacques particularly hallooing out, gentlemen, he was murdered! he was murdered! he said so several times.</p>
               <p>Where was that? - It was in the third gallery in the Fleet; Mr. Hart was in the top gallery; and they had come down into the third gallery, and were going down.</p>
               <p>Was Barclay with him? - Barclay was not with Mr. Jacques, but he was in the same gallery with me; he said as they were going down stairs, just in the same manner.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to these two gentlemen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150170"/>on their conduct? - I was afraid of saying any thing; upon this Mr. Barclay went for the defendant, Jackson, who came forward and said that he was murdered, and that the warden of the Fleet might as well put a pistol and shoot him; these were the words as near as I can recollect; I did not choose to reply.</p>
               <p>Have you ever heard Mr. Jacques and Barclay, or either of them, say any thing with respect to Clipson, or their conduct with respect to Clipson? - That is all I can recollect.</p>
               <p>After Hart got out of this strong room, in what manner did he live then? - Why, drinking; I have seen him in an evening drink five or six or seven glasses of brandy and water; he was, upon the whole, in my opinion, a very intemperate man; I do not know who paid the expences of the prosecution against Clipson.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. You then was not in a state of confinement in this strong room? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Therefore you went out for air as much as you pleased? - I went out, but I was at work; I was in there in the winter time; my windows were glazed.</p>
               <p>Many persons made no scruple of saying it was their opinion Hart was killed with this strong room? - I do not remember hearing any other persons but Barclay and Jackson and Jacques.</p>
               <p>What age was this man? - I really do not know; two or three and forty.</p>
               <p>An old man? - No.</p>
               <p>What state of health was he in? - When he was not drinking he was in bad health; he had always some disorder.</p>
               <p>Was not he visibly worse than when he went in? - I think he was, for he was with Mr. Lille; he was either always ill or always drinking.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, do you think he was not the worse for being confined in that room? - I cannot say so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. You have just said you heard Mr. Barclay and me say he was murdered, when the coroner's jury were coming down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You heard me declare it then in a very public manner? - Yes; you was very busy about it.</p>
               <p>Who was present there? - Mr. Moore was there.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I am an artist.</p>
               <p>Have you a house in London? - No, Sir; I am a prisoner in the Fleet.</p>
               <p>Do not you keep a house any where? - No.</p>
               <p>Does not your wife? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor any lodging? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor have not lately? - About eight months ago.</p>
               <p>What was that house? - A house that was let out for lodgings, that I used to work in at the time I was not a prisoner.</p>
               <p>To what sort of people? - Sometimes to gentlemen; sometimes to ladies.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Was not the strong room put into a state of reparation previous to your going into it, such as being glazed, and appeared different to what we had? - There was a casement put in, because it was November; but there were shutters at the time when Mr. Hart and me were there.</p>
               <p>Did you sleep in it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there a privy in it? - Yes.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Are you a prisoner in the Fleet? - Yes, I was, at the time of Hart's death; I remember his being in the strong room; I knew him before he went; and his habits of life were very irregular, as drinking hard while he was in the strong room; he used to drink a deal of liquor and wine.</p>
               <p>Was this strong room a cold, damp, unwholsome place? - I lived next room to it at his death, two years, and it never hurt me; people have lived in the strong room six months, and not been hurt.</p>
               <p>Was it at that time in a state in which a man might live in it without any visible danger? - I do not know: I remember having a quarrel with Clipson: Barclay came into my room once, and he said to me he was going round the house to get a subscription with respect to an indictment of Clipson; I told him I was not in a capacity<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150171"/>to give him any thing; I made application to Jacques, that I thought Mr. Clipson used me ill in taking out a bottle of brandy; and I had a bottle of ketchup, and I broke that; so they took my room from me for it; I went to Mr. Jacques and asked him what I should do; and Mr. Jacques said there is a better way than indicting him, that is, to make an affidavit that you gave Clipson seven shillings or half a guinea a week to permit you to sell liquors in the gaol; upon that I looked at Mr. Jacques, and turned from him.</p>
               <p>What did you mean by that? - I did not like to hear such a thing as that.</p>
               <p>Then it was not true? - No; I never gave Clipson a farthing.</p>
               <p>Had you ever represented it to Mr. Jacques, that you had given money to Clipson? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Did he explain to you what effect your making such an affidavit would have on Clipson? - He said Clipson would be fixed for it.</p>
               <p>You refused to perjure yourself? - No, I would not do any such thing.</p>
               <p>Have you ever heard Mr. Jacques or Barclay say any thing with respect to Clipson, what they would do to him? - No, nothing particular.</p>
               <p>Do you remember Hart's shewing you any medicinal girdle he had? - After he came out of the strong room about a fortnight or three weeks, or a week, he pulled up his shirt, and he was broke out all over like a leper, says he, this will be the death of me; I looked at him, says he I have put on a girdle, and I am very ill; I went up one time after; I saw him, and he was hardly sensible enough to speak to me; he said he used an ointment; and he said he catched the itch with laying with Jackson in the strong room.</p>
               <p>What was his complaint? - The complaint was the itch; I believe he might live about four or five days or a week after that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Were you intimate with Hart before he was in the strong room? - For five years.</p>
               <p>Did you join in any petition about Hart and Jackson? - There was a petition drawn up, and brought up to us; and a parcel of us swore to it; I believe that disorder of the itch was the death of him, and nothing else.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. What are you, Mr. Freeman? - You know me very well; I was bred a butcher.</p>
               <p>You are brother to Chase Freeman, the attorney? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How have you got your living for some years past? - Many years I lived on my own estate; then when I lost that, which is about nine years ago, I rented one; I have lived this nine years by my business, by butchery, and dealing in cattle, buying cattle by commission, and buying horses by commission.</p>
               <p>You bought horses and cattle for your brother too? - No, never; we might buy a horse and cow together, but not these several years.</p>
               <p>You kept in the Fleet prison a kind of brandy shop? - Why I might have a glass of brandy in the Fleet prison.</p>
               <p>Clipson came down one night to your room, and seized it? - He did.</p>
               <p>Did he make use of any pistol? - Why he brought a pistol, but did not make use of it; to be sure he said, if I did not desist, and let him take the liquor, he should blow my brains out.</p>
               <p>Then you came up to me and told me? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>You met me? - No, I did not meet you; I saw you the next day; then you said I should fix the warden, and fix them for bringing the liquor in.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that? - Yes, swear it! I should not come here without swearing it.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear positively that I told you to make affidavit that you paid to Clipson seven shillings a week? - To be sure you did.</p>
               <p>For what purpose? - You know best; you said it would be better to make an affidavit, than to indict him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150172"/>Did you ever give him seven shillings or half a guinea a week? - No, I never did.</p>
               <p>How many prisons do you happen to have been in? - I was brought up under a decree, because I would not sign an estate away; and I put myself into the Fleet; I was in Warwick gaol for debt, a little matter of Lord Sandy's, about seven pounds ten shillings; and in Worcester gaol about an estate.</p>
               <p>You never was in any other gaol? - I have been in many a gaol, backwards and forwards, but not to stay.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you ever in any other gaol as a prisoner? - Yes; I have been in another gaol in Gloucester.</p>
               <p>For what? - Why I was brought in there upon a matter about a person; you see, the value of a five guinea matter.</p>
               <p>Explain to the Court for what was you in; for a debt, or for a criminal charge? - Why not for a criminal charge.</p>
               <p>Was you there for a debt? - A man said I laid hold of five pounds that did not belong to me, for a wager; I borrowed it, and the man had a note of hand for the money.</p>
               <p>Then you was on a criminal charge? - I had won five guineas of a man; and the man said I took it up before I won it; and he took me up on a warrant; I never was in any other gaol; that I swear.</p>
               <p>Was you never charged with horse-stealing? - No, nor cow-stealing.</p>
               <p>Was you never charged with any other fraud? - No; nor that is no fraud.</p>
               <p>You swear you never was in any other prison than Gloucester gaol, Worcester gaol, the King's Bench, and the Fleet? - That I swear positively; the King's Bench I never was in.</p>

               <p>I have been a prisoner in the Fleet two years: I know Jacques and Barclay; I heard Mr. Jacques insult Clipson three times, twice upon the stair-case, and once in the hall gallery; the first time was, Clipson was coming down stairs with his hands behind his coat: Jacques says, you rascal, you have a knife there to stab; Clipson took out his hands, and said I have no such thing; Mr. Jacques said, you lie, you rascal, I will never leave you till I ruin you; this was after Jacques was locked in as a close prisoner; I think it was before the death of Hart.</p>
               <p>Was it before or after Hart had been confined in the strong room? - I think it was before that time; the expression Mr. Jacques made use of, was, that he would never leave him till he had ruined him.</p>
               <p>After the death of Hart, did you ever hear Jacques or Barclay say any thing about the prosecuting of Clipson, or the death of Hart? - I know the next time they met on the stair-case, and Clipson was whistling; Jacques said, you are whistling now, but you will squeak at the gallows by and by; the third time was, they met in the hall gallery, and there was rogue and rascal and villain called; and a number of people gathered round, and me among the rest; there Clipson said, you accuse me wrong; you are a rogue and villain; and Jacques called him rogue and villain; and Jacques said he would have new turnkeys and a new warden, for he would ruin them both.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear Barclay say any thing on the subject? - Yes; I was at the club when Barclay came into the coffee-room; that is twelve or fourteen months ago; Hart was alive and there; I think Sir

               <p>Was that the evening that Hart was confined? - No; Hart was not put in the strong room, I believe, till the next day.</p>

               <p>Have you ever had any idea that that strong room occasioned the death of Hart? - None at all; Hart was a very ailing man, and he caught a nasty itch, as it was reported, by sleeping with Jackson; he stunk so of brimstone and nasty disordered stuff, that I was very glad I got rid of him.</p>
               <p>Had you ever any conversation with him about his health? - He always said, he was poorly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Then this strong room is the same as the others? - It has the advantage of a water closet in that room; but I have been in the Fleet two years.</p>

               <p>What are you now: you are a prisoner in the Fleet? - I am.</p>
               <p>How long? - Two years come Michaelmas day.</p>
               <p>Did not you offer to swear yourself worth one thousand six hundred pounds? - I did not; I was not asked the question.</p>
               <p>You was not asked the question, what sum you would swear to? - I tell you again I was not asked the question.</p>
               <p>What sum of money are you in the Fleet for now? - Eighteen pounds.</p>
               <p>You sued for your groats, I believe? - I did.</p>
               <p>How long is that ago? - About a year and a half.</p>
               <p>Did you give any schedule of your effects? - Certainly so.</p>
               <p>And you receive your groats? - I do.</p>
               <p>Have you not often told, that you could pay him one hundred pounds, and pulled out a handfull of gold, at the Fleet prison? - You asked me that before; I told you, I did not.</p>
               <p>Was not the strong room damp when Mr. Hart was there? - No.</p>
               <p>I believe you have frequently held clubs in that room? - Never, but once; that was two or three months after the death of Mr. Hart.</p>
               <p>How many times have you been tried in this court? - Not so often as you.</p>
               <p>Court. But answer the question? - Once.</p>

               <p>Was there any riot? - None particularly, only knocking on the table; at this time, my lord, there was Jackson, and Barclay, and Hart, and a number of others, that called themselves hearts of oak; and they determined to keep the club in opposition to the warden.</p>
               <p>Did you never hear Hart declare, that being put in that strong room was the cause of his death? - I never did; I came to see you there, and asked you to make a concession; you refused that, saying, you would not on no account; and that you would not take five hundred pounds for what you should get of the warden.</p>
               <p>Was I not in good health then? - You never looked very well; you always had a sickly look with you; you had a very disagreeable smell with you; I wished you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150174"/>away, and your wife the same; I was afraid of catching it; I remember you had a combustible disorder about you.</p>
               <p>Did I appear to be worse when I came out than I was when I went into the strong room? - You never appeared well; I did not see any difference in you, for my part.</p>

               <p>Mr. Jackson. The knife before me was a pocket knife? - I believe it was.</p>

               <p>You was a prisoner in the prison when Hart was confined? - I was.</p>
               <p>Have not you heard Hart solemnly declare, that he verily believed the confinement in the strong room would be the cause of his death? - I do not recollect hearing him say so; but I have heard others say that he said so: I do not remember that I ever said that strong room was the cause of his death; there was a great deal of conversation about it; I might have expressed it; but I do not recollect it.</p>

               <p>I believe you was one of those that signed a petition to Lord Loughborough? - I signed one or two; I swore to my belief of the contents.</p>
               <p>I suppose you would know it, if it was read to you.</p>
               <p>(The affidavit read of all the parties. The petition to the judges read.)</p>
               <p>You recollect swearing to that affidavit? - I remember swearing to some affidavit.</p>
               <p>Do you remember saying after Mr. Clipson was indicted, publicly in the presence of Mr. Lloyd and Mrs. Lloyd, that you would be at the expence of a habeas corpus, to take yourself up to go against Clipson, if nobody else would, for that your evidence would convict him? - I never said I would be at the expence; but I said, if Clipson merited what was said of him, that I would contribute towards the prosecution of him.</p>
               <p>Do you not recollect saying, that if no other person would go on with it, your evidence would be sufficient to convict him? - I never said I knew enough.</p>
               <p>Did you never say any thing like it? - I said I would join in the prosecution.</p>
               <p>Then you considered there was cause for prosecution? - According to what I had been informed; I cannot recollect whether it was before or after the indictment; but I certainly did believe at that time that there was cause for prosecuting Clipson.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. Have not you frequently heard me declare at the time that Clipson was prosecuted, that I would have nothing to do with the disputes of the prisoner, as I was no prisoner? - I have heard Mr. Jacques declare when he was brought in a second time, that he did not consider himself to have any right to make that affidavit, or sign the petition, because he was no prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Was you present at the time I was put into the strong room? - I was.</p>

               <p>No more? - I knew nothing about his being carried in, till afterwards; I came at his first accusation; I was called here before the gentlemen; and I was examined; Mr. Jacques applied to me twice; I was big with child at the time: I was taken very poorly, and I went home; and he asked me to come again, and I did; and he told me to stay till I was called for, and to speak the truth.</p>

             called.)</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Garrow. I am no friend to converting civil prosecutions into criminal ones. There is no doubt but that you have given a strong evidence of a very malicious prosecution; and of a very malicious prosecution, with very little, if any probable cause; and that evidence would entitle you in a civil action, to recover damages against the parties by whom that evidence was offered; but it is not enough that the parties happen to be poor; it is not enough that the parties happen to be prisoners, to warrant the turning that civil remedy into a criminal prosecution. You have been obliged to insist, that this false and malicious accusation, without probable cause, was by conspiracy between these people. Now, at present, I do not see very distinctly where the evidence of the conspiracy is; the only thing that strikes me as material to that purpose, is the declaration proved by you, as to what was to be done by Jacques, after Hart had been in the strong room, and before his death; that declaration, that this would be a damned good business if Hart should die, for that it would lay a good indictment against Clipson or the warden, for murder. There is a good deal of malevolence in the expression, supposing that this man would proceed to the utmost that he could, in order to support such a prosecution; but that declaration is no conspiracy, because it is his own declaration; it is his individual act; it is true, he says it to Barclay; but Barclay is not involved in it by any answer he gives. The ground that they take, is a distinct ground, namely, that Hart had been in a place, which it now plainly appears they had considered and represented to Lord Loughborough as a bad place; it is also clear that Hart was in such a state of health, that violent, ill-tempered, malicious people might very well hasten to a conclusion that was not just, namely, that this would be murder in the warden: but I do not find that there is any thing like private concert; that there is any proceeding that has led any body to say any thing that was not strictly true; and however erroneous, false, and malicious, yet it was conducted publicly and strictly: and it is particularly taken notice of in the depositions before the coroner. Then this is a case in which it is said, there has been a constructive murder, on the part of Clipson, the officer in the Fleet; the fact of this construction is true; that he was confined in a place very likely to prejudice his health: this was a miserable debauchee, drinking twenty-four drams, or glasses of spirits and water, before dinner: it is a more rational thing, to attribute his death to intemperance; but yet it is a matter open to discussion; and it was more likely to prejudice the health of such a man: I do not mean that the officers are not to keep the prisoners in order; and if a man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150179"/>was allowed to say I am too ill to be restrained, it would put an end to all regulation. Now they have thought fit to bring this case before a jury; and in my judgment there would be evidence to go to a jury in a civil action; but I do not myself see the evidence of the conspiracy, which is to turn a civil remedy into a criminal prosecution; and which I shall always expect to see, because I abhor the idea of converting a civil remedy into a criminal prosecution; and though this happens to a man who has already shewn a disposition to conspire; yet if you think you can sustain the ground of the conspiracy, in that case I will go on; if not, it is unnecessary.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My lord, whenever any observation comes from the bench, that I should much better serve the interests of the public by bowing immediately and implicitly to their opinion, than by setting up any imagination and conjecture of my own, if I could prove it; and after the patient enquiry which has been continued; and upon the whole, the prosecutor having already had the vindication of the jury of his country, in his acquittal; I have no difficulty in saying, I have felt the pressure of your lordship's observation.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. My lord, I beg your pardon. Standing loaded with prejudice, as I do, I wish to go into my defence: I have a great number of witnesses brought here at a great expence; I am loaded with prejudice: God knows, I shall be loaded with still more from the observations, I fear, of your lordship, unless my defence is heard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My lord, I ought to say that it is hard that some of the other defendants, if they wish to avail themselves of the mercy of your lordship, and the acquiescence of the prosecutor, shall not avail themselves.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. I wish for myself to go on: but I wish for the other defendants, that they may be acquitted, as they were indicted only that I might not have the benefit of their testimony; if they are acquitted, I will call them as witnesses.</p>
               <p>Court. There cannot be a partial acquittal.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. Will your lordship pardon me. If it had been a prosecution in the common way, and there had been no evidence whatever given against any of the parties that stand indicted with me, I submit whether in such a case, those gentlemen that stand indicted with me have not a right to take an acquittal; and whether I am not entitled to the benefit of their testimony.</p>
               <p>Court. In this case the evidence is against all the parties.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. Does your lordship conceive that there is any evidence given against Mr. Arnold?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I mean to insist to the jury, in reply on Mr. Jacques, that there is no evidence irresistably strong, as against Jacques, Jackson, Barclay, Arnold, and Apsey: now, as to Arnold, I mean to insist to the jury, that if Mr. Arnold, who stood in the character of a surgeon to the deceased, having visited him, having heard the examination of the witnesses before the coroner; and knowing that man died by the visitation of God, that he must have been actuated by malevolence when he went before the grand jury; and that he had by that act taken upon himself the public character of a prosecutor, and assumed that character for base and malevolent purposes, which he proved afterwards by deserting that prosecution; for if Mr. Arnold felt a consciousness that one of his fellow citizens died by murder, it was his duty to have come forward, and stated that in court: these are a few of the observations which it will be my duty to make by and by.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. I wish not to involve the other defendants, if their counsel are of a different opinion to me; as to myself, I think it is of consequence to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reader, Counsel for Mr. Arnold. I declare, on behalf of Mr. Arnold, it is totally indifferent whether we proceed, or whether we save the time of your lordship and the Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150180"/>Court. I think that it would be incumbent on you to appear before the Court, to shew why you did not appear: I do not think it is a pressing circumstance, but it is a circumstance.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. As it is, I certainly cannot wish to involve the other parties that stand indicted with me, on any account, however I might wish to enter into my defence, unless I could have the benefit of calling Mr. Arnold, who was the surgeon to Mr. Hart, and Mr. Apsey and his wife, who are witnesses.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen of the jury, I have delivered my opinion on this case so publicly and so distinctly, that it is impossible for me to add any thing to it: my judgment is, that the case that is proved does entitle Mr. Clipson, supposing it not to be contradicted, to a civil satisfaction for a false and malicious prosecution; but that it does not prove the crime here charged, which is a prosecution produced and concerted by conspiracy; therefore, of course, my opinion is, that in point of law, the indictment is not proved, and therefore, if you think fit, you will acquit the prisoners.</p>

               <p>Tried by the London Jury before the Lord CHIEF BARON.</p>
               <p>Court. Now, Mr. Jacques, before you leave the bar I must tell you, that I think it a most unwarrantable thing, the circulating previous to this trial (if you did circulate it) a printed account of the former trial, and a pretty strong reference to the trial that was then depending, for which, if it had been fully brought home to you by evidence, I should have thought it my duty to have censured you: therefore be so good in future to understand, that if you have a case depending, you are not to prejudice the minds of any body on that account.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. My lord, I have never circulated any letter respecting that trial, though it has been said I had.</p>
               <p>Court. I can hardly think that paper did not come from you or your friends; (holding up a printed paper, which had been distributed to many persons.) I believe the adversary could never have circulated that paper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. My lord, as to writing letters on that subject, I shall not attempt to deny, but that I have written letters on the subject of the late trial; but I have never circulated them to prejudice the minds of any individual.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If Mr. Jacques is not now satisfied, I undertake to prove, as a substantive complaint, that he has circulated a printed paper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacques. My lord, there is an observation that I trust you will permit me to make, respecting the evidence upon which I was convicted on the former trial; if that evidence is admitted contrary to law, is there no redress for me.</p>
               <p>Court. I observe that is one of the points you make in that printed paper: if it will be any satisfaction to you to know my mind about it; if what I have heard be true, that there was other evidence given of the parties being in conspiracy, I am of opinion that evidence was very properly received.</p>
