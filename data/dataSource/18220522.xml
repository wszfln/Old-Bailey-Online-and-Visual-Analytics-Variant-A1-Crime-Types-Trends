I went to his house last Sunday morning, between one and two o'clock, and found him in liquor. I heard him ordering my wife and children out of doors - I was outside, and said</p>
               <p>"Open the door and let them come out," and what he required for the time they had been there I would pay him - he opened the door and seized hold of me, and began pulling me about; he said I should not come in, and slammed the door too - I had a scuffle with him before that; he was trying to get me out, and during the scuffle I found my pocket was torn away from my waistcoat; I had 14 s. 6 d., and some half-pence in a stocking in that pocket - I do not suppose that he knew that I had any money. I had received it from Mr. Maunday on the Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Your family remained inside - A. Yes. I said if he would give me my money I would go away, and if not I would fetch the watchman; he said he had no money of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182205220004"/>mine - I said.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not come at half-past ten o'clock and break all my crockery - A. I broke three plates of my own in taking down the bird cage - my wife was then out with his wife. I went again between one and two o'clock to seek for my wife, and found him at home threatening to turn them out. I sleep in a stable about three hundred yards off.</p>

I took George - I drove the two donkies behind them; we came on about quarter of a mile, when George left William, and came to me; he said he wanted to tie the donkies together - he was with them about five minutes, and then went on; I saw that they were not tied together. I kept close, and presently a quart pot dropped out of a roll of cloth which was round the donkey; it was in a kind of pad. I had noticed a roll on the donkey's back before he went to it. I picked the pot up, and asked if he had any more; he said he knew nothing of that.</p>

            . I am an officer, and was out with Mims and Francis. Mims took Francis and followed behind us - Francis and I led George and the donkies. I saw the put about quarter of a mile from the turnpike; it fell from the donkey, from a roll on its back - I had not noticed its being bulky before. George had been pretending to fasten them together, and was fumbling about them a good while - the pot fell as soon as he left. Mims and William were behind us. I heard something fall, but cannot say it was the pot, but I saw nothing else.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If the donkies had kicked against it, it would make a noise - A. Not the same sort of noise. I was about half a yard behind the donkey. Mims was behind us, not before.</p>

On the 11th of May, I received information and watched the stand, and about eight o'clock in the morning I saw the two prisoners by the books; Porter stood between me and Oram, who was handling a book - I saw Oram go away in five minutes, and Porter immediately followed in a different direction. I followed Oram, he was stopped about five hundred yards off; I found a book in his bosom, which I had put on the stand five minutes before. The prisoners were acting together, I am certain. Porter was concealing Oram from my view - he ran off as soon as he saw me coming. He was taken quarter of an hour after.</p>

On the 1st of May, about noon the prisoner came to the shop and asked to look at some French cambric; she wanted one-eighth to match some which she had in her hand; I tried to suit her, and when I threw the cambric on the counter to cut it, I saw her hands under it moving about - I pulled the cambric away, and saw her hand go off the counter with a piece of cambric, which she put under her shawl - I took no notice, but cut what she wanted, she put the money down - I walked round the counter, and asked her to give me the cambric that she had. I lifted up her shawl and saw it sticking out of her pocket - before I could lay hold of it she threw it out on a chair, and denied having taken it; I said it was useless to say so; she immediately begged we would forgive her, as it was her first offence.

I stopped him over an area, he shuffled about, and I thought I saw something drop from him. A number of persons had come out of their houses by that time. A woman in the house brought up the chain and seals, and gave them to Mr. Lainson who appeared much hurt, and desired me to hold the prisoner - he gave no account of himself, but begged Mr. Lainson to excuse him, and look over it, and it should not happen again; he said the same at the watch-house.</p>

In two or three minutes she came down and said she had left them with her mistress, that her master was in the room, and that she was going to fetch Mrs. Taylor to see the things, and would thank me to wait a few minutes - she then went out leaving me in the passage; she could put all the things about her person without appearing bulky; she said she was under nursery maid to Mrs. Archer. I waited two hours and a half, she did not return - I found that no lady lived there. I found her three weeks ago in a house in Webber-street, St. George's-fields, and gave her in charge.</p>

On the 11th of May, I was in a public-house in James-street, Covent-garden; I had been drinking at another house and was rather intoxicated, but knew what I was about; it was between four and five o'clock in the morning - I had been up all night - a man insulted me very much, and the prisoner took my part: we had something to drink together there, because he took my part - I paid for it, I did not pull out my purse, as I had silver in my pocket - I went away and he followed me to every public-house I went to - I went to other public-houses, he insulted me because I would not give him any thing to drink - I went into the Compasses public-house, Drury-lane between eight and ten o'clock in the morning; he had been following me all that time - we had something to drink there; I treated him at every public-house, and between the parlour and the bar of the Compasses, he seized me by the waist with both his arms, and put his hand into my left hand breeches pocket - we had a great scuffle, I hollowed out Murder! as loud as I could, and held him as tight as I could - his collar tore, and he got away; the people in the house prevented my pursuing him. I was locked in by two men, and the landlord's daughter and another man. When I got up, I found my money was gone; as soon as he got the money out of my pocket he threw me down. I had eight sovereigns and a five pound note (besides silver and copper) which were in a purse - I had felt it safe a few minutes before.

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in High Holborn. I saw Jones and the prisoner together between six and seven o'clock in the morning, at the Rose and Crown, public-house, St. Giles's, gambling; a third person in the company said, if Jones did not pay what he lost, he would beat him. The prisoner kept shoving towards the prosecutor, who had a handful of silver and half-pence; he shoved him, and some of the silver fell from his hand, which the prisoner snatched up; they were wrangling. I tried to get the prosecutor out of the house, he was very drunk - they all went out together. I went to a public-house with them in King-street, and did not stop there two minutes; the beadle came and desired the prisoner to go about his business, and let me see Jones home, but he followed us to the Three Compasses; he joined us in the street before we got there. My motive in going in was to get rid of the prisoner. Jones and him wished to go into the Compasses. At the Three Compasses I saw the prisoner attempting to take his purse, which he had pulled out at the Rose and Crown. I do not remember seeing it till after he was at the Rose and Crown. He kept shuffling and hustling about him. When Jones had money in his hand the prisoner caught at it; Jones had put his purse in his left hand breeches pocket - I went out to fetch an officer from the watch-house which is about two hundred yards off. I returned in five or ten minutes and found Jones only there, who said he had been robbed. I understood there had been some disturbance between him and the people of the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say you had been out all night, drinking - A. Yes, I was sober. I saw the prisoner on the Monday following in a different dress, and did not know him till he came and asked if I had seen the prosecutor; I said no, for he had given me his direction No. 6, Basinghall-street, instead of Evans's court; he said if I would meet him at nine o'clock he would go to him with me; I waited till ten o'clock, but he never came.</p>

On Saturday evening, the 20th of April, the prisoner knocked and rang at the door; I opened it, he said he had some Irish linen to bring from a house in Oxford-street, and did not know whether this was the house; I told him to walk in, and I would ask my master. I left him in the hall for a moment, and when I got into the drawing-room I heard a noise; I asked my master, then ran down stairs, and heard the street-door slam too, and missed the clock off the bracket; he was looking at it when I went up stairs. I opened the door, and looked out, but could not see him. I saw him again on the 27th, at Marlborough-street, and am certain he is the man I left in the hall.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You could not swear to me at the office - A. I did not take particular notice of him there, but from his manner, appearance, and whole deportment, I am quite certain of him, though he has a different dress on now. I told the Magistrate I had no doubt of him whatever - there was a very good light in the hall; the clock is worth fourteen guineas.</p>

I went up to the first floor, leaving him in the passage and the door open. I asked him to sit down in the hall, he declined, but afterwards sat down. I came down, shut the door, and told him my master was not come down, and told him to wait. I went down stairs, and in about five minutes heard the street-door shut; I supposed that my master had seen him, and he was gone. About half an hour after, my master asked me about a roll of broad cloth which I had taken in the night before. It was in the cutting-room at the end of the passage when he came: I looked and it was gone. I am certain he is the man. The cloth is worth 14 l.</p>

On the 7th of May, about half-past nine o'clock at night, I was in the Strand, going towards Charing-cross. My watch chain hung out, the prisoner ran violently against me, with his elbows against my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182205220011"/>breast, and pulled at my chain which broke it, and ran off with it; I lost part of the chain and two gold seals. I hit him with my umbrella; he ran down Milford-lane - I pursued and knocked him down, and secured him without losing sight of him. I asked him for my watch-chain and seals, he said he had not got them. I do not know what became of them, I do not think he could pass them to any one; I suppose he might have dropped them; I saw them in his possession. He pulled me a step or two before the chain gave way. I cannot say whether he had complete possession of them after he separated them. After taking him to the watch-house, I returned to the lane, and the people were looking with a candle for them; he could have thrown them away without my seeing them. I am sure he ran against me on purpose.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Raven-row, Spitalfields. On the 8th of April, I was called in to attend on Barrs; I found him in bed at his own house with several cuts on his head - he had evidently lost a great quantity of blood, and was particularly bruised about the legs and groins. The wounds on the head might have been inflicted by a stick - he had a wound on his left arm, which appeared to have been done by a prick or a sharp instrument, and was as likely to be done by a pricker, which they use to goad beasts with - I only saw this one prick; it was certainly not a wound at all likely to produce death.</p>

             was with me; I did not know her before that day - I was there about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes. Yatton was there with six or seven more. I pulled out my watch to see the time, and left the house about half-past eleven o'clock, and went into the George and Dragon, public-house, Cartwright-street, kept by the prisoner Brown. Jones was still with me - I saw Yatton there again with other people; I rather think they were the same I saw with him at the public-house, as the people had followed me out of the house. I called for a glass of rum and water, and just as I got in, in came the prisoners with six or eight others, and began shoving me about, and knocked my glass over - one said to the other,</p>
               <p>"You have knocked the gentleman's liquor over," I said never mind the liquor if the glass is not broken - I called for another glass, and had scarcely got it before they all seized upon me - they cut my fob from my breeches, and bound me down quite tight, with my arms fast down to my side; I cried out</p>
               <p>"Landlord spare me,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182205220012"/>they are robbing me" - the landlord said,</p>
               <p>"Go it you ***," they nearly strangled me, and when I came to myself, I found both my pockets turned inside out, and my watch and seals taken away, and 5 s. and a half-crown piece. They then all went out; I can swear to Yatton and Brown - Yatton assisted in holding me down; Brown kept saying</p>
               <p>"Go it! Go it!" he stood behind me, and one hand held my head back, I cannot say it was his hand - I did not see him standing behind, but I could hear him; he was just behind the settle where I sat. When they were gone, I said to Brown,</p>
               <p>"They have robbed me;" he said,</p>
               <p>"Have they." I said I did not know what to do for my property, and declined leaving the house directly, and so he took me by the shoulder and shoved me out, saying I had better go. I wanted his assistance to get a watchman; I told him so - he opened the door and shoved me down the steps and so I went away. I cried out Murder! and robbery! I went to the watch-house, and they told me to come next morning to Worship-street; I have not found my property - I had seen Yatton before that night; I saw him again at Worship-street on the Tuesday. I was sober when I went to the George. It was about one mile and a half from my house. Two men shewed me to the watch-house.</p>

I staid there drinking half an hour; I went with her to five or six other public-houses, and drank at all of them. I had been walking about the streets till eleven o'clock.</p>

A woman in my room, said three suspicious characters had ran out of the dray yard - I looked and saw them return to the gate, one went up the yard with a rough great coat on - I opened my door and saw him come down the yard with his great coat off, and something wrapped in it, and with an oath he called one of the other two to lay hold of it; the prisoner laid hold of it - I ran across to seize the other but could not; I then followed the prisoner, he ran off, and threw the property on my toes - I secured him two hundred yards off. I found the great coat contained three pieces of copper pipe, and a cock, they had been wrenched off the wall leading from the boiler - I think they had wrenched it off before I saw them. It was all safe a fortnight before - it matched with what remained; it was fresh broken.</p>

I locked it up myself; he drove it to Warburton's - I paid him the fare, and forgot to take out the box, it was on the front seat, he had put it there himself; he sat us down about half-past four o'clock, and in a quarter of an hour I recollected the box; I am not certain whether his number was 860 or 862. About twenty minutes past eight o'clock I saw the coach on the stand at Cornhill, and knew it. I looked in, and the box was gone; the prisoner was fetched to me as the driver - I knew him directly, and told him I was sorry he should have drove off with my luggage, and asked if he had not set me down at Mr. Warburton's, he said Yes. I asked what he had done with the box of clothes and my great coat, he said he knew nothing about it; I collared him, and said I would insist on having it. I gave him in charge. The beadle got into the coach and searched it, and the whole of the property was found except a pair of slippers, and the box was broken all to pieces.</p>

I shewed them some on cards; they stopped about ten minutes and bought none. I shewed them three cards, they returned the first two - Bury had the card in her hand last; I told her there was one missing from the third. They had each tried on rings; she said she knew nothing of it - there ought to have been nine rings on it. Mr. Hatton came in and they were both taken into the parlour, and an officer sent for; the ring was not found; they refused to be searched except by a female, but the officer at last searched them; they only had one shilling and a farthing in money.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was in Giltspur-street and saw Mrs. Mountain's son ordering the prisoner to bring back his load of dung; he took it back, and I followed the cart into the yard and found a truss of clover in the cart covered over with loose hay; he said he did not know how it came there; the clover was counted in the loft, and two trusses missed - another truss was found in the other man's cart.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mrs. Mountain. A load of clover came in on this day, and was put into the loft. I saw the prisoner loading the dung; they must go into the loft to get the clover. There was a ladder leading to the loft - I found the truss in the prisoner's cart covered with loose hay, meadow hay. I counted the trusses of clover, two were missing, and one was found in each cart; they were of the same quality, it had been delivered half an hour before the prisoner came.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A strange man in the yard helped us to load the dung. The hay was put into our cart without our seeing it - the dung smoked.</p>

On the 12th of May, I heard her husband go out in the morning; I heard nothing uncomfortable between them. I have the parlour and shop, and they have the one pair - I could hear all that passed in their room. I saw the prisoner about a quarter before eleven o'clock; she rapped loudly at my room door; I opened it, and saw her in a kind of frantic manner; she repeated many times,</p>
               <p>"I have done it! I have done it! Send for an officer; I want to be hung; I must be hung; I have done it to be hung;" I said</p>
               <p>"What have you done?" she said,</p>
               <p>"I have killed my child, I have cut its head off." Seeing her in that frantic state, and throwing herself about, and pulling her clothes about in a wild manner, and foaming at the mouth (froth came out of her mouth) I said,</p>
               <p>"Poor thing you are agitated, I will send for a doctor;" she repeated</p>
               <p>"Send for an officer," and shewed me her hands, which were all bloody, and she kept licking the blood off, saying,</p>
               <p>"Send for an officer." She asked for a cloth to wipe the blood off her hands. Her manner was wild all this time; she was stamping. I gave her a dry cloth; she looked about as if looking for water, and forced by me into my room - she then took the lid off a saucepan, which was on the fire, and then wiped her hands with the cloth; the steam of the water was then ascending over her head. I immediately went into the room, and she said,</p>
               <p>"Send for an officer; now the blood is off me, take me - hang me;" she was still throwing herself about, and pulling he clothes, and stamping - she looked so wild that I was afraid of her. I ran out of the room, and she followed me, and called for an officer again. When I went to the front door, Cranch the officer was there - she kept calling in the same wild manner, saying,</p>
               <p>"Take me away, and hang me;" she said to the officer,</p>
               <p>"I have done it, take me away." When the officer laid hold of her arm, she said,</p>
               <p>"I don't run away, I did it to be taken." She was taken away in about five minutes. She was a kind, and good mother to all her family.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Have you the least doubt of her being insane at the time - A. I am positive she must be insane.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you observed that she was fond of that child - A. She was kind to them all; it was rather a delicate child - she suckled it at this time. I had thought for five or six weeks before, that she seemed to walk in a low, desponding state. She went to a place of worship every Sunday, and was rather of a religious turn - she was sober; she appeared deranged. Nothing occurred to put her out of humour that morning - if there had been words in her family, I must have heard it. She had been attempting to wean the child for three weeks - it often happens that at that time women have a milk fever. She said she had taught it to eat a little, but still gave it the breast at times. I had advised her to wean it as she looked poorly, and about a fortnight before she said it was such a delicate thing she could not bear to wean it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then she suffered it to prey on her strength rather than hurt the child's health - A. Yes. She spoke very affectionately. Giving the milk now and then would cause the milk to flow into the breast, and keep it fuller than if she suckled it entirely. The fever would be more or less violent according to the quantity of milk - I told her I thought she was hurting herself, by suckling it; she said it was such a delicate little creature, she could not go on with weaning it.</p>

            . I am a special constable of Bethnal-green. I was sent for, and got to the house about eleven o'clock, and saw the prisoner standing by the side of a man in the passage - the man said,</p>
               <p>"I want an officer;" I said</p>
               <p>"I am one" - he said</p>
               <p>"Then I give you charge of this woman, she has committed Murder!" she said,</p>
               <p>"I have done it! I have committed wilful Murder!" Dudley came in in the interval, and I gave her in his charge. I went up stairs to the two pair, which was a weaver's loom-room, and at the top of the stairs I saw a child laying with its head severed from its body; the head laid about a foot from the body; and several streams of blood had flown from the body; a razor laid in one of the streams, which I produce - I immediately returned to the prisoner, and said,</p>
               <p>"You must go to the watch-house;" I took her there, and at the watch-house; I asked the cause of her committing so rash an act - she said she had been very uncomfortable in her mind for a long time; that she had received the good things of the Lord, but had lost them - that she had attempted to hang herself three weeks ago, but she could not. I asked if she had attempted to kill her child three weeks ago; she said she had thought of it, and attempted to hang herself that morning to the loom beam. I asked why she committed this act on the youngest in particular; she said she took the youngest because she could do it the easiest.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you not obliged to put her on a strait-waistcoat that night or next morning - A. Next morning, she was quite outrageous - she had much more strength than I should have expected from a woman of her appearance.</p>

               <p>"I have cut my child's head off;" she caught hold of my coat, and said,</p>
               <p>"Don't you go up, I have cut it right off, and don't you go up," still holding me - I rushed from her, and ran up stairs, and saw the body about a quarter of a yard from stairs. I came down and she was in custody. Before I went up she said,</p>

I went to her at the watch-house afterwards, she then looked very wild; this was between three and four o'clock. Her father-in-law, two of her brothers-in-law, and her sister-in-law were with her; I took her hand, and said.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Mountford, how came you to commit this rash act on your child;" she said,</p>
               <p>"I want to be hung." Her hands and eyes kept moving about; she said,</p>
               <p>"I want to be hung, for I am tired of my life." She spoke in an agitated way, and repeated it once or twice. I asked if she would not sooner go home to her family than be hung; she said,</p>
               <p>"No." I asked if she had any particular dislike to that child than to any of the others; she said,</p>
               <p>"No."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have no doubt of her derangement - A. I am positive she could not be in her right mind; she was a kind and humane mother as ever lived, and has nine children now. I believe every sense of recollection had left her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you observed her conduct to that child - No, she was kind to all; she was of a religious turn for the last ten years; she has been in the habit of going to Meeting; and, I believe, religion and her heavy family have caused this.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's brother; when she was about ten years old an accident happened to me, and in consequence of her seeing me she went out of her mind, and was deranged for nearly a month. My mother was deranged in her younger days, and in the latter part of her life, at different intervals. I met the prisoner in the street about eight months ago, and had not seen her since, till she was at the watch-house. When I met her she said she was very well; I saw her twisting and looking back in a deranged manner, I asked what was the matter, she said, she was very poorly and did not know where she was going; it struck me that she was a little deranged.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Carey-street, Lincoln's Inn fields - I attended the prisoner two years and a half ago for a bodily disorder; I perceived her to be a woman of melancholy temper. She had symptoms which indicate a predisposition to insanity, it was a species of insanity which is at times hereditary in families, it is very susceptible to break out at particular intervals. I have known an attempt to wean a child and not accomplishing it, produce insanity; if it was lurking in the habit it would be more likely to break out at that time. When I attended her in 1819, she repeatedly made use of the words,</p>
               <p>"I have no peace at all," and in notes which I have of her case, those words repeatedly occur. I was not at all surprised when I heard she was the subject of insanity. At the time of weaning, the breast remains extremely full of milk, which always produces a degree of irritation. I believe she was an affectionate wife, and had correct parental feelings.</p>

            , who is a widow and keeps the house. On the night of the 5th of May, about twenty minutes past ten o'clock, I went to bed. My mother was out nursing; I have a child and a housekeeper. I am a widower; I fastened the door and shut the windows, and about one o'clock was disturbed by a noise in my bed-room; I had only shut my bed-room door-I laid still three or four minutes, and heard a person breathe; I drew back my curtain and saw a person by my bed-side; it was moon-light. He went out directly, and I followed him into the yard and seized him; he told me not to strike him, but to call the watch. Mrs. Sutcliffe the lodger called the watchman, and he was secured. I found two umbrellas, a knife, and a basket, moved from the passage into the yard - I suppose he had been in the yard before, the umbrellas hung outside the kitchen window. Mrs. Sutcliffe's parasol and umbrella were also there; I found the kitchen window had been pulled back, it was secure at night, shut, but not fastened. The kitchen is on the ground floor, and so is my bedroom. When we got to the watch-house I missed two shillings out of my breeches pocket, and he said he had taken them out of my pocket, they hung on a chair by the bed-side.</p>

               <p>MICHAEL M'GUIRE. I live in Wentworth-street, Whitechapel, I occasionally go into the country to buy rags, phials, and things.

I gave him part of three or four pints of beer; a young lad was with him, and my mistress was with me. I left the public-house a little past eight o'clock, and crossed the fields to go to <placeName id="t18220522-47-crimeloc251">Barnet</placeName>

When I had crossed four or five fields the prisoner overtook me, and another man; and I asked if they were going to Barnet, they walked with me about one hundred yards, then knocked me down; I got up and they knocked me down again; and his companion came behind me while I was on the ground, and took a bottle of liquor out of my pocket, and robbed me of three dozen and four oranges, and a blue purse, containing four pounds in half crowns, shillings and six-pences. The last words the prisoner said were,</p>
               <p>"If you do'nt be off I will have your life." I have known him for eight years, I did not know the other man's name, but think he was at the public-house with him. I gave information next morning, and saw the prisoner again two days after. He only knocked me down, we never had any words.</p>

I married her at the Catholic chapel; she was singing as we crossed the field, and I told her not; I did not strike her. I went to the constable, and saw his wife. I did not say I had lost five sovereigns; my money was in my left-hand waistcoat pocket - I was quite sober.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. We set out between six and seven o'clock in the morning, with one hundred and fifty oranges, and went to Cockfosters, and went into the Cock, public-house, to sell oranges. I saw the prisoner standing at the door; several people were with him - he was drinking beer; I never saw him before, but my husband knew him. My husband staid at the Cock, while he had four pints of beer - several drank out of it - we left, and were going to lodge at Barnet. We went nearly a mile through the fields, when the prisoner with another man overtook us - we asked if they were going to Barnet; he said he was, and he went as far as the field-gate with us, and then asked my husband what he was going to do with the woman, meaning me - I was singing as I crossed the field. My husband said what was that to him - he seized my husband, and knocked him down; he got up; he knocked him down again, and his companion took the bottle of liquor out of his pocket, and also three dozen and four oranges - he lost 4 l. in money. His companion said,</p>
               <p>"Come along Tom, I have got what we wanted;" Tom then said to my husband, if he did not be off he would have his life.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined Q. Did you return to the public-house to find him - A. No; we had enough to do to run off for our lives. He kept his money in his waistcoat pocket.</p>

             re-examined. I had 18 d. a dozen for all the oranges I sold, and had about 3 l. in silver when I set out. I counted my money in the field, and there was 4 l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you offer to make this up for 3 s. - A. No; I said if I could get within 3 s. or 5 s. of my money, I would go no further. I was tried here eight years ago for manslaughter. I have known the prisoner for years.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 29th of April, about nine o'clock the prosecutor came and wished me to take Beech - I sent him to my partner, and about ten o'clock next morning, the prisoner came and surrended to me; I said the Magistrate was not at home and he must come next day, which he did. If I had not known that he bore a good character, I should not have let him go.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I heard this woman cry Murder! in the fields - I went to assist her, and she said I had saved her life. She went behind him, and took a bottle out of his pocket - he put up his stick, and said he would murder her and me too. I took it from him, and threw it away.</p>

            . I am the wife of the constable of Barnet. The prosecutor came to my house between eight and nine o'clock on the evening of the robbery, and said the man robbed him of five sovereigns, which were in his breeches pocket, and that he cut his pocket-off. Next morning he said he had been to the prisoner's mother, and asked her for 5 s. to think no more about it, but she refused.</p>

I saw him next day in my shop; he did not say he had been robbed, but ill used - that if the prisoner gave him 3 s. he would not hurt a hair of his head, but if not he would prig him before one o'clock.</p>

I have seen four at Shadwell Office, in Mitchell's posesion; they are part of those I missed. They were safe at the beginning of April, I know. The whole I have lost are worth 5 l. each plate, and some of them 10 l., but none less than 5 l. I had frequently met Edwards on the stairs and when he saw me, he always turned back again. He was going towards where the plates were kept, which is separated from the kitchen; he appeared confused, but I suspected nothing then.</p>

            . I am a surveyor of the Thames Police. On the 20th of April, I apprehended Edwards at Mr. Matthews's house, about some plates, and on the 21st, Mr. Matthews made a communication to me, in consequence of which, I went to Edwards on board the Police ship; I told him Mr. Matthews had missed more plates, and asked if he knew any thing about them; he voluntarily said,</p>
               <p>"I do, I in company with another boy, took a quantity of plates from Mr. Matthew's house at different times - the first plate we took, we employed a boy named Gagger, who took the plate to a house up a court in Drury-lane, and there sold it, and brought us part of the money - we afterwards took a quantity more, which were carried by myself and another boy to the same place." In consequence of this I searched the house of the prisoner Hammerton, but found nothing there relating to the plates. I took Hammerton on board the ship to Edwards, who said,</p>

               <p>"That is the man I sold the plates to," Hammerton said,</p>
               <p>"You scoundrel, you know nothing of me;" Edwards said,</p>
               <p>"I do, you bought the plates; you gave me 6 d. a lb. for the first lot, and 4 d. for the rest." I took Hammerton in custody.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Thames Police. I apprehended Flawn in George-street, St. Giles's, on the 22d of April, and asked him if he knew what I wanted him for, he said he did not; I said I wanted him for stealing copper plates; he immediately asked if Edwards was in custody, I said he was; he said Edwards and another boy knew all about them - I asked if he ever carried any plates along with the other boy, he said he lid, to an old iron shop under an archway in Drury-lane; that he should know the man by sight, but did not know his name - I asked if he meant Shorts gardens, he said he did - I asked if he took the plates into the house; he said No, but that Edwards carried them in, as the person would only admit one person into the house at a time - that he had taken some plates on the Saturday week previous, and on that day Edwards brought one half-crown from the man, and on the Monday following he received 14 s., which they shared among them; but Edwards had the best share. I took him to the office, and he pointed out Hammerton from among six or seven other people, as the man who received them; he denied it. Flawn said the plates came from Hunt's-court, Castle-street; that he was not in the house on any occasion, but waited outside in the street.</p>

            . I am a manufacturer of copper plates for engravers, and live in Lisle-street, Soho. I think I have seen Hammerton before; I have a very strong suspicion on my mind that he is the man who called on me about the beginning of April to ask what I would give for old copper plates; it was about a fortnight before Mr. Matthews called on me; I told him the price, but he never brought any. The impression is so strong on my mind that if your Lordship said I must swear either that he is or is not the man, I should rather swear that he is.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you with him - A. About two minutes. I described him to Mr. Matthews before he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>MR. MATTHEWS. I have recovered none of this property: the value of one plate is from 8 l. to 10 l.; they were Ward's Sketchings, and some engravings; they were as good as new - the lowest value of any one of them could not be less than 8 l.; they would not sell for less than 5 l. at an auction of the trade, if fair notice was given - old plates always have the engravings erased.</p>

            . I have four plates which I got from the prisoner Gibson, in Dartmouth-street, Westminster. I first saw him on the 19th of April, about half-past seven o'clock at night, standing under an archway in Dartmouth-street, with Flawn and Edwards - I asked what they were doing, they immediately got up - Gibson and Flawn ran away; they had nothing then. I suspected and watched them, and as I came up the street, about eight o'clock that evening, I saw Gibson offering these plates for sale at a shop; I went in and asked what he had in the bag, which stood by his side; he hesitated, and then said it was copper. I found it contained four copper plates of Morland's works; he said his father had sent him to sell them; that his father was a cabinet maker, and lived at No. 9, Great Compton-street - I found he did live there. I asked how his father came by the plates, he said he took them for a bad debt of one Jameson - I asked where Jameson lived; he said it was no use to look for him, he was gone to America. I took him in custody.</p>

            . I belong to the Police Vessel. Gibson was brought there on the 19th of April - I went to his father, and next morning his father came on board. I asked Gibson in his father's presence, whether the story he told the night before of his father's sending him to sell them, was true; he said No, it was not - that his father knew nothing of the transaction - that he would tell the truth; that himself and two boys, (whom he named) had got them out of a house on Thursday, where the father of one of those boys lived; they all three took them to George-street, St. Giles's that night, and next morning all three took them to Westminster, and were waiting for the money when the officer took him. I apprehended Edwards in consequence of information, and told him I took him for stealing a quantity of copper plates; he at first said he knew nothing about them, but afterwards, that he was in company with the boys when the plates were got, but he did not steal them. He was speaking of these four plates; he named Gibson as one of the two boys. He said they were taken on Thursday night to George-street, and they were all waiting at Westminster, when they saw the officer pass.</p>

               <p>MR. MATTHEWS. They are mine. The four would cost 20 l. engraving; they would now sell for 5 l. each. I do not think Gibson was ever in the house, he might have been in with Edwards.</p>

The thieves had got in at the parlour window; there were the marks of their feet in a chair. Another man was brought back with the prisoner, but he escaped.</p>

            . The prisoner is my wife's sister, she was at our room; I gave her the watch to hang up on the mantle-piece. I was reading my book - a man was sitting by who went away between eight and nine o'clock. My wife asked me to go to bed; I asked the time. The prisoner got up and took the patchwork by the mantle-piece. I did not see her take the watch, but I saw a tea-spoon in her hand which she brought back next day. I missed the watch next morning, it was safe after the man left. My wife was sober. I did not know till next morning that it was gone. My wife did not tell me that the prisoner took it till next day about ten o'clock. I would sooner lose it than interfere with them about it.</p>

            . I am an auctioneer, and live in the Hackney Road. On the 4th of May, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I saw a cart with two horses in motion; the prisoner who drove was by the side of the cart, away from the horses. I heard people cry out</p>

I looked at the fore part of the cart, and saw a child, between two and three years old in the road, about a foot from the wheel; but at that time the prisoner was by the side of the shaft horse, and I think it was impossible he could see the child, who was on the off side of the cart; he was by the side of the horse at the time the wheel went over the child.</p>

One person who slept in the room was a companion of mine, the other was a stranger. When I mentioned it in the house the mistress sent for the prisoner, she said she was innocent, and consented to her box being searched. I had marked none of the money. Gardner was sent for, the sovereigns were produced, inclosed in the same paper as when in my box. I never gave the prisoner any money. I had been eight or nine days in the house, and never changed a sovereign while I was there.</p>

Three men besides him slept in the room for two nights, and afterwards only two. On Friday he complained of losing eleven sovereigns from the bottom of his box; the prisoner was sent for, and questioned about it; I used to attend the room, and she assisted me. She was asked if she had taken the money, and denied it, she agreed to her box being searched, which was kept in her bed room; she was the only servant. No money whatever was found, and she said she had no money whatever. Next morning about half past nine o'clock, I found ten sovereigns in a paper, wrapped in a handkerchief in the bolster, which had been ripped open, and pinned up; nobody but her slept in the bed; there was another bed in the room where I slept with my sister. This room was quite in a different part of the house, to where Cook slept. An officer was sent for, and I then told her the sovereigns were found in her bolster, she said nothing; Cook said the money was wrapped in a newspaper, but it was in whitey-brown paper when I found it.</p>

We had sent her out once or twice after her box was searched.</p>

When the prisoner returned I called him into the parlour; the officer searched him, and found duplicates of the property on him - he delivered them up, and said he took them. I have recovered the clothes by the duplicates. He slept in the room they were kept in.</p>

I hollowed for assistance, and he dropped it, and ran away - the prisoner took it up, and threw it on the bush again. The third was quite a boy, about twelve years old. I seized the prisoner, and said,</p>
               <p>"You have been robbing some poor person of their clothes;" he said he had not; he was saucy, and threw himself on the ground. I took him to Mr. Lewis's house, and the servant claimed the sheet. They were in company together.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On the 16th of April I searched a house in Dartmouth-street; the prisoner was in the back room, sitting by the fire at tea with a woman, I said nothing to him, but proceeded to search; while I was searching he came up stairs, and said it was proper that the woman who was with him should see the warrant; I shewed it to him, and said I would read it, if he thought proper; the woman looked at it, and the prisoner said he was satisfied, it was all right, and went down stairs. Under the bed in that room, I found three pictures tied in a blue table cover; I took the woman to the office, leaving the prisoner in the room. Pople brought him to the office in half an hour. He said he knew nothing of it, nor did he know they were in the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The warrant was against the woman - A. Yes; I understood she occupied the house, but found he was her husband; he keeps a carpenter's shop, in Rose-street, Long Acre; the wife carries on a broker's shop at this house.</p>

            . I lodged at Mrs. Turpin's, Dartmouth-street for sixteen months; she managed the business, and the prisoner kept another shop in Rose-street. The room the goods were found in had been let to one Brown for three weeks previous; he left without notice on the Sunday before they were found. I let him the room for Mrs. Turpin was ill at the time, and I minded her shop. He said another young man was to sleep with him.</p>

I came to London on the 15th of May, and lodged in the Hackney-road - about eight o'clock, I and my wife were going to Maiden-lane; we had each a bundle, and she had my arm; we were going along Long-alley, and when I got to <placeName id="t18220522-62-crimeloc339">Angel-alley</placeName>

I put my hand down and pulled up my watch before it broke, and these two bits I caught in my hands; it was a violent blow I received, more than the weight of a man's hand - I suppose there was some weighty substance besides the hand, either iron or stone - the blood came from my nose. I let go my wife's arm, and called Stop thief! pursuing him down Angel-alley, where he ran. I should have overtaken him, but three men stood in the alley, and gave way to let him through. One of them in an apron caught hold of me, and asked what was the matter - I rushed through them, and saw a man turn round a corner to the right; he was the same man who struck me and took my watch - Ramsay is the man to the best of my knowledge - the impress on my mind is such as to leave no doubt of his being the man. The men who stopped me were about twenty-five yards from the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call Stop thief! before they stopped you - A. Yes, and after I got through them; they were in sight when I called Stop thief, and near enough to hear me call. Greenwood was the man who had the apron on, and Bowers was with him; after I got through them, they turned to look after me; and when I lost sight of the man, I saw three or four women, I asked them for a drop of water to wash the blood off my face, which they refused. I suppose the man who struck me went into the house, but I did not see him go in. At six o'clock the next night I saw the three prisoners in the watch-house; I had described them to the officer; I knew them as soon as I saw them; it was not dusk; the alley is dark. I did not suspect he was going to ill use me, it was done in a moment; he did not speak. I noticed his face. I had not run many yards when I saw the other man; I believe Ramsay to be the person; I did not see his face after he got the watch. Greenwood hustled me, and Bowers stood on his right.</p>

I cannot swear to any of the men - I saw four men. I was agitated, but I think the man who ran away from him was taller than the prisoners.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 15th of May I was called by a boy to go to Straughton, and found him bleeding in the nose. In consequence of what he informed me I went in search, but without success. I went next day with Gregory, and found the three prisoners about five o'clock in the afternoon, at a public-house, in Skinner-street, Bishopsgate, playing at skittles - it is about one hundred yards from Angel-alley - when they saw us, I saw a change in their countenances. They went on with the game in a confused state; we took them to the watch-house. Gregory fetched Straughton - he saw them in the watch-house, and identified the whole three. They said they knew nothing about it.</p>

I had had the pony ever since the 5th of September, and I knew him by a star on the forehead, and a half circle on the hoof. My name was on the cart and is now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. What do you keep a cart for - A. My wife is a laundress, and I use it to take linen to town.</p>

            . I keep the Horse and Groom, St. John-street. I received the pony, cart, and harness of the prisoner, on the 28th of April, about a quarter before eleven o'clock. He told me to take his horse, and take care of it, and he should not be there again before Wednesday. I never saw him after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He never came for it - A. He was there for it, but I did not see him. He left it with me three weeks and two days.</p>
               <p>Q. He might have said,</p>
               <p>"Take care of this horse and cart, which a man sent me with" - A. No. He did not, I am positive. I noticed what he said, and am sure he said it was his.</p>

               <p>"I think I shall sell him, for he is hardly big enough for my cart;" I said</p>
               <p>"If you like to sell it, I will buy it, and sell you a bigger." I went into the stable, and shewed him a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182205220026"/>bigger horse, and offered him 7 l. for his. Hayford whom I had sent for, came in and took him in charge.</p>

I went again at five o'clock in the morning, and found both doors open, and the horse gone; it could not have got out without the cross bar being taken down; the yard has two gates, which are frequently left open.</p>

            . I lodge at Mr. Gladell's as servant to the first floor lodgers; the prisoner Foster lodges there. On the morning of the 28th of April I got up first, and unfastened the street door which I found fastened as usual, and the yard door as well.

My wife had been washing, and they were filled with all the linen we possessed. Foster came to lodge with us in July last, and occupied the back room on the second floor. Worboys and his wife came frequently to visit Foster. I cannot say whether I saw them for a day or two before the 28th of April. On the morning of the 28th, my little boy screamed out, I went down into the kitchen and found the drawers all plundered of every thing they had contained over night; I had seen them safe between ten and eleven o'clock; I believe I was the last that went to bed at night; I fastened the kitchen window myself by a screw, and secured it top and bottom. I found a square of glass broken, and the window a little open, but it was impossible that a hand put in there could unscrew it. I missed six sovereigns from the scrutoire, some knives and forks, an India shawl, and some trinkets. My friends wished me to search my lodgers, I declined it; but on the Thursday morning my wife's mother shewed me a brooch which caused suspicion to fall on Foster. I sent for an officer and a lock-smith who opened Foster's trunk in her bed-room; she was out and had left the key of her room with my wife's mother. I found that every thing in the trunk belonged to me; we then went into her little room adjoining the bed-room; I found that a mouse-hole which I knew was there, had grown large enough for me to put my hand in, and from both sides of the hole the officer found four curtain-pins, two irons, a blind, some sugar, five eggs, a tea caddie, and various other articles. Foster came home that night about eight o'clock; she went up stairs and found her bed-room door locked; she came down to know the reason, and the officer took her and Mrs. Worboys who came home with her; Worboys declared she was quite innocent, and accused Foster with being a base woman; they were taken to the watch-house. We got a warrant<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182205220027"/>to search Worboys. On the 2d of May we went there nearly at nine o'clock at night, and found him at a public-house close by; he was taken to the watch-house and searched in my presence, but nothing particular found. In Foster's pocket several trinkets of ours were found, and a key which she was asked about, and said it was a key which Worboys got made to fit our kitchen door. She said in his presence that on Monday, the 22d of April, when we were out, Worboy got the key made, and he assisted her in committing the robbery; he and his wife denied it. I found the key fitted the kitchen door very well, it was an old key filed. At Worboys's house we found a small bible, a towel, two petticoats, an ironing cloth, and some strips of muslin; the brooch is mine, and was taken from the scrutorie.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined Q. Did you find any thing at Worboys that Foster was unlikely to have of her own - A. No.</p>

            . I am the wife of the prosecutor - Foster lodged at the house. Worboys was continually coming to her. On the evening of the 22d of April, Foster was ironing for me all day; she was called out by Worboys in the course of the day - she was not absent long; she went out about eight o'clock in the evening, and said she was going to Mr. Worboys's - she returned in half an hour; she assisted me in putting linen away. Before we left the kitchen, we found all the linen safe. In the scrutoire there was a shawl, knives and forks, six sovereigns, and a bag of trinkets and other things. I know the brooch was in the bag that night.</p>

Another was behind me, the prisoner made a violent snatch at my chain; in doing which, I put my left hand down to save my watch, and found the chain broken, it was gone before I touched it; the watch was left. I immediately pursued the gang, they all dispersed immediately I pursued them across Moorfields, to Long-alley, and finding my watch was safe, I did not go. I heard on Saturday there was a gang of three people taken up, I went to Worship-street, the officer took me into a room; I immediately pointed out the prisoner, the moment I saw him. I had no doubt of him whatever.</p>

            . My husband is a Chelsea pensioner; we live at Edmonton On the 25th of April, the prisoners came to my house about seven o'clock in the morning, and asked if I bought horse hair; I said I did, but I had neither money to buy it nor scales to weigh it - they said they wanted to get some breakfast, and I gave them 1 s. After they were gone I took a handful of it to Mr. Booker - Mahon came again in about an hour for the money - I said I was not to give him the money nor hair, for Mr. Booker had ordered me not - he went away; I never saw him again. I gave the hair to Mr. Booker.</p>

Candy came to me - I went with her, and examined the bag of horse hair, and saw it had come from cushions or chaise backs. I found two worsted tufts in it, which made me believe they came from some coachmaker's linings; I examined our carriages, and found four or five chaise linings cut, and the hair taken out; and several cushions in the lost cut open and the hair taken out. I compared the tufts with two of the cushions, and found they matched. I produce a tuft I found in the hair, and one of our cushions. Mahon worked as a bricklayer at our factory.</p>

About six o'clock a young woman came and gave me information; I went out and overtook the prisoner about two hundred yards off, dragging a truck, with two tubs on it full of skins; it was my master's truck and tubs; I laid hold of him and asked where he was going; he said a young man had asked him to drag the truck, that the man had white stockings on, and he was to have one shilling for his job. I said the cart was my master's, and told him to take it back; he said he would take me to the man. I gave him to a man to hold, while I fetched a constable. I saw the cart safe at ten o'clock on the previous night, locked up in the stable, which is one hundred yards from the shop; he must pass the shop with it; the stable was up a court, which is a thoroughfare.</p>

Platt came into my shop about eight o'clock, and said he was as well as ever he was, except his face; he walked away eating oranges - he had been drinking; I cannot say whether he was sober or not - I thought he looked as if liquor had affected him.

I opened his head; there was an extravasation of blood on the brain, which occasioned his death; I cannot say it was produced by the fight; it was too extensive to come from a blow, it might be from a fall - I think it could not be produced by intoxication; it appeared to be from great violence, and could not have happened above three days previous.</p>

On Sunday night, the 5th of May, between nine and ten o'clock, I was sitting up stairs with my family, and heard the clock strike very loud - I think it struck eighteen or twenty times - I immediately went down stairs, and before I got to the bottom, I heard a violent thundering at the door; I opened it, and was told thieves were in the house, and that one had come out at the back window - I shut the door, and went into the parlour, and close by the window I found two hats and two umbrellas, and found the clock had been removed from the pedestal partly, it was still on the pedestal, and part of it still remained on the space it occupied before. The prisoner was secured outside the door - the two hats were moved off a nail at the back part of the room; the umbrellas were moved across the room. The thieves must have got over the rails, and got in at the window, which was not fastened.</p>

I returned between three and four o'clock. My husband had gone out in the morning and returned about eight o'clock at night.

The other lodgers sometimes go into my room; the prisoner is quite a stranger. Next morning she was in custody at the office. I have found my whittle, but nothing else.</p>

             keeps the house, and lives in it; I lodge in the back garret - the prisoner lodged on the same floor. On Saturday the 20th of April, about half-past nine o'clock, I saw these things all safe in my room, which I left about a quarter before ten. I pulled the door too, and left the key in it. I returned in quarter of an hour and all was gone. I found one of my coats at a clothes shop. I have found nothing else. I found the prisoner the same night in New-street, Covent Garden, and secured him.</p>

I found two sovereigns, thirty-seven shillings in silver, and one shilling in copper, on him. I asked how he got the money, he said if I would go into the parlour, with him he would tell me; I took him into the parlour, he said it was the overplus of work, when he came out of the Penitentiary, where he had served six years.</p>

I was coming outside the door, which is about twenty-four yards from Ansell's house; I saw four men just turn the corner coming into the court; I crossed over the road and stood at a window, and saw the one who walked on first had a light short jacket, and the second was the prisoner; he was dressed as he is now. Three or four minutes after, Mr. Ansell came walking along very quick, and said he had been robbed by four young men. I told him what I had seen; the four men went down Long-alley. On the 10th of May, Brown brought the prisoner to Mr. Ansell's shop; I was sent for. I said he was one; I am sure of it; they were running along very quick; there are two lamps by the spot, but it was not quite dark; the third man caught hold of my arm and spilt my beer, which made me notice them.</p>

On the evening of the 7th of this month (Tuesday,) I was coming through Rose and Crown-court, and saw him enter the Rum Puncheon at a little after eight o'clock; he was alone. I heard Bishopsgate bell ring eight at the time. I went towards home, and three men ran past me in Hand-alley, saying,</p>
               <p>"What a lark;" the prisoner was not one of them; this was about two hundred yards from the public-house. When they passed me, I heard the cry of Stop thief!</p>

A mob came running down the alley after the thieves, and I ran out; the prisoner was not in the house then. One Dent was there, nursing his child; Avell, Carmichael, and him, were the only persons in the house at the time. I had been in the house a quarter of an hour or ten minutes, and did not see Ottery. If Dent had been fetched out I must have seen it. I was at my door when the thieves ran by. I know Perkins by sight, if he had gone by about this time I think I must have seen him.

               <p>Q. You found out in the streets that it was blasphemy - A. No, I did not; a former conviction settled that. I was told it was blasphemy, and I swore at Guildhall that it was blasphemous.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you be kind enough to state what you understand by blasphemy - A. Speaking against God and the Scriptures. Sedition is speaking against the King and the Constitution.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner about two years. Razell lives in Haman's-place, Kingston, and Coombs at Hampton-wick. Razell came to my house one night, and asked if I would go out; I said I would, and fixed to meet him at Coombs's at ten o'clock, which I did, and we all three went across Bushey Park, and came out by Hampton-gate, and went along right under the wall towards Hampton, and met the watchman; they wished the watchman good night, and he said,</p>
               <p>"Good night." We then went up the road for the George, public-house, at Sunbury, and turned into a yard on the left hand, then came out to Sunbury, at the back part of the town, and laid down to sleep in a cart-lodge, as Razell said it was too soon to go. In about an hour and a half we went to the tallow-chandlers shop; Razell unlocked the door with something, and all three went in; the prisoners went into another room and struck a light; we had two sacks and a basket, which we filled. Razell said, as we went along, that he had been there once before, and there was a dog there, and he had got meat to give the dog; and I think he said he had a key which would fit the place. They each took a sack, and I the basket, we went about half a mile across the fields to a gentleman's house, within forty yards of the road; it was an empty house, we put the candles in the cellar there and went home. They said, we must go and get Taylor's horse and cart to bring them away next night, and I agreed to meet them at Coombs's at eight o'clock. I got there rather behind my time, they were gone; I overtook Coombs standing by the cart, just by the bridge; he asked why I was not there sooner; I said, I did not think of coming. He went on to the house, leaving me to stop with the cart till I heard a whistle, which I did in about twenty minutes, and went on till I saw them in the road opposite the house; they took the candles and basket out of a ditch and put them into the cart; we got back to Coombs's about nine o'clock in the morning, and there looked the candles over and weighed them. One hundred and twenty pounds were fit for sale; we divided the broken ones between us. I had about twelve pounds of spoiled ones that night, and left the rest there; my share was about forty pounds; my wife fetched them. Razell afterwards paid me 11 s. as my share of the others, and said there would be 5 s. more between us. I was apprehended about nine weeks after the robbery, and six or seven of the shoemaker's candles were found at my house. Coombs sent a boy home with the cart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How old are you - A. Thirty. I live at Kingston, in Caroline-place. My father is in Sussex. I have been in Petworth Gaol. I have five brothers, one of them is in Horsemonger-lane, and one in Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. How many gaols have you been in - A. About three. I cannot tell how many robberies I have been engaged in. I have gone by the names of Boxall, and King. I once escaped from an officer. I was in the cage when I told of this robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. How often did the Magistrate persuade you, before you mentioned the prisoners names - A. I mentioned it at first.</p>
               <p>Q. How often in the month of February had you crossed Bushey Park - A. Only this once, I think. The watchman had no lantern that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you the man who broke out of Petworth Goal - A. Yes; I was not re-taken, I went about the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Thieving - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Had you crossed the park with the prisoner, except on these nights - A. No.</p>

I asked if it required an answer, and went up to my master, leaving him in the passage; I returned in about five minutes and found the door ajar and him gone; the coat was missing off the nail. Three of my young masters went in pursuit. I had a candle in my hand, and am sure of him. There was no writing in the note.</p>

When I was on the ground the man who took my watch let it drop about a yard and a half from me, and I crawled on my hands and knees towards it, but he was too quick for me, and snatched it up and ran away. As I was endeavouring to get up, the two prisoners passed me - I had not seen Crawley in the transaction before; I took particular notice of him - I at first thought he might be only a person who was passing, till I saw him with Neumhier - I noticed his features, and am quite sure he is the one who ran off with Neumhier, I had seen him repeatedly before. I pursued them nearly to the top of the King's-road, crying</p>
               <p>"Stop thief!" and never lost sight of them till they turned the corner of Ivy-lane; before that I saw three young men come out of a house called the High House, and join in the pursuit. I came up in less than ten minutes to where they were stopped, and saw them in a public-house where they were conveyed, and am certain of their persons, perfectly so. The watch was shewn to me before I got to the public-house. I felt very sore for two or three days from the blow and bruises occasioned by the fall, and my hands were lacerated with the gravel.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. This was only five days ago, and you are quite recovered - A. No; I am not. Two persons rushed against me, a blow immediately followed, and while on the ground the prisoner passed me; the blow and my falling were almost instantanious, I staggered a little, the person who struck the blow and took the watch has escaped. I saw Neumhier rush on me, and then pass me, my attention was more upon him than the one who escaped. I am perfectly certain that the watch was not taken till after the blow was struck, and when I was in the act of falling; I staggered a yard and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. You at first thought the third person was only passing by - A. Yes, till I saw him with Neumhier. I had not called Stop thief when I saw him. His face was quite familiar to me, I did not know his name, they ran about three quarters of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you had such a view of them that if you had met them a month afterwards in the street you should know them - A. I think I should directly; perhaps I might have passed them a month after, and not notice them.</p>

            . I live in King's-road, Hoxton, at the High House, and am a seal skin-dresser. Last Thursday evening I was at home, and heard a noise, I ran to the gate and saw Mr. Bowerbank covered with dust, holding up his stick and saying</p>
               <p>"Stop those rascals, those thieves!" pointing to the prisoners who were about twenty yards before him; I pursued, they turned to the left, and then down Ivy-lane; a man named Rump stopped them, before I lost sight of them; it was the two prisoners. I laid hold of Crawley opposite the Unicorn, public-house, I took him into the house, he scuffled and struck me a blow under the ear, and using a bad word, he said he would serve me out when he got loose again; I let him go, and seized him again immediately, and got him into the public-house, and the other was brought in directly; Bowerbank came in in five minutes, and said he could swear to them both.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not say they turned to the left, and then to the right, down Ivy-lane - A. Yes; I did nor loose sight of them, I saw three persons in Ivy-lane; I saw the prisoners when they turned the corner; Crawley did not say that he knew nothing about it, he said he would serve me out; he said at the public-house, that I had nothing to do with it, he had done nothing.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK to MR. BOWERBANK. Q. While you were getting up and saw the two persons, was the other man running away - A. He was before; I at first thought Crawley might be a man who might assist me. He made no attempt to stop the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you such a view of Neumhier, that if he had not run away, you would have charged him with it - A. Certainly.</p>

            . I live at Hoxton, and work with Collins at the High House. I heard a hollowing, and ran out and saw Mr. Bowerbank all over dust, holding up his stick and saying,</p>
               <p>"Stop thief," I looked towards Hoxton and saw the two prisoners running about twenty yards off, I pursued and never lost sight of them. I stopped Neumhier; somebody laid hold of him when I came up. Collins took Crawley; a scuffle ensued between Collins and Crawley about which public-house they should go to, whether to the Green Man or the Unicorn; and in the scuffle I saw the watch behind Crawley, I saw it in the act of falling to the ground, it fell at his heels, and I think it must have fallen from him; a sailor picked it up and gave it to me. Bowerbank claimed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You suppose it fell from him - A. Yes. I do not think it could have fallen from any one else; I saw it fall. Collins had hold of him, and a third man wanted them to go to the Green Man; there was a great mob, but the watch could not have fallen from them, it was too near to him; I saw it in the act of falling; the sailor boy who picked it up is not here; he offered it to me, but I would not take it, and told him to take it to the gentleman. I believe it to be the same from the colour of the case.</p>

               <p>"Stop thief! Stop those rascals!" pointing to the prisoners who were not above forty yards from him. I joined in pursuit, and never lost sight of them. Sparks had hold of Neumhier and asked me to assist him which I did, and in the middle of the road the prisoners wished to go to the Green Man, and said they would not go to the Unicorn. Crawley scuffled with Collins; Neumhier tried to get to Collins, and I perceived Crawley throw the watch down; I saw it come out of his hands; a sailor picked it up and gave it to me; I gave it to the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You will not swear the watch he threw down was the same that the prosecutor claimed - A. Yes. I stood close by Crawley - the sailor boy brought it to me in the public-house in about five minutes; they would not let him come in at first. It had a black ribbon to it, and so had the one I saw him throw down.</p>

I gave a child which I had in my arms to a person to hold, then ran and stopped Crawley, who ran through the Bacchus, public-house. Sparks came up directly and laid hold of him; I kept hold of him and saw Crawley stopped; they wanted to go to the Green - Man we took them to the Unicorn; there was a scuffle between Crawley and Collins.

            . I am servant to Mr. Whitehead, of Ball's-pond. I met the prisoner Crawley in the Kingsland-road, between six and seven o'clock, a few yards from the King's-road; two more men stood behind the toll-box. Crawley turned back and went up to them, and before they went up to the gentleman, I heard them say, they would have one before an hour passed over their heads. I did not know what they meant. I saw the prosecutor standing in King's-road; they all three rushed from the box and knocked him down. I saw him fall, and was so frightened I could not call out; I saw one of them snatch the watch from his fob; that was neither of the prisoners; they all three ran up King's-road. I saw the prisoners at Worship-street next day, and was sure of them. I am still in my master's service.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You never saw Crawley before - A. No. I had no conversation with him: when I met him I noticed that he looked very pale. The gentleman did not speak to me, I was about two yards from him, he got up, and hollowed</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see what became of the watch - A. The man who knocked the gentleman down, gave it into Crawley's hands, and bid him run, and said, if they came after him they would stop them; they were close to me at the time; I saw that the watch ribbon was dark, and I thought there was a seal to it, but it seems it was only a key.</p>

               <p>"What is that to you?" and threw it at my feet; he got away leaving part of his jacket in my hand. I then pursued Grove and saw a watchman coming out of a public-house, and called to him to knock him down - he turned round and was going to strike me when I secured him. Richardson was taken directly. The basket contained lead, which I matched to the portico of Hornsey-wood House, it fits exactly.</p>

            . I lived servant with Parr. On the Saturday night that Sweeney went into confinement, Parr and West brought up a white counterpane; they both lived in the house. Parr told me to pawn it in the name of Johnson. I pawned it for 6 s. at Gorden's, in Ratcliff-highway; and on that day week when I came in, I found a blue box, a white straw bonnet, and a gown on the table, and a plume of feathers; she sent me to pawn them; I went to three pawnbrokers who would not take them in; I brought them back, and she sent me to sell them - I sold them for 4 s. 6 d. Parr told me afterwards that they belonged to Sweeney. I left her because she threatened to poison the first person who mentioned it. She said the key of her mother's door fitted Sweeney's door.</p>

            . I am a constable. About half-past seven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner with another in Harley-street; the prisoner went down the area of No. 79; then came up, stood about fives minutes and stooped, and I missed a pint pot off the rails; he went down again, and on his return took a quart pot off, wrapped it in a cloth and put it in his bosom. I followed and took it out and one from his hat.</p>

I missed a piece of print, but no one being in the shop, I let them go. Mr. Williams came in, and I pursued them down Type-street, they separated in Grubb-street, and the prisoner went through Chapel-street into a court - I secured her in Whitecross-street, but nothing was found on her; I asked if she knew the other woman; she said she only met her in the street that day. Two days after a boy gave me information, and I went next morning with an officer to different houses, and then found my property in the court she had ran through - I found the whole twenty-two yards in different lengths; some was made up into little frocks.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live in Worship-street. On the 26th of March I saw the prisoner running up Chapel-street, with a bundle under her arm, the prosecutor was following her - I saw her throw the bundle up Long-walk, by some posts up an archway - Ford took her, I was about ten yards from them. I did not tell him for he pushed me down in running by, and while I was getting up I lost him. Harper picked the bundle up, it was blue print.</p>

On the 14th of May, about half-past two o'clock in the morning, I was about three doors down Grey-street, I heard a gate rattling in Duke-street - I went and saw the two prisoners with it in their hands crossing the road; I pursued them and they dropped it. Smith said he was waiting for somebody, and Osborn said she was waiting for the coachman to conduct her up the mews. They were close together, and both had hold of the gate, which appeared wrenched off the railings, which were loose.</p>

On Wednesday the 22d of May the prisoner came into my service, and on the Friday following as she was going out for some ham I stopped her in the passage with a bundle, and asked her what was in it - she said none of my property, and forced herself out at the door. I followed, and stopped her at the corner with it; I found it contained a new sheet. She said she did not know where she was going with it. A pair of stockings fell from the bundle. I found other property in pawn.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Monmouth-street. I first saw the prisoner in St. Giles's, with two others bigger than himself. Mawley crossed into Monmouth, and as he crossed King-street, the prisoner tucked up his coat sleeves, put his hand into his pocket, and

Furzman caught the prisoner - I went up Lombard-street after the other, he slipped into Belton-street, and threw the handkerchief into a passage;

My master went out, and the house-keeper soon after; we were left alone, the prisoner called me up stairs, and told me to look out of the widow to see if any body was coming, I saw him go into master's bed-room, but did not see what he did, he told me he had taken a Jew's harp; and on Sunday he said he took his indentures and gave us 2 d. each, not to tell.</p>

               <p>"I think my master will find it out, for the handle is in the window;" the prisoner went up and brought it down.</p>
