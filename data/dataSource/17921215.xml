            ; I was awake first, and I missed the prisoner out of the room, upon which then I alarmed my husband, and I found all my property gone; mentioned in the indictment; I was ill in bed, and before I had gone to sleep, I ordered her to go down and fasten the street door, and then she came up and locked my door, and then she says to me, do you go to sleep; I don't like you to be disturbed so; I awaked some time after, and found all the property gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she get out of the room? - I cannot tell, she must have unlocked the door to be sure, but I did not hear her, I am sure I heard her fasten them.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it she locked the door? - About Twelve, near that way.</p>
               <p>Q. Who awaked first, you or your Husband. - I waked first, and waked my Husband; he was tired with his work, and I alarmed him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. As to the street door there is no lock; and they say I was with her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150004"/>but five weeks. I continued with her for seven weeks; and I ask'd her the liberty to let me wash me a few things; and as I had neither shawl nor cap, nor any thing to wear whilst I washed my own things, she lent me those things which I had on the while; and Mr. Palmer wanted me to comply with him, because, says he, I know you are a clean woman, and I will not let my wife know it; I would not consent to his compliance; so they have got this spite against me, and besides that, there was no bolt at all to the street door, and she says, she heard me bolt it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Palmer, there is a bolt, a latch and a lock.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Palmer. How was your room door fastened. - The door of my room was locked I am sure.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was no lock on the door, and Mr. Palmer came home nigh Twelve, and then I had got his supper to get, and more particularly I had the table cloth to wash, with my own things, as he was to have some company to come to dinner the next day; and Mrs. Palmer gave me an old shift, an old gauze cap, a pair of shoes, and other things, because she had not money to pay me. Now I have spoke nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Palmer. Is it true that being poor, and not having money to pay her, you gave her these things. - When she came to me she was distressed for her living. She never ask'd me one farthing, tho' I meant to pay her for her trouble; with respect to giving her my shift, or my shoes, then I must have gone without myself, for I had none other myself; I never gave the things to her; I had no other shoes but those the Prisoner took; and I was obliged to walk about my room two or three hours without a shoe, till a neighbour brought me a pair to put on.</p>

               <p>On the 31st of October last, I was going from my house in Long Acre, to my manufactory in Dyott-street, and part in New street, I believe it was a quarter before seven; I took my son along with me into High-street; I made a pause whether I should go up Dyott-street, which I have twenty thousand times, all times early and late; and within a few spaces of <placeName id="t17921215-3-crimeloc14">Plumb-tree-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. I think you say you had your boy with you? - I had him in my hand, but seeing the prisoner coming on, I was obliged to let him go to get on one side of the prisoner; but he still came against me. The watch I lost, was a gold watch, a metal chain, and a cornelian seal, set in gold.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner apprehended? - The next day I sent to Bow-street, and left the name of my watch; but I was told there, that they dare say it was christened; the prisoner was apprehended on the 15th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was going along, at what distance was it when you first observed him, - three or four paces, he appeared to me to come from Dyott-street, and met me near the top of Plumb-tree-street; and he came so forcibly, that I could not avoid him; but my eyes were upon him to avoid him.</p>
               <p>Q. What space of time might it be you observed him? - Not above two seconds, for he came against me at the rate of a man galloping Twelve miles an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before? - No, never before that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your watch ever found? - No, never; when he was apprehended, I was sent for to Malborough-street, and I saw the prisoner; this was on the 15th of November; and I fetched my son from Lewisham, and he saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the prisoner did you recollect he was the same? - I believe I recollect the very words I said at the office, when the prisoner was brought into the office, I looked at him, walked up to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150006"/>him, says I, prisoner, I have not the least doubt but you are the man, but I will not swear positively to you; those are the words I said; but after looking further at the prisoner, and seeing of him now I have no doubt at all about me; I told the justice he had altered his dress.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know in what manner he was apprehended? - He was in the custody of a constable belonging to St. Giles's parish, not on this charge, when I saw him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Since you saw the prisoner first, you have heard Sanders give an account of this transaction? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. I observe that your expression before the magistrate was, I will not swear positively to you; and so it appears, for he was only committed upon suspicion? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. It was as transient as a man's galloping at the rate of fourteen miles an hour, as you stated it yourself - except lightening, I don't know any thing so transient as this.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live at No. 12, Broad-street, Bloomsbury, I am not a police officer, on the 31st of October last, I was standing at the bottom of Vine-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was this from Plumb-tree-street? - Very little; three or four men came running down Vine-street, somewhat in great haste; I looked at the men as they passed me; there was no alarm of the robbery at that time; I took no farther notice of them; I saw Mr. Wallis about a fortnight after the robbery was done, and asked him if he should know the man that knocked him down; he gave me such a description of him, that I supposed him to be the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar, was he one of the three or four persons running down Vine-street? - I am sure he was one of them, I have not the least doubt, because I knew him a twelve month ago, and another or two of the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of this prisoner? - It cannot be of any service if I relate any circumstance.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of your own knowledge, had you known him before - I do not think he had any visible way of living; he used to use the Bedford Arms; there was a great many in society in Peter-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When they were running down Vine-street, had you made such an observation of this person so as to know he was one of those three or four - most certainly, I had been acquainted with him before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is not the first time you have been here; - it is not, Mr. Garrow.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Sanders you told my Lord, that you was not called a police officer; this is not the first time you have been a witness? - No, Mr. Garrow.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Sanders has it ever happened to you to receive a portion of a reward, for a highway robbery? - Yes, Mr. Garrow.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150007"/>Q. Was that for a street robbery. When a gentleman of consequence like Mr. Wallis prosecutes, he does not take the reward, then one gets all oneself; the reward is 40 l. I believe; how much did you share the last time? - I believe I had about 6 l. the last time.</p>
               <p>Q. On this occasion you would have 40 l. - Mr. Garrow, I did not come here for any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray Mr. Sanders was not this man about to be discharged on the subject he was taken up upon? - I asked Mr. Rumley if he had any charge against him, and whether he had had his hearing; he said no; says I he is one of the men that robbed Mr. Wallis, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray was it by your advice that the son was fetched from school? - It was not, Mr. Wallis said his son would know him perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Now it turns out he does not; that is rather unlucky; were the men going pretty fast? - Partly as fast as they well could.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other business on your hands of the same sort at present? - I have some at Hicks's-hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it last Session you received a a portion of the reward? - No I believe it was three or four sessions ago.</p>
               <p>Q. You are neither a police officer nor a parish officer, but a gentleman, having time you do this business? - It is for the good of the public.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Jury to Mr. Wallis. What time was this? - It was seven o'clock at night, as nigh as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark, or a light evening? - It was very dark; but a lamp was near the place.</p>

I did not like very well their appearance. I asked them how much they had got. She said she had got 3 s. I then took four pair of ear-rings out of the window, which were linked together. I gave them into her hand, and asked her if they were the kind she wanted, if they were I would let her have a pair for 3 s. She looked at them some time; and then the other girl, of the name of Dyke, said they are not the kind you want: you want a pair with knobs. I told her I had a pair, but they came to more money; but as they seemed poor girls, I would let her have a pair. I took a pair out of the window, and laid them upon the counter: Dyke took them up in her hand; the girl, Robinson, at the same time had the four pair in her hand; and, in taking her right-hand, and putting them to her ear, in passing her mouth, I observed she bit a pair off: I then missed the other pair, with the knobs, that laid on the counter; I caught hold of Dyke's hand, to take them out of her hand; one of them was broke, and I ran round the counter, and caught hold of Robinson who had the pair in her mouth. I had nobody in the shop but a boy. I desired her to give the ear-rings immediately out of her mouth: she said she had none in her mouth. I caught hold of her, and pushed her against a stool that was behind her: I then put my finger into her mouth and took the ear-rings out: I afterwards searched her, and found she had only a pocket-book, a few thimbles, and a 6 d. I pushed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150008"/>Robinson then towards the door, she ran away. I was going to search the other's pockets: in the interim a gentleman came in, and I was just going to tell him what happened, when Robinson returned with two women: one of them was seen to take up a handful of mud. I slipt out, and brought Robinson in again. The two women, soon as they saw a gentleman at the door, ran away. I then sent for a coach and took them to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of these two pair of ear-rings? - About 3 s. the two pair, they are not exactly new.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The prisoner Dyke was too ill to be tried, at the last sessions? - She was.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe Mrs. Parker, you desired Dyke to go about her business more than once? - I did, I was not sure that she meant to steal any of these or not.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, if she had it, she might have gone about her business? - She might, I told her twice she might.</p>
               <p>Q. Then she only had the ear-rings, but did not do any thing with them? - She had them in her hand; I thought it proper to take care of them, when I saw the other bite one pair off.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you take them from her at the time? - I did, and have had them in my custody ever since.</p>

The prisoner was with the other man that I bought the pigs of. I bought them on the 5th of November. I believe it was between eight and nine o'clock in the morning. I looked at them as they came along the road; but I told him I would not buy them till they came to the gravel-pits. They had ten pigs, and I bought six; I was to give him 7 l. 4 s. I paid him 7 l. all but one shilling; I had not enough. I borrowed some of the money. This man told me he had bought four pigs, and he was a going to put them in his stye, and I might leave mine there. I bought two first; but afterwards buying four more, I gave this prisoner a shilling to drive them off to my house, as I then thought it would be better. I saw no more of them till Mr. Winder come up.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he ask you any price? - No, because I said I had no money to buy them; this was on Tuesday; on Wednesday night these two gentlemen came and asked whether I had bought some pigs, I said no; but told them there were four pigs, that were left in my premises, that the man would come on Friday and then take them to Smithfield. On Wednesday night he was taken and sent to Clerkenwell; I did not see him afterwards; I cannot say I knew where he lived; he told me he had bought them, or else I should not let him put them there; I had known the prisoner for some time; he drove Mr. Gray's team, and worked in Mr. Gray's Brickfield.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the gardener with you when he talked of selling the pigs at Brentford market? - I took this Willis into custody directly as I found the pigs on him.</p>

               <p>I live at Southam-green; I was riding to Smithfield market, on the 5th of November, and overtook the prisoner at the bar and another man with him, with a parcel of pigs; on Tuesday before, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150010"/>saw the man with a single pig at Brentford, a pig we all thought he had stole, he had got it in a sack; it was four miles and a half on this side of Acton; I did not say any thing to them; I told Mr. Winder, at Brentford market, what I had seen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That Gentleman never saw me at Brentford, nor any body else? - I did not say I did; I never saw you with my eyes before that morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I will tell you how I came to buy these pigs; I went down to Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, on Sunday; I have a sister that lives there; I got up on Monday morning to come home, and coming on this side of Acton, I overtook this man with ten pigs; and I am sure I had no more thought of buying a pig then of my dying day, he asked me to buy some; I asked the man what he would have for four pigs, he said six guineas; I said I would give 6 l. however says I, I will split the difference; gave him 6 l. 3 s. coming along we came up to this Mr. Hunsley, he bought a couple; but he said he had no where to put them; I said he might put them along with mine. Whilst I went to feed my pigs he bought the other four; and he gave me a shilling and a glass of gin, to drive them down to his house; I am sure if I had known they had been stolen I would never have drove them down to his house; I dare say Mr. Hunsley had no more thought of their being stolen than I had; when I bought them, there were all the neighbours about; I went down to the black lion at Basewater, and told them that I had bought four pigs; I made no secret of it at all.</p>
               <p>Court to Morris. What time did you take the prisoner into custody? - On Monday night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Gillcock is my master; I work at Kensington gravel pits for him.</p>
               <p>Court to Morris. Do you know him? - No, I never saw him in my life, till I had him in my custody, as I know of.</p>

He was told, yes. He came into the counting-house, and shut-to the door. I did not at that time recollect him, because his face was painted; and he had the appearance of a person of a very ruddy complexion. He held up this pistol. - Says he, your money, or your life. I said, sir, my money! He said, sir, your money - your purse, or your life. I said I have no purse. I put my hand into my pocket, and took out 4 guineas, 4 half-guineas, 2 s. and a half-crown piece, and one farthing. I laid it upon the desk, where some half-pence were laying. - He took the chief part up with his left-hand, and held the pistol with his right. - He then changed the hand with the pistol, and directly held it up. - Now your pocket-book. My pocketbook, sir, says I. Yes, says he. - No<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150011"/>hesitation. Your pocket-book, or your life! I took this book, and laid it on my desk. He said, that is not the book. No hesitation. - Your pocket-book, or your life - and if you move or stir, you are dead, you are dead, this instant! I thought I might as well lose my life as my pocket-book; and the prisoner, just at that time, seemed rather fool-hardy. I perceived he held his pistol rather loosely - I clap'd my hand on it, and seized him by the collar. He disentangled himself from me, struck me on the head, and brought me to the ground.</p>
               <p>Court. What did he strike you with? With the pistol - he cut my head violently, and brought me to the ground. I called out, Help! - Murder! On which my servant, who was in the passage, opened the door, and came in; and the prisoner took up the pistol, and cut his head likewise; on which my servant seized him. He was a powerful man. He seized him. I called out, hold him fast, till I can get a cord to tie him. He held him fast, and I went and got a cord, and tied him, hand and foot; and when he found he was over-powered - O! Mr. Kay, says he, You know me - You know me. I said, directly, - You villain, who are you? and took the candle to his face. On which I said, you are painted, my friend, I see: on which I took the handkerchief, and wiped some of the paint off his face, first on the one side, and then on the other: and then my maid came up. - Soon after that, another maid came up; and they said, O, that is Thomas, who came after Molly! I know him. I then secured him, and sent for the watchman; and then he was secured and sent to New-Prison. I am confident, that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you known the prisoner? - About two or three years.</p>

I told him, yes: then I let him in; and, in the passage, he asked me if Mr. Kay was alone. I told him, yes. He directly walked into the counting-house, and shut the door; and in a little time, I heard Mr. Kay call out murder! and a great scuffle. I directly opened the door, when the prisoner turned at me, and knocked me on the head, with the pistol, and cut my head. I directly seized him by the collar, and held him; and I saw Mr. Kay down on the floor. Mr. Kay called out to me to hold him fast, and he would secure him.</p>

               <p>I was servant to Mr. Robinson, on the 8th of May last, we left every thing safe, that night and went to bed; a little before eleven I went round, and saw every thing was safe; I was alarmed in the morning between five and six o'clock by the ringing of the kitchen bell; I got up, and before I could well dress myself, I was alarmed by a knocking at the door; in consequence of that, I came down; when I came down to the bottom of the stairs, I saw a vast many things laying in the passage, the street door half way open with two watchmen standing on the stairs; part of the decanter of wine standing on the mat by these two doors; after that I let the watchmen in and shut the door, and went up and alarmed the house; afterwards I went down into the kitchen and I observed that the passage door, that goes into the kitchen, at the bottom of the stairs, was forced open; there was only one bar that was forced; the area door below stairs, which was fast over night with two bars, was open; one of the inside shutters was open of the kitchen window, and the sash half way up; there is a little hole in the shutter, which had been chipped round, so as to make room for an arm to be admitted through, so as to open the window, they could then take the bar up; the shutters had been forced in several places besides; I saw a candle stuck behind the door, which goes into the area, which they had taken off a box in my master's room; afterwards I went to my pantry where I used to keep my plate; I had an inventory of it; I am upper footman; the pantry is on the same floor, as the kitchen: the cupboard in the pantry was left locked, that was broke open and nothing left but two tea spoons, which they did not find; in the cupboard was a draw which I locked up the plate in, and out of which they took every thing there was; they left nothing, not the least in the world; I locked it up the night before I went to bed, and put the key in my pocket; all the articles mentioned in the indictment, were in this draw, and all were taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what was the amount of those things that were in your care? - I cannot tell, there was a considerable quantity.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any observations on the other part of the house? - Yes, I did on the parlour; the parlour is on the ground flour; the cupboard was broke open, and every thing was laying about; next I went to my master's room, which is called the back parlour, and there I saw all his cloaths laying about, his bureau was broke open where my master's cloaths lay.</p>

Just as the chaise got up to the brink of the Bar the other men got up likewise to the chaise, and one of the other two, and the prisoner at the bar, took hold of it and lifted it from behind the chaise, and I immediately ran up to the prisoner, and he and the other man had the trunk in their possession when I took hold of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure when you took hold of them, the prisoner had hold of the trunk? - Positively, I struck the prisoner with a stick, that I had in my hand, and then took hold of him, and he let go and dropped the trunk; taking hold of him he plunged away from me, and I pursued him immediately, and in the high road, opposite Bell-yard, I struck him again with the stick I had in my hand; he still continued running till he came to the end of Apollo-court, where I overtook him again, and knocked him down; I never<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150019"/>lost sight of him; I never was five yards from him; I took hold of him, and Mr. Greaves came to my assistance, and we took him to the watchhouse of St. Dunstan's; I then went to the bar, and when I came to the bar, a coachman said, here my friend, here is the trunk; he was sitting on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make observation enough of the trunk to know that was the trunk? - I cannot positively say that it was the same I saw behind the chaise; I said to the coachman, I am much obliged to you, and I took hold of it and carried it to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q Should you know it again, was it in court? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What sort of a night was it? - A bright star light night, rather remarkable light than otherwise.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not seen the prisoner before? - Yes, I had seen the prisoner before many times.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Apollo-court? - It is between Temple-bar and Chancery-lane, it turns up by Salkeild, the pawnbrokers.</p>

               <p>I am a glazier; I was in company with Mr. Bird, on Saturday the 20th of October; I was in Fleet-street about seven o'clock in the evening; I saw two men in company with the prisoner come up Fleet-street; I saw a chaise a little way before me, the horse was on a trot, and these people seemed running after the chaise, as I judged; I and Mr. Bird followed them, and when they came within an hundred or an hundred and fifty yards of the bar, the chaise had come to a walk, because it could not go on so fast for the carriages; I then saw two men turn out into the street, out of the path way into the road way; there was an hackney coach standing close by the pavement; I went behind the hackney coach, and the prisoner in company with the others had got the trunk off the chaise; I directly pursued them; one ran through the bar, and two ran back into Fleet-street; the prisoner was one; I pursued the other and he got away; I saw which way the prisoner took, and when I came up, I supposed he had been knocked down, for he was then sitting on the ground, close by Apollo court, on the path way; there was a scuffle ensued about getting him away; they tried to get him away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you loose sight of him after that? - Never afterwards till we got him to the watchhouse; the next day we took him before a magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the trunk? - I saw the trunk standing on the pavement, and a coachman was sitting on it, at Mr. Child's the banker's door; I brought the trunk to the watchhouse; I have kept it ever since Monday, when it was taken before the Lord Mayor, where it was sealed in order to be advertised.</p>

               <p>Court to Greaves. Did you hear what past? - He said you will make the matter as easy as you can; my mother is in possession of a good deal of money; there shall not be any money wanted. I told him my friend I believe money will be of very little matter in this business.</p>

               <p>I am a Silversmith, in Holborn. On Tuesday, the 20th of November, about eight o'clock at night, the prisoner at the bar called at my shop, and asked me if I would buy a diamond. I looked at it - he had got it between his fingers. - The diamond appeared rather greasy. I said, I don't think this is a diamond. Says he I am sure it is a diamond, from the place from which I had it. I asked him, what he asked for it. He said, 60 guineas. I then step'd out to Mr. Chandler's, the pawn-broker, and asked his opinion about it - and then I asked him who he lived with. He said he lived along with Mr. Goldsmid. I asked him how he came by this diamond. He said, he found it opposite the Royal Exchange. - but I should have observed, that he either said, he had given a diamond price, or it cost a diamond price - I cannot be certain<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150021"/>which of the expressions he used. At last he said, he found it at the Royal Exchange. I told him, I was afraid he did not find it there, but that he found it at his master's house. He then told me that the maids were out, and that he was 
sweeping the carpet; and underneath the carpet he found this diamond. I asked him how he could offer it to sell, he said his master had offered 10 l. reward for it. I took him to Bow-street, and have had the diamond ever since; and called at M. Goldsmid's the next morning (the diamond produced and deposed to).</p>

               <p>I am a Smith. On Saturday the 10th of November, I was employed to do some business for Mr. Austin, in the coal cellar, which has a communication with the area; this was two doors from Mr. Kastevan's - the same side of the way - about half past 5 in the evening, I observed a piece of goods, which I now produce, in the area of Mr. Austin's house. As soon as I discovered it, I got up from the area and went to Mr. Austin's house, where he now lives, while the house was repairing, and told him what had happened. I ask'd him to step over with me: he went over with me; and I took up the piece of goods, and gave it into the hands of Mr. Austin, and he carried it to his own house; and the same piece was brought back by Mr. Austin and me. - It was never out of my sight, only whilst I was climbing up the area. - After I had given it to Mr. Austin, I went with Mr. Austin to his house, I came back again with him, and threw it down again on the same place, as near as I could, in which I found it. I took my station then just within side of the coal-cellar, which was as near as possible. There was a doorway out of the coal-cellar into the area, I believe my feet were in the area. I sat within side the coal-cellar, to hear what passed, and to wait in case any body should come. - I did this by Mr. Kastevan's desire. After I had set there some little time, about half or three-quarters of an hour, some persons, one of whom I suppose to be the prisoner, came to the top of the area, and looked down, and said, there it lays - it is safe. - Are those boards fast? - (speaking to each other) meaning the boards that were laid down to prevent people from falling down before the iron-work was compleated. Another answered and said; No: they are only laid over to prevent people from falling; and these stones are rolled upon them to prevent the boards from moving. Then they went away, and in about a quarter of an hour after, as nigh as I can tell, they returned; and, looking down the area, they saw the piece of goods; they said, there it lies - it is safe; now we will have it immediately. The prisoner came down the area - the boards were removed, - He climbed down - The goods lay at the depth of about 8 or 9 feet: they were obliged to scramble down. On his getting down, I seized him, and took hold of the piece of goods - he had got it about breast-high, as if to deliver it to some one on the outside. I saw him drop pretty near to the goods; so high, that his feet touched the goods. I saw him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150022"/>stoop and take up the goods: there was a lamp near. - There was more than one person above. I roused myself from my sitting, and caught hold by his coat, and all his waistcoat collars, and dragged him about the area, and cried out for help. He struggled, and fought with me to get away, but I had fast hold and would not let him go: his companions, who were above, whom I knew nothing of, said let him go - let him come up; - we will secure him. My answer was, as soon as I see a face I do know, I will let him go, upon which, immediately, a large club was striking at me from above. As soon as I refused to let him go, they struck at me, and I got down, and pulled the prisoner down over me, in order to secure myself from the blows. Mr.

             came, and I cried out, I have got him safe. - Then Mr. Kastevan took him from me, from the area; and as soon as I could get the piece of goods up, I went up myself, to Mr. Kastevan's shop, and they consulted, that it would be best to take him to Bow-street, in a coach. I went with him in the coach. As soon as we got in, the right-hand door was opened; and there was some alarm given, and sticks striking about the coach. - And the prisoner started up, and was half out of the coach. Mr. Kastevan and I were inside the coach; and he found we had got him so secure, that he cried out, Do not hurt them. I will not go with you, I tell you. (The silk produced and deposed to).</p>

               <p>Q. When did you first go to work in this area? - That day after I had my dinner, about two or three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. And you continued working there till you saw this? - No Sir, I had orders to make a coal plate and fastenings; and which was not made till the workmen were all gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you left the work for same time? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And returning you found this piece of goods in your area.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it dark when you left the place? - It was quite dark; I had a candle to go into the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say positively no other person was in the yard, from the time the piece was thrown down by you, till the prisoner came to take it up? - there was no body but the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I saw this piece in my master's shop on the 10th about half past four; it was either the second or third piece from the door, further on in the window; I saw all that was gone in the course of the day; and this particular piece was there at half past four, when a person came in and wanted some kerseymere, and brought a piece to the door, to see if it was the colour; and a quarter after five I went over the way to dinner, to a house where the family live; I saw the window quite full; I returned from thence about a quarter before six, and saw it was gone before Mr. Newton had given information about it; I know it to be Mr. Kastevan's property, I have no doubt about it.</p>

               <p>The prime cost of this piece of silk is at 8 s. 6 d. per yard. At about a quarter past five I sent the servant over the way, to the house, to dinner, where the family reside, and told him when he came back to clear the window; I then observed the window was perfectly full: In about half an hour I think the prisoner was secured in the area; I went down and got him into my own house, and when I got him into the shop, he fell down on his knees and begged mercy; the prisoner had not the least connection with our shop; he was taken to Bow-street; I went in the coach with him; the moment the coach had turned about, a dozen yards, the door of the coach was opened, and some men appeared with bludgeons, and a cry, rescue, damn you, come out; the prisoner gave a leap; I took hold of his collar; he attempted to get away, and we secured him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I am told there is a person of the name of Cave, interested in your business? - That is two years and a half ago; There is no one interested now but my brother and myself.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the name of the public house? - I don't know the name; it was close by Iron Gate, in <placeName id="t17921215-13-crimeloc70">St. Catherine's-lane</placeName>

I don't like to go over the other side of the water; I am rather late. The prisoner was not the woman that I met; after the woman she told me, she would bring me into a very good house, and a room to myself, where I should not be robbed; I went with the woman, and I came to the house of the woman at the bar; I came and I asked her if I could lodge, she said yes, and what I must pay, she said 2 s. that was not the prisoner that I paid the money to, but the other woman; directly, or a little while after, this here prisoner took a knife and cut down all this side of my breeches, and the other woman took hold of this side, and the prisoner took the money out; I saw the money in her hand. I can say I had 10 Guineas and a half, silver I don't know how much; I saw the gold in the prisoner's hand; after she took the money, she took hold of me and throwed me on a little bed, and struck me on the ground by the temple.</p>
               <p>Q. What did this woman do with these Guineas? - She flung them on the table after they knocked me down. They knocked me down three times, this woman and the other both together; I got up again, and they shared the money between them together.</p>
               <p>Q. After they had taken the 10 Guineas, what became of it? - She gave it to the other girl; I saw her give it; I don't know how much.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her give the money to the other? - I did not; I saw it in the prisoner's hand; and I saw them count them on the table, both together.</p>
               <p>Q. After they counted them what did they do? - Then the woman went away and the prisoner took and turned me out of doors.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see her after this? - The prisoner stood with me in the room; I could not get in any more, she turned me out.</p>
               <p>Q. Now attend to me; did you go out when she desired you? - And she shut the door behind me. I stood at the door; the watchman came past directly; and I told him I had been robbed; and I told him to get an officer; and the watchman and the officer they did not come; and I staid all night by the door myself; in the morning when it was six o'clock, I sent the watchman again for the officer, and the officer came and took her up out of the room; she was searched, and there was some gold and silver found upon her; then I carried her before a Magistrate, and she was committed. I saw her before the magistrate at the second hearing, at a house close by where they are shut up, before they go in into the Magistrates; and she told me, she would give me 5 Guineas, and I should make it up; so I believe she said, she did not take any more than 7 Guineas and a half; I told her it was 10 Guineas and a half.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Q. At the time this woman ripped your breeches open, did you see her do it? - I did, she said to the man, that was along with us, that she would pay all, except a bottle of wine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You are a german, you tell us? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a long parcel of money this day? - Not this day.</p>
               <p>Q. This day you are speaking of? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money had you in the morning? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you employed in your business that day? - I was going to Holland.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the morning was it you went into the public house? - Between ten and eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. From that time till you called the watchman, how many minutes do you think, you was out of a public house; was not you drinking from eleven o'clock in the morning, till eleven at night? - I cannot tell; I went to the captain, and from the captain, I went to look for my other friends, to go along with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, had you not been drinking the whole day? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many hours in the day, had you not been in the constant state of drinking? - I had not drank a glass of liquor in five hours.</p>
               <p>Q. And you mean to tell us seriously you was sober when you set out at Iron-gate? - I was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell us how much money you had when you went to the captain? - I had 11 Guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money did you spend in liquor that day? - I don't know, I paid so much. I paid away 15 s. and I bought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150027"/>an handkerchief; I paid 3 s. 6 d. for that; and I had 12 s. in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money had you in the public house, at Iron-gate, in gold, besides silver? - I had 10 Guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you at the time you counted the money there? - No body there.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your friend the landlord at Iron-gate here? - I don't know the man.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not brought him as a witness? - I did not ask him for a witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Because he would have told us whether you was drunk or sober, when you left the house. Now you watched at this house all night, that you might know it in the morning; did not you go to another house, and insist upon going in, and charge another woman with the robbery? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never charged any other woman with this robbery? - This is the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a different thing, on your oath, that very day did not you go to another house, demand admission, and charge another woman with robbing you? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take up no other woman? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor the Constable at your desire? - No, he never did at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Bare was the man to whom you applied, and you swear that you was sober when you applied to Bare? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you tell us, that these women knocked you down, and while you lay on the ground, you heard money chinkling on the table? - I saw them when I was up.</p>
               <p>Q. You never attempted to lay hold of it? - I was in danger of my life; I sent on purpose for the money abroad, because I was not able to work.</p>
               <p>Q. When these people were counting the money, you lay on the ground? - They knocked me down, I got up directly after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the other woman went away with this money, and when you was alone with this woman, you was in danger of your life; she is such a great strapper, she could have eat you up; you was left alone with this woman; and then you complained to the watchman that you was robbed in the house; the watchman would not go into the house with you? - The watchman knocked at the door, and she would not open the door.</p>
               <p>Q. So the watchman did not spring his rattle, and call for assistance. I take it for granted you have the watchman here? - I don't know the watchman; I never saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell Bare about the watchman? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Bare found you at this woman's door? - I sent the watchman at six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You did know then where the watchman was? - I did not go away, for fear she should run away.</p>
               <p>Q. You know where to find the watchman, because you sent him for Bare? - No, I did not send him for Bare; I sent him for an officer; I did not say I don't know the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. A little while ago you said that you did not know the watchman, and yet you took him before the magistrate with you? - Mr. Bare did not tell me I was to bring him here,</p>
               <p>Q. This woman's life is to be forfeited if she is convicted of this you know, and then there would be 40 l. reward in the bargain; that would more then pay you for the 10 Guineas and a half; how came you by so much money as 10 Guineas and a half? - I received it from Messrs. Grosvenors house; my friends sent it over; I have been ill so long I cannot work.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; I was called up between five and six on Wednesday morning, by the watchman; I went to a house, No. 2, in St. Catherine's-lane, and made them open the door; I made one of the girls get out of bed; I found the prosecutor was at the door; they opened the door, there were two or three women in the lower apartment; the prisoner was not one of them; he charged a woman at this house; I told him to be very cautious; he charged her with robbing him of 10 guineas and a half; I searched the girl's pocket, and I found not a penny about her; so I told the prosecutor to be very cautious in accusing this woman, without he was positive she was the woman; then I let her go, and told her to go to bed. Then I went to No. 1, the next door; and there I went into the room; and there the prosecutor charged the prisoner at the bar; there was no one there but her; she was in bed; I knocked at the door; she got up and let me in; there was no money found on her.</p>

I gave him 10 s. 6 d. for it. I told him it did not suit me to buy it. He said his landlord was going to seize on him for rent, and that he would rather sell his own property than his landlord should. - This was what he told me, I delivered the anvil up, when I was asked for it.

               <p>Prosecutor. He had worked with me about six weeks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was a work-shed wherein I worked. It was not an house, and as to breaking, there was no such thing, because the padlock was only a sham one, to put off and on, because he was to go in at any hour the same as myself, and when I took that to the man, he said he did not care whether he had it or not; but as I was a little urgent, because I expected to be troubled in the morning afterwards and I told him if he would keep it till the Monday, I would give him half a crown, and would have it again; which I gave him a shilling earnest out of; but I meant to replace it. I was coming down the morning after, for to tell Mr. Barker of it, as he and I were intimate with each other, but I could not come as soon as I could wish; and I was apprehended for the same. I had not any intention of having it from him.</p>
               <p>Court to Barker. Does he mean to say, that he had as much to do in your house as yourself? - He was with me five or six weeks, but the last two or three days he had absconded. He did not work for me; he worked for himself. He was to pay for his working there, but he never gave me but one shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he to pay for working there by the week; or how? - We never made any agreement about that. He gave a shilling, and said as soon as he could get more, he would give me some.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the day you had lost your anvil, he had come to work, you should not have objected to it. - I should have objected to it, so far as this, that two people cannot work with one tool.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not forbid him. - I had, but he said, he would still give me something. There is another person that works in the shop, besides him and me.</p>

I crept down stairs, and was very much frightened; I stood at the door and cried out there, and one Mr. Clarke came to my assistance. There was a pursuit made after the women; I saw two of them, Loft and Simmons the next day, or the day after; I did not see Dawson till lately.

               <p>Witness Willey. Ison was taken the 3d of November, she was brought up to the justice and discharged, because the countryman was not in town. I was hunting about for her again, till last Monday, when I took her out of Golden Lane.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Dawson. I don't belong to the house, nor did I ever see the man till I was taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Ison. Ever since my husband's decease I have been at Canterbury, and had only come up that evening as this gentleman took me. I was taken up for this same affair, and this same woman (Wheeler) came against me, that there woman came into the little room and told me if I would make her a present of a small trifle, that neither she nor her husband would appear against me on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wheeler. I never said such a thing to her upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Ison. Did not I see you on Wednesday evening, and then you asked me for the money? - It is not true, I did attend on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner Simmons called one witness to her character.</p>

               <p>I was constable of the night, the parties were brought into me about eleven o'clock as nigh as I can guess at the time, Mr. Small charged the woman of robbing him of two half crowns, and an handkerchief, I took the charge, the woman acknowledged the fact, and begged for mercy; she did not acknowledge the handkerchief, but she acknowledged the half crowns.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any body recommend her to make any confession? - Nothing, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Mr. Small, how came you not to say any thing about this handkerchief before? - Because I did not find it on her, but I believe it was written in the letter before the magistrate: indeed I forgot it now, I never found it, it was a new handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Sir, I was going along I met this man, and he asked me to take him home; he pulled me about, and something dropped, and he stooped down and picked it up, but I did not see what it was till he came to the watch-house; he said he lost 3 s. 6 d. more, and an handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you say you lost more money than the two half crowns? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to charge her with an highway robbery? - I never charged her with a highway robbery no more than they please to put down, I never charged her than of robbing me of my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever charge any body with an highway robbery before? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the reward? - No.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Kirby; I know the prisoner, in February 1787, he and another were tried here for stealing a boat and convicted, and sentenced for transportation<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150038"/>for seven years; I was present when he received the sentence; I believe it was where his majesty should appoint; but I cannot be certain to that there; he was at the Hulks at Woolwich a short time after he was convicted.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he was put on board a ship? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where he escaped from? - I do not from my own knowledge.</p>


               <p>Prisoner. I had been seven months in Newgate before I went away; I staid three years and one month at Woolwich; I thought it very hard to be a slave in my own country, working morning, noon, and night. One morning a boatswain's mate and another, said to me, will you go away, here is a boat loose; I said, I did not care, I would as soon die as live; we all three went down and rowed away with the boat; I went away directly and entered on board his majesty's ship, the Eagle Frigate; I escaped from the hulk called the Stainslaus; the door was left open on the deck, were we go through to go down the gang way; we made our escape, and I went down to Sheerness, to the Eagle Frigate, a 36 gun ship. As soon as I was paid off from there, I went on board his majesty's Speedy Frigate, and had the Yarmouth station to keep out of the way; I went from thence directly to France, where I staid till these distresses happened, when I was obliged to come to England, and that was the way I was taken. If I knew where the captain lived, I know I could get a good character; I took two prizes while I was on board the Speedy Frigate. I was obliged to come to England, or else I never should. No body has been me ever since I have been away.</p>

               <p>I am an hackney coachman; I drive for Mr. Mumford, at the time that this affair happened, it was Saturday evening about nine o'clock, or between nine and ten; I lived at the time with Mr. Butler, Whitechapel; as I came up from the end of Fenchurch-street into Gracechurch-street, this hackney coach passed me very fast, to go over the water; and I being very tired jumped behind to ride, being a driver of an hackney coach myself; I stood up and looking through the hole of the coach, that was behind the coach, I saw nobody inside of the coach, and then looking over the roof, and seeing this dirty boy driving it, I thought something was not right, and knowing it to be Mr. Cannon's property, by the chocolate brown colour, with a kind of a gold border; so then I sets myself down and rides over London-bridge, and he drove at a very great rate indeed; I was determined to see what he meant to do with this coach and horses. I rides this coach till he got off the stones at the Borough, and he turns it about, by the stand going to the King's-bench; I dropped down from his coach, as he was getting off his box, and I went round and came to him, as if I was coming from St. George's-fields, and I came up to him, and I said, my lad what are you at now, he makes answer and says, my master is here, we have just set down a fare at the corner, he has given me six-pence to ride with him to night, says I it is no such a thing, I know you have not come honestly by this coach and horses, and I will find you a master. with that I called to the watchman immediately, desired him to take charge of him, on suspicion of stealing the coach and horses; I think his name is Dicks, and he took him into custody; I got up on the box, and the boy had a desire of speaking to me, and called me on one side, and said, stow it; stow it; I suppose he meant for me to let him go, and say nothing about it, says I, what do you mean, how came you to go to be guilty to take a man's coach and horses away? says he, I took it from Charles-street, Covent-garden; I asked him if he had earned him any money? He said no. I drove the coach and horses up to the watch-house, on the Surry road, and told the night constable the same as I have told you. Mr. Wood the constable agreed for the boy and watchman to be drove to Mr. Cannon's, in the coach, and I to drive the coach; I told the night constable, who the owner of the coach was, and he thought it most prudent for me to drive him there, and I drove him there; and one of the city constables was sent for, and the boy was sent to the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the boy drunk or sober? - He appeared sober, I did not see him any thing the least disguised for liquor.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to know this was Mr. Cannon's coach? - By this last witness. Mr. Cannon was at home, they opened the gates, and Mr. Cannon said, he was very happy to see the coach come home, it was his coach, after that says he, watchman you have done your duty, the boy must be sent to the Counter.</p>

               <p>I am an hackney-coachmaster, the coach was brought to me, and the horses, and the prisoner was in it, on Saturday the 3d of November. The horses were two black geldings. I am sure they were mine, I should have known them in any other person's coach.</p>
               <p>Court to Clare. Were your horses geldings that you left? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ply for Mr. Cannon? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you that night at your master's house after the coach and horses were at home? - I was, I knew them to be my horses, I was very glad to see them, it was past 12 o'clock. I had sent word by my fellow servant to let my master know of the circumstances I had light of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was in Charles-street, Covent-garden, and a man asked me to feed his horses, and he said he would be back again in five minutes, he came back and gave me 1 d. and gives me the whip and says, if there is a job comes you may go with it, and come back to me at two o'clock, accordingly I went with the job.</p>
               <p>Jury. I beg to ask a question, the fact was perpetrated in Charles-street, Covent-garden, which is in the country, can a London jury be competent to judge of it.</p>
               <p>Court. The action is maintainable in any county where the property is carried, it appears he came through the city of London, therefore the action is maintainable here.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Cannon. What may be the value of these geldings? - £30.</p>

This was Wednesday. As soon as this young man with the straps had gone out of my shop, which was four or five minutes before the other. There was the constable and patrole in the street. As soon as I had measured the young man for the shoes, he gave me his address and went out directly. The constable took up this young man, and the patrole the other, and they took them into a public-house, and they came over to me to know if I could swear to these shoes, I said I could. I found the prisoner and the other in the public-house; immediately in less than three minutes they were both of them in hold. The shoes were marked with the name of Evans, by my Clicker,

The patrole was on duty in Lombard-street, I went to the patrole, and told him there were two suspicious chaps about, and I will watch them: If they cannot give a good account of themselves, I will take them before the Lord Mayor. I followed them till they came to Mr. Jupp's shop, and the prisoner at the bar, and the other crossed over the way and stood at the corner of a passage by Mr. Hatches, the pork-shop, when a coach was going past I lost sight of him that was outside, I crossed over the way, and I saw the other with the prisoner in the shop as I supposed but I could not swear it was the same; therefore he was discharged. When the prisoner came out I seized him, and took him into the City Arms, and there I searched him, and found in each of his coat pockets one of these shoes, I was going to take him off from the seat where he sat, he dropped these picklock keys.</p>

On the 25th of November, we had just done dinner, Mr. Goodall, and Mrs. Goodall, and me. Mr. Mayo just came in, and he waited about an hour, and they both went out together, Mr. Goodall and Mr. Mayo: I did not see them again till about six o'clock that evening; there was Mr. Goodall, Mr. Mayo and Mr. Muslin came, and Mrs. Goodall was making the bed; some body knocked at the door, and she went down stairs, and I heard some little noise, and then Mrs. Goodall came to me, and gave me some sessions papers to read, and told me I might go to my mother's and I might come again that night or not, just as I would; I went away; I was gone pretty near an hour; I then went back, when I thought my hour was expired; I was coming back by Clerkenwell-green, to go home, and I met Mrs. Goodall, and she seemed to have something in her apron, she appeared to have a small parcel before.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out did you make any observations? - Yes, my mistress was making the bed in the one pair of stairs, and I saw something in the lower room; I thought there was a bundle; I had not been in that room since the afternoon; that bundle was not there then. When I was coming from my mother's, I met Mrs. Goodall, and she asked me whether I was going to her house, I told her yes; she told me to go along with her; I went with her, to Castle-street, in Turnmill-street, where she desired me to wait, I waited there about half an hour; I left the sessions papers at my mother's and brought away five others which I had changed; I went from Castle-street to my mother's again, and I was at Mrs. Goodall's the next morning, about seven o'clock, and I met Mrs. Goodall going out, and she desired me to make haste, for the fire was alight; she told me to brush the stove, and to sweep the room over; I went there and I saw three parcels on the bed, and an handkerchief laying on the bed, and Mr. Goodall at the vice, hammering out the marks of some silver tea-spoons.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150044"/>Q. Where used Mayo to sleep for a week? - On the same bed.</p>
               <p>Q. All the three prisoners together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this a week running that he slept there? - No, sir, at different times, but they had slept on the same bed.</p>
               <p>Q. In what room was it? - The same room the vice was in.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you think he was hammering out the marks of tea-spoons? - Because I could see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him hammer out such things before? - Never but once.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the room at the time? - Mr. Mayo.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mrs. Owen do any thing in the course of that day? - About a quarter after Muslin came up.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Mrs. Owen come in? - She came about half an hour after that she took the neck string out of a black silk cloak, and burnt it, and she said it was very remarkable, for it had three joins in it, Mr. Goodall and Mr. Mayo where both present, she then ript the body of a gown, and then she went out with the gown and cloak before breakfast, to take them to a mantua maker to be altered; she was gone about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. When she returned what did you see? - Some handkerchiefs and aprons, some muslin ones, and a new pair of stays. I was set to pick the edging of a tucker, and the lace of a muslin handkerchief, by Mrs. Owen's orders; about eleven o'clock Mr. Goodall, Mr. Muslin and Mr. Mayo, went out together; they left three bundles, one was in the drawers and two on the drawers, as I can best recollect, Mr. Goodall took out the silver spoons, that the marks had been beat out of with him, and a pair of silver sugar tongs. While they were gone out Mrs. Owen shewed me two Bank notes, this was towards night, she took them out of a little book out of her pocket; she asked me, if I had ever seen any bank notes, I said Yes, and she shewed me them both; I said, what are these his, meaning my master's and she said, there are only one of them George's, the other is Mayo's; I asked her, whether or no he would take them to the Bank; she said, yes; but if he did he would get hung. I was not there when Mr. Goodall returned home.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at any time desired of him to borrow any thing of the lodgers? - Yes, a chopper on Monday afternoon before he went out, I borrowed it of the lodger up stairs, and he cut up a box and burnt it, it was a brown box of a wainscot colour.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any thing about a pair of stays? - Mr. Mayo had them because they were sent by the boy on Monday morning wrapped up in a white counterpane to his wife Mrs. Mayo.</p>
               <p>Q. What white counterpane was that? - It was one that had been in a robbery before, I did not hear where the stays came from.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember being there on Tuesday, where was Goodall the greatest part of Tuesday? - He came home at five o'clock in the afternoon, very much disguised in liquor. Soon after Mr. Macauley, otherwise Muslin, came in when he came in he said he had been ill used at St. Catharine's, and he brought in a bill which had been put out about this robbery, and Mrs. Goodall read it, and presently after she said, that there was something wrong in it about some things, but I cannot tell what; Mr. Muslin I believe said it was not right. Goodall was drunk on the bed, and Mrs. Goodall went and took his things out of his pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing about candlesticks? - Yes, I heard something about candlesticks in the bill, and a name on them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing else laying<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150045"/>on the drawers which you had not noticed to lay there before? - I saw a pair of stone buckles on the drawers; I saw them before the justice, and I believe they were the same.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. I took these articles from the prisoner, Trimmer: a towel, a piece of green stuff, with two shillings-worth of farthings in it, one half-crown piece, 7 s. 5 six-pences and 9 s. 6 l. in halfpence, together with some pick-lock keys; one of which I tried the prosecutor's door with, and it locked and unlocked it as well as the key the prosecutor has: this was taken from him the day of the robbery, between eleven and twelve o'clock: I, in company with Mr. Cooke, saw the prisoners coming up George-street, in White-chapel. As soon as they saw us, they ran into a house. We pursued them. - I got into the house first, and I met the tallest of the prisoners coming out. We had no warrant. - We did this on our own suspicion. - And if we had not known them that was sufficient to cause suspicion. Mr. Cooke stood withinside the door. I let the tallest pass me, in order that Mr. Cooke should lay hold of him, and I laid hold of the other. Accordingly, I took Trimmer, in a backyard, that was there; and there I found all this property on the prisoner, Trimmer. A shift I picked up in the passage; but cannot take upon me to say which of the prisoners it was that dropt it. - There was no coat found on him - nor sheets. I found this piece of stuff with the farthings, and 9 s. 6 d. in half-pence; and as soon as I had found the farthings, he took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150049"/>hold of the piece of stuff, and shaked them in among the half-pence: with that I secured him, and took him to the office, and advertised the articles, on account of which the prosecutor came.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Trimmer. Did you take that property from me? - I took every article, expect the shift, out of his pockets.</p>

               <p>On Tuesday the 20th of November, I went into Mr. Enoch's shop, I had a little business with him, the prisoner at the bar at that time was in the back parlour trying on breeches, after he pulled on his own breeches, and returning out of the shop, there was some conversation took place, between the prisoner and Mr. Enoch, Mr. Enoch said, that he believed he rather came with an intent to steal a pair of breeches more than to buy, with that the prisoner seemed very much affronted; Mr. Enoch told him, he would shew him no more, and wished never to see him there any more; the prisoner said, he never would come there any more; after that the prisoner had buttoned up his breeches, and returned out of the shop; I cannot pretend to say, I perceived it before or after he had got out of the shop door; I perceived one knee hanging out of the hind part of the skirt of his coat, five or six inches; he was out of the shop and passing by the window; on seeing this, I went after him, he perceived that somebody was after him, he began to run, he just turned the corner of Mr. Enoch's shop; I caught hold of the hind part of the skirts of his coat, collars him and accused him of the theft; I suppose he was about a dozen or fourteen yards from the shop; with that other assistance came up, and we took him to Bow-street, in an hackney coach; he was examined by the sitting magistrate and committed to Newgate; Mr. Enoch permitted the breeches to be taken out in the coach, going to Bow-street; when I saw the prisoner go by the window, I followed him to the door, but I did not see the breeches till I was at the door.</p>

I observed the footman's pockets being turned out as we were going to the watch-house, and he said he had lost half a guinea out of that pocket, says he, they made several attempts at my watch. I had hold of one, and Stevens had hold of the other; they told us we should let loose, or we should not be watchmen there long. We kept our hold and took them to the watch-house, and gave the charge of them, and delivered them over to the constable of the night. The footman was nothing but blood, all his face, very much cut about his forehead. The lining of the pocket was turned completely out. These are the same men we lodged in the watch-house. I attended before the magistrate next morning, and there the prosecutor mentioned his waistcoat being turned inside out, and said, that he had lost half a guinea. We<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150054"/>took hold of these men from the prosecutor. I took Robertson, and Stevens Campbell.

               <p>Q. When did you see your half guinea before? - I had a guinea, but I owed Timms, at the Black Horse public house, half a guinea, and he gave me change, which was about half an hour before I was attacked; I put it in my right hand pocket, and recollect nothing more about it till I perceived the half guinea was gone.

               <p>I am a butcher at Turner's-end; the prosecutor Mr. Kimpton came on Saturday the 10th of November, and claimed two sheep skins; this man the prisoner had come to me the Tuesday before and told me he had two ewes to sell; the next day Wednesday he brought two wether sheep. I was killing a bullock; I bought them; I had no knowledge of him; I gave him 19 s 6 d. a piece, he asked 2 l. Mr. Kimpton came to my shop when I was not at home, and my landlord shewed him the skins; I came home directly, and shewed them to Mr. Kimpton, and he carried them to the office along with him; I told him I was not sure where abouts he was at that present time; but he was soon found; when he brought the two wethers he said, I made an exchange with my brother; my brother bought four wethers at Hertford fair, and I exchanged them; he told me he was a shepherd.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. These sheep that you talk about have a ruddle mark across the loins; you have seen many sheep have the same mark? - To be sure I have.</p>
               <p>Q. These wethers were not worth so much as laid down in the indictment 2 l. 12 s. - No, I have bought cheaper and I have bought dearer.</p>
               <p>Q. Of whom did he say he got possession of these sheep? - Of his brother, and afterwards he said, of Duck and Gisborn, and he said, that they said, if he would not go and sell them for him, they would kill him, and he was to have 18 d. for his day's work, and the sum was to be returned to Duck and Gisborn, and they were to divide the money into three parts; but he said he would not do that, he would only have his 18 d. for his hire.</p>
               <p>Q. This man was taken up before Duck and Gisborn? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you again the mark that was on these two wethers, was it a common mark that all the farmers in the county have? - It is.</p>

               <p>I was employed by my father-in-law, Mr. Harvey, from whom the sheep were brought the night before; on Wednesday I was going to Turner's-end, and I met the prisoner with two sheep, driving in the road; I did not know them then to be the same that I had sent to Mr. Kimpton; I asked him whether he was going to the welch butcher's with them, he said, yes; I was by when he was with Mr. Thomas; and the butcher asked me to look at them; I asked the butcher what he asked, he said a pound a piece; I told him I dare say the man and he would deal. On Thursday morning I was going by the butcher's shop, and he was killing one of the sheep; I asked him, if the man and he had agreed; I told him, if they were my sheep I would not have sold them under 30 s. a piece: then I recollected they were Mr. Kimpton's sheep; I observed the marks, and I was certain they are the same I saw at my father-in-law's; this was on Thursday; I took an horse and went over to my father-in-law's to know if any sheep were lost, he said he did not know, as Mr. Kimpton was gone to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150060"/>town, and was not at home, and said it would be as well for me not to go then, but he would go in the morning. Mr. Kimpton came over on Saturday morning, and I told him where the sheep were, and went with him; the skins were produced, Mr. Kimpton claimed them as his property; I went immediately and took the prisoner at the Fox, at Farnham's-green.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Now my friend you say you met the prisoner at the bar, on the road, with two sheep; at that time you had no suspicion of their belonging to Mr. Kimpton? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you close to the prisoner at the bar, when you had the conversation with him; you asked him whether he was going to take them to the welch butcher's? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know them then? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the sheep that you saw on the road, you can recollect they were Mr. Kimpton's, and now you can take on you to say they were the same at Mr. Thomas's. The fifteen wether sheep you sent to Mr. Kimpton, had the ruddle mark on them? - They had.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a common mark? - Not very common.</p>
               <p>Q. Some mark in one place and some in another? - They do.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you did not recollect them to be Mr. Kimpton's, when you saw them on the road, yet you recollected them to be Mr. Kimpton's, when you saw them cut up; you know them by the ruddle mark? - And by the breed.</p>
               <p>Q. You talked to Thomas about the price he had given for the sheep, you seemed to think he had a good bargain of it? - I am certain he had.</p>
               <p>Q Do you think if he had been driving some stolen sheep to the butcher's, he would not have hesitated a little, to have told you where he was going? - That was the place he had appointed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he would have readily told you where he was taking them, if he had been guilty? - I don't think he should.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see any sheep marked in that way without a slit in the ear, or some other mark? - I cannot say; there is an ear mark in one of them that my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150061"/>master does not know of, I know of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The slit in the ear you have seen in other people's sheep? - I have.</p>

             and another came into my master's shop on Monday morning last, between 9 and 10 o'clock, he asked for some patterns of thicksets, they are for making of small clothes, which I desired the porter to give him while I waited on other customers. The porter's name is John, I forget his other name; during the time he was there, I observed him turn his face to the window, presently I asked the porter what became of the piece of Florentine, as I had but just come into the shop, he made a reply and said, he did not know any thing of it; I then looked on the counter, expecting some person might have put it there, and have taken it out of the window. I then looked out at the door, and saw the florentine under Davenport's coat, standing near to the door; I then turned over the counter for the purpose of cutting Davenport's patterns of thickset. The porter had a suspicion, and called Mr. Burbidge forward; Davenport dropped the Florentine from his coat, I saw him, I saw it fall to the ground.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The porter is not here. - He is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other persons who were in the service of Mr. Burbidge? - None, except a customer who came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this piece of Florentine rolled up tight or loose? - Rolled up as we usually keep them doubled back, to shew the quality in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - I have seen the prisoner before in the shop as a customer.</p>
               <p>Q. The porter on some observations of his own, called his master? - He did.</p>
               <p>- WARREN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a beadle of the ward, I produce the goods, I received it of Mr. Burbidge, it is called Florentine, I have kept it ever since.</p>
               <p>Court to Burbidge. At the request of the porter you went into the shop? - I did; when I came into the shop close by the prisoner, he dropped the silk close by me, I saw him, I gave it to the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether it was in the shop or no? - I do, I did not see it at the window myself that day, but I saw the vacancy.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say you had not sold it. - That piece I am sure we had not. (Deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was Mr. Chaplin at home that day? - He was not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Sometimes things are taken out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150062"/>to shew the customers? - Occasionally things are taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. You said very fairly you could not take on you to say from your own knowledge, that it was there that day? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Davison. I began to put them in about seven o'clock that day, and it was between seven and eight that I was finished, I put this piece in between seven and eight.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had occasion to go into this shop; on Monday last, about ten o'clock, there was a person either at the time, or immediately after, came into the shop; the shopman told the porter to serve me with what I wanted, and he would serve the other customer: the shopman immediately goes round the counter, and says to the potter, what is become of the piece of Florentine there? The porter says I have not seen it since, I laid it on the counter this morning, he immediately went out to the door and looked, he came in directly again, and as I comprehended the circumstance, he sent for Mr. Burbidge, and when he came into the shop, a piece of Florentine fell down from behind the door.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called eleven witnesses, who gave him an excellent character.</p>

I took nine pounds of sugar from him, raw sugar. The warehouse belongs to

               <p>Prisoner. Was I at work at the sugar warehouse that day, or the day before? - He was at work that day, I did not employ him, but one of my fellow servants employed him, he had just had 4 d. for his hire; he was employed in the warehouse among some men.</p>

I had been at work that afternoon at that warehouse, and earned 2 d. and did not find out any more work all the blessed afternoon. I was going home, seeing another man on the Keys, says he, there is a small bundle of hoops to light my fire; stooping for his bundle of hoops, please you, my Lord, there was a man lay with something wrapped up in it; says he, here is a prize, he unfolded this mat, and in this mat there was sugar; with that there says he, the second blunder is as good as the first. I thought no harm in it, and I takes this quantity which was found about me, and the other man whether he took the remainder or no, I cannot say; so coming up the gate, I turned to go home, and there was this gentleman standing by the door, I walked up farther, and was going for a halfpennyworth of shag tobacco; he says, where have you been at work? I said, no where; says he, you have been at work in the warehouse; says I, I have been in the hemp warehouse, and have earned 2 d. Says he, come back to me, I told him I would after I had bought the tobacco; there was the King's watchman walking under the gateway, who certainly would have told whether I went up in the sugar warehouse and come down; he could not miss seeing me; I have no witnesses but God Almighty.</p>

               <p>I am a servant to Mr. Wood, I saw the prisoner on the 21st of November standing at my master's door, looking into my master's shop, about half past eight o'clock in the morning Wednesday, with a two foot rule in his hand. I took no notice of him, thought he was a person taking a plan, which many men do in our business; about five minutes after, I saw him come out of my master's shop with the glass in his hand. It is a dressing glass in a mahogany box frame, I said to my fellow servant, do you run to my master, and when he came back I told him to go about Little Moorfields way, and I would go down Moor-lane. My fellow servant took him, and he ran away from him; on Saturday the 24th I took him again in Long Alley, Moorfields.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe him enough to be able to say that he is the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever recover the glass? - Yes; we got the glass on the 21st.</p>

I asked him where he was going with the glass, he said it was a jobb of his own, I told him it was not, it was a glass of our's; he directly pushed it into my hand, and ran away.

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Jacobs and I were going up Houndsditch, on the 24th of November last, and saw three people going along stoping at several windows trying to break them, but they still walked on till they came to Cornhill, where I saw the prisoner working at the window to break it open; we then ran, and Jacobs catched hold of him and tore his coat. I struck him, and broke my stick over his head, he crossed to Leadenhall Market, ran up the right hand passage, and comes up to the beef hall, and then turns to the right, and comes into Leadenhall-street again; coming up there was a man stopped him; accordingly I grasped at him behind, and catched him, he made a little resistance, but Jacobs coming up we secured him, took him into the public house, and there he was very resolute, and buggered his eyes and limbs and all such expressions as are not fit to mention; and there was a gentleman there, the biscuit maker to the Prince of Wales, who offered to lend a pair of pistols for safety, and another offered to lend a blunderbuss; they were afraid of him, he was such a desperate chap, he swore he would not go without the half of his coat that was broken off, so we put it on arms to pacify him; we put him in the Compter, and there he wanted to turn evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any stockings on his person? - I cannot say; I followed and pursued the man, and left Jacobs with the stockings; I know nothing further.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How long was I in the public house before the boy brought the stockings? - I was busy with him, we had not been there five minutes before I saw the stockings there. I cannot say when or how they were brought in, I am sure he was one of the persons at the house, and that window was broke, and I saw him packing up the bundle under his arm.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was any thing found on him to cut glass? - Nothing at all that we found.</p>
               <p>Court. You say this was about the hour of six in the evening, was it not light enough to discern any man's face? - It was not, at a distance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever lose sight of him? - I never had him out of my sight from the time that Jacobs had first hold of him, I should have knocked him down under the archway, but a butcher's dog catched hold of me and lugged me some little space, for about a yard or there abouts,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150066"/>I never lost sight of him; I am sure he is the person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Does it stand to reason if this man had seen the stockings drop, and there were two or three of them, that they would not have picked them up.</p>

I then ran out into the street, found the prisoner Levingston; I broke the cord in a moment, I found the prisoner in the custody of Mr. Nichols, I never knew the prisoner before, he was then struggling very hard to get away; I found the hose very near the prisoner, eleven pair of stockings; I picked up the stockings and ran to the constable Hatch, and he came and took the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>I am a patrole, on the 29th of last month; I stopt the man coming out of the house; Mr. Halton requested I would stay a little longer than usual to watch his house. Our usual time to go off is six o'clock; between six and seven, on the 29th, I heard a chain fall inside of Mr. Hatton's door, I went immediately the other side of the way, and waited for about ten minutes, and then I went and stopt close by the door till the man came out; I followed him till he got out to go to Mr. Hatton's stable, and under the left side of his coat he had got a parcel; I asked him what he had got? he said a few nails, I said where are you going with them? he said to the stable yard, it is in St. John's-street, I told him he should not take them to the stable, he must go along with me, he was my prisoner; from thence I conveyed him to the Cooper's-arms, in Cow-cross; I took that parcel from him that I saw in St. John's-street, and in the Cooper's-arms, I found three other parcels, one he took out of his pocket, and two I took out; so there were four in the whole. I sent for his master directly, and his master came. I have got the nails in court; they have been in my box ever since. The prisoner did not say whose they were. (Produced and deposed to.)</p>

One of my young men said to her, I suppose you have more in your basket; no, she said, she had not; my wife was going to market; she said, here is a man's shoe in the basket. I went round the counter and saw there was a pair, and said to her, now tell one where you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150069"/>have got these; she said first of all, she got them from Snow-hill, and then from a court, No. 4, Hosier-lane; I was going to send my young man there to find out the persons, she said, no don't send there, they come from No. 15, Silk-street, Grub-street; I told her the best way would be to take her to the office, in Hatton-garden; accordingly I went for a constable; she desired me to call at Mr. Crane's, in St. John's-street, to desire him to inform her father of her situation, and to desire him to get the muffins, as she could not go there, I called at Mr. Crane's. On the second examination she then confessed they were taken from the waggon, which puts up at the Golden-lion, St. John's-street. I gave the goods over to

Hughes the patrole apprehended the prisoner.</p>
               <p>- HUGHES sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of the patroles; on going down the road, on Friday the 30th of November, about six o'clock in the evening, I was going through Kensington town, about the middle of the town, I passed the prisoner, near six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner was in company with another man, that is evidence against him, his name is Mac Laughton, Mac Laughton was first and he had the bundle of lead; I says to my partner, stop that fellow he has got something very heavy, and the prisoner at the bar stepped immediately from the path way into the road, to make his escape; it was very dark, we took them both, and took them into the public house. Swain was the man with me, and he took the load from Mac Laughton's back; I asked him where he got that lead. The lead was brought up to Bow-street, and the plumber looked at it the Wednesday following; Swain kept it in the mean time. I made enquiry and found that there was some lead lost in these buildings. I took them both up and Mac Laughton was admitted an evidence on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>- SWAIN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of the patroles; I and Hughes met the prisoner and Mac Laughton; Hughes told me to mind Mac Laughton, because he had something heavy on his shoulder; I went to him and took it off his shoulder, and took him into the public house close by, and examined what was in it, I found it was lead, it was directly brought up to Bow-street office, and on Wednesday Mr. Fisher the plumber came and looked at it, and brought some more with it that matched very well in quality, but the pieces did not match; the lead was locked up at the Brown bear; I got it back again; I am sure it is the same.

               <p>Q. Can you safely swear that this cotton bed gown is your wife's? - I can, I bought the stuff in Oxford-road out of a shop; and my wife made the bed gown up. One of the check aprons my wife had to wash; it belongs to a Mrs. Hatch; it was in my wife's possession to wash.</p>
               <p>Q. You know that your wife had an apron to wash, but you cannot swear that that was the apron? - I can swear there was an apron in the possession of the prisoner, and my wife had an apron to wash, and it was missing.</p>

               <p>Q.

I had a sufficient reason for discharging him; I met him with my property on his back carrying it away, and I made him carry it back, and put it in the stable, and locked the door, and took the key of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any violence at the stable door? - The staple was pulled out and broke, it was fastened with a padlock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He was not my employer, he had nothing to do with me, his son was my master; he gave me a key, and he had another key for himself; one of the horses had his legs swelled, and he told me to walk him about, I took him down to Fleet-market; I went for my shirt, and I got myself drinking, he had nothing to do with me.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you not to see it till Tuesday? - I was informed where he was, and my son went to see him; I could not leave my shop.</p>

               <p>I am an engine windster. The prisoner came to me, and called me down from my mother's, where I was at work, and asked me to pawn them for her; this was the same day the young woman lost them, about three o'clock, as far as I can recollect, in the afternoon. I took them to the corner of Rose lane, Prescot street, and pawned them; the prisoner waited for me till I came out; I was taken up for it; I did not know any thing of this till I was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you give this account? - To the man that took me.</p>
               <p>Court to Harper. Do you know in what name they were pawned? - Mary Woodham. (Deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Had you ever seen Woodham in your house? - I never see her before I saw her before the magistrate. The prisoner lived with me a week and four days.</p>

               <p>This woman, the prisoner, gets her living by hard work; she is a washerwoman; I have known her several years; I have pawned these sheets several times for her.</p>
               <p>Q. These very identical sheets? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you pawn them? - Once at Catherine-wheel alley. I am a widow, and have eleven children.</p>
               <p>Court to Pawnbroker. What time of the day were these pawned. - The 19th of November; I think, about three o'clock, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Barker. When was the first time you pawned these sheets? - I pawned them about eight or ten weeks ago, with Mr. Davidson, the corner of Catherine-wheel alley; they gave me a duplicate.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the other time? - Before that.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to insist on it, they are the same sheets? - They are the same sheets.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Davis. Were these sheets ever out of your house before? - Never, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Tyler knows I have pawned them in his shop before now.</p>
               <p>Court to Tyler. Did she ever pawn these sheets before? - Never, to my knowledge. I don't know whether it is proper to mention it to you, but this woman, (Barker,) brought me a letter from the prisoner; the purport of it was to induce me to say the sheets were pawned separate.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Barker. Did you carry this letter. - I did.</p>

Mr. Palmer brought the beer, and put it into my hands; it was light enough to see the countenance of the prisoner and deceased by the candle in the tap room. I was close to the deceased. The prisoner came out to the door with a pint of beer; he gave it into my hands; he said to the deceased, Are you not a rascal, and a villain, and a thief? The deceased made answer, and said, No, Mr. Palmer! and Mr. Palmer made answer, and said, You are. No, says he, I am not. I am no thief, nor yet a rascal, nor a villain. Yes, says Palmer, I can prove him a thief. Now, says he, I know you owe me a grudge for owing you 5 s. and then he said, Yes, you do, you owe me 5 s. The deceased made answer, and said, No, Sir, I paid you some. He said, if you say so again, I will knock you down; and then the deceased made answer, and said, Yes, I paid you some; and then he made no more to do, but Palmer knocked down the deceased immediately; I saw him, upon my word; I cannot say I see where he struck him. He got up, and said, very well, Mr. Palmer; and then he repeated his blow, and knocked him down again; I saw that; and the deceased got up, and got off from his premises, and went to Mr. Bennett's door, the next door, and there the deceased said to him, You struck me twice, now if you strike me the third time - I am off your premises - I will make you pay for it; and then Mr. Palmer said, Damn me, if I am to pay for it, I will pay for some thing; and then went, and struck him again, and then I never stirred an inch from the place where he struck him; I saw him strike him; I stopped at Mr. 
Palmer's door till my brother came out, and then I went away.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon; I live at Stoke Newington; I was sent for on the occasion, eight or ten days previous to his death, to attend the deceased; he then was labouring under a disagreeable fever and a bilious complaint. I treated him in the usual way; the medicines did not succeed; he died on Monday the 25th. I went down, and see that he was black on the side, and the blood was ready to burst through; a mortification had taken place; but I do not take upon me to say, he might not have died without that, but, I think, his death might be accelerated by this; I heard nothing of this before his death; if he had sent for me immediately, he might have recovered.</p>
               <p>Court. Your opinion is that the disorder might have occasioned his death without the blow. - He was labouring under a bilious fever.</p>
               <p>Q. That could not happen from the blow. - It might by the disturbance of the vessels that secrete the blood.</p>

               <p>On the 17th of November, (Saturday) about twelve o'clock, I was coming with one Luckney, a professor of the same employ, an utterer of bad money, I met the prisoner at the top of Long-lane, by Aldersgate-street, we went into a public house, called the Six Canns, in Barbican, all three, and had something to drink; then the prisoner said to me, I want to speak to you on business to-morrow, because I can put something in your way, that will be of service to you. I met him, by appointment at the sign of the Cart and Horses, in Sutton-street, in Goswell-street, on Sunday morning, at ten o'clock; I went there first, and waited about an hour. I was sitting at that time in the tap room; when he came, I believe, he spoke first; he said, he expected two sellers that were coming with some money, who was to meet him there; they did not come; I went out of the house with him, and we went down to Long-lane, about three quarters of a mile from the place, in Sutton-street; we went to the Bell; there he shewed me some bad money in a paper, that they had brought to him; I suppose there might be 40 or 50 s. most of them six-pences; he then took me up to Goswell street, almost by the turnpike, and said, they must go through the pot again, for they have been rubbed. That parcel of money was delivered to him in the lane, in a little court that goes into the square, in <placeName id="t17921215-44-crimeloc258">Long-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. Then you received this money of this man. - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go any where else with him. - I went with him to a house in Fashion-street, Spitalfields; there was a public house in a Short street, that we went in before, but the house that I bought the money at was at <placeName id="t17921215-44-crimeloc259">the Queen's head, in Fashion-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was there any body else there? - There was a man in a sailor's habit; I bought of him there, in that house, sixpences and 3 shillings, bad money, for 5 good shilling. Mr. Croker has got it. This was on Sunday evening, about five o'clock, that I bought it; he asked 5 s. for these 18 bad sixpences and 3 shillings, and I gave it him. I went and delivered them to Croker, at the Feathers, in Hart-street, Covent garden, about seven o'clock on the same evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you kept this money separate? - I had wrapt it up in two or three papers, that it should not get lose in my pocket. When he was apprehended on the Tuesday following, he was then to meet me again in Church-street, in the Strand; I went there, and Croker with me and another officer, he was in the path, at first, and Croker and Davis followed a distance; he went out to the coach way, to bring a bit of comb out of the coach wheel to do them, because they were too bright what he had got.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Worsdale do me the favour to look at these gentlemen across; where do you live? - No. 13, Charles-street, Tottenham-court-road; I have lived there ever since I came down from Little Heath turnpike, in the neighbourhood of Mims, between Brent and Hatfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you the toll collector to a turnpike? Pray are you the same gentleman that we have had so many complaints about bad money at Battle-bridge? - No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150080"/>Q. I will take down that answer. - I never staid there but three weeks in my life, and that was about four years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. I pass through that turnpike, at least, once a week, and I recollect you. How long was it since you was dismissed from Battle-bridge turnpike? - About three or four years.</p>
               <p>Q. For being too honest, I take it for granted? - I went from there to 
Isleworth.</p>


               <p>Q. What might you be dismissed from Battle-bridge turnpike for? - Because I could not get money enough.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay at Isleworth? - Seven months.</p>
               <p>Q. You left that, because you could not get money enough, I take it for granted? - I lost the use of two of my fingers; then I was out of employ for sometime, and went to sea.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a landsman again? - Pretty near a year and three quarters.</p>
               <p>Q. Got into any other toll-gate since? - I collected the City street toll, and after that, I went down to Little Heath turnpike.</p>
               <p>Q. Is 5 s. the common price for 18 sixpences and 3 s? - I don't know the common price, for some gives more and some gives less.</p>

               <p>Q. I don't know, whether you know, you are liable to be prosecuted as well for buying as for selling. Did you ever buy any before or since? - I have, I will not deny it.</p>
               <p>Q. Yet you cannot tell the market-price? - They differ.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray how many are you in the course of this day to try to convict single handed? - There are two more.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray now, Mr. Worsdale, what is the reward for this dealing? - I know not any, nor do I require any.</p>
               <p>Q. You do it all for the good of the public? - I do, it is never too late to mend.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, one question more; Have you not been discharged as the collector to the Sunday toll at Battle-bridge, because you was wonderous utterer of bad money? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. No! Now, remember, Mr. Worsdale, that once a week, at least, I have taken bad six pences at that gate. Upon your oath. Has there never been a complaint against you for giving bad sixpences at the turnpike gate? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you never heard of such a complaint? - There might be.</p>
               <p>Q. I would not hurry you; for the world's sake, take your own time, only tell me, on your oath? - I never heard of such a complaint.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - If it had been made, there is not a doubt, but it would have been just.</p>

He did not return till the 27th of November, and I did not see him till the 21st; he came to the Horse Guards, and asked a soldier to let him sleep in the guard in a night, and a corporal of the same company I belong to, came and informed me. I had him taken up in the morning of the 28th, and he was conducted to his master, and I took him to the magistrates, and then he was committed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This gentleman gave me half a guinea to get change, and it dropped out of my hand, and I was afraid to go back again.</p>

               <p>This boy was in my service, he had been there from Sunday to Tuesday, and when he left me, he was employed to draw beer. I knew nothing of him before, he directed me to a place in Westminster, where I could get a character; I went; he had not lived there, but he had been there about eight or nine days about the house, and appeared very industrious, and he believed he was honest; he left my house on Tuesday between two and three o'clock, I missed him all of a sudden, and presently the serjeant came to me, and enquired where the boy was; he never came back till he was brought back by the corporal on the 28th of November; I asked him what made him behave in that manner, or what made him make away with the half guinea, he said, he went to a public house, and there he saw a man like a coal-heaver, who said, to him what do you want? says he, I want change for half a guinea for the serjeant; O says he, never mind going back with the half guinea, let us nd seen it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I can get a character from where I lived five years; I have always been be up very honestly, and I never do any thing of this sort before in my life; my father and mother live down at Newbury in Berkshire.</p>

               <p>Q. How much was in that pattern? - About three quarters of a yard; there was originally six yards of it; I had my private mark on it; I took the prisoner before a magistrate, and swore to my mark there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Your mark is very near the end? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q If any person had been indiscreet enough to match it in your shop, could they not have cut that mark off with great ease? - They certainly could have done that.</p>
               <p>Q. How much would they have wasted? - About half an inch.</p>
               <p>Q. So that this young woman with your mark on it brought it to your shop, I observe gentlemen, (of the Jury) you do not think it needful for me to put another question if I don't misread you.</p>

I pursued him from Edward-street, and came up to him in Barfield-street; I did not come up quite to him, he made a step back with the knife; after some little way farther, then Harris turns round to Ryan, and says damn you, why don't you do the bugger; I followed them then up into George-street, where they ran into Kendall's-mews; there Harris stooped down, and pretended to ease himself; and there they were apprehended; the stays are in court.</p>

The girl is not present, she is in the country.</p>

               <p>I am one of the trinity officers; on Sunday morning the 2d of December, between five and six, I was coming from Rotherhithe in a boat, and I saw the two prisoners, Davis and Young, in a boat coming down the river; I was going up; perceiving the boat very deep in the water, I ordered the waterman to row towards them; accordingly they rowed directly over for the other shore to Wapping; I am sure they observed me; we then came very near to them, and before we could board the boat, the prisoner Young jumped over-board, and says, you bugger now catch me if you can; he endeavoured then to swim towards the other shore, towards Rotherhithe-stairs; we then came close to the boat and perceiving it to be loaded with log-wood; Davis would have jumped over-board likewise, but the waterman catched him by the coat, and called him by his name; he attempted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150089"/>to jump, and got up on purpose to do it; and I told him, I would shoot him if he did; we then rowed immediately after Young to pick him up out of the water, and told him to swim to the boat, or I would blow his brains out; he swam to the boat and got hold of the stern; we then took him into the boat and then we rowed after Davis who had got the property in the boat; we overtook him; we then took both of them together over to Shadwell watch-house, and there they remained till Monday morning, when they had a hearing before the justice. There was thirteen pieces of log-wood in the boat; I took it to Shadwell, and by order of the justice put it into a warehouse, where it was locked up; some of them weigh about an hundred weight a piece; we have got two pieces here, we marked it so as to know it again; on one piece we put the broad R, with a knife.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Young. Before they took this load from us, they had got another skiff load of wood which they took from two men. - We had not, we had nothing but my blunderbuss and cutlas; our business is to go up and down the river to keep peace and quietness.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Davis. I never attempted to jump over-board. - He did attempt to jump over the boat's head.</p>

There was about thirteen or fourteen pieces of log-wood in the boat, which were put up in a warehouse by the justice's order; there is one piece which I scratched with a knife which I can swear to.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am foreman to the yard where the wood was stole; on Sunday the 2d of December I missed it; I saw it on Saturday evening when I locked the yard up.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the wharf open to boats if the tide is up? - There is no fare through in the night; the wharf this time of the year is opened about eight o'clock in the morning and shut again at five in the evening; it is intirely enclosed from the water-side.</p>
               <p>Q. Could people easily get at this timber? - They might get over the fence, and then they might easily hand it over.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pieces did you miss; - It is impossible for any body to form any idea of the particular quantity of pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see the log-wood afterwards? - Maxwell and Peate came to me and informed me they had stopped some log-wood, and Maxwell shewed me the log-wood in the warehouse; I knew the log-wood; I can swear to five pieces positively; I was taking them in seven years ago, and I particularly put them by, they are not to be matched in any yard in England, and one was the outside piece of the parcel and was the longest of the five, the other two were rather shorter, and the two following were shorter still.</p>
               <p>Q. Why were they kept so long? - By the order of Mr. Springle in case he should want to oblige any merchant abroad; he never sells any in England. (Produces and deposes to the outside pieces.) I dare say I have moved it twenty times; I know the prisoners; I know their parents, and I only want what is honest and just.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Young. Last Sunday I awaked and got up, and was going down to Billingsgate to get some fish, going across the water from Pickle-herring-stairs, I saw this boat adrift; I had this young man with me; I says to him, there is a boat adrift; never mind the boat, says he; says I, I don't like the boat to go to pieces; I tied my own boat and was going down to Fountain-stairs; just before I came to Fountain-stairs these men rowed out of the craft, bring too, says he, or I will blow your brains out; he came right in to us; I made over to shore, and they came after me, and told me, if I did not come in they would blow my brains out; then they took Davis at Cherry-garden-stairs. I have been at sea seven years, and then I came home and bound myself apprentice to a waterman, but I did not serve long, but was going to sea again; I have got a ship now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Davis. This here man Young, called me up about five o'clock in the morning to go to Billingsgate and get some fish; he sees this boat adrift, accordingly we rowed towards her, he jumped in and sees the man's name on the boat, and accordingly says, I know partly the man and where his stairs are, accordingly he towed his own boat ashore and made her fast, and was going down towards Fountain-stairs with the boat, but this man attacked us and fixed a blunderbuss, he jumped over-board and took one of the skulls; I was drove athwart the ships, and to save the boat from being sunk, I pulled in towards Cherry-garden stairs, and then I set myself down to wait till they came to me, when they told me to come into their boat which I did.</p>
               <p>The prisoners each called one witness to their characters.</p>

               <p>Jury. How do you know my man that these were Mr. Stone's? - I know the barges, and I shewed Mr. Stone the barge from whence it was taken, and he said it was his; and I knew it was Mr. Stone's by the number.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lawrence. We sent a barge with coals to Trigg-stairs, and that barge and coals was our property. I was not on the stairs at the time; I saw them the next morning after they were taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Marshall ever point out to you the barge, from whence they were taken? - He did, and that was our barge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hatred. I heaved out the coals, from a West-country-barge; and they gave me 1 s. and the sweepings out; I don't rightly know whose barge it was; I heaved five chaldrons out, Jones was heaving the head room out, and I was heaving at the stern room; accordingly I came ashore with my coals; and Mr. Rodbard stopped me, and I was taken before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150092"/>the Alderman; I told them that they were sweepings; when I got up I lifted them on the full piles, and then I suppose the boy saw me take them down: I begged very hard of Mr. Rodbard, that he would not send me to the Compter; I never was in the Compter before, nor in any place of confinement; it was a strange place to me, and I was afraid of going to such a place; I have got a poor old mother at home, who entirely depends on my maintaining her. Mr. Tucker came to me and said, this boy was to have 10 l. from the Coal exchange.</p>
               <p>Tucker. There is not a word of that true.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jones. The constable came up to the Compter, and said, that he dare say I should be transported; for the boy would have 10 l. and he dare say the boy would say any thing.</p>
               <p>Court to Tucker. Do you know there is any reward in this case? - Yes, I knew nothing about it, till three days afterwards, I heard that there was a reward of 5 l. from the Coal-exchange.</p>

               <p>Mr. Conte came to my house last Sunday evening between five and six o'clock, and when I came there, I found the prisoner on his back in the parlour; I searched him, and found in his pocket an old knife and 2 s. I took him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On Sunday morning about eight o'clock, there was two men that belonged to the East India Company's ship Brunswick, came to my house and called me out to take a walk with them; we went to Clerkenwell; coming through London-street, this window was up, they threw my hat in and I went to get my hat, and they came and laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>Court to Bateman I think you say, that the prisoner threw open the window and looked into the room once or twice, before he came into the room. - He came back first and throwed up the sash, and went away, then he came back a second time and opened the blinds, and then he went again.</p>
               <p>Q Was it possible for you to distinguish the features of a man, to know he was the same man? - I could, he jumped over, and there was two outside to help him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any hat thrown in? - There was no hat but what was on his head.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>

Claxton came in immediately, and asked me if I had taken in any saw; I told him no, but said here are two saws, Claxton owned one, I asked the prisoner if they were his own, he said they were and he was a carpenter; I am sure it was the prisoner; the saws have not been in my possession since.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at the bar a man that worked in the house with you? - No, I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They could not swear to their saws when they came before the justice; the justice took and wrote each of their names on the saws, then they said they could swear to them when they came before your lordship. - We all swore to our property at Malborough-street office before the justice, we had not the least doubt but they were our saws.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I came out of the country three weeks, a fortnight of the time I worked at Uxbridge for one Mr. Brown; the people at Uxbridge informed me if I came to London I should get better work and wages; accordingly I came to town on Friday, on Saturday I went up and sought after work, I went to Oxford-road and got my dinner; I went to the public house, and sat myself down and called for a pint of porter; there were two well dressed men with two tenant saws on the table, I asked them where I could get a job of work, they asked me if I was a stranger to London, I said I was, they said, I was welcome to go with them, and seek after work if I liked it; accordingly we went down into Holborn, I think they call it so, and we went into a master carpenter's yard, on the right hand side, and asked for work, he said, he did not want any hands at present, we came out, I asked them if they would drink, they thanked me they would, we had two pints of beer, we came out again, and went down several little streets, and they said, young man, as you are so civil to treat us with this beer, they said, if I would pawn these two saws, they would return it, I asked them what pawning was, they told me if I went in, and asked them to lend me 2 s. 6 d. on them saws, they would do it; so I went, and when I was there two gentlemen came in and stopped me, the men said at first, that they would stop till I had pawned the tools at the corner of the street, whilst I was in the pawnbroker's shop, these men came in and stopped me, there was a great number of people about the door; when I came to the justices, they said, they could not positively swear, and then they got the constable to mark them.</p>

Strahan and Co.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How long had this man lived with you? - About since the month of October, or November, before the March these things were lost.</p>
               <p>Q. You had always found him an honest man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a partner in this line of business? - Not in this business.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the business is that? - In the anchor boats.</p>
               <p>Q. This man works with you occasionally? - He has been constant since the latter end of June, but before that he has not been above sometimes two days a week or three days or so; but when he was out of my employ it was his own fault. I paid him 3 s. a day as long as he worked.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before the Minerva sailed after the 28th of March? - She proceeded immediately, she left the river about the 29th or 30th.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard nothing of the loss of this till June, and then I believe you took a search warrant to search the prisoner's lodging? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You found nothing there? - I did not; I took him before Justice Staples, where he was discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe that from June to a very little time ago he continued in your service? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you told him that you had heard something more about this box, and you expected he would attend before Justice Staples again? - No, he was taken before Mr. Staples; I had no suspicion till he came before an attorney, and I found that he could not clear up his point.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever said, that you thought the prisoner was innocent? - No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Where did you come on board? - At Gravesend.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not been told that there was a box brought under the stern at Gravesend, which he said wanted some repairs, and then took it back? - I never received it at Gravesend; I did not ask for it there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. When you did ask, was you so told? - I was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You never heard any thing of that sort while you was in the river? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. This I take it was one of the most valuable part of your cargo? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the rest of the boxes contain money? - No, it was the valuablest one and smallest one of the cargo.</p>
               <p>Q. The cargo was known to them on board? - It was certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. That box was not unknown to the people? - The people did not know any such a thing was coming on board the vessel.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150098"/>Q. If it had got on board it would have been known from the weight, to have contained money? - Most certainly it would.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it you was a good deal surprised that you had not been told of that before; you was a good deal surprised that your crew had been so negligent? - They did not know the box was to go on board the ship; they told me a box was along side; I asked myself about it.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought it strange they did not tell you of this before? - No, I did not think it was strange, because they did not know it was coming on board, they had seen a small box, but when they were told it was to go back for alterations, I did not think any thing of them about the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Galloway your mate? - He is, he has been with me five years.</p>

The prisoner came under the stern, about twelve o'clock at mid-day; the tide had raised the ship fifty or sixty feet, and he hailed and told us he had something for us, but he was going down the river further and he would call when the tide served to come nearer the vessel; he went away at that time down the river, and he came when the water was lower, along side, about three in the afternoon; on his coming along I asked him if he had any thing heavy in his boat; he said, there was nothing heavy in the boat, but one box which was going back, (pointing at it,) and there was some alterations he believed to be made in it, and he believed he was coming down with it in the afternoon; immediately I ordered

               <p>Court. When did the captain enquire? - Sometime before he got to Madeira.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How many things did he bring in this boat? - I cannot tell the number of things, there were several things for the ship, that this man brought.</p>

               <p>Q. And he pointed particularly to another box? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you that that wanted some repairs and alterations and he believed he should be down in the afternoon, signifying there were more things coming down for your ship? - So I understood him.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are quite sure of? - So I thought.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this was it the captain came on board? - He came on board at Gravesend.</p>
               <p>Q. You told him you expected some more things would have come on board, but they went back for alterations? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why you was a good deal disappointed, was not you? - No, being so full of business we did not think about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the last package? - It was that came in a wherry; there was another man came down, but with no packages.</p>
               <p>Q. You was a good deal surprised he did not keep his word? - I was so.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you did not tell the captain? - I did not.</p>

            ; he came to the side of the vessel while she lay on the ground at limehouse-reach; I hauled up some goods and there was one box left in the boat, after he had hauled up every thing except this box, I threw down the rope again for this box, he told me it was not coming up, he was to take it back to have some 
alterations to it, and he went away from the ship up Limehouse-reach again; I am positively certain that the box was not put on board; the captain made an enquiry before he got to Madeira; I told him what passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever on board again before the ship sailed? - I have been in her 
two years and seven months.</p>


               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You expected the prisoner to return according to what he said? - I did not hear him say that.</p>
               <p>Q. All the hands were on deck? - There was none but me and the mate.</p>
               <p>Q. They were within sight of the boat, if they had directed their sight that way? - They might if they looked over the side.</p>
               <p>Q. He said this box was to have alterations made in it? - He said nothing to me about that.</p>
               <p>Q. As the box was to have alterations in it you expected him to return? - I never thought any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think it was to return or not? - I never thought any thing about it, I was about other work.</p>
               <p>Q Was you on shore afterwards? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. My friend I ask you whether if you had not been on shore yourself, you might not easily have had any thing conveyed on shore by other people?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you in point of fact steal it and give it away?</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What time was this that this man came to the ship in the boat? - As nigh as I can recollect, between two and three in the afternoon.</p>

             is my sister. - She married my own brother.</p>
               <p>On Friday the 14th of December, about half after seven, as near as I can recollect, we had been to Warner-street, to which place my sister had been to dispose of the counterpane. Warner-street is somewhere on Clerkenwell-green. We were returning from Warner-street to my house, Brackley-street, Golden-lane. - The first thing was, that my sister stopped to tie up her garter. - On which there were two bad women and a young man with them passed, that made a very bad expression. - I did not notice them, any otherwise than that, I observed a man with them. I came to the corner of Sutton-street, which turns about the post. I perceived the young fellow to pass me very swiftly by, going in the same direction with me, I noticed him to have a blue jacket and a round-hat. - Then I was saying to my sister, that I knew Mr. Cannon, that kept the Bunch of Grapes; and while I was speaking to my sister, he passed quickly between me and the window, and looked in my face. I believe it is the same man that passed me twice before.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he must have turned? - I did not observe that, but I observed that he was the same person, as I believe, but I am not certain it is the prisoner who passed me. There was a person passing while my sister was tying up her garters; and another while I was speaking to my sister at the Bunch of Grapes window, that person, I believe to have been the prisoner; but the person that passed me afterwards I am sure was the prisoner. He was dressed in a blue jacket, round hat, and a striped waistcoat. After he had passed me, he struck cross-wise, and came and catched hold of my bundle. I had just got across to the Charter-house-wall then. I did not observe him at me, till he seized my bundle. I was following my sister. I had crost, going to the place where I lodged. This was at the corner of <placeName id="t17921215-67-crimeloc382">Wilderness-row</placeName>

               <p>Jury. Which end of Wilderness-row? - In Goswell-street. - There was nothing passed; but he gave me a sudden twitch: and there came behind a lad of fourteen or fifteen years of age, and he also catched hold of my bundle. - Then the prisoner aimed to hit me, and he missed my head and hit my shoulder with a stick. - From that he raised his hand again; and I looked at him, and said, will you strike me, you villain? At which the blow hit me on the bonnet, just over my eye, and knocked me to the ground. It was a violent blow - it stunned me. I was certain it was the prisoner as soon as I saw him. The first thing that I observed, after I was sensible, was that I was dragged along by this person and another, on the ground, by my bundle. - I was dragged very near from the corner of Wilderness-row, to the Bar at the end of Wilderness-row. I called out, by name, Mr. Cannon, for God's sake, come out; I am murdered! When I called out, the prisoner ran away, and took the bundle with him, and tore sadly the inside of my hands. On my calling for assistance, they were pursued. I saw him again in the course of the evening. - As soon as I did, I jumped up, (though hardly recovered) and was going to seize him as the person. I was taken into Mr. Cannon's, and they brought him into Mr. Cannon's to me. He was in the room when I came to myself. I jumped up, and said, that was the villain that robbed me and used me so. I had not been informed that any body was taken at all. - I was hardly sensible. - There was a number of strangers in the room. I have no doubt about him at all. As he held up his arm to strike me, I noticed him; and his dress was the same; but not the dress he has on now. - He had a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150101"/>blue jacket, a round hat, and a striped waistcoat, cross-wise. I could not see the colour of the stripes by the lamplight.</p>
               <p>Court. You describe, three different times, persons passed you; and the prisoner was the person that passed you the last time. - He was, and directly as he had passed, he came and snatched at my bundle.</p>

I walked before my sister, first, to get home, because of my child. I had my child with me, (it being late) and then I was three or four yards before her; and I heard her scream out and I turned my head, and saw she was laid in some mud, a good way from me. It was by a wall. - I saw a man run with the bundle, and I thought it was mine; and I ran after him, and cried, stop thief! I followed him a great way, but I could not follow all the way, I was so tired with running. I lost sight of him. I am wife of

               <p>Between the hours of seven and eight, I was going up Wilderness row, and I heard a cry of murder! and stop thief! I was got about three parts down; and I saw the prisoner ren by me, with a bundle. - And on account of the alarm, I took him just at the bottom. I never quitted sight of him, after he ran by me, till I got him; but he dropped the bundle before I took him: but when he ran by, I saw him have the bundle under his arm. I know it is the man, for he never was out of my sight after I had seen him with the bundle under his arm. The patrole came up, and took him while he was in my custody. I saw the bundle again directly, as soon as possible, the man that picked it up could come up. - Williams brought up the bundle.</p>

               <p>I am a stable-keeper, in Old-street. - I was passing down Wilderness-row, from Goswell-street into St. John's-street, and I heard the cry of murder! and stop thief! On this cry I returned, running pretty swiftly. Just as I got to the pavement, I met a man, full-plump. Directly he saw me, he threw from him a bundle, which he had in his hand, down into Cross street. Mr. Thorpe had passed me about a yard, and got up to him, and struck him on the neck, against the iron rails. I took the bundle up, and brought it to him. After we had secured him, we took him to the public house to the prosecutrix; and directly she saw him, she was just recovered from a fainting-fit; she said, that is the villain that robbed me. Then Mr. Thorpe and I followed him to the watch-house. We went down Wilderness-row; and I wanted to see whether there was any bludgeon, or any thing else. - He had taken nothing else of her. While we were going to the watch-house, and looking about, the prisoner said he had taken nothing else. I suppose it was what he spoke accidentally. I told the patrole what I was looking for; and he knew I was looking for the bludgeon.</p>

I said to my partner, there is some Row! - Stop, a-bit! We directly turned back again, and met the prisoner at the bottom of Wilderness-row - we were both together. My partner laid hold of him. I happened to run<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150102"/>against a post, and he slipt through between the post and the palisades, Mr. Thorpe had struck him, I believe, - he said he was running after a thief. I said, there was no thief came that way, because there was no person passed that way. He said, the thief went down Cross-street. I said, then you have certainly over-run your mark. Says he, I could not stop myself (I produce the property which I received from Mr. Williams. I have kept it ever since.)</p>

               <p>Q. If you had paid 4 l. 4 s. 4 d. what was to be done with the things? - Mr. Gammon did not think they would have made a charge above 3 l. which if I would have paid he would have paid me again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this sum of money offered for the things that were pawned? - They were to take them out of pawn with the money; I was to pay them the money and he was to throw the bill out of court.</p>
               <p>Q. If Mr. Gammon paid this money, and you paid 3 l. who was to have the things? - I understood that they were to have the things; they were to have the money to get the things out of pawn.</p>

I immediately said, when I saw the roll of carpeting, you have taken this from the top-hole, in the upper-part of the warehouse. He did not deny that; but said, he believed the devil was in him. I mentioned to the officers, the next morning, how many yards there was in it; and when it was measured at the mansion-house, it proved to be that quantity. I have no doubt about it being my master's property; we had the same in our shop; we know it by the name of the pattern.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Pope. Did not you search me on the spot when you took me first? - I did, I rubbed him down and found nothing; when he was at the distance from me of about ten yards, I observed him stoop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Pope. If it had been on the same spot he must have seen the bundle.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman. On the 24th morning of last month between two and three, I heard some men running down Carolina-street into Russel-street; I immediately made over to them; Mr. Croker was near and had got one of the prisoners; he said, spring your rattle and follow that man; I saw two coming down; I took croft; I ran down Russel-street into Tottenham-court-road; I never lost sight of him; in Tottenham-court-road he tumbled into the dirt, he got up again before I got hold of him, he runs into Oxford-road and there I catched him facing the Boar and Castle, in Oxford-road, and took him to the watch-house of St. Giles's; he was examined and had nothing on him; when I first saw him he was about ten yards before Pope; I am sure it is the same.</p>
               <p>Croker. When I opened the dark lanthorn the candle was greasy as if not blown out long.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Croft. Whether he can swear I was the person that left Pope? - I can, I am very certain.</p>

               <p>Q. This happened between the hours of six and seven; are there any lamps there? - There are; and they were lighted.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of the prisoner? - I did for an instant or thereabouts, it was in his turning the corner which leads into Old-street-square; there was two in company, when they assaulted me, and were arm in arm.</p>

On the 20th of November last, on Tuesday I went out from my house to see my husband's mother that lives at Hoxton; I left my husband's mother at six o'clock, she is a nurse to a farm house, Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150113"/>Robinson's at Hoxton, and I believe it might be twenty minutes or half an hour after six when I got into Old-street, I was walking strait up, and just as I got to the coach stand, the prisoner at the bar, and another man met me, the other man gave me a push, and one of them made a very bad expression, I believe it was the prisoner, but I cannot positively say; I let them pass me, and they went on some yards from me and I kept behind them, and when they had got about three or four yards, they then went quite on the run, then it was about two lamps off I saw the prosecutor; and I saw the basket fall from his shoulders by the light of the lamps; then I heard somebody call out stop thief; and I walked pretty fast, when I came to the place there lay the basket, but nobody was there at all; with that I stopped a minute or two, and some people came round and asked what was the matter, I told them I believed somebody had been robbed, for I saw the basket fall from the man's shoulders; and they took it up, and just as we got the basket into the house, the prosecutor came back with the prisoner in his hand, or by the side of him, with that he insisted going back to the place where he was stopped, and they went to the place, I and several more people, the prisoner and the prosecutor, and they found a piece of chain, and the watch key; I am sure that is one of the men that pushed against me; but I cannot say he was the man, that robbed the man; after that they brought him back, and took him into the Red Lion, and the young man begged leave to send for some of his friends; with that one Mr. Fisher, and one Mr. Wise, and several more people came into the parlour; one Mr. Gass was sent for as an officer, and Mr. Shurey, another officer was there; and Mr. Fisher, or one of them pulled out some notes and offered the man a note for his watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a Bank note? - I fancy so, I did not see it only as it lay; they asked him how much his watch cost, he said, five guineas, with that they offered him five guineas, to pay for it, he said, he would leave it to the constables, for he did not understand whether he might be safe in taking it; with that Mr. Shurey wanted to make it up; Mr. Gass said, he should not; I went before the magistrate with them, where I related the same and he was committed.</p>

               <p>I am a headborough of St. Luke's. I was sent for on the 20th of November, a little after six o'clock, at the Red Lion in Old-street road; I took charge of the prisoner at the bar, when I came in one Mr. Shurey was there an officer of the same parish, he desired me to take charge of the prisoner, for he could not stop; I took charge of him. Mr. Shurey returned in about half an hour, we went down to the public office, Worship-street, and at a public house adjoining the office, there Mr. Shurey took five guineas of one Mr. Wise, and told the prosecutor to take the five guineas into his hand, till such time as he had his watch returned; and if he should not have his watch returned, he should have the choice of two or three together; after that, I told him he had done very wrong in so doing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. He took no part in it, all this was done by Mr. Shurey? - It was all done by Mr. Shurey, not by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prosecutor. Your watch has never been recovered? - No, sir, it was a watch the inside case pinch back, or some other metal, and the outside case was tortoiseshell, gold rims and gold studs, and chain to it, two metal seals, a metal key.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor never charged me with robbing him at all, but wanted to know whether I was a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150114"/>person of good character; accordingly he took my address and seemed content.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called twelve witnesses, who gave him an excellent character.</p>

Please you, my Lord, last Tuesday week, Mrs. Moore came to my lodgings, and asked me to pledge her some things, likewise I did; I went to Westminster, and pledged them for 3 s. 6 d. when I came back, I returned with the money; she asked me to go and drink something, likewise it was all spent in liquor, and she was very much drunk; and she asked me to put on some dinner for her husband; her husband came home, and after her husband had eat his dinner, she awaked, and gave me some more things to go and pawn; after that, she went along with the rest of her company and drinking, and then she came back again, and asked me to take some more things which I did; she gave me them all to pawn; I told her, if I had taken them unknown to her, I would have paid her out of my pension, but I took them for her, and we all drank together, and spent the money.</p>

               <p>- EMERY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am wife of the last witness; I knew the prisoner just a week, by sight; I know about her neither good nor harm, only that she took my property.

               <p>Q. Then it lay open to any body that came into the house? - No woman ever came into my room but her; I lost it; and I found it again at the pawnbroker's; the prisoner pawned it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you pawned it yourself, or desired any body to pawn it for you? - No, I missed it on the 18th of last month; I found it at the pawnbroker's the same day.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to the pawnbroker's to enquire for it? - I missed it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it into your head it was at the pawnbroker's? - I thought I would endeavour to find it. I first went to Brown's, I could not find it; I went from there to Mr. Wright's in the Ambrey.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever pawned any thing at Brown's? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I went down into the yard, about eight o'clock in the morning, and I found the spoon by the sink hole, and I took it, and went and made away with it; I never was in the woman's room; she cannot say I was in the room from Sunday night. Pray, Mrs. Emery, did you see me in the room? - No, but she was the only person that knew the spoon was in my room; it was in my tea cup the night before, when I went to bed, in the morning it was gone; I did not know she was in my room; but no other person had been in my room since I have been in the lodging but her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was down in the yard, and there I found it; she saw me standing by the street door when she came down, going with her husband's breakfast. My<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150119"/>father is a master gardener to Lord Barrington; my mother goes out a nursing.</p>

S. K. She left my service more than five months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. What month was it she left your service? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any account of these spoons you have lost? - I have from the pawnbroker. It is a painful task for me to appear against any poor creature, but I have suffered so exceedingly by servants, that it is necessary to make an example of them: a servant went and enquired, and found them at a pawnbroker's in Gravel-lane.</p>
               <p>- sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a pawnbroker. I produce the spoons. (Deposed to.) The first table spoon was brought the 22d of October; the tea spoon some time in September; but I cannot say positively the day; and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150120"/>the other table spoon this month. I have known her upwards of five years to use our shop; I received them all of the prisoner at the bar; I supposed she was a servant; I knew her using the shop; bringing the things; she had not brought any plate before, but she had brought other things; she had brought her own gowns, aprons, and so on; I had known her some time, and she always had a good appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. You must have known whether she was a servant? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish to know, whether you thought she was a person likely to have plate of her own property? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What name were they brought in? - One was pledged in the name of Kirby, and the other in the name of Brown.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no suspicion, by her using two names, what was the common name? - Brown and I heard that she had been married lately, and had changed her name.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did she get on these pawns? - The tea spoons 18 d. and the other two table spoons 6 s. each.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought she had got up in the world, and mended her circumstances, coming out with the silver table spoons? - I saw the letter was K.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was going through the Piazza's, one evening going to the play, and I could not get in, and this person picked me up, as I was with her I went to her lodgings, after I had been there some time, I took my watch out of my pocket, and lay it in the crown of my hat, the prisoner saw it, and ran down stairs with it, and I never recovered it. I advertised the watch, as it was a watch of value, on which I was advised to apply to some of the people at Bow-street, as in all probability I should get it; I thought to have prosecuted the receiver, but to my great surprise, I found I was bound over to prosecute the thief instead of the receiver; I was drawn into this prosecution; I have never seen my watch again.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the advertisement lead to the prisoner? - By describing the prisoner one of the people at Bow-street found her, and told me he would take her up, and did, and brought the person who had received the watch whom she confessed she sold it to for 15 s.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you with her? - Eight or ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you take on you to say this is the same person? - I could not be mistaken, because I took particular notice of her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Mr. Pilleau you seem a gentleman pretty far advanced in life? - Young enough for this business.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray sir, what station of life are you in? - That is nothing at all to the purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. It is to the purpose Mr. Pilleau? - I belong to a public office, I belong to the Bank, I am a <rs id="t17921215-82-viclabel464" type="occupation">clerk</rs>

               <p>Q. A single man I take it for granted? - I am not a single man.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you have children? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. How many children have you? - I have had a great many, I have six.</p>
               <p>Q. Your wife living and six children at this time; so you was betrayed and seduced into this prosecution was you? - I did not mean to prosecute the girl, my motive was to prosecute the receiver.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you never knew this girl before? - I never saw her but once before in the Piazza.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you never see her before she accosted you in the Piazza? - Not in her room, I saw her in the Piazza as I came by.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath have you not had frequent conversation with her? Mind what you are about Mr. Pilleau. - Not frequent, no farther than told her to go about her business.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this once or twice? - Once, about a fortnight before.</p>
               <p>Q. How happened it, sir, that you as a married man going to the play, and finding this woman, thought proper to go to her lodgings with her? - Because most men do foolish things sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a disgrace to come with such a prosecution into court. And when you went to her lodgings they were in <placeName id="t17921215-82-crimeloc465">Parker's-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. Do not you know Parker's-lane? - I did not know it before.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150122"/>Q. Now sir, when you went with this girl to these lodgings, did you agree to give her any money? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you go for? - For a lunching as most men do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her any thing? - She did not stand for that.</p>
               <p>Q. You put the watch on the hat before her face? - I did openly before her face.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never seen the watch since? - I have not, I wish I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how old the prisoner at the bar is? - I think I have heard she is about eighteen.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure you never knew this prisoner before, and if any body was to come, and swear you had known her perfectly well a great many years, it would be a falsity? - It would.</p>
               <p>Q. You never went with the prisoner at the bar before to her lodgings? - No, nor to any house whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you went to the play? - The third of November.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet the prisoner as you went, or as you came back? - I met her first as I went, and told her I could not stay, and desired her to go about her business.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you returned from the play-house? - About ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner then? - In the same place, or thereabout, somewhere under the Piazza.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you appoint the place? - No, I did not, nor did I measure the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. King's? - What Mr. King.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Crown-court? - I don't know what they call Crown-court, I know no such a place much.</p>
               <p>Q. Crown-court, Little Russel-street? - I don't know much or little either.</p>
               <p>Q. You are treating us with shuffling at present? - You shuffle with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Crown-court you don't know, out of Drury-lane, or out of Little Russel-street. Then you did not go with the prisoner at the bar, to a house in Crown-court a fortnight before this? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You are still a clerk in the Bank? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live with your wife and children? - Suppose I do, or do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Answer my question, Sir? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they know of this? - They do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Ryder? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Union-place? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Union-place, Lambeth? - I lived there.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say, that you did not know it; perhaps, now you have brushed up your recollection, you know a person of the name of Ryder, that lived there? - I do know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your wife and family live there? - They did.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Ryder had some family I believe? - He had.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe there had been some complaints of very indecent conduct from that part? - What indecent conduct?</p>
               <p>Q. It is not fit for a court of justice to be disgraced with the recital. Has not the Mr. Ryder that you know, complained of no indecent conduct that you have practised? - Mr. Ryder and I were on very good footing.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps, I am putting a wrong term on the manner in which you thought proper to conduct yourself; you may not consider it indecent; you may call it decent? - I don't know what you mean, that has nothing to do with this.</p>
               <p>Q. I will tell you what it has to do: there are some pails between you and Mr. Ryder's house? - You are wrong informed,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150123"/>if they told you so, there are not; there are high walls.</p>

               <p>I was on Westminster-bridge the 9th of November; I saw the prisoner at the bar running; I immediately ran after him; my acquaintance ran likewise, and catched him before me; as soon as he caught hold of him, he threw an handkerchief down, and I am certain I saw three taken out of his breeches pocket.</p>

I met him in Fleet-street, the city side of Temple-bar; he asked me, if I could tell him where he could get some whiskey; I went with him up Shire-lane; they were shut up; he turned down, and went to Ship-yard; they were shut up there, and he and I stayed at the end of a court together; he asked me, where I lived; I told him; he said, it was too far; he said, he would give me a shilling, if I would let him have connection with me in this court; it was close by a necessary; he wanted me to lay down in this necessary; I told him no, I did not chuse to do any thing of the like; he said, if I would, he would give me another afterwards; I said, I did not approve of it; he said, I might be damned, and the 1 s. too; he went away from me; I set on the necessary about a minute, having occasion to make water; I heard him speak to the watchman; says he, did you see a woman go by here; no, says the watchman; then she must be in the place where I left her, he said; he came to me, and said, I believe you have picked my pocket of three guineas; Lord, sir! says I, I have not told gold this good while, I have only this shilling you gave me; says he, watchman, I give charge of her; I was taken to the watch-house; the constable asked me, what money I had about me; I told him, but 1 s. the constable asked him, if he gave me a shilling; He said, yes, for charity; the constable asked me to strip my clothes off; I did to my shift; he searched even my bonnet and cap. The constable said, I have found nothing, and if, you think, I have not done you justice, take and strip her again. The gentleman at Bow-street told him, it was impossible for me to rob him if he had no connexion; he said, he believed, I must come on the side of him in some odd manner, and take it out of his pocket; he asked him, what he gave the shilling for; he said, he gave me the shilling out of charity, and had nothing at all to do with me, nor I had nothing to do with him, than I have to do with him this moment; if I had robbed him, I would not have stopped in the same place as where he left me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. She deceived me, by not directing me to the place I thought she would; she tore my things all open.</p>
               <p>Q. How could she get her hands into your pocket? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your money? - In my left hand breeches pocket.</p>

            ; we frequently missed the blue which we conceived must have been stolen; the prisoner at the bar worked for us about sixteen months, he worked more particularly in the manufactory of mustard, he managed the horses, the mills that manufactured the one did the other; but still the mustard-maker has no business with that part of the manufactory where the blue was manufactured; he might occasionally have worked at the blue, but he had not for some months past. On the 5th of November very late in the evening, Hall, a city constable, and another man called and told me they had him in custody; I attended the Lord Mayor's court and the property was there produced.</p>

On the 5th of November last, near nine o'clock in the evening, I and some more officers were going up Petticoat-lane, we observed the prisoner at the bar with a bag on his shoulder, he stopped at the door of an iron shop, a suspicious house, we crossed over the way, went to him immediately and asked what he had got there; he said, he had got some blue; I asked him how he came by it; he said, he met a man and gave him 5 s. for it; I immediately took him into a public house close on the spot; I then asked him if he knew where to find the man; he said, no, I then asked him where he lived; he made no answer, but that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150128"/>he worked on the Keys at different places; he hoped I should not detain him; I told him I must take care of him; immediately I then carried the blue and took the prisoner to the Compter, going to the Compter he said, it was his first offence and desired me to let him go.</p>

               <p>Q.

Yes, I have, says I, says she, you must come over to Mr. Dover's, the pawnbroker's, and see whether it is your shirt; and I went over and it was my shirt.</p>

The person that brought it, was admitted an evidence against this girl, and she has run away; she brought the shirt and we asked her whose it was, she said it was Fitzgerald's, I told her I would take it in of Fitzgerald, but I would not take it in of her; she fetched Mrs. Fitzgerald, and Mrs. Fitzgerald came; and she said this girl has brought me to own a shirt, that I know nothing about; she said that the girl lived at the Bell, a public house in Newtoner-street, a servant, she did live at the Bell, and we sent over to her master; then immediately Mrs. Fitzgerald found out that this woman lost her things, either this day or the day after.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. All you know about this girl's taking them is, that when you taxed her with it, she then said she had given them to her mother? - She did, and nobody else goes into the room but the prisoner and me, and two children; she said she met her mother in the street, and gave them to her.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses to her character, and who proved she was not rightly in her senses at times.</p>

Even if it had not been buttoned, could the purse have come to that place where you saw the purse lay? - It was from one side of the room to the other, one shilling laid down by the purse; they were searched in the watch-house but not in the room; I never got but one shilling.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is not polite to look at your customers.

The candle was on the window.</p>
               <p>Q.

               <p>I am a publican; I took the prisoner coming out of the hoard with it, he had it on his shoulder; I came up to him and asked him what he was going to do with that piece of timber; he said, he was going to carry it to his master; I told him he must carry it a door or two further; I made him bring it to our door; I had him taken into custody and had him taken to his master; the timber was taken into our house that night.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I did it for real distress and want; I had not a farthing in the world nor could I get any relief from the parish where I belong to; I took a piece of wood whether it is the same or no I cannot tell.</p>

             was standing with several of them at the corner of an alley further on with another woman, and she took hold of my arm, she was on the right side of the Strand as I was going up, and she asked me to have a glass of wine, or something of that sort; I refused giving her the wine, and she still kept hold of my arm till we got to the corner of a passage when I stopped with her; we had not stopped above a minute or two, but I put my hand into my pocket and missed my watch; I was not sensible when she took it; I asked her if she had got it; she said, she had not got it and laughed, and just as I missed it I turned round, and the other women that were with her was gone; at the time I first met her there were two other women with her; but she stayed with me till the watchman came up voluntarily; when he came up I gave her in charge to the watchman; she was taken to the watch-house and searched and nothing found on her; the other two women was not near me, they were within a yard or two, I don't think they were near enough to touch me; she had got hold of my right arm and I never let her quit my hold till I charged her with the watch. I was sent for to the public office in Lemon-street; these other two women were in custody and the watch was found on them; I saw the watch at the office; I advertised the watch next morning with a reward; but I found it was taken immediately. I went on the 12th, they were taken on the 11th.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Kirkpatrick I believe these ladies were apprehended in the neighbourhood of East Smithfield; that is a considerable distance from the Strand? - It may be, I don't know where it is, I am a stranger in town.</p>
               <p>Q. Very likely then your curiosity might lead you to converse with more ladies then one; - I believe there was another spoke to me somewhere in the Strand.</p>
               <p>Q. You seem a good humoured pleasant man, and no doubt inclined to indulge<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150135"/>the ladies as far as in your power; did you stop any length of time? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray Mr. Kirkpatrick where had you been spending your evening? - In Covent-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Drank a little of course? - Yes, a little.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been in Maiden-lane? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray Mr. Kirkpatrick how lately before you came into the Strand did you know you had your watch? - I had had my watch when I was in Covent garden.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been at the coffee house that evening? - I had been at the Carpenter's-arms in the middle of the Garden.</p>
               <p>Q. This is one of the early houses; I observed that the expression you used when this was fresh in your memory was, that you verily believed that you had the watch when you went out of that coffee house? - If you will give me leave to explain it, I think it necessary. Some gentlemen had gone to that house and had had a little supper and drank some liquor there; one of them there pulled out my watch; he said, I think you are rather poorly, we will try how your pulse beats.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I believe then I need not feel how your pulse beats any further.</p>

On Friday the night of 7th of December, between the hours of eleven and twelve; coming from the west-end of the town, something disguised in liquor, I was accosted by the prisoner, (to the best of my recollection) in Broad-street, St. Giles's, and solicited to accompany her to her lodgings, which, at that time, I did not know where they were. I went with her. - I was conducted up to a one pair of stairs room, where there was then a light, and a small fire. - I was there about a quarter of an hour. - I was then further solicited to take off my clothes, I did; and I went to bed with her. - How long I was I don't know; but I fell asleep very soon, from the effects of the liquor I had drank. I awoke; and reflection and recollection came a-cross me so strong, that it alarmed me a great deal. I enquired what o'clock it was. - My reason for asking this, was, I had hung my watch close by the bed-side, on the corner of the chimney-piece, which I then missed. The chimney-piece is not a yard from the bed, to the best of my remembrance. Missing my watch, I immediately got up, and was going to dress myself. I should observe to your lordship it was then dark; my clothes were removed all about the room, and when I wanted them I found sometimes one, and sometimes the other; finding my situation to be such, I called out and gave an alarm; the prisoner asked me what I wanted, why I made such a noise; I told her I thought there was sufficient reason, as I have been robbed, and as such I would wish to know what was become of my watch, she said she knew nothing about it; the alarm I had given brought some persons into the room; but whom I cannot tell, one was a woman, and the other was a man; the man enquired what was the matter, I told him accordingly, I had been robbed,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150136"/>I missed a shirt pin, a pair of silk stockings, a man's cloth great coat; my pocket I found had been rifled; the man that came into the room said I am sorry for it, I will go down and call my father, he went down and came up again, and said his father was coming; he came and brought his father, and we came down into the street and called the first watchman near; his name is

               <p>Q. You admit yourself to be so very drunk that you fell asleep as soon as you got to bed? - It was not from the quantity of liquor, but the badness, that made me drunk; I had not drank more than six-pennyworth of rum and water, I might have drank a little more of porter that day, I had called at a house in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober enough to know that you had your watch about you? - I am sure I had and the pin to the best of my recollection I slipped into my coat pocket where my pocket book was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any light in the room? - When I went into the room there was a light and a fire.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your watch? - A metal watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your silk stockings again? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do for a pair of stockings? - I had two pair on, I had a pair of under ones, under my silk stockings, I found the one pair, but the silk ones I lost.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the value of this watch be? - 15 s. or 20 s.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the value of your silk stockings? - 2 s.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the value of this pin? - 15 s. or 20 s.</p>

             follow that man and bring him back, I stood at the door and saw Read bring him back, when he came back, he had the basket on his shoulder, I then ordered Read and another person to take the basket off his head, taking the basket off his head, there was the jack that was over the lead, with that I immediately took out the lead and I marked it, I then ordered him to the watch-house, after I had lodged him in the watch-house, I went to the roof of the work-house, there I observed a great quantity of lead cut away all of it fresh. I took the lead in the basket into my possession and kept it, it was taken to the roof of the work-house, I sent for a plumber and had it beat out on purpose, it fitted and corresponded even with the nails.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then of course you did not see any instrument by which this could be cut? - There was a bricklayer's ladder just by an adjacent building.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know so despotic a sovereign as a bricklayer is over his labourer, his man was under the controul of such a monarch? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. That is an universal proposition? - there is no rule without an exception.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he taken in his beer that day? - I really do not know, but he had taken in a great deal of gin.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the poor fellow worked there? - I had observed four or five days.</p>

Whether I found this knife on Macquire or Cunningham I cannot say. While I was there part of this property was brought to me, which had been picked up by a lamp-lighter,

A young man that was going by, heard me say to Mrs. Jones go after a constable, and stopped; I told Mrs. Jones to call that young man in, and he assisted us; he said why did not you let me take them out before you took me; the young man came in and I see him take the red handkerchiefs out of his pocket after he came in; the waistcoats are worth 30 s. and more, the cotton handkerchiefs 13 s. and the linen handkerchiefs, 10 s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Why did not you take them out of my breeches when you said they were in first? - I thought you was a stronger man then me; and I thought I could get to the door and lock you in.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The gentleman says, I pulled them out of my pocket; and the other says, I pulled them from behind me. - Whether it was from behind you you pulled them out, or out of your pocket, I cannot say positively, but you pulled them from you.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I went into this shop to buy a pair of breeches, and the gentleman pulled me down five or six pair; two pair I tried on, and they were full large, - They would not do. I want a pair says I with strings. I went out - there were none fitted me. I went to the Coach and Horses, in Clerkenwell-green, and I stayed about an hour. When I came back, I called for a pair of breeches;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150148"/>and the gentlewoman came to the door, and she called this young man in. When I went in, says I, you remember I was here about three-quarters of an hour ago. He took me down a pair of breeches: says I, they will not do, because they are straps, and I want strings. Trying on the breeches, I pulled down my apron, and a parcel of things tumbled down with it - Some fell behind my breeches, and some just at the knee of my breechs. The young man came round, and says, What are you at? - If you stir, I will cut your head open. You talk foolish, says I. He calls out, directly, for the gentlewoman of the house; and she came, and the gentleman came in; and the neighbours picked up several things at the same time: but as for having any thing about me, I had not.</p>
               <p>Court. How came this bundle up your back? - I had nothing behind my back - Is it possible to suppose, that a man should have such a bulk about him without being perceived? When the constable came he searched me, and found 17 s. and 6 d. in my pocket.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>

Gentlemen, I am as innocent of it as a child unborn.</p>

               <p>Sunday was a week, Mr. Watts, and his man, Stanly, came to me, and asked my husband and me, whether we would be so kind as to come to see him at their house, as his wife had made an elopement for a fortnight before we went there; and when we were there, this boy came in, and asked Mr. Watts to buy a watch: Mr. Watts, knowing the boy, asked him where his father and mother were. He then asked him the price of it. - He asked a guinea and an half. Mr. Watts bought the watch for 25 s. if his father was agreeable to take the money. On that Mr. Watts asked the prisoner Hollwell to go with the lad to see if his father was agreeable. We sat in the house just the same; and that gentleman came to me, and said, he wanted Mr. Watts. He then stepped out with the watch, to ask somebody, whether it was worth the money or not; and he brought it back - and when he brought it back, he gave it to Mr. Stanley to take it to the boy. The boy delivered the watch to Mr. Watts for 1 l. 5 s. if his father had been agreeable to take the money. Hollwell never had the watch. She went out, and the boy and Watts soon followed.</p>

             came to my house Sunday was a week, and enquired of me, for my wife and me to go over and see to make matters up between him and his wife. While we were there, in came the boy with the watch, and said he would sell it; and offered it to Mr. Watts for sale. Mr. Watts asked him, what he would take for it: he said a guinea and an half. - They came to an agreement for 1 l. 5 s. if in case his father was willing to take the money. - His father lived in Union-street, Shadwell. So, by that means, the woman and he went out both together, to see if his father was agreeable or not. There was a man's voice called into the boy while he was in there; they thought it was his father. - He said it was. They went out, and I heard no more.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did Watts go out? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he follow the woman immediately? - I don't think he did, I suppose it might be a quarter of an hour for what I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the watch that time? - The last time I saw the watch, it was laying on the table, the woman went out with the boy, and took the watch with her.</p>
               <p>Q. When she took the watch from the boy's hand, what did she do with it? - She looked at it, and it was laid down on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - I am certain it was laid on the table.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hollwell. Mr. Morgan, my brother and sister invited me to come down to Mr. Watt's, this boy came in between five and seven o'clock, and offered this watch for 1 l. 10 s. for he said, it cost his father that, Mr. Watts said, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150153"/>had only a guinea, but he would give 1 l. 5 s. and if his father would come he would give him that money; he had lived twice with Mr. Watts, as they say, the lad shewed the watch about to all the house, the boy said, to me Mr. Hollwell, what do you think of it, I said, I don't know, the boy sold it to this man for 1 l. 5 s. Mr. Watts went to the public house to borrow the remainder of the money; the boy said, my father is sick in bed. Mrs. Hollwell said, Mr. Watts will you step to his father and see? I heard somebody call Will to that boy, Jack says he, you must say the watch is your's, for they have stopped it; I took hold of the lad, and says, I believe you have stole the watch, he had a little wand, and struck me twice, I ran after him into the Virginia Planter, and I said to some man are you an officer, if you are, take hold of this body, I never denied that Mr. Watts bought the watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Watts. On Sunday morning this man and me went over to Mrs. Morgan's to ask them to come over, they came and this gentlewoman came over too, we made shift with a bit of cold leg of mutton for dinner, and it passed on till between five and six getting a little drop of drink, this boy came in and stood dangling his chain, so says I, Will you have got a watch is it your own? he comes and whispers to me I will sell it to you, if you will buy it; my father has been out of work this week or fortnight, and I want to give him a few shillings; what do you ask for it, says I, I don't know, whether he told me 1 l. 10 s. or 1 l. 11 s. 6 d. I will not be positive, he came to 1 l. 5 s. I said, I would buy it, if his father was agreeable; the watch was laid down on the top of my table, every body was looking at it, now thinks I, I have not the money, I will whip over to the chandler's shop, and at the same time, I will shew it somebody, I heard there was a disturbance about this watch, I went in again, and I says to the man, you run up with the watch that is all I know about it. I never wronged a man of a farthing ever since I was born.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. When is your dinner time? - At twelve o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. What was that for? - Because I should know him again; the other cocks were not marked, I had had them two or three years, I will take my oath as long as I live, that they fowls were mine; one of the other cocks had a core taken out under his throat; I know the hens by having them so long, knowing they were my property by seeing them in the day, I had them three or four years, four of the hens were black, and one was a brown or red whatever you call it.</p>
               <p>Q Did you define when you was at the magistrates, precisely the number you had lost? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am a constable of Clerkenwell; on Sunday morning the 11th of November, about six o'clock I met Phancutt, Platt was with him, I met him at the top of Albemarle-street, St. John'-street, they asked me for the Nag's head, I told them it was very near there, and I asked them what they had got under their arms? each one having a bundle in a blue apron, I asked them what they had got there? Phancutt said, does it trouble you, what we have got, I said it did, and I would insist on seeing, says he, you have no occasion to make such a bother about it, he said, he was going down to Bath, I said, I would see what was in there, and I called my superintendant, Mr. Inglefield, to take charge of Platt; I directly took hold of another man, who was discharged before the justice, I carried them down to the watch-house, I took the bundles and opened them at the watch house; Inglefield carried one each; Inglefield carried Phancutt's bundle, and I carried Platt's, I opened their bundles, and they contained dead fowls quite hot, just killed, they said, they were their own fowls, they said, they were cocks, hens, and pullets, he said, be they hens or cocks, be they what they will, there are eight in number. Phancutt had four, one cock and three hens; the other had two cocks and two hens; I says to them directly, now tell me where you have come from, they said directly they came from Kensington. Phancutt told me, that I got their names, now my lads, says I, you shall go along with me to gaol, I took them before the justice, and there Tibbott saw them, and the fowls, going to gaol, they begged to have a little beer, I let them have two pots of beer among them all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. In all this Phancutt was the great spokesman, do you think Platt had recovered from his evening's dose? - He was not drunk, but he had but very little to say.</p>

               <p>I am superintendant of the watch, I was in company with Brown, at the time he stopped these men, I went to shut up the by man's box that morning, and Mr. Burr was along with me; just as I had shut up the box, these three men came up, the two men at the bar and another; Burr called to me, and we took them to the watch-house; there Burr asked what property they had there? they said, what property they had there was their own, the fowls were not produced before them, till they came before the magistrate in the morning; we took the fowls from them at the corner of Albemarle-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I take it for granted you do not mean to tell a different story from Burr? - I will tell nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of the men say any thing to you? - They did not till they got up to the Harp, where they went in to drink, when Platt said, he thought it made no odds to which prison he went, says he, I had rather go to New Prison, because I have been out only there last Thursday, from thence we went to prison with them; the next morning they were before the justice, and the prosecutor came and owned the property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe Phancutt was the only person that spoke about the fowls, except that particular, which you mention, was Platt quite sober that morning? - He was not.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Phancutt. That gentleman tells false things, he carried them down to the watch-house himself, and he opened the apron, and told them as they lay on the table, and I told him I came from Kingsland.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Platt. I told that gentleman in Clerkenwell, I never was there for any robbery.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Platt called five witnesses, who gave him a good character; and the prisoner Phancutt called one.</p>

            ; he at the same time well knowing the said bond to be false, forged and counterfeit against the form of the statute and against the king's peace.</p>
               <p>(The indictment was opened by Mr. - and the case by Mr. Garrow.)</p>
               <p>Mr. RAILTON sworn.</p>
               <p>At the latter end of October or on the 1st of November, Mr. Sewel who is an attorney at Norwich, and acquainted with Mr. Tilbury, who is a partner of mine, came to my house, he said, he came on a message of importance, he said, it was concerning a considerable debt which was due to the prisoner at the bar; Mr. Sewel produced to me this bond which I have in my hand, and said, the prisoner claimed on it; on that I read the bond over, found it very imperfectly written, being a bond for so very large a sum of money, said, it does not appear to me that it was written by any professional man; I wanted to know the consideration for the bond and how it came into Dunnett's hand; I mentioned that in the presence of the prisoner; the prisoner said, that he received the bond in payment of the quarter part of the lottery ticket which he had purchased in the lottery preceeding the date of the bond of Messrs. Richardson and Co. I then observed that there was 10 l. more than the quarter part of that ticket, and that I apprehended there were deductions made from the prizes; the prisoner said, the bond was not dated at the period at which he became entitled to his prize but afterward; I asked him if he knew who the witness to the bond was, because I had my doubts respecting it; he said, he believed he could find him out; I asked him how he became possessed of it; he said, it came to him in a parcel addressed to him at a house in Norwich; I think he said, the flying or rampart horse; I wished to see the letter it came in, and also to know who the witness was, as I thought I ought to have information of that kind before I made application to Messrs. Richardson; I desired Mr. Sewel to return into Norfolk for that purpose, and to learn every information he could respecting the bond; I was induced to do this in consequence of my believing what the prisoner said was true, and thinking that the payments had been made by some clerks in the house, and might have patched up this bond and have quieted the prisoner without Messrs. Richardson's knowledge, and I was the more led to make that sort of enquiry seeing two sums written by way of interest on the bond; on the subject of both of which he gave as blind an account as he did of the bond, and which he had admitted to have received in bank bills addressed to him in a similar manner as the bond itself, from which payments, he said, he had been inclined to rest satisfied with the bond till he had occasion for the money, which he then had for a considerable part of it. In consequence of my advice they returned into Norfolk as they left me, promising to go there; they came to my house again on the 8th of November, Mr. Sewel and the prisoner; I was out when they came in but found them there; the prisoner was desirous of having Richardson and Co. proceeded against by an arrest for the recovery of the bond; having still my doubts about the validity of it, as they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150157"/>had brought up no information or cover conveying the bond, I waved proceeding by an arrest, said, I knew the house of Richardson and Goodluck to be solvent, and that there would be no danger of a personal application, which I wished to have made on the circumstance of the bond, thinking as I did, that the prisoner had been imposed upon by the clerks. I desired an application might be made by myself that I might observe the countenances of the parties and the nature of their receiving the application. Dunnett and Sewel went with me, when we went to the lottery office I perceived Mr. Richardson there; I told him I had an occasion to speak to him on a letter of business, and wished he would give an opportunity of doing it in a private room; he invited me up stairs, I told him the two gentlemen with me, pointing to Mr. Sewel and the prisoner at the bar were concerned in what I wished to speak to him about, and therefore I desired they might come up at the same time; he consented to it, and we all went up together; Mr. Sewel then gave this bond to me in the presence of the prisoner; I gave it to Mr. Richardson, told him I was applied to by an attorney and the prisoner respecting the money that was due on the bond, that the prisoner did not want all the money, but a part of it, that I wished him to look on the bond and give his answer to it, and then gave it to Mr. Richardson; Mr. Richardson read it, was much agitated I could perceive while he was reading it; he locked at me says he, Mr. Railton I have known you many years, I am astonished at the demand, and if the parties had presented the bond without your being present I would have deemed them madmen, but out of respect to you I shall give such answers as I think proper; I then asked him if the signature to the bond, purporting to be Richardson was his signature; he said, it was not; I asked him if the signature of any of the gentlemen who were his partners appeared to be their signatures; he said, they did not; I asked him if he knew the signature of the person purporting to be a witness Roberts, he said, they had a clerk of the name of Roberts, he said, it was not his signature; he, desirous of giving me any information in his power; after he had denied the writing of himself and partners, said, that if I wanted the satisfaction to see his partners he would desire them to come up without any comment at all, without any observation they each denied the hand writing on the bond to be theirs; I then communicated to them my sentiment that he might have been imposed upon by some person in their house, and I would wish the books to be searched, which they readily consented to, and searched the books so as to discover this man had no dealings with them at the period which he mentioned; there were some transactions that appeared afterwards to be done with him, and there appeared to be about 8 d. or 4 d. owing for the postage of a letter or something, and the prisoner was that overpaid, he then asked the prisoner what he brought the bond there for; then he demanded the 2.510 l. for which it purports to be given, he said he demanded the money of Mr. Richardson; it was after this period that Mr. Richardson wanted to know what to do; I then said, if it would turn out fatal to the prisoner I was sorry I had been made use of. A constable was sent for and he was taken into custody, and taken before a magistrate; I am sure it is the bond, for I put my initials on the margin; I put it under the seal of the prisoner, then I put the bond under a cover sealed by the prisoner and myself, and afterwards I put my initials on it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Mr. Railton, I believe before this you had never seen the prisoner at the bar? - Nor knew him, nor did I know Mr. Sewel.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150158"/>Q. Mr. Tilbury nor yourself was agent to Mr. Sewel? - No, not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner at the bar was first introduced to you you looked upon him quite a country man, an ignorant man who might easily be imposed upon? - I did in the manner I have alluded to in my evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came first to you you compleatly had the idea in your mind, and that was the reason you had the desire of his going back again; his persisting that he had bought a quarter share of a lottery ticket which had been fortunate to be drawn a 10,000 l. prize? - I thought him imposed upon as a countryman and that Richardson and Co. had paid the money to some of their clerks who had quieted this man by this bond.</p>
               <p>Q. At the last you felt yourself extremely concerned to have any thing to do in this business. You went twice to the house of Richardson and Co.? - I went only once.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Sewel or the prisoner tender the bond? - Mr. Sewel produced the bond to me; he always produced it to me; Mr. Sewel also told me that he had his doubt about the bond and that Dunnett admitted it to be his.</p>
               <p>Q. Dunnett did not make use of such expression as admit? - Yes, he did, and that he had it for payment of a lottery ticket.</p>
               <p>Q. We are then to understand that the prisoner having expressed a doubt about this bond went to the house of Richardson and Co. whose bond it was. Did he ever hesitate going to Richardson's house? - I cannot say he did; I advised Mr. Sewel not to part with the bond.</p>
               <p>Q. From the first time you had seen him to that time he might have come back again or not? - To be sure he might, I would have much rather he would have gone off than stayed.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you was led to imagine that this man was imposed upon by another circumstance, that the bond itself was not done in a business way yet the indorsement was? - No, he had wrote the indorsement himself.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact when you came to make the enquiry you did hear of such a person of the name of Roberts? - Yes, that made me still the more believe the man could be cheated; I was satisfied there must be guilt somewhere, but I could not impute it any where.</p>
               <p>Q Still however the prisoner at the bar, in the course of all this examination stopped and heard it all and he remained fixed in his determination and you went with him? - Because I wished to see how Richardson and Goodluck would treat it in countenance and observation.</p>
               <p>Q. He was there and stopped all the while to hear it? - Yes,</p>
               <p>Q. To Railton. I would ask you, sir, from your opportunity of observing of the prisoner at the bar whether he shewed any particularity in his conduct during the whole or part of the time you saw him? - I thought his countenance was wild and distracted even from the first time I saw him he gave frequent stares and looks, not quite in my opinion consistent with a person in his senses; that was the impression his conduct made on my mind in the moment.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you did not imagine that his conduct betrayed the conduct of a man out of his mind? - When I told him the question was serious, he seemed very much agitated; and I could see that his mind was disturbed, whether it was the effect of a disordered mind, or the effect of conscious guilt, gentlemen, it will be for your verdict.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Richardson seemed to think the same as you? - The reason was, that he thought it was a bold thing, to demand money on a bond which was neither his writing nor his partners.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150159"/>Q. Did you see, on that occasion, Mr. Arnold? - I saw all the partners, but one, Mr. Goodluck.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether there is such a person as Mr. Goodluck? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Steele to Mr. Railton. Did it appear to you that Mr. Roberts. their clerk, had had correspondence with the prisoner? - It did.</p>
               <p>Mr. SEWEL sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an attorney at Norwich. I have known the prisoner ever since my infancy. He has resided at Rainthorp Hall, about eight miles from Norwich. He had mentioned being possessed of such property, frequently. It may be four or five years back. He described himself to be possessed of property of three of four thousand pounds. I don't know from what house, but I recollect he had security for some property, derived from the lottery, as early as four years ago. About the 8th of October, he applied to me on the very subject of this bond. On the 20th of August the prisoner applied, and requested me to go over to Ingham with him, to look over a considerable estate he was about to purchase. I went over with him, and advised him against it. - The estate afterwards came to auction, and the prisoner became the purchaser of it, for 6000 l. - Afterwards he wished to recede from the bargain, as they applied to him for the deposit and duty. I was applied to to settle it, as he did not want to have it, the world was very censorious upon him, and he asked me to advertise for a meeting of his creditors. In consequence of that advertisement being inserted, the prisoner deposited that security, with other securities, in my possession, for to answer these demand. The amount of the other security might be 500 l. or upwards: all of them promissory notes. The debts claimed amounted to more than 700 l. After the others had been lodged with me I recommended the prisoner to look to the notes of hand first, and let this matter rest a little while. I wrote to the parties, whom the prisoner pretended were his debtors, and delivered the drafts to the prisoner, who said he was going over to Bury, and that he would deliver them to the parties. None of them paid, except 6 l. On the 30th of October, Dunnett applied to me to come to town with him. There was 700 l. to pay, and only 6 l. to pay it with. The prisoner was in the seed trade, and lived at some expence, in the stile of a private gentleman's son. In consequence of that I came, and arrived in town, on the 31st of October last; and called upon Mr. Railton. I cannot correct Mr. Railton in his statement, in one instance. I was before the Lord Mayor. The bond that I went to demand upon, I received from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You say, you had known the prisoner from his infancy. Had you frequent opportunities of seeing him? - Very frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the habits of intimacy with him? - Yes, on very good terms. I have been with him at his uncle's house, when I was a school-boy, I used to go there to spend two or three days frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever make any observations on his conduct? - There was I thought something extremely singular in his conduct; it might be three years since he seemed very low, rather in a state of stupidity than otherwise.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any sister? - He had two or three sisters.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know them? - I know one and only one; I have heard that he went to a closet and took out a brace of pistols and attempted to shoot his sister.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the circumstance of his having a fall from his horse? - That was the time I speak of, three years ago; I did not see him fall, I heard of it, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150160"/>that he was in consequence of that, in a state of stupidity for some time; it was after that time that I heard of the conduct he used to his sister; last November I heard of his conduct to his sister.</p>
               <p>Q Have you heard any thing of his attempting to drown himself? - I did hear it in the month of October, or the begining of November.</p>
               <p>Q. In short from the observations that you had made of him from being a school boy to the present time, there was always something peculiarly singular about him? - There was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Pray Mr. Sewel let us be a little grave. If he had applied to you to make his will would you have made it? - I did make his will in the month of March, in the present year.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you consider him as a sane man at that time? - Undoubtedly so, or else I should not have made his will.</p>
               <p>Q. You took him to be a man of sound mind and memory, capable of disposing of his property; do you think that he continued of the same disposing powers till he came to London? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. All that you meant to describe of him was, that he was not so gay, that he was not so talkative as some others, that he was occasionally dispirited, but always of a sound mind and disposing powers. Now we heard a good deal of what you have been told. Did you ever hear it insinuated that he was not a man of perfectly good understanding and capable of conducting all his affairs? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray when did you hear this anecdote about the unloaded pistol? - This I heard just before he came to town the last time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that after he had been at Mr Railton's? - It might be a fortnight back or three weeks,</p>
               <p>Q. Then there had got a rumour in the country, that he had presented a pistol to his sister, and fell from his horse; but down to the time you visited Mr. Richardson, had you ever heard it hinted that he had been in danger of drowning? - No.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you certain that that cover never contained the bond, or at least you never sent it in that cover? - On the contrary, it contained a mere letter of business; for the house of Richardson and Co.</p>
               <p>The letter was wrote on a sheet of post paper, this cover is the half of the letter I sent, here are a number of seals on the paper, which were not on it when it went from me, the words Sir, Sir, was not on it, when it went from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no transaction with your house, and the prisoner on the account of a prize of 10,000 l. - We have not shared a 10,000 l. prize since the lottery 1785, which was drawn in 1786.</p>
               <p>Q If any person in the name of Dunnett, had become possessed of such a prize, would you of course have known it, are the books public for all persons to see? - They are.</p>
               <p>Q. Then except these transactions there has been none with the prisoner Dunnett to your knowledge? - None at all, he wrote up to know what his prize amounted to; and we wrote him word, he owes us now about 1 s. 7 d.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. I was present at the Lord Mayor's when the prisoner was examined, and he described this cover as the cover in which he received the bond. (The bond read by the clerk).</p>
               <p>Prisoner. May it please your Lordship, and Gentlemen of the Jury. In the beginning of the year 1789, I sent money to the house of Messrs. Richardson and Co. to send me, in return, a quarter of a lottery ticket. In the month of March following, I was informed that the ticket was intitled to 10,000 l. Being greatly rejoiced at such an event, I was going on horse back, among my friends and acquaintances, when I had the misfortune to be thrown from my horse, and my skull was fractured. - And from that time I was incapable of attending to my business. As soon as I recovered my senses a little, I sent a letter to Messrs. Richardson and Co's. informing them, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150162"/>was the fortunate adventurer, and became thereby intitled to the 10,000 l. prize, and would take their bond, payable on demand, for the same. On which, in a few days afterwards. Messrs. Richardson and Co. sent me an answer, desiring me to buy a quantity of lottery tickets, and they would send me their bond, as required, which they did: and they sent me 2510 l. and I received two different sums of money, as interest for the same, of Richardson and Goodluck.</p>
               <p>In the month of October, being in want of a few hundred pounds, to answer some demands: I desired Mr. Sewell to advertise a meeting of my creditors; and I requested him to come to town with me, to receive such monies as I should be intitled to, to answer the demands against me: and Mr. Sewell and myself came to town in October; and we went to Mr. Railton's. He advised us to go back again to get some necessary things wanting; accordingly I did. - When we went up again, and came again to London, we went with Mr. Railton to Mr. Richardson's; and when Mr. Richardson asked me if I wanted the money, I told him, yes. He sent for a constable, and charged me with commiting a forgery.</p>
               <p>I hope you will take my unfortunate case into consideration. I am innocent of the case before you, I have at all times been a man of property until now. And, my Lords and Gentlemen, I should have a number of respectable persons, in order to convince the Court of my innocence, and my character in general; and of the unfortunate situation of being deranged in my senses, as I am frequently laid up for a month, which is a hardship for me: but the great distance prevents their attendance; which I hope, my Lords and Gentlemen, you will take into consideration my unfortunate condition, in losing my senses. - And, my Lord, if the bond is a forgery, I have been greatly imposed upon, by those who remitted me the bond for my share of the ticket in the lottery. I never was in London till I came for the bond. If I had known it to have been a forgery, I would not have gone to have received the money, nor have had it in my possession. I never saw any of their writing, nor of their clerks, till I came to London. - Therefore, my Lord and Gentlemen, consider my unfortunate situation, of being deprived of my senses, which can be no more restored to me again.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an Assistant to the Poultry Compter. I remember the prisoner at the bar coming into my custody; his conduct has been very singular in many instances. He has pretended to write to people of Norwich, whom he has had no degree of claim on; and several other things that made me believe that the man was really out of his mind.</p>
               <p>The second or third day after the man was in custody, Mr. Railton and he were in the lodge together; and Mr. Railton said he must be out of his mind, or he would never have done as he had done; and in several instances behaving wild - such as making away with his things: - he did not mind whatever he had. He would give away every thing he had - he did not care to whom: I sincerely believe, and, I am on my oath, that the man is not right in his senses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Have you ever had occasion to observe mad people before? - I never was much used to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150163"/>Q. Was you subpoened? - I always attend here the time the London Jury are sitting.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first communicate this? - Several times I communicated it.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Roberts have you other grounds than those you have mentioned, to make you suppose this man was deranged? - He first of all employed Mr. Railton, then he employed Mr. Dalby the short hand writer; and at last he employed this man.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Roberts, who wrote these letters you have mentioned? - Mr. Dalby was applied to in the business for him, and he wrote to Norwich by the desire of Dunnett, there was an answer to this, and Mr. Dalby shewed me the answer to this letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Mr. Dalby employed as the confidential solicitor to a man under your custody; shewed you his client's letters and the answers? - He shewed me the answers, I cannot say he shewed me the letters himself.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Mr. Dalby shew you the answers? - As nearly as soon as he received them.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you thought it a strong proof of madness that the man did not receive the money he wrote for. Did you hear of this story of the pistol that hath been invented? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor any fall from the horse? - No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to Mr. Railton, was what Mr. Railton said no more than this, that he believed he was mad; did not he say that his reason for stating him to be mad was his conduct? - Mr. Railton said he believed he was mad.</p>
               <p>Q. So Mr. Railton was coarse and indelicate enough to tell a poor man in his condition</p>
               <p>"you are mad;" and that is all, on your oath did Mr. Railton ever make use of such an expression without adding more; did not he say you must be mad to go to a house to demand money on that bond? - I tell you and what I tell you is verbatim.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Mr. Railton did not give any reason for thinking him mad: upon your oath did not you hear Mr. Railton say that his conduct was the conduct of a mad man, thinking to demand this money when it was not due? - I never heard so much discourse as that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Railton. I waited on him at two periods in the Compter, he was without friends, and without property, and without advice, and sought for me to advise him; I did not incline to undertake such a prosecution; I said that Mr. Chetham was a very proper person to advise with him; this was the first period I saw him, he was very much distressed; the second time I saw him I did not chose to go up into the prison to the man again, for I thought he looked agitated; this man has great truth in part that he says; when he came down to me, I asked him if he had employed Mr. Chetham, I told him it would be material, he should have some advice.</p>
               <p>Court. I think the indictment is ill conceived; I shall take the opinion of the Jury on the fact; the act of parliament describes a number of offences by indorsements and by assignments, &amp;c. but I take it in all, there must be a condition, and a penalty, to make it a bond obligatory, this is a writing obligatory, but I think it is not a bond obligatory, unless it has these two essential qualifications to it; I shall therefore reserve the law for the opinion of the Judges.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Marshall. Please your Worship when I set off from my friends house in the morning, I went to Charles-street, Bartlet-square to a butler, and drank a little with him there: coming down Bond-street I met a friend that had just come from France; I went with him and had four pots of ale; he told me of a place of a gentleman just going abroad, to enquire at the Oxford coffee house, accordingly I called there and he was not at home; just as we got to Mr. Slack's house we parted and shook hands together; he returned back to go up Oxford-road, I left him and going by the prosecutor's door I saw this tippet lay by the prosecutor's doors; I picked it up, and was walking away with it openly in my hand; the prosecutor came and catched hold of me and took me into the shop, and when I got into the shop, he said, he would prosecute me if he could; I begged mercy; if I had meant<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150169"/>it as a thief I should not have carried it in my hand; he told the gentleman of the office that I stole another tippet which he found on the ground by me; when I was before the justice I begged his pardon, and he said, you rascal if it was in my power I would hang you, and if you are not heavy enough, if I could have my will, I would pull your legs.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Goodall. I left Marshall nigh the prosecutor's door and went on; I heard the cry of stop thief! I turned back and in about twenty yards I heard the thief was taken; accordingly I saw it was Marshall, he called me in, as as soon as I got in, the prosecutor took hold of me by the collar and said, sir, you have got the other two; he kept me about three minutes and then let me go; in the course of an hour and a half, two constables took me up and searched me and found nothing.</p>

On the 20th of November Foxley came to me and said, he had lost his watch and asked me to go along with him and apprehend the prisoner; I told him I was obliged to go to the Mansion house; he said, he expected to see him at twelve o'clock; says I, do you seize him, when I came back I found he had taken the man; I went before the Lord Mayor and he was discharged and nothing found on him. On some other occasion his master had desired me to get some duplicates of blankets which he had lost, he said, he had made away with them; I saw his wife and him fumbling in a box together; I catched hold of the box, and I found this duplicate in her hussiff in the box, pledged on Wednesday night after he had been turned up by the Lord Mayor; the maker's name was on the duplicate, which the prosecutor told me; I acquainted the prosecutor; he went with me to the pawnbroker's and said, it was his watch.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My lord this man accuses me of my apartment belonging to me, it does not; I never took the room nor lodged in it, nor paid rent for it; I took my linen to wash there once a week; I had no property in the box.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 16th of March, 1791, did any person make any application to you in the jewellery business? - Yes, on the 16th of March, 1791, the prisoner came to my shop to ask to see some necklaces, and ear-rings, we shewed him some that were commonly sold, he said he wanted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150173"/>diamond necklaces and ear-rings, and was recommended by Lord Salisbury, there were but few in the shop, I told him we would collect others of the work people, and shew them in a few hours; he agreed to my waiting upon him in two hours, which was at four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you to go to? - To St. James's Place, he left a card and address (the card produced) Lord Massey on one side, and No. 36, St. James's Place, on the other. I went accordingly to the apartment at four o'clock, when I came to the house, a man servant shewed me up stairs, and I went into the room and found the person who had given me the card, I opened my goods and shewed him my book, he was looking over the book, and he asked the price of several articles, I told him; he asked me if I asked the lowest price, as he was going to pay ready cash for them. A person came into the room and said Dr. Hunter was come in, the Dr. came into the room, and the prisoner at the bar begged I would go out of the room while he spoke to the Dr. I went out of the room for about five minutes, and then was called in. Dr. Hunter was sitting down at the table to write, the prisoner looked at the articles, he then made choice of a pair of diamond ear-rings, a necklace, a watch and chain; he desired me to put them in cases, I told him I would take them home and put them in cases, as I had no proper cases with me, he desired me to bring them again as soon as possible, as he was going out; I went back again as soon as ever possible I could get them packed up, and took the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was you back? - This was before five, he looked over the bill, and I shewed him some other articles at the same time, which the workmen had brought in since I was gone out, he looked over the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the amount? - Seven hundred and sixty pounds; he then went to the drawer, and brought me this note. (produced) I looked it over, found it was regularly drawn on a check, told him I had not cash about me, I would get it changed, I returned in about half an hour with a draft on my house for the difference of the bill, his servant told me he was gone out, I waited for about half an hour expecting he would return, but I found he did not; I told the servant I would call in the morning, I went to Mr. Coutts's first in the morning, found the note was refused payment there.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe from the time of his delivering the note, you never saw him till he was in custody at Birmingham? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that? - That was on the 13th of last November twelvemonth, the year 1791, he was at that time in custody at Birmingham.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the person you saw at Birmingham, the same person that gave you the said draft? - He is.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good to look at the prisoner, are you certain and clear he is the man? - I am; I have not the least doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. I observe that before the magistrate at Birmingham, you said you believed he was the man? - I did; I wished to avoid prosecuting him, I thought there were such heavy charges against him there, that justice would be done without.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Council. There was eight months from the time you saw the prisoner and received the bill from him, to the time you saw the prisoner at the bar? I should like you to recollect what you said, when you got to Birmingham? You said just now, that you verily believed he was the man, did not you say on the contrary, that you could not positively speak to his person? - I said that I believed him to be the person.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you did not make use of this expression at any time in Birmingham, that you could not speak positively to his person? - No, sir, I said that I believed him to be the person.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150174"/>Q. Did not you say, Mr. Green, that the person who had got the goods of you was a thinner man than the prisoner, who was then examined? - At that time, I said, he was thinner than when I saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish you would recollect yourself a little, did not you say that the person who had the goods of you, was a thinner man than the man that was examined before the magistrate? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had the least sight of the person who obtained the goods of you for these eight months? - No, not for these eight months.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Had you taken any pains to find him? - I had advertised a reward and distributed hand bills.</p>
               <p>(The draft read by the Clerk of the Court.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I saw you at Birmingham, prior to the last time I saw you, you had two or three interviews with me before you made this charge? - I went with Mr. Wallis the constable to you.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not seen me prior to that time when you was asked whether it was the person that imposed on you or not, and did not you say that the man that had imposed on you was a man that was a much thinner man than I am? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say I was the man? - I said I believed you was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Green, as a man of honour, as a tradesman of respectability, to which no doubt you aspire; did you, or did you not say, that you verily believed that I was not the man? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I beg your Lordship's pardon in intruding upon the court; but they are facts that I can bring an indisputable witness to prove, a person not unknown to my Lord Loughborough.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe, madam, in March, 1791, you lived in St. James's Place? - I did, Lord Massey took my lodgings on the 15th of March, but did not come till the 16th.</p>

After he came home there was a porter brought a letter directed to Lord Massey, left it and went away. Mr. Green came afterwards, I shewed him up to my lord, I don't know what passed while Mr. Green was there.</p>

               <p>Q. Now I ask you to recollect whether you did not intimate to some person, that you thought another man you saw there, was the person you served as Lord Massey? - I fixed my mind and was confident, this person is the person I served, as Lord Massey, I was in prison and looked at all of them, and I saw that same man, and I don't know that it is any other.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, your Lordship has done me the honour to allow me to reply in answer to the charge exhibited against me by Mr. Garrow; it certainly is not my with to be distinguished as a public speaker, and several powerful reasons present themselves, why I should be silent on this occasion; but in the present case, I feel myself irresistibly impelled to arrest the attention of the court, while I submit a few remarks to the candour, good sense, and liberality of you, my Lord, and the Gentlemen of the Jury. Gentlemen, I feel peculiarly unfortunate in being obliged to add to the loads of misery I now sustain, the being placed at this bar, to answer this charge. The circumstances of my now standing under the strongest prejudices, the public opinion being against me, oppressed by calumny in every newspaper, and almost convicted by the popular cry, before I have even heard the charge imputed to me, or had it in my power to say a syllable in my defence, under such prejudices, and in such a situation, I can only rely on the judgment, the honour, and the integrity of the learned Judge, before whom I am tried; and to implore a fair, candid, and an impartial hearing of the cause to the Jury, who are to determine the matter.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I can only be anticipating the observations that will be made much more favourable for me by the learned Judge, when I earnestly request of you, Gentlemen of the Jury, to try this cause<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150178"/>on the evidence adduced before you, and totally to lay out of your consideration every thing you have heard before it came into this court, your minds being only impressed by the effect of the evidence; from which I feel a most perfect confidence in receiving a verdict declaring my innocence.</p>
               <p>I will now take the liberty of imparting to my lord and gentlemen of the jury, such observations as have occurred to me on the evidence which has been given against me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Green, gentlemen, I am sorry to say it, hath exceedingly departed from the truth, in a most gross and flagrant manner; gentlemen, my assertion is this, and I well know that base assertions can have but little weight, but, gentlemen, I have it in my power to call a gentleman of the first respectability, a man who wants only to be known, to be universally admired; I shall not anticipate his evidence more than I have already done, he will tell you that Mr. Green, when he saw me at Birmingham, on the mention of this question, said that the person that imposed on him was a much thinner man than myself, he has now told you he did not say so; that he said, that I was exactly the man, and that he was very certain of it; gentlemen, what can we think of a man thus elastic in his mind, one that will swear one thing one day, and one thing another: Heaven forbid, gentlemen, that I should be desirous of depreciating the character of any man, even the greatest enemy I have in existence, I assure you I would not; but when such flagrant evidence thus contradictory in itself, is brought against me, with a view to deprive me of my life, I think it but fair I should make it known.</p>
               <p>The next witness that is called is the lady that keeps the house, where the impostor lodged; she has acted in such a manner that does her infinite honour; she does not say that I am the person, she says she thinks I am the same person, but she does not attempt to speak that I am the person who imposed upon her. Gentlemen, I need not tell you what a wonderful coincidence in manner, size, appearance and voice, there may be between two persons without the smallest connection, as to the same identical person; we know a man of the brightest genius is like to err, as to identity and more particularly, where the view has been transient, as appears in the present instance. The mistress of the house swears that I left the house at five o'clock, the maid servant swears it was at six; gentlemen, were women will take upon themselves to swear to the identity of a person, in a forcible manner, it is very extraordinary, they should not as well recollect, to as great a certainty the hour, it appears they do not, for the mistress of the house says, I went away about five, and the maid servant says, I went away about six; therefore her evidence, as to the identity of person, cannot be depended on.</p>
               <p>The next witness called is Lecree, who appears to have been a servant, with the assumed Lord Massey, he has told you, gentlemen of the jury, that I resemble him that there is a wonderful likeness; but surely, gentlemen, that is not evidence, that ought not to add any weight in the scale of this cause; surely nothing but the most clear and strong evidence should govern the determination of a Jury; nothing of this sort as adduced by this witness, should be suffered to make any impressions; more particularly when the life is at stake.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the jury, there is a circumstance occurs to my mind, which I think very proper for your consideration. Mr. Hunter's name has been mentioned,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150179"/>his name has been used in this cause, his evidence no doubt would be a material weight in this cause, I should be glad to know why he has not been brought forward, a person of his integrity, respectability and veracity, would have had very great weight with the judge, and you, gentlemen of the jury.</p>
               <p>I will beg leave to read to you, gentlemen, two letters, they were received by me yesterday from a man that was my servant, they will prove beyond the possibility of a doubt, the intention of Mr. Green and will manifest he has left no stone unturned to deprive me of my life; I will beg leave to call a witness who will prove having received this letter from

               <p>Sir, the very moment I sent of your other letter, Mr. Willerton and Mr. Green, have come to me and asked me several questions, the same as before, I have given the same answers, that I would be ready at any time; they asked me at last, Mr. Green asked me if I meant to stay always in livery, I said no; he said if I wanted money or clothes he would lend me some. - The meaning of it, gentlemen, you may see very plain.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, under all these circumstances it would be an insult to your understanding to suppose you capable of giving a verdict contrary to your best wishes, I solemnly declare to his lordship, and you, gentlemen of the jury, that I am not guilty of the charge.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the jury, I have been in custody fourteen months, since which time eight sessions have elapsed; why this charge has not been brought forward before this period; I cannot say. Gentlemen, from the vicisitudes I have undergone, it is impossible for any person possessed of sympathy, not to feel something, and more especially on the present occasion; where the dictates of keen sensibility take place, without the smallest mitigation.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I need not tell you, I have long been the mark of vengeance. I have been reviled to the utmost; but I have the infinite satisfaction in my own breast, that they are ill grounded; for could I be truly charged with any dishonourable, mean, or unmanly undertaking; my feelings would indeed be very different from those I now experience; my mind in that case would sting me, more than the bitterest reproof of the sincerest friends. Thus supported by my conscience, I wait for your verdict without inquietude, as knowing that to men of your liberality of sentiment, I am not the object of those prejudices, which have operated to fatally against many men in my circumstances, and doubt not, but that you will form your result, from a feeling heart, directed by an enlightened understanding.</p>

               <p>I live at Birmingham, I am in the profession of the law.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present at any time, that Mr. Green saw the prisoner at the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150180"/>Q. Did you hear him give any account as to the knowledge of his person, and will you be so kind as to tell us the expression he made use of on that occasion? - I was with him when he was before Mr. Careless at Manchester; Mr. Green got up and walked about the room, and he was asked whether he was certain he was the person, he did not take on himself to say. Mr. Careless wished me to be present, as a professional man; in consequence of this, I asked Mr. Green if he was certain, that Mr. Griffin was the person that had committed the robbery, he said he could not speak with certainty to the person, but his young man could; Mr. Griffin after some conversation got up, and walked up to Mr. Green, and beseeched him to take every opportunity of satisfying himself, whether he was the person or not. - I then told Mr. Green, that he ought to be decided in his evidence against him, as the charge was of such a serious nature as to affect his life; he said he believed him to be the person; on which Mr. Careless said it was sufficient to commit the gentleman on that charge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I am sorry you have had the trouble to come to day, to take on yourself to prove what Mr. Green has said before. - Perhaps this examination is your hand writing? - It is not, it is Mr. Careless's I believe, this examination was brought ready prepared.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Green sworn to it? - I did; I asked Mr. Green whether he was certain as to the day, Mr. Griffin said it was no consequence, if he said the month of March, for he was all that month on the continent.</p>
               <p>Court. Was your conversation with Mr. Green, before or after, his examination? - Previous or rather during his examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before he signed his examination? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. As you attended to assist Mr. Green, you of course saw that every thing was put down correct? - I did not exactly see, what was exactly put down, I was there in some respect by desire of Mr. Griffin.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did the last witness say of Mr. Green, that he could not swear positively to the woman, but his servant could.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mr. Green. This gentleman has said that you said you had a person who could more recognize the prisoner than yourself. - That is so, that person is in court.</p>
               <p>Jury. We wish him to be called.</p>

               <p>Was you in the service of Messrs. Green and Willerton, in the month of March 1791? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the prisoner as the person who came to your masters shop? - I cannot swear positively to that person, but I think the prisoner resembles him.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you be so good as to point out any alteration between the person at the bar and the person who assumed the name of Lord Massey? - He appeared I think at that time to be rather fuller in the face.</p>
               <p>Q. On the whole are you able to form a belief that the prisoner is the same person or not? - I cannot take on me to say; I cannot say any thing more than I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe he is or is not? - I rather believe he is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Gentlemen of the Jury, I state to you gentlemen, that this person was not in my brief, or otherwise I would have called him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is rather extraordinary Mr. Garrow you should not have called him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Sir, I have done you the justice and liberality to state that he is not in my brief.</p>
               <p>Court. How long had you an opportunity of seeing the person March 1791? - I only saw him in the shop.</p>

            , and that he lived at an oyster shop some where in Chancery-lane; the Lord Mayor asked him what apartment; he said, a front room and a chamber, he paid 15 l. a year for it, at last he said, that the woman's husband threw the letter after her, that he, the prisoner, had taken it up and given it to her and came to shew her where to come.</p>
               <p>Q. I observe the letter is not directed to any particular place but only Mr. Horne, Stock-broker; I suppose in your advertisement you had stated where you did your business? - Yes, he was then asked again about his profession and what he was; he said, he was a gentleman; he asked him what he had to live upon; he said 50 l. a year, which was remitted from his father in Ireland; the Lord Mayor then asked him, whether it was remitted in bills or Bank notes; he said, in Bank bills; then he was asked whether he had not a great many of those covers by him; he said, he certainly had; he was asked whether he had any of those about him; he said, no, he was very glad he had not, because he did not choose they should be exhibited to every body; he was then asked about the letter, and then he said, he did give it to the woman, and a woman in the street gave it to him; then the Lord Mayor said, it is very extraordinary that he should bring a letter and take a letter from a stranger; have not you been at Tothill-fields Bridewell? he said, no, he had never been there, and then he said at last, he had been there that very morning; he did not say that he had the letter from thence, but he seemed to imply it; then he was asked again if he knew the contents of the letter; he said, no; then he was asked if he was the writer; he said, he could not write; then he was asked if he knew either of the parties who signed the letter; he said, he believed he might know them by sight; then he was asked whether he was not a member of this club in question, at last he acknowledged that he had been there some time and that he knew the man at the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you learn from him in any examinations whether he could write? - The Lord Mayor on Monday desired him to write, and he took a pen and made a scrawl; the Lord Mayor's clerk asked him if he had not been there charging a man with robbing him of money and signed his name; he said, if he had signed it was very badly wrote; the Lord Mayor asked him if that robbery had been tried; he said, no, the grand jury threw out the bill. On Monday he said, that every thing that he said on Saturday was wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enquire to see whether he lived at the oyster shop? - They neither of them lived where they said. I went to Tothill-fields Bridewell; I saw Brown there; I never saw him before, and he acknowledged he never saw me.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Horne I will put a question to you though it has not any thing to do in the subject; was there the smallest truths in these insinuations? - Not the least in the world.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Mr. Horne I am extremely sorry they have been thrown out. I can assure you that in my brief<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150184"/>there is not a tittle suggested to your prejudice, and God forbid I should throw any imputation.</p>

               <p>The letter read by the clerk, as follows:</p>
               <p>Saturday morning, sir, I am sorry to inform you, that I have been unfortunate with the rest on Monday last, in Clement's-lane, as I suppose you must have seen in the papers, and have been in prison ever since, not being able to get bail as some have done, I have been solicited to say who supported me in the least, which I would not do, till I sent to you and another friend likewise, who I believe is out of town; I believe, I could get bail, if I could but make up 10 l. which would settle every thing intirely, for it is very hard, as you know, and as I know, you are a considerate man, for me to lay in prison six months, in a starving condition, therefore I hope you will send me the assistance by the bearer, &amp;c.</p>

             in this indictment, he was arraigned, tried, and found guilty; but a doubt having occurred to the learned Judge, who tried the prisoner, whether on the circumstances of the facts stated in the evidence, the prisoner's case was held within the act of parliament under which he was indicted, made in the seventh year of his Majesty; on this doubt the judgment was respited, for the opinion of the Judges. On the evidence adduced in the trial, it appeared, that the Bank note had been cut into two parts, and one part of the note inclosed in a letter sent one day, the other part of the note inclosed in another letter, and sent the next post day; the Bank note so divided into two parts was under these circumstances secreted by the prisoner, the doubt suggested was, whether he had been guilty of the offence laid down in the act of parliament, with respect to that, at two several periods of time, the parts were secreted; which by the objection, was argued, separate offences had taken place; on that doubt all the Judges present, when the case was mentioned, were unanimous of opinion, that the offence stated in the indictment in form and manner, as it had been proved by the evidence falls directly within the meaning of the acts of parliament, contained in the first section of the acts of parliament,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150186"/>chap. 3. in the seventh year of his present Majesty which makes this offence a felony. The persons who are particularly trusted, with respect to letters, have been by the legislature put under a specific and peculiar law; the prisoner that is charged, in this present case, in the indictment, is not charged with having stole the letter, but with having secreted the note, contained in the letters, that was conveyed by the public conveyance of the kingdom. Now the words of the act of parliament are very carefully and wisely made, for they have put in the persons of every description, all of every office and capacity, that may be employed in post offices, deputy, clerk, agent, letter carrier, post boy, or any other officer, or person whatsoever, employed in receiving, stamping, sorting, charging, carrying, conveying, or delivering letters or packets; that shall secret, embezzle or destroy, any letter or letters, package or packages, containing any Bank note, with a great number of other necessary descriptions, which might be restricted by the act specifying the crime that a person shall be guilty of.</p>
               <p>Now upon this fact it is clear he has secreted the letters, containing this note, the letters being proved to have come to his custody; two letters, in which two letters a Bank note was contained, that is, two parts of a Bank note, which made a Bank note in the whole; therefore, this particular fact, as proved, is contained in the express, conscious and proper words of the act; the Bank note divided into two parts, and contained in two letters, he has secreted by secreting the two letters; these two letters contained a Bank note together; the two parts cannot possibly be added together, without having reference to this identical case; the case is within the very terms of the act of parliament, with respect to the construction of stealing, and with respect to the words of the act. On the case so stated, all the Judges, that were present, were unanimous and clearly of opinion, that the prisoner is rightly convicted, and ought to receive sentence accordingly.</p>
