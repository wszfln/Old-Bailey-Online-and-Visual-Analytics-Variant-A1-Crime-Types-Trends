               <p>Amey Deseret. On the 20th of January, after tea in the morning, this young gentlewoman, Mrs. GOODWIN, told me, that we were robbed, I asked her of what? she said, of two shirts and her buckles; I was very much surprized, and looked to see if we had lost any thing else, and I missed nine silver spoons, a dozen of silver-handled knives, thirteen forks, and a silver pint mug.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to suspect the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Deseret. She was my <rs id="t17440223-1-deflabel4" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Q. Did she say, she supposed her husband took them?</p>
               <p>Deseret. She did not say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got your goods again?</p>
               <p>Deseret. I have not found any thing at all; the spoons and the pint mug were in her charge, and she had a place to lock them up in; she said, she did let a man in, but I don't think he could carry them off without her knowledge; she has owned since, that she took away three spoons in Christmas week.</p>
               <p>ELIZ. GOODWIN. She confessed she carried out three of the spoons in Christmas week, and gave them to the man she called her husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say, any body else had been there?</p>
               <p>GOODWIN. She said, no body had been there but her husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she say, that her husband must take them?</p>
               <p>GOODWIN. She did not say so; I told her, if no body else had been there, he had stole them.</p>

            . The 28th of Dec. the man who goes for her husband brought three spoons to me to pawn; I saw a crest upon them, and refused to take them in; she came afterwards; I asked her,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174402230003"/> whether they were her own spoons? or how she came by them? She said, she had them of an Embassador for a debt, but I did not take them in; I found out afterwards who she lived with, and then I believed them to be stole.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner produced a Witness, who said, that she had lived with him as a servant, and always behaved herself well; and, by what he had heard, behaved well, wherever she lived as a servant, and believes she is a sober honest woman.</p>
               <p>Another Witness said, she had known her all her life time, and that she always behaved herself well, and has lived in very creditable families.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have lived in creditable good families, with great people, both here and in my own country (Holland) and they know my character, God Almighty take my soul! I am not guilty of this thing, indeed.</p>

            . On the 17th of January in the evening, a Grocer in Fleet-street, asked me, if I had not been robbed, I said, I don't know, he told me, the Prisoner brought a pound of nutmegs to him, and offered to sell them for 18 d. that he told him, it was too little, and the Prisoner said, then give me two shillings; but he would not buy them. The next time the Prisoner came to my house, I challenged him with taking those nutmegs, and bid him bring them again; he protested he had not seen a nutmeg these twelve months; then said I, go out of my house (he is a chocolate-maker, and works for me) for you shall not work for me any more; he said, it was very hard that he must lose his work for a man's saying, that he carried him some nutmegs, and would not go; so<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174402230005"/> I took him by the collar, and told him I would charge a constable with him; then he begged my pardon, and said he had never done so before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he confess that he took them?</p>
               <p>Oram. He confessed that he took them out of the cellar in my house, and carried them to a shop in Holborn, somewhere by the Turnstile, and sold them for three shillings, but would not tell me to whom.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I found the nutmegs in the street, and did not know the value of them: I was in liquor, I do not know what I said then.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you found them in the street, what did you do with them?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I sold them to a man, but I don't know his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss these nutmegs?</p>
               <p>Oram. No I did not miss them, there were 60 or 70 pound weight in a cask in the cellar, the key was left in the cellar-door, and, I suppose, he might go down for some beer, and then take them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any body to your character?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My master will give me a character.</p>
               <p>Oram. Before this thing I took him to be as honest a fellow as any in England, he made a thousand weight of chocolate for me last year, and was to have made a thousand more; he has worked for me five years: he offered to sell the person, to whom he offered the nutmegs, as much chocolate for half a crown a pound, as he would have. <rs id="t17440223-8-verdict45" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Mrs. Burroughs. I saw the Prisoner come into the shop, and take away a bladder of hogs lard. I stood at the end of the counter, while he was in the shop, but was very much frightened, because I had no body in the house but mysel f. He looked me full in the face, and went out with it. It was near a quarter of an hour afterwards before I could send for my husband: I described the Prisoner to him, and he was taken up about nine o'clock at night; I am positive he is the man, because I have known him some years; he looked like a guilty person.</p>

            . My wife sent for me home, and described the Prisoner's person and clothes to me: I got a constable, and he informed me, if I would go into Black Boy Alley, we might probably find him; we went there, and found five or six of them scolding and fighting together: when they saw the constable, three of them run away, and we took the Prisoner and another; when my wife saw him, she said, that is the man.</p>

               <p>Q. How did she do it?</p>
               <p>Jennings. She took hold of me, put her hand into my pocket, and took out half a guinea, and some silver. - I caught her hand in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. In what pocket?</p>
               <p>Jennings. In the right-hand pocket of my breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she take it out of your pocket?</p>
               <p>Jennings. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find her hand in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Jennings. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What, before she had taken the money out?</p>
               <p>Jennings. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss the money?</p>
               <p>Jennings. I missed it directly.</p>
               <p>Q. What, before her hand was out of your pocket?</p>
               <p>Jennings. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you put your gold and silver together?</p>
               <p>Jennings. It was together then.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before was it that you saw your money?</p>
               <p>Jennings. I felt it as I was coming along.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that before?</p>
               <p>Jennings. Just before.</p>
               <p>Q. How much had you in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Jennings. I had in all about 14 s. half a guinea in gold, and the rest in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. What pieces were they?</p>
               <p>Jennings. They were shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they all shillings?</p>
               <p>Jennings. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ne'er a six-pence?</p>
               <p>Jennings. Not to my knowledge; I had changed a guinea at the Ship in St. James's-street, and had my full change.</p>
               <p>Q. You should have had more money, what did you do with the rest?</p>
               <p>Jennings. I paid some money there, and I had been drinking, and had spent some money.</p>
               <p>Q. How much had you spent?</p>
               <p>Jennings. I believe nine pence, for three pots of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Nine pence was a pretty deal, was not you disguised in liquor?</p>
               <p>Jennings. Very little, if any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your money?</p>
               <p>Jennings. I found it in her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you take it from her?</p>
               <p>Jennings. I could not open her hand; I called the watch, and secured her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever retrieve your money?</p>
               <p>Jennings. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say when you had called the watch?</p>
               <p>Jennings. She said, she had only taken a halfpenny from me, and she would give it me again, and I said, I would not take it; I had her to the watch-house, kept her there all night, and the next morning had her before a Justice, and then she owned she took a halfpenny out of my pocket, and no more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you offer me three pence at the water side, if I would oblige you?</p>
               <p>Jennings. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You said so at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Jennings. By virtue of my oath I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you pull me and haul me about, and wanted to have to do with me?</p>
               <p>Jennings. By virtue of my oath, I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You said you had been spending of money, or you would have given me more.</p>
               <p>Jennings. By virtue of my oath, it is false.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what pretence did she come up to you? Did she speak to you?</p>
               <p>Jennings. Yes, she came to pick me up.</p>
               <p>Q. What space of time was there from the beginning of this transaction to the end of it?</p>
               <p>Jennings. It might be a minute or thereabout.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pick her up, or did she pick you up?</p>
               <p>Jennings. She picked me up; when she came up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174402230007"/> to me, she took hold of me with one arm, and with the other picked my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she searched?</p>
               <p>Jennings. No, she was not searched, for when I proposed searching of her, she said, if she had three or four half guineas about her, what was that to any body.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming from my mistress's where I had been at work, by St. Martin's Lane; he asked me to drink, I said, No, I will not; then he said, he would give me three pence if I would go with him under the gate-way; I said, I did not value his three pence; he said he had been spending money, or else he would have given me more; and because I would not go with him, he d - d me and called me bitch, and charged the watch with me in a minute. <rs id="t17440223-13-verdict73" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. How came you to be sent for?</p>
               <p>Constable. A man was brought before Justice Dennet, for knocking down a Gentleman on Tower-Hill, and the Justice, hearing that I had been robbed, sent for me to know whether he was one of the persons that robbed me; when I came there, I had great reason to believe, that he was one of them; but as it was so dark when I was robbed, I could not be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the name of that person?</p>
               <p>Constable. His name is Sherlock; when I was with him, I thought there was more in his voice to know him by than there was in the sight of him; for the candle in the lanthorn was so soon put out, that I had not time to get a full view of them; but Sherlock confessed the fact before the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174402230008"/> Justice, and impeached the other three, of whom the Prisoner at the bar was one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you take them up upon this?</p>
               <p>Constable. Sherlock was sent to New Prison, and great search was made after the other three; but we have heard they were sent out of town, went from place to place, and have got on board the privateers, so that they are not to be found. The Prisoner was taken three or four days ago in St. John's Street; I observed so much of them, that they were all well dressed, genteel, young fellows; the Prisoner was in much the same dress as he is now.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you think the Prisoner was one of the persons?</p>
               <p>Constable. He seems to be about the same size; they were young, and active; but he has no particular mark that I can swear to him by.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was Mr. Constable, when you pursued him?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. He was coming along Brewhouse-yard, at the upper end of new Hermitage Street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went up to him first?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. Rocket was the first that overtook him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it that knocked the man down that had the lanthorn?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. It was myself, I did not knock him down, I shoved him down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Prisoner at the bar with you at that time?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. Yes, Neagle was before him, Rocket at his right-hand, and Cleaver at his left; and I had hold of the man at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Who rifled him?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. Cleaver and Rocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they take from him?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. There were twelve shillings divided between us, the money all in six-pences, but two shillings; a little pen-knife, and a tobacco-stopper and cork-screw in one; Neagle had them.</p>
               <p>Q. What time o'night was this?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. About nine or ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go afterwards?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. I was stopped by a gentleman on Tower-Hill; but we went into the Minories first, and divided the money, and we gave Cleaver a shilling to take the hanger out of pledge.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be stopped on Tower-Hill?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. As we were going over Tower-Hill, Neagle stepped out of the road, and knocked a gentleman down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you all four go there?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. We all four went together, and coming over Tower-Hill, Neagle and Rocket quarrelled, because Neagle said, they (Rocket and Cleaver) had got some gold from Mr. Constable, and he was going to fight them with a pistol; going up the hill, a gentleman ++ was coming along with a cloak on, muffled up, (for it was a cold night) Neagle struck him; I said, You rascal, what do you strike the gentleman for? he did not meddle with you: and I believe he was a little stunned; then they three run away; and I did not think he knew any thing of our being concerned in the other affair, or else I could have made my escape too, but I took his part, because no harm should come to him, and I was taken and carried to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>++ Mr. Willoughby was knocked down on Tower-Hill, so 'tis probable it was him; but the witness did not mention any name.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the Prisoner and you been acquainted?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. About two years; but I never went with him or them upon such an account before that night +.</p>
               <p>+ He was concerned with them in robbing Mr. Pidgeon, 30th of December, by his own evidence, as appears by the next Trial.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What place did we set out from that night?</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Was this the first robbery you committed?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. No, the first robbery was that of Mr. Pidgeon in St. Catherine's.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174402230009"/>Cleaver. Could you go down to St. Catharine's without danger of being pressed?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. We did go to St. Catharine's, and were waiting to rob one Esquire Wynn; but missing of him, we met with Mr. Constable in the mean time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is true indeed I did go out that night with that gentleman the evidence, and he said he was going to a public house to Mr. Wynn, to borrow a little money of him; and he said he was sure of getting some liquor, if he did not get some money; and we met at this Rocket's house, and set out about six o'clock that night. He asked me to go down with him to St. Catharine's, for he did not care to go without company, for fear of being pressed. At last he prevailed upon me to go with him, and I did go. I went to see an acquaintance of mine in St. Catharine's, and staid with her till ten o'clock, and happened to meet these three persons: I asked them how they did, and where they had been, but they did not care to tell in particular where. We went into the Minories to drink, and when we came into the house, Rocket pulled out some money, and so did Neagle; I think it was about three shillings apiece.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no part of it?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had not a farthing, only a shilling to get the hanger out of pawn; and Neagle said to me, if I would go to his lodging, at the Fountain and Shovel in Thames Street, he would make me drink; and he said, I can tell you what passed at Tower-Hill, for I was present with them: I did not think I should have been tried, till the person who they say is taken, is brought to London; or I should have been able to have made a better defence. <rs id="t17440223-15-verdict88" type="verdictDescription">

Then another came up to me, and told me, I must go before their officer: I walked about four or five steps, and their officer, as they called him, came up to me, and put a pistol to me, and told me, if I opened my mouth, he would blow my brains out, and demanded my money: I told him, I had very little: They rifled my pockets, and took a guinea, a shilling, and some half-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any of them so as to know them again?</p>

               <p>Pidgeon. I thought I should know the first per son that came up to me again; which was Sherlock. The Wednesday following, Mr. Willoughby sent to acquaint me, that he was stopped the night before, and the person was taken, and desired me to go to the Tower prison, and see if I knew him. I went to the Tower prison, Sherlock was sitting by the fire-side, and I pitched upon him immediately, though I believe there were twenty people in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any light when you were robbed?</p>
               <p>Pidgeon. There was some light; and a little girl took me for her father; and she stamped, and cried, Oh lah, Oh lah, what do you do to my father? Then he that had his hand in my pocket, put his hand into his pocket; and I was afraid it was to take out a pistol to shoot the girl.</p>

            . On Friday night, the 30th of December, about seven o'clock at night, Neagle, Cleaver and Rocket were at my house in Jerusalem Court, and we went to a public house in St. John's Square, they asked me, if I would go out upon such an affair: I said, I did not care to do it; and they told me, I was a coward; I said I would go with all my heart, rather than they should charge me with that. Accordingly we went into Bishopsgate Street, drank some slip, and then went into Stepney Fields, and met a boy with a link; I saw some other peopl e, we followed them, and came up with them; and when we came up with them, we found they were not worth any thing, so we did not speak to them; we did not meet with any thing. Then we went to St. Catharine's, and met captain Pidgeon; I knew him a captain of a ship in Holland, when I was mate of a merchant-man.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see him so as to know him?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. I had some knowledge of him, though I did not know him certainly; but I knew him when I saw him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went up to him first?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. Neagle and Rocket run after him, and asked him, What ship? Cleaver and I were together, at a distance. - No body attacked him but them two, and they robbed him of a shilling, and some half-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there a guinea?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174402230010"/>Sherlock. I did not see any thing of the guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was you from him?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. I was about seven or eight yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Cleaver go up to him?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. Cleaver did not go near him, nor I neither. - Neagle and Rocket run after him.</p>
               <p>Q. When Neagle and Rocket run after him, you stopped, did not you?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. When we first saw him, we were all four standing together; and then they two run after him, and stopped him.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the money?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. We spent the money at a night-house in Newgate Market.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money had you?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. There was but seventeen-pence half-penny. - Rocket might keep the guinea for what I know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please to ask him, whether I had any part of the money?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. Cleaver was not at the spending of the money; there were only three of us.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Cleaver then?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. He was not well, and he said, he would go and buy some barley-sugar, or something for his cold; he said he would come to us, but he did not come.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know nothing of this robbery; indeed I did go out with them, and I saw them speak to a gentleman, and they had something in their hands, but I was gone to knock at a gentleman's door a stone's-throw off: they asked me to go with them to Newgate Market, but I found they were for striking and abusing people as they went along, and I would not go with them; so I went to a pastry-cook's shop to buy some barleysugar, and then home. <rs id="t17440223-16-verdict95" type="verdictDescription">

I recovered myself a little, and got Smith by the collar; and finding myself a little stronger than him, I got him into a Butcher's shop, that was pretty near, and desired somebody to get a Constable; Petty got from me, but I secured Smith, and carried him before a Justice, and I said, he was one of the two men that robbed me, and he denied the taking the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they make any excuse in the butcher's shop, when you charged them with it?</p>
               <p>Nightingale. They did not say any thing, they made no excuse.</p>
               <p>Council. Had you your goods again.</p>


               <p>Nightingale. My brother has them, he took them from the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first met the Prisoners, upon your oath, did not they tell you what they were? Did not they tell you they were Excise Officers?</p>
               <p>Nightingale. Upon my oath, they did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first hear that they were Excisemen?</p>
               <p>Nightingale. It was before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not they say so to you in the street?</p>
               <p>Nightingale. No, upon my oath, they did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not they say, they were Excise-men, or belonged to the Excise-Office, and desired to see your parcel?</p>
               <p>Nightingale. No, nor did they give me the least reason to think they were Officers of the Excise.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not they produce their deputations before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Nightingale. Not that I remember.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been then?</p>
               <p>Nightingale. I had been at Mr. Pelleret's in Lime-street, and had bought some Hungary water; and going home, I called upon Mr. Sandys, a dealer in tea, on Ludgate-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not you a dealer in tea?</p>
               <p>Nightingale. Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Then did not you know the Prisoners?</p>
               <p>Nightingale. I never saw them before that time in my life to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, you were in a Butcher's shop with the Prisoners; don't you know the Butcher's name?</p>

            . On the 19th of Dec. I was coming down Wych-street; there was a crowd at a Butcher's shop, I enquired what was the matter, and they told me, a gentleman was robbed. I went in and said to Mr. Nightingale, Are you the gentleman that was robbed? and he said, Yes. I went for a Constable, and he charged the Constable with Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Petty?</p>
               <p>Lee. He pretended to go for a Constable, but did not return again. Another Excise-Officer (as I was informed) said before the Justice, that he believed he could light of this Petty, and said, he would step out and see for him; he went out and returned again in about a quarter of an hour, and brought Petty along with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any deputations?</p>
               <p>Lee. They pretended to snew some deputation before the Justice.</p>
               <p>The Justice's Clerk. Smith said he was an Excise-Officer, and that he seized the parcel as run goods - Petty denied the taking of the goods - They offered to produce deputations; I cannot say they did produce any.</p>
               <p>Lee. The Justice said, that the Prisoners swore directly contrary to one another.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say?</p>
               <p>Lee. I can't tell justly.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how can you say they differed in their accounts? Tell us the sum of what they said?</p>
               <p>Lee. I cannot very well remember what was said.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Petty deny the fact before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Lee. No, to the best of my remembrance he never did deny it. [The Justice was of opinion, when they were before him, that it was not a robbery; and directed the Prosecutor to prefer a bill at Hicks's-Hall for an assault.]</p>

            . I am Clerk to my brother, who is an Attorney. On the 19th of December, as I was going along the back-side of St. Clement's, Mr Nightingale came by, with a bundle under his arm; the two Prisoners came up to him, and said, they suspected that he had got some run-goods, and desired to see what he had in his bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Nightingale say?</p>
               <p>Unwin. He said, If you molest me, I will swear a robbery against you; they took the bundle away, and they all went into a Butcher's shop by the Angel, the back-side of St. Clement's.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed in the shop afterwards?</p>
               <p>Unwin. I did not go in; I only saw the two Prisoners and the Prosecutor go in together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Prosecutor, Nightingale, demand to see their deputations?</p>

            . The 19th of Dec. in the evening, the two Prisoners and Mr. Nightingale came together into my shop; Mr. Nightingale had a handkerchief in his hand - I cannot say but Mr. Smith might have hold of it with one hand; and Nightingale put it upon the window himself. Mr. Smith said, they were Excise-Officers, and had been at Ludgate-Hill to see after some run tea; Nightingale was for sending for a Constable; and Smith bid Petty go and fetch a Constable; and Petty went for a Constable, but did not bring any.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Nightingale close to him when he said they were Excise-Officers?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Nightingale was as near as I; he might have heard, for my wife and I heard.</p>
               <p>The Justice declared, that when the Prisoners were before him, they prosessed themselves to be Officers of the Excise, and showed their deputations.</p>
               <p>A worthy Alderman of this City said, he has known Petty about ten years, and always took him to be a very honest young man; and from the knowledge he has had of him, believes him to be incapable of committing a dishonest or an unjust act.</p>
               <p>Justice Engier said, he has known Petty eight or ten years, believes him to be as honest a man as any in England, and that he would not do such a thing for the world.</p>
               <p>There was one person called to the character of Smith, who has known him from three or four years of age, and says he has a very honest, just, fair character. <rs id="t17440223-17-verdict101" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Bowers. It is not worth three pound, but I suppose he took it for a gold one.</p>

I know the key and the metal watch were found upon me; I can tell how I came by that watch; I did go to Mr. Bowers, and asked him to lend me eight pound upon the watch; I can prove how I came by all the things: The silver watch is my own, I broke the minute hand of it myself.

               <p>Sibilla Hetherington. On Sunday night, while I was at church, I was robbed of four thirty six shilling pieces, and some guineas and half guineas, there was upwards of forty pound in all. I had a ready furnished lodging, and the Prisoner used to come to that house as working for the shop, and she came to do something in my room, and stole this money; it was in a trunk in my room, the nails were drawn out of the trunk: She was represented to me as a very honest person.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she a lodger in the house?</p>
               <p>Hetherington. I do not know that.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she took it?</p>
               <p>Hetherington. Because she went away from us upon that account; and she said before Justice De Veil, that she took it: There is thirty pound of the money in his hand, which he said I should have. The Constable took it from the Prisoner [ the money was produced in court, and shown to the Prosecutrix, viz. four thirty six shilling pieces, and a parcel of guines.]</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell what pieces are yours?</p>
               <p>Hetherington. These four thirty six shillings pieces are mine, I can swear to them, one is a crooked piece, as to the guineas I cannot swear to them, they may be alike. <rs id="t17440223-22-verdict126" type="verdictDescription">

            . Yesterday the 21st of this month at five o'clock in the morning, the watchman called me down to tell me my shop was broke open, there was a shutter taken down, and the sash was thrown up; when I came to search my shop, I missed a couple of cannisters with two pound of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174402230014"/> tea , which stood upon a shelf behind the counter, and the till from under the counter, in which was six shillings in silver, and three shillings and four pence in half-pence, and a lump of sugar. I put the shutters up myself at half an hour after ten, put in the pin which goes through the post, and I suppose turning the pin round the key fell out, not having any catch; and yesterday morning about nine o'clock we found the tea and sugar, and cannisters in the Prisoner's lodging on Addle Hill (I live in Thomas Street) he was there at the same time; I asked him where he had it; he said, he met three men in the street, and one of them gave him a slap on the face, and asked where he was going; and told him, as he had got an apron, to take those things, for they were smugglers, and were pursued by the watch. I sent for the Alderman's beadle, and charged him with the Prisoner, and before I came to the Justices, he said, if I would be favourable, he would tell me where the money and the tea-spoon were; I told him, I would be as favourable as I could, and he told me the money and the spoon were laid under his bed, and we found them there.</p>

            . The Prisoner and I, and three more, were drinking at the Green Dragon till four o'clock in the morning, or upwards; we all lived in the same court, but one of the persons; there is a woman lives up one pair of stairs in the house where we live, who sells a dram; we would have had a dram, but we being in liquor, she would not let us have any. I went to a neighbour's house to beg a bit of candle, and finding the Prisoner was not in bed, I went down to the door to see for him, and saw him coming up Addle Hill with something in his apron; when he came in, I said, John, what have you got there? He said, he had got some tea, and sugar, and gin, which some smugglers had given him, but they did not know where he lived, for he told them he lived by St. Paul's; he said, they hit him a slap on the face, and made him take it in his apron, and promise to come to them again: There were two cannisters with tea, some gin, and some sugar: I said to him, Tom, I am afraid you will bring me into a scrape; I believe you did not come fairly by these; he said, he would carry the things to them again; I told him he should not have the things, neither should he go; and I said, I believe we should hear of somebody that had lost those things.</p>

About ten o'clock yesterday morning Mr. Cave sent for me, and said, he had taken a Prisoner who had broke open his shop, and charged me with him; as I was going to Guild-Hall, I asked him what he had done with the money; I said, I supposed he had got the money as well as the goods; he said, he had no money at all, and never saw any; but afterwards he said, if Mr. Cave would be kind to him, he would tell him the whole truth, and said the money was under the bed - between the bed and the sacking; I found it there in this bag [the money and a silver spoon were produced.]</p>
               <p>Cave. This is not my bag, this spoon is mine, it is marked with two E's, and a B.</p>

               <p>Q. Was not she with you before?</p>
               <p>Cox. She was not one of the women that forced me into bed. They left me with the woman they forced me into bed to.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body in bed when you went into it?</p>
               <p>Cox. Yes, there was. The Prisoner came up into the room and took my breeches from under the bolster, and took six-pence, a knife, and some papers out of my breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all you had in your breeches pocket?</p>
               <p>Cox. When I went in I had eighteen pence, (they brought up liquor, and said I must pay for it;) that was all I had then. The Prisoner had given my waistcoat away to another woman before, and she had my breeches in her hand: She said, if I would not give her my handkerchief, and the buttons out of my sleeves, she would fetch up half a dozen who were below in the court; I stung my handkerchief to her, and took my breeches out of her hand; then she said she would go and call some people up: I went directly out of the house, got some assistance, came and broke the door open. I found only the woman whom I went to bed to and another in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the Prisoner is the woman that took the six-pence out of your pocket?</p>
               <p>Cox. I am sure she is the woman; she took six-pence, a knife, and a handkerchief, and threatened my life, and she gave my waistcoat to another woman, and it was carried down stairs. I carried the two women before a Magistrate, and he committed them to hard labour, and a man who pretends to be the husband of one of them brought my handkerchief and waistcoat; the Alderman told him, if he did not give a good account how he came by those things, he would send him to Newgate. The man said he would produce the woman who had them; and the Prisoner was taken. I was sent for before the Alderman, I knew the Prisoner, and he committed her to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, you were hurried up by 2 dozen women.</p>
               <p>Cox. It was by half a dozen Women.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not a market night, and a great many people about?</p>
               <p>Cox. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you call out?</p>
               <p>Cox. I could not, for they stopped my mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. When the waistcoat was taken from you, you said you run down stairs, did not you complain to the people in the market about it?</p>
               <p>Cox. No, I went directly to my acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you go to those people who were nearest you?</p>
               <p>Cox. Because I did not know whether they would be so ready to assist me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you charge the other two women with abusing and robbing you?</p>
               <p>Cox. Not with robbing me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you order the waistcoat to be pawned for your convenience at that time?</p>
               <p>Cox. I did not.</p>
               <p>- Hebborn, the Constable, said, that last Saturday was sevennight at night Mr. Cox charged him with two Women, and charged them with robbing him, and he sent them to Bridewell.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sharp. I never saw Mrs. Jackson or Mrs. Mayers, till I received a letter from Mrs. Mayers, which was wrote in this manner (I have not the letter here) ''I desire you will call upon '' me some afternoon, I have something to propose, '' which will be for your advantage. Your '' humble

             Mayers.'' Accordingly I went to Mrs. Mayers's, for as there was something to my advantage, I was glad to hear of it; when I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174402230017"/> she said, I have something to propose very much to your advantage, but when I tell you, you would think I joke: She said, she knew a lady who had no relation in the world, who came to her house every night in the week, and if you will come here to morrow night you shall see her; she is worth forty thousand pound, and lives at one Mrs. Witham's in Chancery-Lane; she said she was a frugal lady, and would not spend it. I thought forty thousand pound was a great deal to lay hold of, and a good wife too, and I was to go the next night to meet her at Mrs. Mayers's - I had several letters, but not one of them has a date (I think this was in January or February 1741.) I went by appointment at five o'clock, she said she had been with Mrs. Jackson, that she was ill of a cold, and she was angry with herself she had spoke to me about it, for fear I should think she deceived me, and bid me not be uneasy, for she saw her every day, and would soon bring it to pass.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Council. Mr. Sharp, I understand there are some letters. Who wrote these letters?</p>
               <p>Mr. Sharp. Mrs. Mayers said sometimes they were wrote by her son, and sometimes by her daughter: After these letters Mrs. Mayers would sometimes come and drink a pint of wine with me, says she, I will try, whether I cannot get her leave for you to go to her house; she has a great many East-India and South Sea bonds, and I will try whether I cannot get her to part with some of the bonds she had at her brother's death: She has petitioned the general court of the East-India Company, and they have ordered the interest to be paid to the year 1736, they have allowed her forty eight pound: Says she, you know those gentlemen, you trade with them, you must try to get this high interest for Mrs. Jackson, and she will reckon you 2 clever fellow, and then the match will be made at once; I said, I never bought or sold a bond in my life, and I did not care to meddle with them. Some time after she came and told me, that Mrs. Jackson said, if you will bring him, and he will talk of nothing but the bonds, he may come; so I met Mrs. Mayers at a tavern in Chancery-Lane (I believe this was in February) and there was Mrs.

               <p>Mr. Sharp. When we were all together Mrs. Mayers appointed that Mr. Mayers should settle it with Mrs. Jackson before I was to give her the money for the bonds.</p>
               <p>Q. How could she deceive you in this when you had been apprized before of the order for paying the bonds off?</p>
               <p>Mr. Sharp. I was not informed any otherwise than Mrs. Mayers informed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you come to any agreement that they came to any particular interest?</p>
               <p>Mr. Sharp. When I desired the account in writing, he said the general court had ordered payment to be made upon the bonds according to what was in that paper - he told me they had petitioned the general court, and they all said the court had agreed that the interest should be settled to the time mentioned in that paper - they said there was forty eight pound due upon each bond down to the year 1736, as appears by the Company's books down to the year 1736, and that they had allowed all the interest to that time, and there the interest is cast up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they all agree that it should be put into writing?</p>
               <p>Mr. Sharp. They all agreed to it, then Mrs. Jackson said, she would appoint a time for me to come and pay the money for them.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Council. Where did you go when you went from that house?</p>
               <p>Mr. Sharp. We went back again to the tavern, Mrs. Mayers staid a little behind, and when she came she gave me a great deal of joy; she sat down by me, and gave me a prodigious slap upon the thigh, and said, God, you are a lucky devil, for she likes you prodigiously.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sharp. All the four persons I have indicted; I carried the paper with me - it was produced<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174402230018"/> there, and Mrs. Mayers said this is the true interest due upon these bonds.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Council. Speak up boldly, Mr. Sharp, I cannot hear you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sharp. May be you do not desire to hear me. Mrs. Mayers said that was the right account: I said to Mrs. Jackson, Madam, I will give you the money for these bonds; but look here, Mrs. Mayers and Mr. Mayers, take notice of one thing; as for my part I cannot see how Mr. Mayers can cast up the interest; suppose the interest should happen to be more or less, if there is any mistake we must rectify it, and give or take the difference; and they all agreed to this.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Council. How is this a fraud then?</p>
               <p>Another Council. Out of your own mouth comes the truth.</p>
               <p>Sharp. I shall not deny this I say so still, and they all said, Aye, to be sure, the difference was to be settled: Mrs. Mayers came to my house, and said, Don't part with the bonds; I would have you keep them, for Mrs Jackson is as cunning a woman as any in the world; for she will come and look upon the bonds, to see if you can spare the money out of trade; and I believe I should not have gone about the money for the bonds, if Mrs. Mayers had not said that; I went on the Tuesday to Mr. Webb, at the India-House, and told him, I had got some East-India bonds; he looked at them, says he, Who had you these bonds of? Said I, What signifies who I had them of; he looked at them again, God bless me! says he, you had these bonds of Mrs. Jackson; I told him, I had, and shewed him the paper, with the account of the interest; he looked upon it, said he, Go back again to her, as fast as you can, for she has cheated you; I went several times, and could not see her; I went one day, and desired to see Mrs. Witham, and told her the affair, and she owned Mrs. Jackson had ordered herself to be denied; I brought an action and recovered the money; and what I do now is for the good of the publick; I have been 40 l. out of pocket already.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Webb. Suppose Mr. Sharp had come to you and told you of such a petition, could not you have informed him whether it had beenplied with?</p>
               <p>Mr. Webb. Yes, to be sure, if he had shewed me the bonds.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not you have told by the numbers?</p>
               <p>Mr. Webb. No. I could not, but if I had any acquaintance with the person, I would have endeavoured to have informed him, as well as I could.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Council to Mr. Sharp. Had not yo the petition a month before you paid the money for the bonds?</p>
               <p>Mr. Sharp. I had not the petition till I paid for the bonds; the petition was only read to me at Mrs. Jackson's, and it was only read to me when they brought the account of the interest.</p>
               <p>The petition to the honourable the Directors of the East-India Company was produced and read, and likewise the paper wherein they had cast up the principal and interest, with the particulars of the interest (said there to be as it stands on the Company's books) the total amounting to 665 l. 2 s.</p>

            . I believe it was this February was two years, that Mr. Sharp was with Mrs. Jackson at our house, and Madam Jackson asked him, whether he had enquired about those bonds; he said, he had not enquired, for he had not proper instructions - He said, he would give her the money for the bonds, if she would give it him in writing, that if he could not get all the money of the Company, that she would return it; which she agreed to, and then she said, she would give him a copy of the petition to enquire by - They did not tell him whether the petition was presented, or no - My brother wrote out the petition, and I and my sister carried it about a month before March the 4th. My brother told him, Sir, if you think you can't get the money, don't take the bonds at all - I did not hear Mr. Sharp say any thing to it; and my brother wrote out the account; he took me with him to Mrs. Jackson's, and she told him how to write it, and my sister and I carried the account to Mr. Sharp, and said I had brought the account by Madam Jackson's order; and he said, tell Mrs. Jackson I will meet her at the Bank coffee-house, and I will pay her the money for the bonds; I know how to get the money of the Company, I know how to make the Company pay me - I heard him say these words; the money was paid the fourth of March.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Council. Do you remember at any time that he made any proposal of stifling the prosecution?</p>
               <p>Mayers. He desired my mother and sister would go out of town, and not appear at the trial, and he would pay the charges; and she said, she would not; he said, then it should be the worse for her.</p>
               <p>Council. This was when he sued Mrs. Jackson; but do you remember, that Mr. Sharp said at any time, he would have some money of Mrs. Jackson, or he would bring her to the bar?</p>
               <p>Mayers. Last December, or thereabouts, he said he was going to find a bill of indictment against Mrs. Jackson, and wanted my mother, brother, and sister, to go to the Old-Bailey, and he said, he would make them handsom presents, but they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174402230019"/> would not; then he said, he would indict them all out of spite; he said, he would carry my brother off swearing, he would spoil all their swearing; my mother said, it was a vile thing to prefer an indictment, and so he went away in a passion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sharp. That boy never was at any of the meetings.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Witham. Mr. Sharp came to speak to Mrs. Jackson; I heard some high words, there was a mighty hurley burley, and Mr. Sharp said, I will send you all to Newgate. What, said I, I that know nothing at all of the matter? he said, Not you. I said, how came you to buy these bonds, when you bought them with your eyes open? he said, if it had been a thousand pound he would have done it for her - I believe all the county of Essex will give Mrs. Jackson a good character; her father was a man of good reputation, and so were all the family - I believe she is worth a good thousand a year, and a coach and four horses, near Brentwood.</p>

I am the tipstaff that took Mrs. Jackson up, and in conversation between Mr. Sharp and her, he was angry with her, and said, she had cheated him of a great deal of money, and he would send Mrs. Mayers to her. - He said, if he discharged her now, intimating. he had it in his power to discharge her or not, and that, if she would marry him, he would release her; those were not the very words, but to that purport.</p>
