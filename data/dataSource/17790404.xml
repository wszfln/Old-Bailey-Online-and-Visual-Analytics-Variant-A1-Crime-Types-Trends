            , who is now in the country. I employed the other prisoner some time ago to make me some clothes. I gave him the money beforehand to buy the cloth. He did not make them. I went to his lodging, and because I insisted on seeing the cloth he threatened to be revenged on me. I went after that to America; when I returned I met him in the street, and he asked me to drink, which I consented to, though I knew he had malice in his heart against me. He then asked me to lend him some money; he said he was in distress. I saw no more of him from that time till this happened; then out of revenge he said he had the watch of me. I never had it in my custody. When I was at the Brown-Bear, he said I had better say I gave him the watch. I do not know the laws of this country. I refused to say so. Then he said, as I would not say he had the watch of me he would get clear in spite of my teeth; as he was the first speaker he could say what he pleased.</p>

               <p>You was coming from the playhouse with Miss Ray on the 7th of April. - I was. On Wednesday the 7th of April, seeing Miss Ray in some difficulties at the playhouse, and, being a little acquainted with her, I was induced to offer my assistance to hand her to her carriage; she took me by the arm.</p>
               <p>What time of the night was this? - Past eleven o'clock, I believe; I am not precise to the time. As we came out of the passage that leads into <placeName id="t17790404-3-crimeloc17">Covent-Garden</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17790404-3-crimeloc17" type="placeName" value="Covent-Garden"/>

                        targets="t17790404-3-off14 t17790404-3-crimeloc17"/> playhouse, when we were in the piazzas, very near the carriage, I heard the report of a pistol.</p>
               <p>You was not with her then; you had only handed her to the piazzas? - I came out of the passage with her. I had not quitted her at the time the fatal accident happened; she had hold of my hand at the time. After I came out of the passage in the piazzas I heard the report of a pistol, and felt an impression on my right arm, the arm she held with her left, and which I conceive to be the ball, after it had passed through her head, that had hit my arm; she instantly dropped.</p>
               <p>How far had you proceeded from the playhouse door when this accident happened? - Within two or three yards of the front on the outside, in the street, within two steps of the coach; she had got out of the portico; it was in the piazzas that it happened. I thought the pistol had been fired out of wantonness; I had not an idea that there was a ball though I felt the impression on my arm. I stooped to assist her in a fainting fit, as I conceived it to be, through the fright of the pistol.</p>
               <p>Did you at any time observe the prisoner? - No, I did not; I do not know he was the person at all, but from what passed afterwards in the Shakspeare. I threw myself upon my knees to attempt to help her up, and found my hands bloody; I then had an idea of the truth of it, and by the assistance of a link-boy I got her into the Shakspeare tavern. Upon the prisoner being secured, I was induced to ask him what could possess him to be guilty of such a deed? or some question of that sort; and he answered me by saying, that it was not a proper place to ask that question, or something to that effect. I am not precise as to his answer. I asked him his name, and I understood from him that his name was Hackman; I think he pronounced his name with an H. I asked him if he knew anybody. He said, he knew a Mr. Booth, in Craven-street in the Strand, and desired he might be sent for. He desired to see the lady. I did not tell him she was dead; somebody else did. I objected to his seeing her at that time. I had her removed into another room. From the great quantity of blood I had about me I got sick, and was obliged to go home. - I know no more abou t it.</p>
               <p>When the prisoner heard the lady was dead did he make any observations in your hearing? - I cannot recollect that he made any observation.</p>

               <p>Give an account of all that you observed under the piazzas.</p>
               <p>I was standing at the post. Just as the play broke up I saw two ladies and a gentleman coming out of the playhouse; a gentleman in black followed them. Lady Sandwich's coach was called. When the carriage came up, the gentleman handed the other lady into the carriage; the lady that was shot stood behind. Before the gentleman could come back to hand her into the carriage the gentleman in black came up, laid hold of her by the gown, and pulled out of his pocket two pistols; he shot the right hand pistol at her, and the other at himself. She fell with her hand so (describing it as being on her forehead) and died before she could be got to the first lamp; I believe she died immediately, for her head hung directly. At first I was frightened at the report of the pistol, and ran away. He fired another pistol, and dropped immediately. They fell feet to feet. He beat himself violently over the head with his pistols, and desired somebody would kill him.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts did he beat himself? - Just about the right temple. (Describing it.)</p>
               <p>His own head? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see him in Tothilfields Bridewell the next day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the person you saw there the person who discharged the pistol? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is he here? - That is the gentleman. (Pointing to the prisoner.)</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You say Mr. Hackman pulled two pistols out of his pocket - do you mean he pulled them both out of one pocket with one hand? - He pulled them out of different pockets with different hands, and they went off just so. (Describing it by claping her hands twice, one immediately after the other.)</p>
               <p>Was one taken out first, and the other afterwards? - No; both together.</p>
               <p>Was the pistol cocked? - I saw him cock both the pistols at the same time.</p>
               <p>Did you see him do any thing to the pistols? - I saw him let them off.</p>
               <p>Do you know the make of a pistol? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see him do any thing to the pistol before he let it off? - No.</p>

I went up, and saw the surgeon had Mr. Hackman and a pistol in his hand. Mr. Mahon gave me the pistol, and desired me to take care of the prisoner, and take him to his house.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Mahon's house? - Yes; when I came to the corner by the Red-Lion, the door was shut. I found the prisoner very faint; somebody called to me, and desired me to bring him back to the Shakspeare tavern; that Mr. Mahon was there, and I brought him back to the Shakspeare.</p>

               <p>I am an apothecary. I live at the corner of Bow-street. Coming through the piazzas in Covent-Garden, intending to go through the passage home, I had just put my foot on the first step when I heard two pistols go off. It struck me that two gentlemen had quarrelled in the boxes, and taken that method to settle the difference. I went back, and saw the gentleman lie on the ground, reclining in this posture (describing it) he had a pistol in his left hand, and was beating himself violently. I understood that his name was Hackman. The prisoner is the gentleman. I wrenched the pistol immediately out of his hand. He bled very much. I gave the pistol to Blandy, the constable, and desired him to take the prisoner to my house that I might dress the wound, and stop the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177904040007"/> violent effusion of blood. I was going towards my own house; at the corner of Russel-Street I met Mr. Campbell, who keeps the Shakspeare tavern?</p>

               <p>It is no matter what passed between you and Mr. Campbell, did you see any thing of the lady? - At first I did not.</p>
               <p>When did you see her? - In the space of two or three minutes I saw her lying at the bar, supported by a person I did not know. I perceived the wound was mortal. I said I could give her no assistance.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon. I was called upon to view the body of Miss Ray. I saw the body at the Shakspeare the same night soon after the murther; I examined the wound, and found it to be a mortal one. I felt the vessels of sensation, and tried every other way to see if I could perceive any life, and pronounced the woman dead. The wound was received in the front of the head, in the Centra coronalis, and the ball was discharged under the left ear.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I should not have troubled the court with the examination of witnesses to support the charge against me, had I not thought that the pleading guilty to the indictment gave an indication of contemning death not suitable to my present condition, and was in some measure, being accessary to a second peril of my life; and I likewise thought, that the justice of my country ought to be satisfied by suffering my offence to be proved, and the fact established by evidence.</p>
               <p>I stand here this day the most wretched of human beings, and confess myself criminal in a high degree; yet while I acknowledge with shame and repentance, that my determination against my own life was formal and complete, I protest, with that regard to truth which becomes my situation, that the will to destroy her who was ever dearer to me than life, was never mine till a momentary phrensy overcame me, and induced me to commit the deed I now deplore. The letter, which I meant for my brother-in-law after my decease, will have its due weight as to this point with good men.</p>
               <p>Before this dreadful act, I trust nothing will be found in the tenor of my life which the common charity of mankind will not excuse. I have no wish to avoid the punishment which the laws of my country appoint for my crime; but being already too unhappy to feel a punishment in death, or a satisfaction in life, I submit myself with penitence and patience to the disposal and judgement of Almighty God, and to the consequences of this enquiry into my conduct and intention.</p>

               <p>"My dear Frederick,</p>
               <p>"When this reaches you I shall be no more, but do not let my unhappy fate distress you too much; I have strove against it as long as possible, but it now overpowers me. You well know where my affections were placed; my having by some means or other lost her's (an idea which I could not support) has driven me to madness. The world will condemn me, but your good heart will pity me. God bless you my dear Fred. Would I had a sum to leave you, to convince you of my great regard: you was my only friend. I have hid one circumstance from you, which gives me great pain. I owe Mr. Knight, of Gosport, 100 l. for which he has the writings of my houses; but I hope in God, when they are sold, and all other matters collected, there will be nearly enough to settle our account. May Almighty God bless you and yours with comfort<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177904040008"/> and happiness; and may you ever be a stranger to the pangs I now feel. May heaven protect my beloved woman, and forgive this act, which alone could relieve me from a world of misery I have long endured. Oh! if it should ever be in your power to do her any act of friendship, remember your faithful friend,</p>

               <p>I was concerned with the three prisoners in this and several other robberies. I have been connected with them four months. We went out of days to see if we could find any places where we were likely to get any thing. We saw this upholsterer's window broke, and Harris said we could get something there; we all went at night. Harris<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177904040009"/> and Foster went, and Harris took the glass out of the window, piece after piece, till he had taken the whole out. Potten and I stood on the opposite side of the way. Harris brought the carpeting to us, and then the writing desk and then the tea-chest. He could not reach any thing else. We took them to my house.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In Windmill-street, Tottenham-court-road. They fetched all the things away the next morning except the box which was left at my house. I did not think it was safe to have it there. I carried it to a neighbour; when it had been there a little while, I desired him to pawn it which he did for six shillings. Potten and Foster boarded with me at the time. They lodged at a different house in the neighbourhood, to which I recommended them.</p>
               <p>What day was this? - I cannot tell; it was some time in January.</p>

               <p>By the information of Lyons I and another officer went to Harris's longing; we could not find him; as we were coming out of the court we saw him coming home in a coach, and secured him, and took him to his lodging. I searched his lodging, and found a tea-chest. I asked him where he got it; he said he bought it. Lyons carried us to Foster's lodgings; we took Foster and Potten together: they both lodged in the same room. I searched the room, but found nothing in it. Harris took us to a house in Petticoat-lane, under a pretence to show us some other people who were concerned with him, and when he had got us into a room among a number of people, he ran away and left us.</p>
               <p>From Harris to Lyons. Whether I did not buy the tea-chest and a coffee-pot of your brother Barnard? - He did not.</p>

               <p>You cannot recollect the day of the month? - No, I cannot; it was about the 22d or 23d of February. The goods were lost out of the shop window; the shop was open. It appeared to me that by some instrument the pane of glass had been snapped off at the corner, and a hole made big enough to put a person's arm in. I knew the pane of glass was whole. The door was shut, it has a spring latch; and the candles were lighted. I was in the back shop with my partner; the servants were both out.</p>
               <p>What time in the evening were they lost? - Between the hours of six and seven.</p>
               <p>You cannot tell how long after six it was? - I believe about half after six; I heard some glass rattle; I went and searched, but did not perceive any pane broke at that time, nor any china gone from the window. I did not look so particularly as I should have done. The next morning, the man taking down the shutters, saw the glass lying down under the place; I was by at the time.</p>

               <p>Are you acquainted with Harris? - Yes, I have been acquainted with him from about a week after Christmas. We have been out a great many times together, and got a great many things with other people. We went by this china shop in the day; at night we went again, and he had a knife which he always cut glass with.</p>
               <p>Was you with him? - I was.</p>
               <p>What time in the night was it when you went out? - About five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did you go immediately to this house? - No; we went to a publick-house, drank something, and staid till after six o'clock, before we went to this shop; when we went from the public-house, we walked about the street to see if we could get an opportunity to cut the glass out.</p>
               <p>Was it quite dark then? - Yes. We came to this shop, he had a little knife in his hand, he put it into the putty, and cracked the glass; it made a report, and the gentleman of the shop came out and looked all round the shop-window, but not perceiving a ny thing, he went backwards again, quite to the back part of the shop; then Harris put the knife in again, and loosened the glass.</p>
               <p>You concealed yourselves at the time? - We went on the other side of the way till he went in. After this we crossed the way again to the shop. He put his knife in again and loosened the glass, and took it out piece by piece, till he could get his hand in,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177904040011"/> and then he put his hand in and took out the china mentioned in the indictment (repeating it) and gave them to me, putting them into my apron as he took them out. Then we went home with them to my house in Windmill-street, Tottenham-court-road. He said the china would fetch a guinea, and he gave me half a guinea. As to the three chocolate cups, I said he might keep them himself; he came the next day and took them from my house. I gave information against Harris on Friday night, and he was taken up. I saw the cups and saucers, and chocolate cups at the Rotation-office. Harris told me the next day, that he had taken them to my brother and he had pawned them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She only wants to hang me to save her brother. Ask her if I did not give her brother eighteen-pence for the three cups? - It is a falsity; I did not desire any thing for the cups.</p>

In his lodging I found these three cups (they were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor); he said he bought them at a sale for eighteen-pence; he told us afterwards that he would take us to some persons that were concerned with him, and when we were in Petticoat-lane, he made his escape from us; he went afterwards to the Mansion-house, and wanted to be made an evidence, but his lordship finding he had escaped from us, would not admit him.</p>

I gave him eighteen-pence for them; he had the tea-chest in his hand that I have been charged with. They have a spite and spleen against me, and want to swear my life away.</p>

When I came to Hampstead I was informed, if I went to the Coach-and-horses, I should hear where my goods were. I went, and was informed they were at the house of one Muddock, a constable. I saw the goods at Muddock's, and knew them to be mine. I went the next day, and took an inventory of them; my niece took the inventory; I was by at the time. I saw all the things mentioned in the indictment at Mr. Muddock's, (repeating them). They were all in the house when I left it. I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman in the parish of Hampstead. Upon the 18th of December, as I was crying the hour at three in the morning, I met one Mr. Brown with a lamb cart; he told me had seen a little cart coming along the road, and he thought it had some stolen goods in it. He said, he thought there were two men upon the cart, and one by the side. He had told my brother watchman of it before. I walked up the town, crying the hour, and met Osborne, Ball, and Hilsdon, and two others beside.</p>
               <p>Who were the two others? - One was Wilkins.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - I cannot say I do.</p>
               <p>Who told you there was one Wilkins? - Ball.</p>
               <p>Is Wilkins the prisoner at the bar? - I cannot say that he is.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner one of the five? - I cannot be positive that he was.</p>
               <p>Should you know the man that they call Wilkins, if you was to see him. - I cannot say that I should.</p>
               <p>Did you stop the cart? - I intended to stop it, but they drove away from me; they drove against a brick-wall, and overturned it, just above the pump, in the town of Hampstead, and I and two other watchmen came up to them; there was household furniture in the cart. When it overturned they endeavoured to make off. I struck at one of them as he turned the corner of the butcher's shop; as I struck at him Ball came up, and I collared him; he immediately struck me in the neck. I took Ball only. I delivered the goods up to Muddock the constable.</p>

When she found I had indicted her, she got a warrant against me, and Justice Wilmot sent me to Bridewell till my neighbours bailed me out. She swore I beat her.</p>

            's regiment. I have been lately discharged on coming home from America. We landed at Portsmouth. I came home in the Hallifax. I think I came to London on the 25th of March. I was robbed on the 26th. It was late on Thursday night when we came in; we enquired where we could have quarters; we were directed to a Mr. Kennedy's, the sign of the Angel, in Chapel-street, Westminster. We laid down our knapsacks, and drank pretty heartily.</p>
               <p>How many comrades had you with you? - Six or seven. We found the prisoner at Kennedy's; he offered us his bed for that night; he lodged in Kennedy's house. I said we were obliged to him, and three of us slept in his bed that night. The next day we went to the War-Office to get our billets to go to Chelsea, and then returned to Mr. Kennedy's for our package. I took the prisoner to be a friend; he pretended to be a countryman of mine; he is a soldier; he went with me, and some of my comrades, to Chelsea. The day was pretty well on when we left Mr. Kennedy's. When we came to Chelsea, and I had got my billet, he asked me to take a walk to pass away the time; we went to the sign of the Square and Compass, and had four pots of beer; we staid there two hours or more; he had had no dinner. I paid for a dinner for him. I then took my pocket out, and changed a dollar. I had ten dollars and an half, four pisteroons, and four pieces of money they call 7 d 1/2 pieces, and some small money; it was all in my pocket-book in my breast pocket. I changed a dollar with him at that house; then we walked to another house; he asked me to have a bottle of beer, and took me into a house that I thought not good; it was then, I think, between four and five o'clock. I asked him then to go with me to Mr. Kennedy's; I wanted to spend two pots of beer at his house, as he had been kind to me, and to return him thanks, because he had charged nothing for my eating. I desired him to come out of the house where we were; he would not; upon which I left him, and went to Mr. Kennedy's by myself, and he came in afterwards; we drank two pots of beer together, and then Mr. Kennedy desired him to see me home, and he went with me.</p>
               <p>What time of night was it? - I cannot say, I was pretty much in liquor; he went out with me, and as we were going along, he took me out of the road, near the <placeName id="t17790404-9-crimeloc53">Queen's gardens</placeName>

I went to the serjeant of the queen's guard, and asked the favour of a man to go home with me.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the serjeant of the guard that you had been robbed? - I said not a word of it till I got home.</p>
               <p>When did you miss the book? - Immediately as he took it. As he turned away, I desired him to give me the pocket-book; he made me no answer. I knew I was not in a condition to follow him; and thought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177904040015"/> if I did, he might use me worse. I kept it as still as I could, as I knew him, left he should get away from the place. I went to Mr. Kennedy's, in the morning, and found him there; I told Mr. Kennedy of it, and he charged him with it; he went up into his lodging and brought down the pocket-book.</p>

I went out at seven and returned at eight. I left nobody in the house; I locked the door; it is a spring-lock; I tried it to see that it was fast. When I returned, I found the door as I left it; I opened it with the key; I went in and got a light, and saw a tea-chest which I left upon the dining table in a chair that was in the lower room; there is but one room on a floor. I said to a lady that was with me, that I was robbed, and immediately missed the gowns, which I had left below stairs; I then went up stairs, and missed the plate out of the closet, and my clothes out of a drawer. I came down again and missed a watch which hung over the mantle piece.</p>

               <p>Did you examine how they got in? - I apprehend by opening the door with a key. There were no marks of violence. I was sent for to Sir

               <p>I live at Mile-End New Town. On the 16th of March, between ten and eleven o'clock, a young woman brought six or seven gowns to me from Mrs. Ireland. Mrs. Ireland came in after her; there were two silk gowns, and a silk gown not made up. I bought them of her; I was to give her four pounds eight shillings for them; I gave her two guineas in part. In the afternoon Mr. Phillips came and asked for the bundle the young woman brought from Mrs. Ireland.</p>
               <p>Who did you pay the money to? - Mrs. Ireland. She keeps a sort of chandler's-shop.</p>
               <p>Do you keep a shop? - No; I did keep a chandler's-shop, but I do not now; I work at my needle, and do clear starching; I am a house-keeper. I delivered the gowns to Phillips.</p>

I went after the prisoner, and asked him where he got that linen. He said, what is that to you? I secured him, and brought him back, till I made an enquiry whether there had been any robbery committed. On enquiry, Mrs. Holbrook came and owned the linen: A constable was sent for, and he was carried to the Compter. When he was examined, he said he found them.</p>

               <p>I was at a neighbour's house; I was called, and told that a man came out of my bedroom window. I came home and found two drawers quite stripped. I went to the cheesemonger's and saw my things. I have seen the prisoner before, he sold cutlary ware in Bishopsgate Church-Yard.</p>
               <p>How long after you lost the things was it before the prisoner was stopped? - Not a minute I suppose; the servant said he heard somebody jump from the window.</p>
               <p>What time of the day was it? - Eight o'clock at night; it was quite dark. The window is not above seven feet from the ground; I suppose one got upon the other's shoulders, and put up the sash and got in; there were the mark of footsteps in the room.</p>
               <p>(The things were produced in Court by the constable, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

In a short time the prisoner came down, and went into the snuff-room, took some paper, laid it on a stand, and dipped his hand two or three times in a stand of snuff, took out about half a pound, twisted it up, and put it in his pocket. He then went into the warehouse, where the tobacco is; I could not see him in that warehouse, but heard him take the lid of a stand up. My apprentice was concealed in another part of the warehouse, and saw him take tobacco. I had watched him, and seen him take snuff three sundays before this. I did not take him up, because I understood that his sister came of a Sunday morning to receive parcels from him. On the Saturday following I desired one Badcock to get a constable ready against the next morning; and if she came, to take her; if not, to take him. I concealed myself again. On Sunday the 28th, the prisoner came again into the snuff-room, and took three pounds and a half of rappee snuff. He then went out; the constable took him, and found the snuff concealed in a pair of breeches under his coat. The constable and I searched his box; there were several suits of clothes and tobacco in almost all the pockets, and a letter directed to his sister, desiring her to come to him the next morning at seven o'clock. When the constable stopped him, he said he was going to take it to a customer of mine, one Mrs. Baker at Charing-Cross.</p>

I said he must go back to his master; he had a pair of breeches. I asked him what he had there; he said a pair of breeches he was carrying to mend; the snuff was tied up in the breeches. Before the alderman he said he was going to carry it to a person, who desired him to bring him some real rappee snuff, because they were used to adulterate it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Haynes told me he suspected his servant robbing him, and desired me to watch his coming out of his house, which I did three Sunday mornings running; he sometimes went into the Cock and Crown, and sometimes went another way. On the 27th the prosecutor desired me to get a constable the next morning, and, if his sister came, to take her; if she did not, to take him. I went and saw the prisoner come out with a parcel under his arm. I went after him, with the constable, and bid him stop. He said, what must I stop for? Couchman came up, pulled out his staff, and told him he was his prisoner. We took him back, and Mr. Haynes said he had some snuff about him; that he saw him take it. The prisoner said, that he was going to carry it to a customer; but I forget the name.</p>

             lives at the corner of Westmoreland-buildings; he used to ask me to give him some snuff, and told me I could get more. Is that an honest man to swear against a person that would do that? Mrs. Baker is a customer of my master's; I took some goods to her on the Friday; she desired me to get her some of my snuff; to be sure I that worked in the vineyard would not take the worst of the grapes. My master would not sell snuff retail without adulterating it; she desired me to bring her some of my sort of snuff, I served my master duely and truely as I ought to do; I never wronged him of any thing.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Barnwell. On the 19th of March, at half past seven in the evening I received two silk gowns and two silk petticoats from the servant of Mr. Jakes, who keeps the George-Inn in Holbourn. I carried them into the parlour to my mistress; she looked over them, and put them on the compter in the shop, till my master came in, because we thought they would not take the colour they were to be dyed. The shop was then shut up. I went into the parlour again, and sat down to my work with my mistress. About half an hour after Mr. Jaques sent a child with some fringe to be dyed of the same colour. I laid it on the silk on the compter, and went again to my work. About five minutes after two women came to the door; one in the name of Mrs. Cox asked for a coat and waistcoat, which had been brought for my master to clean.</p>
               <p>Who were those women? - The two prisoners. The other prisoner came with Mrs. Cox. I desired them to walk in; I told them I believed they were cleaned, and went into the shop to look for them; there are two compters in the shop, I looked on one, but could not find them; I moved the the silks to make room for some things on the other compter, to look for the coat and waistcoat. I found they came to eighteen pence; she gave me a bad shilling; the other woman went to the door, and asked Mrs. Cox if she was coming; she said yes. As soon as we had settled, I asked if she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177904040023"/> would have the things put in her handkerchief. She threw them down on the compter, and knocked the candlestick down; they then went out, and I shut the door after them, and went immediately into the parlour to my mistress. In about five minutes after they were gone, I found the fringe lying at the door.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barnwell keeps lodgers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many lodge in the house? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Does one Miller lodge in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you say the door was open all the time you was in the shop with the prisoners? - I was never asked the question.</p>
               <p>Was the door open? - No; it was upon the latch.</p>
               <p>Any of the lodgers could open the door if they would? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you express a wish that the lodging of Miller might be searched, that you suspected him; and your master said he must not search the apartments of his lodger, because if he did he should lose them? - I said I wished he would search the whole house.</p>
               <p>Did you ever declare that you believed these women not to be guilty? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see the silks at the time the prisoners were in the shop? - Yes.</p>

             is my sister. Watson declared while my sister was waiting for bail that she did not think she was guilty. I asked her how she came to swear so positively before the justice; she said she did not mean to swear positively, as she only took her up on suspicion.</p>
               <p>Where did she say this? - In the office, as we were sitting on the bench. She said she was obliged to do what she did, for if the gowns were not found she must pay for them. I asked if there were any lodgers in the house; she said, yes. I asked why her master did not search the house; she said she advised him to search it, but her master said he was a poor man, and could not afford to lose his lodgers. I offered if any of the lodgers were to go away on the account of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177904040024"/> the search, to pay half a quarter's rent. Watson said she thought there should be a search warrant, particularly for Miller's room. We went up to the two-pair-of-stairs room; Miller was gone out.</p>

Foley had his hat off and a pair of spectacles on. With the sudden surprise of our approaching the room he dropped a sixpence, which he had in his left hand (producing it). He was on the opposite side next to the fire-place. Foley was rubbing that sixpence that fell, either with scowering paper or a file, the other was at work. I cannot say in particular what he was doing.</p>
               <p>Describe what things were found on the table before them. - The sixpence he let fall, I picked up, and these sixpences were on the table by Foley (producing five). By the fire-place, there were many crucibles, and by the left hand side of the door there were flasks set as moulds. Mr. Clarke will produce them; that is all I saw. Whether Foley was making use of the files or the scowering paper and cork I cannot say.</p>

               <p>I went, in consequence of an information, to this house, (No. 2) in Oat-Lane; we went up into the three-pair-of-stairs room, bursted open the door, and opposite to the door there was a table, where the two prisoners set at work. Foley was at work on the sixpence; I believe he was scowering it with sand-paper; I am very certain he was. Weldon was at work upon another with a file; he was without his coat; the other without his hat, with spectacles on; but the alarm of bursting open the door so suddenly frightened them; before them was a quantity of counterfeit sixpences cast; (producing a parcel) these lay before Weldon; that is the sixpence he was working upon; that is the file he was at work with. They were both at work, Foley scowering with sandpaper, the other at work with the file.</p>
               <p>You are sure he was filing sixpences? - Yes; the file and the sixpence both dropped out of his hands together. Here are three counterfeit sixpences I found in the draw in the room; they are finished. As I was searching Weldon I found five more played tricks with; they are not finished. In the same room was a quantity of wrought arsenick; there was some copper, likewise some sand, and what they call facing. There were two pair of flasks and crucibles; there is one pair moulded ready for pouring; there were about fifty impressions ready fixed. After finding the flasks I thought the patterns must be somewhere; I desired them to produce them, they refused knowing any thing of them. I had instructions to search in the cellar, and there I found as many sixpences as there were impressions in the flasks; there are fifty or fifty-one, I cannot be particular to one; they were the pattern sixpences. (The flasks produced). The impressions are all perfect.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>When you had your information, did you know who the house, where these people were at work, belonged to? - I do not; I believe Weldon was the owner of the room, but they were both at work in the same room.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177904040025"/>That you are positive of? - I should be sorry to say that here if it was not true.</p>

               <p>Foley.

               <p>Foley. There was a pair of spectacles lay on the table; he asked whose they were; I told him I knew nothing of them. - He is one of the blood-suckers.</p>

I said, I think they are lace. He said, he would go and see what they were. The man rested them on the seat of the coach; we went up to the coach, got in it, and bid the coachman drive to Justice Sherwood's; we opened it at the justice's, and there were ten guineas worth of halfpence; we left them with

               <p>Were the lock and key gone too? - It was lost; my man found it in the field, as he was hedging, about a month ago. The horse was an iron grey, six years old, marked R. C. on the near nostril; a brown mane and tail. I had her about three years. I found her at a place called Gilded Moreton, in Cambridgeshire, in the possession of

               <p>Tell us how it happened. - A man came from Hatfield, in Hertfordshire, and gave me intelligence of her. I set out after her, and pursued the prisoner to Gilded Moreton; it was about eleven o'clock at night when we got to the place where he was.</p>
               <p>What inn was it? - I do not know the sign. Mr. Pack saw him go out of Hatfield with the mare just before I came there.</p>

As soon as he got out of the reach of my arm he said, you be d - ned; he jumped over the stile, and got out of my reach. I went into the house, and said, I believed they had a mare of mine<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177904040028"/> there. I desired them to get a light; they brought a candle; when they came into the yard they blowed the candle out; they went and lighted it again, and then when they were in the yard they blowed it out again; they did so a third time; then the man that was with me took the candle out of the person's hand, and went and lighted it himself. I saw the mare, and knew it was mine. Mr. Pack pursued him, and took him th e next day.</p>

               <p>I harvested at Ashwell. I went down into the fens. I was there a week. I came back along with the same man he mentions now. I came up to Barnet fair. I saw a gentleman there who had a mare sold to him by somebody; he said I was the man that sold the mare to him. I said I was not the man. He threatened to take me into custody. I was frightened, got from him, and went down into Hertfordshire. I saw a man with two horses, a bridle and saddle. This mare was one of the two horses. A young man asked me to ride. I said I was going to Ashwell. He said he did not know Ashwell, but he knew Great Moreton, and took me to the sign of the Swan, and said, if I staid there he would come to me; they call it Gilded Moreton.</p>
               <p>Jury to Mrs. Hinton. What colour was the mare you saw him upon? - A grey mare.</p>

               <p>Pack. He worked at the harvest at Ashwell; he did not mind his business; his master turned him away before the 4th of September.</p>

               <p>I keep the Kilbourn-wells. On the 29th of June, about six o'clock in the morning, when I came down, the mare was at my door; the prisoner was drinking with some others; he was offering the mare to sale; he asked twelve guineas for her; I had seen her several days on the common. The mare had a sprain in her leg; the prisoner said he had put a rope round her neck and tied it to her leg, by which means she got the sprain. I said twelve guineas was too much for her; he said he would not sell her to me. I desired Mr. Carr to look at the mare and buy her for me; he agreed for eight guineas; I paid the eight guineas. That is the mare the prosecutor claims.</p>

               <p>I was at day-work at Clapham. A man left a mare there, and desired me to take it to Smithfield and sell it for him. A gentleman asked me whose mare it was, I said it was none of mine, but it was to sell. I said the price was twelve guineas, he bid me eight guineas; I turned it away. I asked the young man if he would take the eight guineas; he said he would, and I took the eight guineas directly. He wanted me to turn king's evidence, when they found I did not belong to the mare.</p>

               <p>Did they rob you of any thing? - They robbed me after they had knocked me down of a pocket, an apron, four shillings, a child's jamb, and a snuff-box.</p>
               <p>Did they produce a pistol? - No; they beat me terribly.</p>
               <p>What did they beat you with? - Their hands; they tore off the pocket-apron by force, and left the strings behind; the other things were in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Did you know the men before? - I never saw them in my life.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure of their persons? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177904040030"/> Yes. As I was turning round to help myself, when I was down, I saw them coming to strike me, and had a full view of their faces.</p>
               <p>Did they say any thing at the time they robbed you? - The blows came so fast, I was hardly sensible; I did not cry out while they were beating me, as I knew my life was in their hands. When I was able to get up, I went into the house, and said, gentlemen, you have robbed me; one of the gentlemen standing by the door showing something to another, said, has the old woman missed it; d - n the bitch, and were going to drive me out, on which I made my escape.</p>
               <p>Do you live at Islington? - No; I went to see my sister on the Sabbath-day, the 24th of January, and staid supper; my husband was to come for me; he did not; I set out by myself from my sister's to come to London at eleven o'clock at night. I live just by Drury-lane. I asked the watchman if it was safe for me to go across the fields by myself; he said he did not know, as the moon was very cloudy. I asked him where I could have a house to lie at; as I knew I had a trifle about me, all that I had in the world, I was afraid of loosing that; he said the Peacock would be up at one o'clock, and he would take me safe there; he took me there at one o'clock. I treated him for his kindness; he staid about twenty minutes, and then went away; he left me about half after one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did you intend to lie there? - No; I intended to stay till daylight, in order to be safe.</p>
               <p>What time was you robbed? - About three o'clock. These people came about half after two.</p>
               <p>Were they drunk? - They did not seem to be drunk - they seemed very roguish.</p>
               <p>Was nobody up in the house? - Yes, two watchmen.</p>
               <p>Did not they take your part? - No.</p>
               <p>Did they see this ill-treatment? - Yes, and the landlord too.</p>
               <p>Did not they attempt to assist you? - No.</p>
               <p>How did you know they were watchmen?</p>
               <p>- I was told they were watchmen; they had great coats and caps on.</p>
               <p>What did you do after they had robbed you? - I went and sat down on a bench next door to my sister's, till she got up, then I told her what had happened, and she put me to bed as I was very ill.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the the men afterwards?</p>
               <p>- No. I went the next day to Justice Blackborough. I was led by two women there. He sent for one of the men out of prison who was already taken up for house robbing.</p>
               <p>Did you know him again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he acknowledge any thing? - No.</p>
               <p>He seemed thunder-struck, and as he was going out called me an old bitch. and said if he could catch me out what he would do to me.</p>

               <p>On Saturday the 30th of January, Dinmore, I, and the last witness, apprehended the prisoner Campbell coming to the Angel; he asked what was the information against him; I said he would know when he came before the magistrate; then he said, I know what it is, it is through that rogue Bell, he brought me to this. We took him to Justice Blackborough's; I do not remember his saying any thing these. I was not at the examination of Bell on the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Did you understand him that Bell had brought him into a scrape by inviting him to partake of the crime, or brought a false charge against him? - No; I thought he meant Bell had invited him to do it. We were informed on Monday, that the woman was like to die; and had an order to take the men to her to the hospital. When we came into the ward, the curtains being drawn round the bed, Dinmore undrew the curtains, and asked if she knew any person in the house. She opened her eyes, and pointed to Campbell, and said she knew him; he said how could she say that, when she was in such a situation; she said I wish I had never seen you, then I should not have been in this situation, nor you in trouble. Her sister came to her and said, sister, you are in a dreadful situation, what will become of you if you should say a false thing against these men. She said if it was the last word she had to say, he was the man, that was with Bell.</p>

I never saw the woman in my life till I saw her in the hospital. I never saw her at the Peacock. I came there about half past one o'clock for some beasts; the landlord of the Peacock (Mr. Baldwin) would not come; they kept him out of the way.</p>

             called Winter and me out into the street, and said he knew where he could get plenty of pewter; he went and got a sack, a chissel, and a tinder box; he came to the house. We went from the White-Lion about eleven o'clock, and went to the Angel, and got into a little room fronting the bar, and staid there two hours; we staid till about one, or rather better.

We took some bread out of the Angel, and went over to the White-Lyon, and eat it; we then went to John Green's, a wheelwright, at Islington. Bell called him up to let us in, and asked him to let us put some things in his lost. He let us put them in his lost. Bell went to my mother's, got the sack, and put it in the lost, and Green put some straw over it. When we came the next night to take them out, and Green's son let us have them, Winter took the sack on his back, and I took some under my arm. Winter let the sack fall in the road, and Mr. Burrow's servant, I believe, stood with a lantern in the road; he came up, and Winter ran away. Mr. Burrow's servant took up the property.</p>

I know nothing of the affair; but coming home, in Sadler's-wells fields, I heard something thrown away, and saw the light of a lantern; this was seven in the evening, the day after the robbery was committed. Coming along the field I looked by the side of the foot-path and saw a bundle; I went and kicked it; it was coppers and pans, and a tea-kettle, in a woman's apron; my wife took up the tea-kettle, and I took up the other things, and carried them to the Angel. Winter came by me just at the time with a blue apron about him, and there was a man, Casteldine I believe, was just by.</p>

The 23d of January, my husband and I coming by Sadler's-wells fields, about five yards from the Wells, we heard something fall. He said there were thieves. I said it was nothing but milk-pails. I thought it was milk-pails. Immediately two men run by us; I do not know who they were; coming further I saw a bundle, and picked it up. I told my husband I had got a tea-kettle; he picked up another bundle with several other things; it was dark; it was seven in the evening. There were two men just by, one of them ran against me, but I do not know who they were.</p>

I held my candle, and saw him move gently into the field. I held up my candle again, made towards him, and he ran away. I did not know who he was. I turned round, saw a sack, and found there was cheese in it. A man coming up, I asked him to help me to carry it to the Angel. There were seven cheeses and a half, a chissel, and a brass ladle in it with Mr. Bartholomew's name on it. I heard something rattle.

               <p>What time of the night was it when you was near the house kept by Mr. Browne? - I was coming by, I believe, about twenty minutes after twelve, and found the door open.</p>

               <p>At this time was there any appearance of fire? - There was no appearance at all of fire. I found his door open, and the key on the outside.</p>
               <p>Was the house open, or only the key on the outside. - The door stood a-jar, and the key was on the outside. I saw dirt in the entry.</p>
               <p>Did the door stand so much a-jar that you could look into the entry? - Not a great way; only about the space of a foot. I demanded<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177904040035"/> to know who was there; a man answered Browne.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body there before you asked who was there? - No; I did not see any body there. I called out before I saw anybody. The door was a-jar. A man answered me his name was Browne. Seeing the house dirty, as if the goods were removing, I said that would not do for me; I must see the master or mistress of the house. With that the man came to the door to me; he told me that he was the master of the house, and his name was Browne. I said, Sir, you will excuse my making myself so busy; but, finding the key on the outside, made me so particular to see the master of the house. He made answer again his name was Browne, and he was master of the house. I said the key was on the outside of the door. He said, is it? and seemed not to know it.</p>
               <p>Did you take any notice of the man? - Coming to the door, I observed he was a lusty man; he had a brown coat on loose. I did not take notice of the rest of his clothes, nor his face. I went to my brother watchman, and told him. He said, all as is you must mind there are no goods brought out of the house. I returned to my box again.</p>
               <p>How near was your box to his house? - Fifty or sixty yards from his house. - Going past the door, I struck my staff against the door, and it was fast. I looked up at the windows, and saw no light. I returned again in about twenty minutes, and the door was fast then, and I saw no light.</p>
               <p>Did you see anybody come out of that house? - Only Mr. Browne; he came out and locked the door, and bid me mind my own business.</p>
               <p>When was that? - The first time.</p>
               <p>Tell us how that was? when you told him the key was on the outside what did he do? - He came out, locked the door on the outside, and bid me mind my own business.</p>
               <p>Did you observe which way he went? - No; seeing he was a gentleman, I took no more notice.</p>
               <p>Did you observe his voice? - Yes; he had a course voice, spoke short, and seemed angry with me for making myself so busy.</p>
               <p>How soon after this was the alarm of fire? - It was mean half after two o'clock when I first heard the alarm of fire. The alarm was given when I was in my box. I came out and saw the flames above the houses.</p>
               <p>Which house did you see first on fire? - I cannot say; it was one of the houses near on the spot where I first spoke to Mr. Browne.</p>
               <p>When you first saw the house on fire was there any more than one house on fire? - I cannot say; I believe there was only one house on fire.</p>
               <p>How far was the front of this house from the back? - I cannot say; I never was in the house.</p>
               <p>How far is the back from the river? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was you before the justice when this matter was enquired into? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see anybody there charged with this offence? - I saw the man I spoke to, Browne.</p>
               <p>Is the prisoner the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you take any notice of his voice? - I took him to be the same man by his size and his voice.</p>
               <p>Did you take any other observation of his person to make you think he is the man? - I took no observation of his features.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Did you take any notice of his person that night? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you take notice of his features? - No.</p>
               <p>Then if two hundred men had assembled you could not have picked this man out? - No further than I thought he was the man by his size and voice.</p>

               <p>I am a waterman.</p>
               <p>Where was you the night of the fire? - On board a vessel called the Falcon. It lay on Mr. Smith's Quay, close to Mr. Browne's back door.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Browne's house? - Yes; vastly well.</p>
               <p>What did you observe first of that house? - A fire came out of the back side about ten minutes after two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Was you awake? - Yes; I was obliged to be awake to haul the ship too for the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177904040036"/> caulkers to work her next day. I was obliged to be up on account of the tide. About ten minutes after two o'clock the fire came out of the back premises of Mr. Browne's house.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by back premises? - The back warehouses.</p>
               <p>It runs a great depth from the street to the river? - Yes; I suppose near fifty feet.</p>
               <p>Are the warehouses timber buildings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The fire came out of those warehouses? - Yes; the lower part of the warehouses.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any fire any where else? - No; the fire was very small then; I suppose it was a tar-barrel on fire by the blackness of the smoke; there was a cloud of smoke as if it came from a tar-barrel.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>How many warehouses were there at the river-side, on this spot where the fire happened? - Every premise had warehouses.</p>
               <p>Did the warehouses and fronts join together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were there landing-places at the back of these warehouses? - Some warehouses have; but there is a wharf to the next house but one to this which was on fire.</p>
               <p>Who did the wharf belong to at the back of Browne's house? - There was no wharf there.</p>
               <p>Was there a communication from Browne's house to the river? - Yes; the back door, where he ships his goods. The water flows up quite to the house.</p>
               <p>You think the alarm was about ten minutes after two o'clock, what kind of a morning was it? - A very fine morning.</p>
               <p>Was it moonlight? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was in a situation that you could see the progress of the fire? - I was so nigh that it burnt the hat on my head, and the handkerchief on my neck.</p>
               <p>Did you stay on board the ship? - Yes, to endeavour to save it.</p>
               <p>Which way did it spread? - Next the grocer's took fire, then Smith's wharf, it is a sand wharf, and then the wind turned easterly. There was a squall of wind. It took upwards, towards the Hermitage, and burned both ways at once.</p>
               <p>Had you such an opportunity as to mark the course and progress of the fire, that you can speak with certainty to the place where it broke out. - Yes; I was obliged to clear the fire from the ship; it was on fire three times; my hat was burnt on my head, and my handkerchief on my neck.</p>

               <p>I am clerk to Mr. Hadden, cheesemonger. I was alarmed about twenty-five minutes after two, on the 16th of March. I was up when the alarm was given.</p>
               <p>Do you live at the next door to Browne's? - No; at the distance of eighteen or twenty houses. Not being in bed, I went down the street immediately with Mr. Mitchell, and some other gentlemen. I thought the fire was at Mr. Keating's, or Mr. Browne's premises. When I came there I was confirmed in it, for Mr. Keating was running out of his house in his shirt, (he is a grocer next door to Browne's) and there was a person throwing some bedding, or something out of a one-pair-of-stairs window. I observed the fire burning very rapidly backwards. I thought Mr. Hadden's house in danger.</p>
               <p>We do not want a history of the fire. Did you make any observation of Browne's House? - I could not tell where the fire began; it was at the back of the houses. I was alarmed for Mr. Browne's family. I recommended the door to be broke open; it was broke open, and I immediately went in, and endeavoured to alarm the family by calling Mr. Brown by name. A person told me I need not trouble myself, for Mr. Brown was removed to Bethnal-Green. Browne's house was very much on fire backwards.</p>
               <p>Was his house at last burnt down? - Yes; it was.</p>
               <p>Did you observe how it was furnished? - No; I did not.</p>
               <p>The fire had not caught the dwelling-house at that time? - No; I think not.</p>
               <p>

               <p>I was out in the street at the time the fire broke out. I went down to Mr. Browne's house, and saw the fire at the back part of it. I could not be certain whose house it was that was on fire then. When I had been there a little time, I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177904040037"/> the next door neighbour throw some things out of the house, sheets, and some other things. Thinking Mr. Browne was in danger and asleep. I broke the door open, and found the fire had made a great progress in the house; I suppose halfway into the house from the back part.</p>
               <p>Was there any other house on fire at that time? - Not that I could see.</p>
               <p>When you broke the door open could you see that the fire was confined to Mr. Browne's house? - I thought the fire began at his house, because it was burning in his house.</p>
               <p>You cannot say that it had reached other houses? - I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>Did you see any furniture in the house? - There was none that I saw; I cannot pretend to say whether there was or not; I did not take notice of that. When you first go in, there is a passage, and then a room. I did not go in; the fire had burned I dare say half way into the house.</p>

               <p>I live next door to Mr. Browne. I was alarmed about half after two o'clock, as near as I can recollect, and got up in my shirt and looked out at the back window, and saw a reflection of fire on the opposite ships. My warehouse was lower than Mr. Browne's, I could see over it. I ran forward; I saw no fire in the street; I went into the street and took an observation of the fire over Mr. Brown's house. I went back to my warehouse, which was not then on fire, but in three or four minutes after the fire burst through the side of it, next to Mr. Browne's; the blaze rose from Mr. Brown's warehouse, and over-topped mine; I saw there was danger. In about three minutes it struck into mine.</p>
               <p>Did the fire communicate to your warehouse from Mr. Brown's? - It did.</p>
               <p>How far is Mr. Browne's warehouse from his dwelling-house? - There is a communication between the dwelling-house and warehouse; the dwelling-house is brick, and the warehouse wood. I saw then I had no remedy left, not being insured. I stood some time amazed; I ran up stairs and called for assistance, and threw what I could out of the window.</p>
               <p>You cannot tell that the fire had not began beyond Mr. Browne's? - From the observation I made, I could not see that there was any fire beyond Mr. Browne's warehouse.</p>

               <p>Was Browne's house at this time, in your judgement, on fire? - There was not the least appearance of it.</p>

I locked the garden-gates. and went to bed. I waked him the next morning early; he looked out of the window in his shirt and night-cap, that was about six in the morning; there is a strong fence with spikes upon it.</p>

               <p>Is there no gap in the fence? - There was a gap but not big enough for a man to get through; a child might. Since he has been in custody the gap has been made bigger.</p>
               <p>How high are the pails? - About seven feet, with iron spikes on the top.</p>

             called me aside, and said, don't let me go alone, make a prisoner of Lambert. New then said to Lambert, you know we did rob the woman. Lambert absolutely denied it; New said, how can you deny it, when you have got the woman's stockings on your legs; she then flew in a great passion. The stockings were taken off by Dinmore. New told me to go to their lodgings, and she would show me some more of the property.</p>
               <p>Did they lodge in one room? - No. I went with New to her lodgings first, and she pulled a handkerchief from between the bed and the sacking.</p>
               <p>(The handkerchief was produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Redgrave. From thence she took me to Lambert's lodging, and in her room I found these clothes (producing them) I asked her if that was all; she said no; that the night they committed the robbery, they pawned an apron, at Mr. Low's on Clerkenwell-green.</p>
               <p>Who acknowledged this? - New. I asked her if there were any more things; she said yes, a shift and a flannel petticoat, pawned in Portpool-lane, about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before I took them, that Lambert had the woman's shift on, and pulled it off that morning to pawn it. I found these things at the pawnbroker's.</p>

I had given her warning to quit the lodging; when the time was up, she told me she was not provided, and I permitted her to stay a few days longer. On the fourth of March she left the lodging without saying any thing, and took the key with her. I waited a week to see if she would return; finding she did not return, I took a young man that works with me, and tried some keys I had in the house, and got the door open. When I got in, I found the bed cut to pieces, and the tick gone, and missed all the other things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them). On the Wednesday following I saw her in a stall near Gerard-street. I took her before a justice. She denied knowing any thing of the things, or pawning them; the justice ordered her to be searched, and duplicates were found upon her which led to the discovery of the things.</p>

I went and bid him bring the note to the office, he did, and it was delivered to me; I kept it a fortnight and advertised it, but nobody came to own it. The magistrates then asked me what I had done with it; I said nobody had owned it; they said I might go and get the money for it, and give it to the girls; I went and got the money, but before I delivered it, I advertised it twice more, and then the prosecutor's brother came and owned it.</p>

I got up and found my shop window had been burst open, and four joints of meat gone, with a linen cloth, which was marked; the meat was in a cloth in a tray, near the window; soon after the beadle of the parish came and told me that a boy had been stopped with a parcel of meat, which they thought had been stolen.

               <p>I am a publican. The prisoner drank some gin at my bar in the morning; she pulled a black silk handkerchief out of her bosom, and put it in again; presently after she pulled the handkerchief out again loose and cried out, murther, I am robbed! I asked her what she had been robbed of; she said three guineas which she had in her bosom; my maid put her hand down her bosom and found the three guineas, and gave it me to keep for her, as the woman was very drunk; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177904040048"/> next day she came for half a guinea, and gave the maid five shillings and sixpence, and five shillings to a man who she said stood by or she should have lost it all; that morning the prisoner came in, and said he had lost some money, but did not know who to suspect, as it was in a lodging house; I told him of the money the prisoner had.</p>

I charged him with robbing me the Saturday night before; but he denied it. I sent for a constable and then he said he had taken another pair, and if I would let him go, he would fetch them; I said it was too late then, and took him to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177904040049"/> the Rotation-Office; and the constable and I went and searched his room, and found the men's dressed shoes; he had blacked the heels where they wer e stitched, and worn them a day, I suppose; and we found likewise two pair of women's callimanco shoes.</p>

               <p>I went with the prisoner Penticross and his uncle to Walker's lodgings, and took him and the other prisoner. I searched the lodging, and found two patterns in the closet, and three in Walker's pocket. I then went and searched the lodging of Canton, but found nothing there. The next day I took them before a magistrate, and Penticross wanted to be an evidence; but would not say any thing till the other two were brought up. Then the magistrate said, he understood he was come voluntarily to offer himself as an evidence, and asked him what he had to say; he said, nothing at all, and refused to say any thing. Then they were all three ordered to the bar, and began to accuse one another. Penticross charged Walker with softening the iron crow, and bending it up with a hammer to break the house open. I went and tried the crow, and it fitted the mark where they had wrenched the window open.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. On the 21st of February, in the morning, the prisoner was brought to the watch-house by the prosecutor and two watchmen. The prosecutor said, she had robbed him. I desired her to return the man his money. She said, she had none of his money. I threatened to search her, and said, I knew I should find it. She then pulled out half a crown, and some halfpence. I asked where the guinea was; she said, she had none; I said, you know you have it in your shoe. I made her pull her shoe off, but found no guinea. I stroked my hand along her foot, and found it between her foot and her stocking. She begged his pardon, and hoped he would not prosecute her. She did not say any thing about the money she rather denied it all along.</p>

I took up her cloak, and saw some holes in it, on the left side in the lower part the cloak. I went to Vincent's house, and said to Vincent, what have you been doing? he said, that she had been breaking his windows; and he told her, if she did not keep away he would shoot her in the arse, that was his word directly; he said, she stood aggravating him, and he shot her; but he did not think of doing her any harm; and he said, that if he had killed her he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177904040052"/> would suffer for it; I told him, I must take him into custody as I am an officer; I hope you will not be angry with me about it; he said he could not help it; he was not angry with me.

When I came into the room, I saw her lying on her back on the bed just expiring; I enquired whether any thing had been done; they said, they attempted to give her some liquor, but she could not swallow it; she died soon after.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the body? - I did; I asked where the wound was; they showed it me, and turned her on her side; the wound was near the back, on the left side; I found two wounds between the loins and the ribs; first I examined it with a probe; then I passed my finger into the wounds; there were two deep penetrating wounds; they penetrated into the cavity of the body. I told them there could be nothing done for her, she was dying. The man came in and asked me if it was in my power to do any thing for her; I told him, no; he asked to kiss her; and the constable followed him and took him away.</p>
               <p>Did you afterwards examine the body? - No; I was before the coroner; I showed them the wounds.</p>
               <p>There was no thorough wound, as if a ball had passed? - No. After having my finger some time in the wound, I brought out the point part of a nail. The woman was then in the agonies of death. (The nail was produced in the court.) That was the occasion of her death.</p>

               <p>I live at North-End. On the 23d of March, about three o'clock or thereabouts, I cannot say precisely, I had an information brought me, that Vincent had shot Mrs. Dollard. I went immediately to Vincent's, and saw him in the garden, talking with one Mills. I went up to him, and said, Good God, Vincent! how could you do so? He made answer, he had shot her; but had no more intention to kill her than he had me that moment. He told me she had broke his windows, and aggravated him a good deal; that he did not know what to do with himself. I heard him say afterwards, that he had done it; and if he was to be hanged for it, he must be hanged for it.</p>
               <p>Did he say to you he had done it accidentally? - No.</p>

               <p>Coming on horseback by North-End, I saw a crowd of people; I enquired what it was; some children told me, that an old man had shot a woman; he came out, and said to me (I cannot repeat the exact words) he said, if he was to suffer for it he could not help it; but, if he had not shot her, she would have done him a mischief. I asked what she had done? He said, she had thrown brickbats at him, and broke his windows, and threw water at him. The people said they had lived together upon exceeding bad terms; that is the whole, as near as I can recollect. I was coming to town; as they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177904040055"/> did not seem very willing to take him; I hurried the constable away with him.</p>

               <p>When he said she had been throwing brickbats at him, did your lordship propose any question to him? - I did not; he seemed so very hardened. He said afterwards, he had no more intention of killing her than he had of killing me. Then he said he was only shooting at the gate.</p>

               <p>I was riding with Lord Seston and another gentleman on the North-End road, and observing a crowd at the door of a gardener, we rode up and enquired what was the matter; they informed us an old man had just shot a woman. My curiosity prompted me to get off my horse; I went into the house and saw the woman, I believe, nearly expiring. I got on my horse again. The prisoner came to the door; the crowd informed me that was the man that had done it. I asked him what could induce him to commit so horrid an action. As far as I can recollect, that was the purport of my question; he did not make any immediate answer, but began a detail of circumstances, that she had thrown water upon him in the night. I do not know that he alluded to the preceding night; that she had been breaking his windows that morning and throwing brickbats at him, and pointed to the wall where there were some brickbats; after that, he said he had no intention of killing her; and concluded by saying he was only shooting at the gate. That is the general purport of what he said. We staid till the woman was dead, and charged a constable with him.</p>

On the 16th of March, about half after twelve o'clock, the prisoner came to me to the watch-house, I was constable of the night; Hilliard was a brother constable, he seemed frightened and begged assistance to get the engine for he said his house was on fire, or he believed his house was on fire. Mr. Bagwell and I who were together in the watchouse, went immediately out and I went to Hilliard's lodging, and went up stairs. On the stairs there was a deal of smoke, but I saw no fire. Some watchmen followed me. I saw two women; I enquired of them where the fire was; they said they judged it to come from the chimney of the next house, where there had been men at work; I went immediately to the next house, which is Mr. Richards's, a publick house, knocked them up, and went in and examined, but there was no fire in that house. Bagwell did not go with me; he went to see for the engine. I did not see any fire in either of the houses.</p>

               <p>I lodged in the prisoner's house, in the second floor; he occupied the rest of the house; he lay on the first floor, which is a kitchen and room adjoining to it, and a closet on the landing-place of the stairs. On the 16th of March I went to bed at past twelve o'clock. I saw Hilliard pulling off his boots that night about nine. Before I went to bed I heard the closet door on the stairs open several times. His maid lay on the same floor with us; she came up to bed; she wished me a good night as she went past; I went to bed and fell asleep; I was waked by Hilliard coming up stairs; he called Molly, Molly, the house is on fire, get up directly; it was a voice neither whispering nor very loud. This alarmed me very much; I wakened my husband, and got up and opened the door. Hilliard was just then gone down; when I opened the door the fire poured into the room. Two watchmen came up and went into my room, seeing all safe there, they went down again; I followed them; as I was going past the closet, I felt some heat come to my face; I looked up and saw a flame of fire in this closet; I called the watchmen back, and one of them struck his staff against the door. Mr. Atkins came and searched for the key, but could not find it, the maid said her master had the key; I desired him to break it open; I ran up stairs, and when I returned it was broken open. I had seen some time before a link and a piece in a place, as I came out of the cellar; they had been there I believe three weeks, I think I missed them that night.</p>
               <p>(On her cross examination she said he was a fire-porter, had been called out to a fire; that the construction she put upon it was that the links were to light him upon those occasions.)</p>

               <p>I live next door to the prisoner. On the 16th of March, between twelve and one in the night I was alarmed by a knocking at the door and cry of fire. I got up and went into Hilliard's house; I went up stairs, and the cloud of smoke was ready to drive me backwards; the flames were coming out at the lattice over the pantry door on the stairs; I enquired for the key, but it could not be found; I set my shoulder to the door and drove in the top, so that I could put in part of my body. Within the closet there was a cupboard; the door was open I put my hand to the door and pulled it down; the flames were coming out of that cupboard; there was a fort of pitch barrel on fire in that cupboard, it was burnt quite through; I laid hold of it and it fell to pieces. I ran down stairs with the hoops and bottom all on fire; it burnt me very much; I thought there was certainly some bad intent, for it appeared by the smell to have kitchen-stuff in it; it ran over my hands; the door of the cupboard was very much burnt; there was a person there very active, so that it was soon all out.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177904040057"/>The flames came through the lattice; I pulled a piece of the lattice down; I believe it had been in a blaze; the lattice was up at the cieling, over the door; the cupboard went up to the cieling near the lattice; the cupboard had no top. There is some timber worked into the wall an inch and an half thick, and appears to have been there ever since the house was built; there is a piece of bead runs up by the ceiling that appears to me to have been on fire; there is a piece of yellow wood nailed to the joist (I have worked in the wood manufactory, and know the nature of yellow wood) that appears to me to have been on a blaze.</p>
               <p>What did you do with the bottom of the tub? - Put it into a tub of water; Washington has it here now; that tub was about ten or fourteen inches high.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did you see any fire any where but in that cupboard? - I saw the flames come through the lattice; I call the lattice on fire when I see the flames come through it. I saw the door of the cupboard on fire, and I really believe the lattice to have been on fire.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the lattice appear black afterwards, as if it was burnt? - Yes, it appeared to be burnt.</p>
               <p>Is the plaister about this cupboard finished? - Yes, I think it is.</p>
               <p>Do you think the cupboard was put up since the plaister was finished? - No; I apprehend the plaister was finished after the cupboard was put up.</p>

               <p>On the 16th of March, about half after twelve, as I was coming home, I met the prisoner coming very fast towards me; he went and opened St. Mildred's church; he seemed very much agitated; he said there was a fire in Bird-and-Hand Court; I went to the prisoner's house and went up stairs; upon the stairs I met Atkins with the bottom of the tub all on fire; I went up to the closet and saw some of the combustible stuff still burning on the shelf; I got some water and extinguished it; I turned and saw the prisoner standing by me; I desired him to assist and wet the ceiling, which was very hot; he was very diligent and did every thing in his power.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a carpenter. On the 23d of last month, I was at Guildhall; the prisoner was under examination for the last time; the alderman desired me to go and take a survey of the building, and give my opinion of it. Here is a plan of the place (producing it) it appeared to me that the closet where the cupboard was fixed was a part of the house, erected before the house was inhabited, as a proof of it I cut off a piece of the rail that goes over the lattice, up to the cieling. I believe that had been on fire (producing it); several persons have seen it; it has been rubbed, it was like a coal when I first had it. Here is a piece of board (producing it) that was nailed up under the joist to fix one part of the cupboard to; it appears to me to have been on fire. Here is a piece of the lattice work that was over the door, it was very black, I could not perceive that it had been burnt. In the side of the cupboard there was a cavity where the flame drew; here is a piece of the jam lining of the window, which appears to have been burnt. The cupboard appears to me plainly to be a fixture; the sides of the cupboard are the walls of the closet, and the top is the cieling. It was never meant, I am persuaded, to be pulled down.</p>
               <p>Was the cupboard burnt at all? - Yes; here is the door (producing it); the size of it is two feet four by one foot six.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Was any part of the lattice burnt? - No; but here is, what is more material, a piece of the bead of the cieling which is burnt.</p>
               <p>Is the cupboard an entire thing, put up at once? - I think it was put up bit by bit, first the bottom, then the door.</p>
               <p>Does the bottom consist of two or more pieces? - I do not know, it is painted; there may be twenty pieces glued together for what I know.</p>
               <p>Was not the bottom some of it painted and some not painted? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Do you believe the cieling to be finished before or after the cupboard and closet were put up? - I believe the cieling was finished<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177904040058"/> after the closet was put up; I cannot say as to the cupboard.</p>
               <p>Mr. STREET sworn.</p>
               <p>On Friday the 19th of March about twelve o'clock, Mr. Watts and Mr. Burford came to our house, and told us that Hilliard had confessed. We went to the house of one Osbourn, where the prisoner then lived, Deputy Smith went with us. We found the prisoner sitting by the fire. Deputy Smith asked him what could induce him to to be guilty of that horrid action of setting fire to his house; he did not immediately make answer; I believe the question was repeated to him two or three times, I cannot say how often; he then said that the devil had walked up and down with him for a fortnight or three weeks past; that it was to burn the lodgers out; that they should not stay any longer in the house than himself. A constable was then charged with him, and he was taken to the Compter. I went to him in the Compter and enquired what he had done with the key of the closet-door. I told him I had heard that he threw it in the cellar, but had been looking, and could not find it. He then said that he threw it the next day behind a bottle-rack in the cellar of Mr. Wenman, where he had occasionally worked as porter. Mr. Burford, I, and my porter went to Mr. Wenman's and searched and found the key, and went and tried it to the closet door, and it opened the lock.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Was there any magistrate attending, or any thing taken down in writing? - No.</p>
               <p>Was there any threat or promise made use of to obtain this confession? - No; I was particularly careful of that.</p>

I called for a pennyworth of purl and a halfpenny-worth of gin; the prisoners were there at supper; I had sevenpence halfpenny in my hand and my apron. I put down the money on the table to tie my apron on. Williams took up the halfpence; I desired him to give them me again, and the other prisoner came and took my apron, and they both ran out of the house. I am certain the prisoners are the persons.</p>

               <p>This woman came in in liquor, and wanted to join our company; we would have nothing to say to her; she picked a quarrel, and began beating this young man.

I took Wilson to the watch-house, and told the constable what had happened; he searched her, but found no watch upon her. I described the other prisoner, and Ashmore, Martin, and I went after her; we could not find her, but got intelligence of her name. While we were gone, she came with another woman to the watch-house, and Roberts the constable, from the description I had given of her, suspected her, and stopped them both. When I came back to the watch-house, I saw her and knew her. She had changed her hat and cloak with the other woman; but when she stood up, and I saw her face, I was positive to her. I never found my watch again. I am positive to the persons of the prisoners, I had seen them several times before in the street, and know them.

When they had robbed me, they went out, and I went home. I went to Payne the constable, and he desired me to come to him at ten the next morning; I did, and we went to the house and saw five or six women sitting; Payne asked me if I knew any of them; I said no, only one, which was the woman who had the knife. Payne locked the door, and went up stairs, where he found the two prisoners, one in bed, and the other standing by the door; I told him the woman that stood by the door was one of them; he made the other get up, and when I saw her, I told him that was the other, and we secured them. When we came down, the other had made her escape out of the window.</p>

               <p>On the 18th of January, I went out, between ten and eleven o'clock; I returned between three and four o'clock. When I returned, I found three or four letters on my table, which my servants said they received by the penny-post; this was one of the letters. Upon observing this letter, I thought there appeared to be an attempt to disguise the hand; and being satisfied it was the manner of the prisoner's doing his business at the custom-house. I indorsed it, as coming from him, and put the day of the month on it on which I received it.</p>
               <p>You are one of the Commissioners of the Custom-house? - Yes; the prisoner was employed in 1775, and in the year 1776.</p>

               <p>Counsel for the Crown.</p>
               <p>Explain what you mean by it not being disguised to you. - From being well acquainted with his hand, there may be some strokes disguised; but I have seen so much of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177904040063"/> his writing, I cannot have the least doubt of its being his. ( Shown two other letters.)</p>
               <p>Are those his hand-writing? - Yes; I am satisfied they are both his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How often have you seen me write? - I suppose more than ten times; he has wrote more than ten memorials to the Treasury in my office.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Whether you have never said the letter was disguised or appeared to you to be disguised? - There are some strokes written with a larger pen.</p>
               <p>Have you or not said before a magistrate, that the letter was disguised? - I do not recollect that I have; to the best of my knowledge I never did say so.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown.</p>
               <p>You said it was not disguised to you? - There are particular strokes appear to me to be written with a different pen from what the other letters are written with; and some of the capitals are made in a different manner from his usual writing, but not sufficient to disguise it.</p>

I now earnestly intreat you to take my hard case into consideration, settle my accounts, and pay my just balance, according to your promise, as I call God to witness. When you inforced my acceptance of the command of the Charlotte, the very gross behaviour of you to me for doing a just duty, has so alarmed many men where it has undergone the least examination, that, as sollicitor for my children, anxious to procure justice for them, will follow this matter with the uttermost attention. I desire you will immediately get the account settled, that my children and I may obtain the most speedy justice. Sir, you should know, as this is become a family-concern, that address and despath in these matters will be required of you. I hope and trust, by the first convenience, to have your answer. Believe me, Sir,</p>

               <p>I am porter to Mr. Langdale at Holborn-bridge. On the 29th of February I lost a cask of gin out of my cart in <placeName id="t17790404-46-crimeloc272">Skinners street</placeName>

               <p>- LANGSDALE sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 27th of February we sent a cask of gin by the last witness to Mr. Payne in Shoreditch; when he returned he said he had lost the cask; when it was found it had part of the name of Payne upon it, and the gauge mark which answered to the book.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I bought the cask in Sun-street with a washing-tub; there were several persons saw me buy them but they are not here; I did not think my tryal would come on to night.</p>
               <p>Langsdale. He made the same defence before the magistrate, and said he would prove it at his tryal.</p>

His wife and he have a room in the gallery. It was within a few minutes of one when he went to bed. I helped to get him up with his wife. He lived in the same gallery with me.</p>

He was out of employ, and his wife worked to support him. When he took the lodging he asked to have a key to let himself in. He said he might be kept out late. I told him I would not suffer any body to have a key, but ostler, and the person who keeps the tap. I told him I was generally up till one, and would let him in; if he came after that time, had rung the bell, he should be let in. I did not see him that night; but, when they were getting him up to bed, I heard somebody say to his wife they did not think he would swear in. His wife said he would swear as well as others when he was a little in liquor.</p>
               <p>What time was that? - It might be between eleven and twelve, or after twelve; cannot say.</p>

Once, when I had put in a number of halfpence that covered three silver-spoons, the next morning I found them very bare, which raised my suspicion that I was robbed, and that the robber was in my house. I went to a friend, an optical-instrument maker, and got him to mark twenty-four pennyworth of halfpence with a mark on the head of the Britannia; those halfpence I put into the till, among a great many more. The next morning I missed seventeen pence. I suspected that my boy, the prisoner, was the person who stole them; but, to be certain of it, I sent for

            , and told him my suspicions. We agreed that the boy should be sent to his house that morning with a quartern of gin, and Tanner was to give the boy sixpence to change, in order to discover whether the boy had any of the marked halfpence in his possession. He took the gin, and gave Tanner seven halfpence in change, among which was one of the marked ones. I then sent for a constable, and charged him with robbing me. He said, I rob you! what do you mean! Do you want to take away my character? We asked him for the key of his box; he pulled out another key by mistake, which he endeavoured to conceal. The constable took it from him, tried it, and found it would open my till as well as my key. We went and searched his box, and found a guinea in gold, five pounds nineteen shillings in silver, two shillings worth of halfpence, and a medal which I kept in my till.</p>
