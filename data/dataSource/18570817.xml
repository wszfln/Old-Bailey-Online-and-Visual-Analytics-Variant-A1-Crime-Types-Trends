                  </hi>. I am warehouse clerk to Messrs. Bruschner and Henrichson, sugar refiners, St. George's in the East. On 6th May I deli<lb/>vered to Johnson's cart twenty tittlers, or loaves of sugar; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the order upon which I delivered them—it was brought by one of Johnson's carmen, as far as I know; I did not take it in myself; I was at the scale—I delivered the tittlers according to this order—they were part of a quantity, belonging to Messrs. Cooper and Co., that we had in our warehouse.</p>

L."—they had on the white cover in which they went from us, and a blue paper over it; that blue paper had been put on since I saw them—the number "11" was on the bottom of each of the tittlers that I sent—it was on the sugar, and on the paper too—the three I saw at Chamberlain's Wharf had the number scraped out, except that one was more intelligible than the other—the number was still on the white paper as I had left it.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">for Ryder Durant</hi>). <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The mark you speak of is on the base of the tittler, is it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—they would not get rubbed or made dirty by being moved about the warehouse—they are wrapped in paper—they are not wrapped up the moment they are completed—they are knocked out of the moulds one day, and are papered the next—the marks are put on while they are in the mould—if the bottoms get dirty they would be re-scraped, but they would not get dirty; they are concave—this is one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the bottom does not come in contact with the ground at all—the "11" means the day's work—they are numbered according to the day's work—there is a trace of the "11" at the bottom of this—it is made with a hook.</p>

Harrison was in my employment from 1851, as a kind of foreman porter in the fruit and refined floor—the sugar would be in his department—I had made a purchase of a large quantity of sugar of Bruschner and Co., previous to 5th May—the contract was in writing—this is the contract note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I purchased 883 tittlers—when we purchase we leave the tittlers in the refiner's hands until we want them—it would be Harrison's duty to write orders for them, as they were sold—he had nothing to do with the selling—I have the delivery order book here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—these orders are printed with blanks, and with counterfoils—it would be his duty to write the order, filling in the blanks, and to fill in the counterfoil to correspond—this produced is one of the forms—there is no counterfoil corresponding with it—there is a counterfoil bearing the same number—this is in Harrison's writing—(<hi rend="italic">this, being read, was an order for raisins</hi>)—this does not refer to any transaction for sugar—there is nothing that corresponds with the tittlers in the counterfoil—I attend to the business myself—I had given no authority for any such order as this, the goods not being sold—if this had been a regular transaction it would have been Har<lb/>rison's duty to make an entry in his warehouse book previous to writing the order—I have the warehouse book here—I have searched it—I find no entry at all of the transaction to which this order refers—Roger Durant was in my service from Oct., 1854, till 2nd March, 1857—he would have an opportunity of becoming acquainted with our course of business—he gave notice to leave, and left on his own account—during the time he was in our service we had a customer of the name of Mitchell—Roger Durant introduced his name to our firm as a customer—his place of business was first in Noble Street, and then in Lillypot Lane—when Roger Durant was about to leave our service, I asked him who this Mitchell was; he said he</p>

               <p>was a respectable person—I then pressed him further as to who he was, and he said he was a brother-in-law, or a distant relation; I asked him what distant relation he was; he said he had married a sister of his; I said, "Then the distant relation is a brother-in-law?"—I made an entry that we had a reference at the time; we have a book in which entries are made of references given by customers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this entry is in Roger's writing: "Wm. Mitchell, of Lillypot Lane, refers us to Messrs. Saunders, Cannon Street, who inform us, since he has dealt with them he has always paid regularly, and from what they have seen of him, they believe him to be a respectable man"—that is dated 2nd March, 1857—that was the day he left—he had told me some time previously that he had got a reference—I requested him to make the entry, and I refused to settle with him that day until he had made it—he did not make it in my presence, he brought it to me with the entry made.</p>

On 22nd May I received this order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was brought by Johnson's cart—I wrote something on it, and returned it to the person who brought it—he afterwards brought it back to me—Harrison accompanied him—I know Harrison's handwriting—I believe this is his signature on the order for the delivery of forty tittlers—I wrote on it, "Please say blue or white paper"—he said, "Always deliver goods in white paper, unless we say 'blue' on the order"—at that time we had a quantity of sugar tittlers, the property of Cooper and Co.—I delivered the forty tittlers in white paper—(<hi rend="italic">The order for forty tittlers, marked "R. A. T" and signed "C. Harrison"</hi>)—the mark "R. A. T." was on the white paper, and on the bottom of the sugar loaves</p>

               <p>themselves was "85," with a stroke under it—we prepare a weight note on these occasions, after weighing—we gave Mr. Cooper's weight note to Harrison, and the carman's weight note was put into the scale—the note that I gave Harrison, was for forty tittlers, marked "R. A. T." and "85"—I have since been to Chamberlain's Wharf, and seen about thirty tittlers there, which I believe to be part of what I delivered on that day—I found the marks "R. A. T." on them—I examined the bottoms of them; there were no marks at all there—they had the appearance of having been scraped or rubbed—there was then blue paper over the white—on 19th May I delivered two lots of fifty tittlers from Mr. Cooper's stock, and sent them to Mr. Cooper's—this note of those two parcels is in my handwriting—there has been a "40" added to it—that is not in my handwriting, nor written by my authority—I know nothing at all about it—I do not know whose handwriting it is.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 8, Ponsonby Place, Vauxhall Bridge Road. I am in the employ of the two Durants, in Lillypot Lane—I know Harrison; I have seen him there—I went into the service in Nov. last—they carried on the business of wholesale grocers—I was there on 22nd May when forty tittlers of sugar were brought by Johnson's cart—I assisted in unloading them—they were placed in the warehouse—Ryder Durant was there at the time—I did not notice whether any invoice came with them—they were in white paper—part of them were afterwards removed to Chamberlain's Wharf—I cannot say the exact number—they were placed with some other tittlers that were in the warehouse—I think thirty-five of them went to Chamberlain's Wharf—I believe I was there when twenty came on 6th May—I cannot say whether any of those went with the thirty-five—I directed the carman where to take them—Ryder Durant had desired me to do so—I do not know where Roger Durant was at this time—I went with them to Chamberlain's Wharf—two packed bags were also taken, containing sundry articles of grocery—they were directed to R. Attwell, No. 95, Lower Union Street, Torquay; 25: 5: 57 (<hi rend="italic">looking at a card</hi>)—this is Roger Durant's writing—I did not see him write it—I put it on the bag; it lay on the counter—I cannot say who put it there—Roger Durant was there that day, and he was there when I went away with the things—both of them were—the sugars were directed "R. A.," with a "T." under it—one of them was directed the same as the card—I was directed to put the card on the bag by one of the Durants; I cannot say which, they were both there—I believe they were partners in this concern—I attended the first examination at Guildhall on 10th June—Ryder Durant said something to me after that about the partnership—he said he was going to be a working partner—he was saying so to some friends there, he was not addressing me particularly—I heard it—what he said was, that he was going to be a working partner with his brother—that was before I had been examined, I believe; I cannot recollect—I remember asking for an alteration to be made in my evidence after that had been said to me, so it must have been after I was examined—it was in consequence of that being said that I requested to alter my evidence—I took a receiving note with me to Chamberlain's Wharf—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—one of the Durants gave it me, I cannot say which—(<hi rend="italic">This was a bill headed, "Debtor to W.

                  </hi>. I am one of the detective officers of the City of London. Harrison was taken into custody en this charge on 29th May—on the following day I went to Durants' place, in Lillypot Lane—I saw Ryder Durant, and asked him if he was Mr. Durant—he said, "Yes"—I asked him which, Mr. Ryder or Mr. Roger; he said, "Mr. Ryder"—I asked him when Mr. Roger would be there; he said he did not know, for he was at Plymouth—I then told him that I and Scott, who was with me, were detective officers, and we should like to speak to him; he then asked us into a back room, and I asked him to show us the invoice of the last transac<lb/>tion that he had with Mr. Cooper, of Monument Yard—he went into the front shop, and brought out one of Mr. Cooper's invoices for some tea—I then told him I wanted to see the file; he went into the front shop, and brought in a file containing a number of invoices—Scott then said, "We want to see the invoices of the transactions yon have had with Mr. Cooper for tittlers"—he said, "We have not had any tittlers of Mr. Cooper; we have had our tittlers of sugar from Mr. Turnbull"—he produced one number of Mr. Turnbull's invoices for sugar—I said, "Perhaps you will show me the invoices of the transactions you have had with Harrison for tittlers"—he said, "My brother is the buyer, and I do not know what transactions he has with Harrison"—I said, "Why, you are in partnership with your brother?"—he said, "Yes, I am, I have been in partnership three or four weeks, and if you like I can show you the partnership deeds"—I told him I did not want to see the deeds, but I said, "As you are in partnership with your brother, if he has bought any tittlers, or had any transactions with Harrison, your books will show it, and you would have invoices"—he said, "Certainly; but I know there is no entry in our books of any transactions with Harrison for tittlers"—he then said that he would write to his brother by the next mail, and we were to call on the Monday</p>

               <p>morning—I did call on the following Monday, and saw him—he said he had had no answer—he then opened a book at the counter, and said, "Harrison owes us 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—I called on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, and on Friday Scott and I called, and he said he had not heard—I told him it was very curious that he had not heard at all, and he said, "Well now, Mr. Webb, what is it you want with my brother?"—I said, "The ends of justice require that I should see him, to put a few questions to him"—he said, "Well, the fact of it is, if you want him, you must go and find him"—I noticed the name of Roger Durant and Co. over the door in Lillypot Lane at this time—I went on 16th June, and that name was then erased, and the name of William Mitchell put—I produce two letters, which I received from Chamberlain's Wharf.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I live at Mr. Edward Law<lb/>ford's, Victoria Terrace—I met the prisoner at a public house about 10 o'clock at night, on 28th June—there were three or four girls there, they mixed themselves in our company, and there was an old woman there; I think, perhaps, she was the mother—the prisoner spoke very lovingly to me—when we went out we were making love, and I asked her to go and sleep with me at her house—she said, "Yes," very willingly, but she had not got the key of her house to take me home—I said, "I am not going to sleep in the street; I shall not allow you to sleep in the street, you may come and sleep with me if you like"—I went with her, arm in arm, to my own door, in Victoria Terrace—having entered the house, I felt myself tired—the prisoner said she was not well—I gave her a glass of water—she took off her upper dress—I was so fatigued that while undressing myself I tumbled into my bed—the prisoner was then sitting down with a glass of water in her hand—I got up again, and took the key out of the lock of the door, and put it in the pocket of an old coat that was hanging up—the prisoner did not lie down on the bed when I went to bed, she was sitting still—I went to sleep, and I awoke in the morning about 6 o'clock—I looked about, and said, "I had a woman here last night, what has become of her?"—I found my watch was gone, and a coat and waistcoat, and a <hi rend="italic">porte mon<lb/>naie</hi>—I went to my friend, and went with him to the police station, and took a policeman to my house—when I went with the prisoner to my house, my friend Charles was with me—he wished us good night at the door—no other woman went with me to the house—I think I saw the prisoner once afterwards at her mother's, but she hid herself when she saw me—I know the prisoner is the woman—I knew her four or five weeks before—I had nothing to say to her, only shaking hands—after the policeman took her I saw her at the station—I have never said that I believed she was not the woman—I recognised her immediately—I knew her mother after the theft—they were together at the public house that night—the mother had been drinking with us, but I think she had left before we went away—she did not accompany us.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Were you not talking with another young woman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is possible—you and your mother came into the public house after I was there—I changed a sovereign at the public house that evening.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> You had another friend with you, a man; and that man gave your son the key to go home? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the boy went away, but my friend went away in company with you and I—you did not leave me talking with three other women when you went home with your mother—I swear I had known you before, by shaking hands with you in the tap room of Mr. Smith's public house five or six times.</p>

I did not observe anything on that Saturday night, but on the Sunday morning, between 2 and half past 2 o'clock, I heard the breaking the lock of the door which awoke me, and then I heard a person walking along the passage, and go out and shut the street door, and pass by the window—it</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> She came to the police station, and there was another young woman there for something, and she asked the prosecutor whether it was me or the other young woman; she did not know which; she has gone by another name; the prosecutor pointed me out to her, and she said at the public house that she was sorry he had not told her more, for she would swear anything; she said her landlady was always finding fault with her for speaking to Basten, but she always would, and she drank with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Cowley Manor Farm, and am foreman to Mr. Charles Webster, a farmer, there. On a farm at Hillingdon he had a rick of clover hay—on Friday, the 24th, I saw Baker come after a load of hay—he took a load, and paid me the money, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said, "Can I have a load on Monday morning?"—I said, "I can't give any answer before I see Medler, and I will let you know on Saturday night by one of the men;" I forgot it then, and sent word on Sunday afternoon—I did not speak to Baker himself with regard to it—on Saturday evening I told Medler we wanted a load of hay cut for Baker on Monday morning, and asked him what time he would get it ready; he said it should be ready by half past 9 or 10 o'clock—I said, "Very well, I will send word to him that it shall be ready by 10;" he said, "By 10 it shall be all ready"—on Mon­day morning, about 7 o'clock, I went to the clover hayrick—Medler was there, and his two brothers with him—they were not engaged by me—I said, "Has any one been here this morning?"—he said, "Oh, yes, he has been here"—I said, "Has he taken any hay away with him?"—he said, "No"—"Well," I said, "where has he gone to"—he said, "To one of the mills; either Mr. Randall's or Mr. Austin's"—I said, "The track of the cart went the other way"—"Well," he said, "I do not know where he has gone to, but he told me he was going to one of the mills"—I understood him to be speaking of Baker—he said, "He will be here again between 9 and 10, but I do not know whether he will have one load or two this morning"—I went and looked round the rick—I asked him whether any hay had been taken away that morning—he said, "No"—after this conver<lb/>sation I went out into the road, and made inquiries—I fancied I could trace Baker's cart—I went down to West Drayton—that was quite a con<lb/>trary way to Mr. Austin's or Mr. Randall's mills—when I got to West</p>

               <p>Drayton, I went to a barn there, about fifty or sixty yards from Baker's house, on the opposite side of the road—I found his cart standing by the side of the barn door, backed in, and a load of hay on it—I do not know whether Baker's name was on the cart; I know it was his horse and cart—it was clover hay—I looked round it—I fancied it was our hay, by its being made lighter than hay in general—I believe it to be my master's—it looked as if it had not been cut long—I went back to the hayrick about half past 9 o'clock, Medler and his brothers were still there—"Now," I said, "Medler, has any one been here this morning, and fetched any hay away?"—he said, "No"—I said, "I know they have"—he said, "Yes, they have had half a load away"—I said, "Yes, Medler, and a load; for I have been down to Drayton, and seen a load standing on Baker's cart"—he made some reply; I do not justly know what—I went away down the road, and met Baker coming up from Drayton with the cart and horse—I said, "Halloo! what, are you coming after your load of hay?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Have you seen any reapers about this morning?"—he said, "No, I have not seen any countrymen at all"—I got up into his eart, which was empty; I rode along in it towards the rick; "Now," I said, "Mr. Baker, you may as well pay me for this load of hay, for I want to go to Uxbridge, and this is my nearest way"—he said, "Yes," stopped his horse, and pulled out the money, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and gave it to me—I said, "Now, Mr. Baker, this is for this load of hay you are going now to fetch from the rick"—he said, "Yes"—"Well," I said, "let us see, how many loads have you had before?"—he said, "Three loads and three quarters"—I said, "You have paid for all you have had before?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "You have not fetched a load before this morning?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Nor yet your horse and cart?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Now, Mr. Baker, I know you have; for I have been down to Drayton, and seen a load stand<lb/>ing on your cart"—he said, "Yes, I have; and I would sooner pay for it than have any bother about it"—I said, "No, I can't do that; you must go to Mr. Webster, my master"—he had paid me for the three loads and three quarters—the price was agreed upon before—he was to have ten loads out of the rick, at 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per load—I took him to Mr. Webster's, and told Mr. Webster, in his presence, what had occurred—Mr. Webster said he should not have anything to do with it; he should see the Magistrate—Baker said, "I hope you will look over it, Sir, for I have a wife and three little children at home"—he was given into custody—I afterwards went back to Medler, and took him to the policeman—he said he would go with me; he did not know anything that he was going for—I afterwards examined the hay that had been on Baker's cart—there were thirty-six trusses there—we weighed them all—the proper weight of a truss is 56 lbs.—they were over weight—I did not keep an account of the weight; that was left to the policeman—I saw them weighed—there were two the right weight, and all the others were over—there were two or three that weighed 64 lbs.—Medler binds all Mr. Webster's hay; he is an experienced man; he keeps a weighing machine of his own, and brings it with him—it was there on the morning of 27th July.</p>

Roberts on it—this is the note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said I thought I had not sufficient silver in the house to give him the full change, and I must send out to get it—he said, "Oh, don't do that; give me what you have, and send the silver with the medicine;" so I gave him the four sovereigns, and sent the remainder of the change with the medicine—I paid the note away the same evening; it was returned to me a few days after­wards, as forged.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a water proofer. In March last I worked for the prisoner, at No. 25, Little Alie Street, Whitechapel—I was at work there on Sunday, 15th March, in the back room second floor—there are only two floors to the house—there were more workpeople in the front room belonging to Mr. Sterne—he also occupied a parlour and bedroom on the first floor—a little before 7 o'clock I went down stairs, and saw the prisoner going up stairs—I asked him for a candle to finish my work—he gave me one in one of the little ornaments that was standing on the mantelpiece—I told him the candle would not hold in that, and I did not like to take it—he said, "Never mind, you have not got much to finish," and I took it—I left him in the first floor—I went up stain into the back room again, and put the candle on the table—I went down stairs again directly to a man named Randall, who occupies a rag shop at the bottom—I found him sitting in the back room on the first floor—by the first floor I mean the ground floor—he is in the employment of a person there—as I was going down to him, I saw the prisoner going up stairs—he went up to the back room on the second floor—I did not stop down stairs above two minutes—I then went up into the front room second floor—I remained there about ten minutes—I went out with Mark Robinson, and saw that the door of the back room was shut, and we noticed a light from the bottom of the door—we opened the door, and hallooed out "Fire!" directly—I saw a lot of India rubber cuttings burning on the ground, and a solution pot, with about fifteen or twenty pounds of solution, burning as well—that is an India rubber solution for the purpose of making coats—it was standing on the ground, burning—I saw no fire in any other place—the candle was lying on the ground, <hi rend="italic">outed</hi>—I directly gave an alarm of "Fire!" and, with the assistance of Randall, it was <hi rend="italic">outed</hi>—he brought up some blankets—it was completely put out—we looked round in every corner—Robinson had been at work in the front room second floor all day—the India rubber cuttings that I saw burning were lying about the room, about half way down it, not under the table—they were lying, some pieces here and some there, over half the room—after we had put the fire out, we all went down stairs—there was Robinson, Greenbow, Randall, Mrs. Levine, and her daughter, and two sons and a young man named Goldberg—while we were there, the prisoner came into the passage from the street—he asked, "What is this smoke here for?"—we told him there had been a fire—he said, "Is there anything damaged, anything burnt?"—we said, "No; there is nothing burnt, but the pieces of cutting and the solution"—he sent for a pot of beer; and while</p>

               <p>the workpeople were drinking it down stairs, the prisoner and I went up stairs to Bee what was burnt—as we were going up stairs, he said, "Joseph, you have ruined me"—I said, "Why?"—he said, "You had no business to out the fire"—I said, "I could not help it; I was not going to leave the house burning;" and I showed him my hand, which was burnt—we went into the back room second floor—he said to me, "Go, I do not want you any more; I shall never give you a bit of work any more"—I took the handle of the door in my hand to open it, to go out, and I saw him with a candle alight in his hand—I saw him stooping down with the candle to one waterproof coat, and then to another—he looked at me and smiled, and said, "Joseph, for God's sake, don't you speak a word about it; if you do, I will transport you"—I only saw him hold the candle to two coats, and then I went down stairs directly—I saw the coats alight—I was afraid to stop up stairs any more—I went down to the passage, and saw Robinson and Greenbow, and told them all to come up, and all of us went up—I found the prisoner standing at the front room, with his arms <hi rend="italic">a-kimbo</hi>, whistling, looking out through the doorway of the front room—when he heard us coming up, he turned round, and went and stood near the stairs, with his hand on the landing, very near the back room door, and he would not let us go into the back room—Randall fetched up some more blankets, but the prisoner would not let him go in—I could see the fire in the back room at that time—I opened the door—he would not let us go in, and we went down stairs, and hallooed out, "Fire!"—the engine came shortly afterwards—when he told me that I should not out the fire, he said he was insured—that was after telling me that I had ruined him—he said, "You should not out the fire; I am insured; I can get money for it."</p>

On 15th March I was residing at No. 21, Little Alie Street, with my mother—we lived in the lower part of the house—Sterne lived on the second floor—about half past 7 o'clock in the evening, I remember hearing a cry of "Fire!"—I went up into the back room second floor—I did not go right into the room—I saw into it, and saw a large pot on fire—it was just in the room door, on the right hand side, on the floor, against the wall—it blazed up high—I went and got some blankets, and wetted them in a tank, put them over the pot, and put out the fire—there was no fire in any other part of the room—I opened the window, and let out the smoke—at the time I left the room I know and could see there was no fire whatever in it—I then went down stairs—I met Sterne coming in at the street door—I told him there had been a fire up stairs—he first of all said something in his own language to his own people, then he said that I had no business to put it out, he was insured—he sent for some beer, and several of us drank of it; that was in the first floor front room—he remained there about five minutes before he left the room—I saw him leave it; I did not notice anything in his hand—I heard him going up stairs, he was up stairs about five minutes—he called me, and I went up; he was standing against the front room door; the back room door was shut; he said his things were all spoiled—he then came down stairs again—he stayed in the front room a few minutes, and then he went up stairs again; he remained there between five or ten minutes, and then he called me up again—he said, "Let us see if the fire is all out"—I had just got to the top of the stairs, when he said that—the back room door was shut—I followed him into the front room; he had a candle in his hand, and he went in, and looked round the room—we could not see any fire in the front room—he came out, and opened the back room door, and said, "The room is all in flames"—I saw that it was so; some coats were on fire, hanging up against the fireplace—that was about a yard from the pot that I had previously seen—I immediately ran down, and fetched up the blankets again that I had previously used; when I came up again, Sterne was standing against the top of the stairs—he pushed me back, and said I should not go into the room again—I ran down stairs, and was going to Mr. Manley's, who rents the lower part of the house—an alarm was given, the engines came, and at last it was got out—the back room and part of the staircase was burnt, and the roof; the upper part of the house was seriously burnt—I met the prisoner two or three days afterwards in Church Lane, Whitechapel—he said to me, "Those d—b—s have been troubling me"—I asked who he meant—he mentioned some names that I could not under<lb/>stand; Robinson was one, I cannot recollect the others—he said, "Have you heard anything from the insurance company?"—I said, "No"—he said, "If you do, don't say it was the pot on fire."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fireman. I was called to the fire, it was in the top back room second floor, and the staircase—when I went, Sterne, who I knew before, was in the passage at the bottom of the house; he said, "Frank, for God's sake save the child, there is a child in the top front room"—he knew me very well—I have been to the house four or five times for fires, within, it may be, two years—I went up stairs, but could not get into the front room as the staircase was on fire, and the fire was going through the roof; I should have had to pass through the fire to get to it—I came down again and told him I could not get to it, and that t had not ladders on the engine sufficient to reach it; I sent for the fire escape, and put the engine to work, and put the fire out—there was no child there—the top back room was burnt, the roof was burnt through, and down the staircase as far as the first floor staircase window—after the fire was got under, I went with him to a public house, there were several persons with him. and some men with the engine; he called for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of gin, and said, "Frank, there will be a dispute with the Insurance Company, I expect, over this fire, and I shall call on you as a witness to prove that I had a good stock at the last fire"—I told him I could prove that he had a very good stock then, but I could not tell what he had now, because all that was in the room was destroyed—on the Monday I went with Mr. Perkins, the churchwarden, to examine the premises; the prisoner was there, he said that t had had him for four or five times for fires there, and he heard a cracking noise in the room, and thought the fire was all put out, but it broke out afterwards and burnt the place.</p>

Silver—Sterne called at my place on the Thursday after the fire, between 10 and 11 o'clock, and asked for Mark Robinson, who lodged there with me—Mr. Bowman, the landlord, said he was not within—he said, "I think he is," and the landlord called me down—he said, "As Mark Robinson is not at home, if he comes home, perhaps you will be kind enough to tell him I want to. see him very particularly, I want to give him something to drink"—he wanted to give him sufficient money to go away to America, for he knew he had been to the insurance office, and that he would ruin him if he remained in London any longer—when Robinson came home, I told him—next Monday evening Sterne came again, at a little after 7 o'clock in the evening; I went down—he said, "Well, is Mark at home?"—I said, "The landlord has just sent him out for an errand"—he said, "Did you tell him?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Did he give you an answer?"—I said, "I told him you were here, and he said to me he had got no reason to wish to leave London, and he did not want any money of you to go away to America"—Sterne said, "Well, I can say if he does not want to go to America, he only wants to ruin me; but before he can get me into trouble, I will get him in sooner"—I said, "How can you get the man in trouble so easily?"—he said, "You do not know me for a day; but you have known me quite long enough, as I can get any man into trouble as easily as you can make a waterproof garment;" then he said, "Look here, one <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Sheppard is gone, and I am the second; only there is not another Jonathan Wild shall be able to beat him"—I think it was on the Friday after that that Robinson was given into custody, or the same Friday, I cannot say which.</p>

On 9th July I went, at half past 3 o'clock in the morning; to No, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., New Compton Street, where the prisoners resided, in a room on the first floor—I found the prisoners in bed—Mason was dressed, with the exception of his coat, waistcoat, and boots—Jarvis was undressed, in bed—I looked behind the door, and found this large chest, and, on looking in it, it contained the articles now produced on the top of it—I told Mason to get up, and I com<lb/>menced searching the room—he dressed himself, and I directed a policeman, who was with me, to take him down stairs and put him into a cab which we had at the door—I desired Jarvis to get up, and, on looking round the room, I found this needle case on a dressing table—I asked Jarvis who it belonged to—she said, "To me"—I directed her to dress herself, and took her down stairs and put her in the cab—I then recommenced searching the room, and found this second box under the table—I found the oil cover of it under the bed, and also a large bundle, which contained three damask table cloths, twenty-two napkins, twenty-six towels, two toilet covers, five dusters, three shirts, five pillow cases, one damask chair cover, nineteen D'Oyleys, and five kitchen cloths—in the chest I found three worked cushions, one toilet cover, thirty-five pieces of silk tabaret, four curtain holders, two kettle holders, one piece of chintz, one stuffed pheasant, three glass decanters, one claret jug, thirteen brass ornaments, one photograph likeness, nine books, one piece of taper, one silk scarf, three collars, two women's sleeves, one cigar stand, one fancy work case, one scent decanter, one deal box, and an otto<lb/>man under the table—Mason was taken to the station, and I took these articles there, and asked him how he came in possession of them—he said that he had bought them at Debenham and Storr's—I asked him from whom he bought them, and what he gave for them—he said, "I refuse to answer any further questions now."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Stoke Newington, and am assistant registrar at the East India House. It is my duty to receive manuscript letters which</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185708170041"/>
               <p>come from India—they are called collection—they come from the East Indies in large parcels—they are stamped in the secretary's office, that it may be known to what office they belong—I hand these letters daily to persons in the East India House, and by the stamp they are enabled to return them to me—I have the sole superintendence of them—they are kept in presses up stairs, in a building near my office—subsequent to Jan. last, I commenced transferring some of them from there down to some cellars—there were three messengers and six labourers employed to transfer them, of whom the prisoner was one—that was in consequence of directions I had received, that they were to be destroyed from the earliest date to 1846, inclusive—they had usually been burnt, or cut in pieces, but in this case the Court had decided that they should be sold to papermakers under bond that they should not be made public, but should be reduced to pulp—I superintended this transfer into the cellars, and the prisoner was a mes<lb/>senger employed under me—it was his orders to take them into the cellar—I received some information with regard to the six labourers, and I called the prisoner and another messenger, and said, "I have found a quantity of paper up stairs in one of the presses, the consequence of it being taken away will involve you all; this will seriously affect your characters"—they answered, "Yes, of course it will, if it is allowed to go on"—this led to a stricter caution with regard to these papers—after this I received a report that the business had been completed, and these papers were transferred from the presses to the cellars—I went up stairs, and examined the presses—I found in one of them a quantity of paper, I suppose a cwt; that was a place where they had never been to my knowledge, not a place of deposit—it was a press in the entrance of the first room up stairs—I called the prisoner, and said to him, "Whatmough, why have you been stowing away papers up stairs when I had forbidden you to do it?"—he said, "I have not done it"—I said, "Who then?"—he said, "Forbes"—(he is one of the messengers)—I went and spoke to Forbes—I then ordered that portion of paper to be carried to the cellar—it was no part of the prisoner's duty to take any part. of this paper from the East India House, certainly not—the weight of the paper found on the prisoner is about 36 lbs.—this paper was never used in the East India House for lighting fires under any circumstances, nor for waste paper—I had given some French papers and old books to the mes<lb/>sengers and to the prisoner, but only to be destroyed—part of the messen<lb/>ger's duty under me is, to fetch such part of this correspondence as may be required in any part of the house—that is the case daily—an order would come to me for such a collection—I should give the order to the messenger, and he would go and get it—the messengers are perfectly acquainted with the nature of these documents—I keep a register of all the documents in the presses, not of those in the cellars—I was up at the Mansion House on the first occasion—I was bail for the prisoner, and he called on me, and told me he was guilty of taking the paper, and he hoped I would do what I could for him, or something to that effect.</p>

I was in the St. Martin's work-house on 10th July—I slept in the "F" wad that night—the prisoner also slept there that night—he was strapped down to his bed about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—Richard Empson slept in that room—I think I awoke about 5 o'clock on the Saturday morning, but I could not say for certain, as there was no clock in the room—when I awoke, I saw the prisoner struggling with the deceased at the deceased's bed—the prisoner was then up—in his left hand he had one of the straps he had been fastened down with; in the right hand he had a staff or little stick; I do not know whether it was wood or iron, and I saw him with his right hand make a sort of stab towards the head of the deceased, and the blood flowed directly—he struck at his head three or four times—the blood flowed from the deceased on to the prisoner—I ran from the room to get assistance—there were three other persons in the room while this was going on—they were in bed—I cannot say whether a person named Dixon had left the room before the struggle began, but when I awoke he was not in the room—I came back with assistance—the prisoner was then on the staircase—he had not anything in his hand then—I saw him in the yard afterwards; he ran after me—he had a shovel in his hand then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the master of St. Martin's workhouse. On 10th July, about 11 o'clock, the prisoner was brought into that house, by order of the relieving officer—he was soon after seen by the surgeon—I at first</p>

               <p>considered that he was a person capable of being set to work, but he refused to do that—in consequence of a communication made to me by the person who superintends the labour of the paupers, I sent the prisoner to what is called the "F" ward, about 2 or 3 o'clock in the afternoon of the same day—about half past 4 o'clock I was writing at the desk, and he rushed into the office, and laid hold of me by the arms at the back, and said that somebody was after him to murder him—I released myself from him, and directed him to be taken to a ward, and a strait waistcoat to be put upon him—the surgeon was then sent for; he came, and sanctioned the putting the strait waistcoat on him—I allowed Dixon to sit up that night with the prisoner, at the desire of Empson—Empson was about seventy years old—he was wardsman—I saw the prisoner after he had the strait waistcoat on, at about 10 o'clock at night—he then complained to me that some persons wanted to kill him—he was not in an excited state, he talked to me calmly—I stayed there about five or ten minutes, talking to him—he was strapped to the bed; I thought that necessary, to keep him from hurting himself or other people—I saw no more of him after that until 6 o'clock the next morning, when I was aroused—I found him in the yard, with a shovel on his shoulder—he was then in a violent, excited state—the strait waistcoat was still on him, but the straps loosened—he had blood upon him—he was throwing bricks about the yard—I sent for the policeman, and he was taken into custody—I then went up into the "F" ward; I there found Empson lying on his right side, blood was running out of his mouth, and from wounds in his head—he could not speak—I immediately sent far a doctor—I had him lifted upon the bed, and had his wounds washed—he died in about a quarter of an hour from the first time I saw him—I picked up part of a poker in the room, near where he was lying—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—it was covered with blood—I cannot say whether it belonged to the place, I never saw it before—after the prisoner was brought up into the room, and the strait waistcoat fastened to the bed, I asked him why he had done such a thing; he said, "He tried to kill me, and I killed him"—Empson was dead then; his body was there when the prisoner made that observation.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon of St. Martin's workhouse. On the morning of 10th July I saw the prisoner, about 10 o'clock—I had a long conversation with him, to ascertain the state of his mind; I had understood from the relieving officer that something was amiss with him—the first part of the time he apparently gave quite rational answers—just as I was about leaving him, he said, "I have been accused by persons in the street, who have been following me, of very abominable crimes;" not, perhaps, in those terms, but in more gross ones—I had a little more con<lb/>versation with him at that time, and from those delusions I thought he was not right in his mind, but he appeared to be quite calm and quiet, and therefore I did not direct any restraint to be put upon him—later in the day I received a note from the master of the workhouse, to come down, as the prisoner had become very violent, and he did not know what to do with him—I went to the "F" ward; the strait waistcoat was then on him, but I advised a persistence in that restraint, believing, from the answers he gave me, from his violence towards the master, and his incoherent language, that he was a dangerous lunatic—I directed some cooling medicine to be given him—a little before 6 o'clock in the morning I was sent for by the porter of the workhouse—the deceased was still alive when I saw him—there were several punctured wounds about his head; they were such</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185708170045"/>
               <p>wounds as would have been produced by this instrument—he died of that violence about ten minutes after I arrived—I had some farther conversa<lb/>tion with the prisoner after he had been put under restraint again; he said that this man had attempted to kill him; that persons were going to kill him; he was prepared to die; he knew he should have to die that day, and that he should have to be fastened on his corpse—judging from what I had seen on the previous day, and what I saw of him that morning, I came to the conclusion that he was perfectly insane, and incapable of controlling his actions by reason.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Deane, a stationer, of No. 29, York Street, Westminster. He is the landlord of the house, and lives in it—the prisoner was a lodger there—she occupied a front attic—she had been with us three weeks when this affair happened—no one else occupied it with her—on the morning of 23rd July I missed from a box in her room a great coat, and a pair of plaid trowsers—I did not go up myself; I sent a little girl that I keep—I saw the prisoner afterwards, I think about 11 o'clock—I asked her if the little girl had turned out the whole of the boxes to look for the property, and she said she had done so—I said it was a most extraordinary thing, as the things were in that place when she took possession of the room—I said, "My husband is going out in a hurry, and when he returns I must come and look and see if I can find them"—she then went up stairs—I saw her come down again in about ten minutes—she ran down the stairs very quickly, accompanied by a young girl named Eliza<lb/>beth Groves—I then sent the servant up again—the moment she got to the door and opened it, she screamed out "Fire! the place is in flames!"—I did not go up stairs myself—I was standing between my parlour and shop door—I smelt the fire, but I did not go up—I sent for a policeman—a soldier of the Grenadier Guards, lodging in the floor below the prisoner's room, went up—I saw the prisoner about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after this—she had the key of the door round her finger—I was looking out of my shop door as she came up—I said, "You have set my place on fire"—she said, "My good woman, I know nothing at all about your place being on fire"—the policeman was behind her—after she came inside the house, she said to one of the lodgers, "Is it natural I should come back if I had set the place on fire?"—I gave her into custody as she came in at the door—I did not go into the room at all myself—I was dreadfully alarmed—there were my own three children in the house, and my lodgers' children.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mrs. Deane. On the morning of 23rd July I was sent up into the prisoner's room to search for a coat and pair of trowsers—I could not find them—the prisoner was there while I was making the search—there was no fire in the room or in the fireplace, nor any candle alight—I think it was about 10 o'clock—she came down stairs about five minutes afterwards with a slop pail, and she took a jug of water up stairs with her—she came down again about five minutes after—a girl named Elizabeth Groves was with her, with a baby in her arms—they went out together—Mrs. Deane told me to go up and see if her things were all right—when I got up the door of the room was locked—I had a key which I opened the door with—when I got into the room I discovered the bed, and the sheet, and pillow case, on fire—there was smoke in the room—I hal<lb/>looed out, "Fire!"—I put the blanket on the blaze—it was alight and blazing—Mr. Moon then came up—he went down again, and got a pail of water—it was smoking then—Mrs. Deane sent me for a policeman.</p>

I smell fire!" and she said it was only the candle—it was not like the smoke of a candle—I did not see any candle in the room—there was a table there, with nothing on it—I did not see any candle alight—she went in, and shut the door, and then came down—I went out with her—I am quite sure I smelt burning.</p>

On Tuesday morning, 28th July, about 3 o'clock, some persons came to my house with two females—I had closed the house, but they knocked, and I let in Jones and Gough—there were also two men, who are not in custody—they were the only four customers in the house—they drank to the amount of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked for payment, a watch was tendered to me, and I was asked to lend 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I did, and took the watch—I had seen Gough several times before—they remained till about half past 5 o'clock; I then missed one of them, and was seized from behind by an arm round my throat—they then all rushed round, seized me, and rifled my pockets—I had got two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, nine sovereigns, and a lot of silver—with what I picked up, I had 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. remaining; I lost 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the watch, upon which I had lent them 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—all the four men took part in it—I noticed Gough and Jones at the time it was going on, but should not like to swear to Liversage—I have an indistinct recollection of seeing him just at the time I was attacked—I became insensible—I struggled very much, and broke a great quantity of glasses—I heard one of them say, "Give it him tighter;" and when I recovered, I found myself in a pool of blood behind the bar—I got up, and sent for a policeman.</p>

               <p>Street—the prisoner came out and walked with me; on the way I called at Harley Street, Hoxton—the prisoner went into his own residence there, and afterwards went to the dispensary with me; I left him outside, waiting—I came to the door three or four times and saw him there, and when I came out the last time he was talking to William Forty—I went across and spoke to them—we then all walked together to the Angel public house; there was no quarreling going along—we went in, my husband sat next to me, and Forty next to him, the prisoner was between us—I had some half and half, and a biscuit, and Forty paid for it—Forty said to me, "You do not eat your biscuit;" my husband said, "She does not respect the giver, or else she would eat her biscuit"—another pot was called for; I asked the prisoner to pay for it, and he struck me on the face with his fist—Forty got up, and said, "If that is your game, George, I am off," and went out of the house—my husband followed him, and I went out and saw them in the road—I heard some person say, "Mind, he has got a knife"—I ran away, and my husband ran after me, he caught a slight hold, and I ran farther on—when I got to a tobacconist's shop I fell down, and the prisoner then struck me, once on the shoulder, and once on the back, with a dagger—I had often seen a white handled dagger in his possession at home—I bled a great deal, and was taken to St. Bartholomew's Hospital—my hus<lb/>band knew that I was at Forty's house; he has said that he would have money or revenge—he has repeatedly said that all he required was money, that he did not wish me to live with him; if he had money he would take a girl, and that was all he wanted, and I could live with he knew who.</p>

I think, before my husband was aware of it—I did not tell him where I was going; he ordered me and his daughters to pay him rent, or leave his house—we would not do so, and I took the apartment for my daughters—I lived with Forty as his wife, and was called Mrs. Forty by the lodgers—he asked his son how he liked his new mother-in-law, but he never called me his wife—my husband saw me during the three months I was living with Forty, but he did not know where I was lodging—I told him on this day that I had left Forty's house; I did not say that I would return home at the end of the week, when my time was up—I promised to see him again that day, and I met him; he left me in Goswell Street, and I came back and told him to go away, that a man was watching him—about half past 10 o'clock that night Forty came, and knocked at the street door, and I opened it—I had not told my husband that they did not know at Forty's where I had gone to—my husband struck Forty on his head, and made him bleed, and the police came, but Forty would not give him in charge—I told my husband that I was parted from Forty; I told him that on purpose to keep him from Forty, because he has threatened his life so many times—he had tried to get money from Forty; first 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and then 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and at last he came down to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if I had given him money I might have stayed—I knew that both my life and Forty's were to be sacrificed, unless 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid—I was at my husband's house each day—my husband</p>

He went into the navy about three years ago—some months afterwards I went to live with another young man—I had a child by him; the prisoner afterwards came home, he came to where I was, and I went to live with him again; the child was not living with us, the father took it away and put it out to wet nurse—last month I went to see it; I had been there about ten minutes, when the father came there to pay something to the nurse—he had been there about a quarter of an hour when my hus<lb/>band came into the room—I was nursing the baby—he said, "Oh, this is no more than I expected; give me the key of my room, and I will go home and sell everything"—I gave him the key, and he went away directly—I saw him again on thursday, 6th Aug., he came up stairs, I was in the room by myself, at least the baby was lying on the floor on a pillow—he said, "I want you"—I said, "want me what for?"—he said. "Oh, I will tell you;" he caught hold of my two hands, and knelt on me on the bed, and was rummaging in his Guernsey for his knife—I said, "My God, William, are you going to murder me?"—he said, "Don't halloo," and he commenced stabbing me; only one cut me, but there were several cuts in my dress—the knife broke—it bruised my thigh, but did not cut the flesh.</p>

                  <hi rend="largeCaps">RACHEL JACOBS</hi>. I am the wife of Robert Jacobs, of No. 7, Dock Street, Whitechapel. On Tuesday evening, 11th Aug., I was going to the Sydney Smith public house, in Dock Street, between 6 and 7 o'clock. I do not think the prisoner is the man I saw there; I think it was a taller man—I have never seen the prisoner before to-day—it was a taller man that I saw at the station house—he is the man I saw before the Magistrate—I made a statement before the Magistrate—it was read over to me, and I signed it—the prisoner is not the man who assaulted me—I think it was a taller man—after I was knocked down I was carried home—I did not come to my senses until 10 o'clock at night—I went to the station house, and made a complaint to the police—I afterwards learned from the police that a young man had been taken up—I went to the police office, and gave my evidence—the person standing before the Magistrate on the charge at the time looked like that young man—I was asked some questions, and my answers were taken down in writing—I made my mark—this is it—I stated what is written in the deposition—I never missed my ring until 10 o'clock at night—I have said that the prisoner was the man, but since that I have heard that a woman has got my ring—I do not know whether the prisoner is the man or not that took it—he is the man I saw at the station house—the boy that was kicked told me he was the man—I was too much in liquor to know—I was very much in liquor—it was not because I knew it myself that I said he was the man, but because somebody told me so.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>). I have pleaded guilty to this charge—I have known Whale some two years, or more—some time ago I was in the service of Messrs. Barnard and Rosenthal—I knew Whale at that time—I then left that service, and went into the service of Messrs. Hutton—I was still acquainted with Whale whilst at Hutton's—I then went back from Hutton's to Messrs. Barnard's again—I think I have been at Barnard's this last time nearly a year—my duty was in the top floor—I knew Whale while I was in the service of Barnards the last time—I have had trans<lb/>actions with him—they commenced about five months since—the first transaction was that of selling a parcel of silk—on that occasion I met him in Cheapside—we were talking together, and the conversation turned on business matters, matters concerning the silk trade—we were talking of the price of silk, and I asked him if he was open to buy a parcel; he said he was—about two or three weeks after that, I took him a parcel of silk—I cannot call to mind the quantity—I should imagine it was about a pound—I took it to his warehouse—I saw him, and asked if he would buy it—he said, "Yes"—he did not ask where I got it from, or anything about it—I got it from Messrs. Barnard's—I took it from them without their knowledge; I stole it—I believe Whale did not at that time know where I was living—I never said anything about being a traveller for a house in Spitalfields, or about coming from Spitalfields—he paid me at the rate of 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound for it—it was sewing silk, in skeins—I do not think there was an invoice made out for the first transaction—I went to him again, I think, about a week after, within a day or so, more or less—I took another parcel of silk, precisely the same kind as before, and stolen in the same way—I should imagine it was about the same quantity as before, or more—he bought it, and paid the same price for it, 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per pound—he paid me for it at the time—I think there was an invoice then given—Whale first men<lb/>tioned the invoice—I think his remark was, "You had better give me an invoice of this," which I did—it was made out in my own name—he said the price that was to be inserted was 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I put—all these invoices (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), are in my handwriting—they are all made out at 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I believe there is no date on any one of these—these all relate to the earlier transactions with him—I had nine other transactions with him, after the first two, making eleven in all, for which I gave invoices without dates, and put in the price as 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the price always paid to me—all these other invoices (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are in my handwriting, and have dates—I do not know how many there are—they are all priced at 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I received 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for all those—it was quite an oversight not putting the dates to these; Whale mentioned it—I went to him on each of these dates—I had thirty</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185708170071"/>
               <p>transactions with him during the five months—there was not a transaction so frequently as every two or three days, sometimes it would be ten or twelve days—I always went to him at dinner time, between 1 and 2 o'clock—I never said anything to him about dinner time—I have made the remark that I wanted to get back at 2 o'clock—I did not state any reason why—I never told him where I got the silk from—I have many times been with him to a public house when I have been about the silk—it was only to one public house—I do not know the sign of it; it is kept by a Mr. Phillips, in the Old Bailey—I have known Whale dine there three times, and I have been to see him there—we used to go back to the warehouse to transact business—he never talked about the business at all before the persons in the public house—I carried the silk to him in parcels and papers—it was done up in a piece of ordinary brown paper, or newspaper, or any waste paper—I believe Whale employs many workpeople—there has been one or two of them in the warehouse at the time I have gone there, but he has dismissed them when I went in to have the transactions—he is a fringe maker by trade—I remember being followed by the officer on 29th July, and being given into custody—I had been at Whale's on the Monday pre<lb/>viously—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the last invoice I ever gave him—I am quite sure I went on Monday, July 27th—I took him on that day the packet of silk represented by this invoice.</p>

Barnard—I also sent a note to Mr. Wontner, stating that I wished to see him—I afterwards saw him, and made a state<lb/>ment—I have never sold things that I have stolen to any one else but Whale—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the silk—they are all silks that I have taken to Whale, just in that state, and in skeins like that—the silk is manufactured, I believe, in Coventry—it is used by tons, I might say, in Spitalfields.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the detective officers of the City of London. Messrs. Barnard called in the assistance of myself and another officer—I watched their premises for some time—on 29th July, about 1 o'clock in the day, I saw Norris leave the premises; I and my brother officer followed him—he went into Aldersgate Street, into Newgate Street, and into the doorway of the Queen's Arms; when he came out of the door<lb/>way, he had this parcel under his arm—he then went into a butcher's shop in Newgate Street, then to a stationer's, and then to Bishop's Court, Old Bailey, where Whale resided—when he went into the stationer's, he pro<lb/>cured a newspaper, in which he wrapped his parcel—I did not see where he got the parcel from—I did not see it when he came out of the premises—when he bought the newspaper, he went into the passage of the Queen's</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185708170072"/>
               <p>Arms, and into a door way in the passage, and when he came out he had this parcel under his arm, wrapped up in the newspaper—he then went to Bishop's Court; that turns out of the Old Bailey—he went into No. 4 there—I did not then know it as the premises of Mr. Whale, I do now—when he got there, I heard him call Whale—a boy came to him in the passage, and told him Mr. Whale was not at home—I then went up to Norris, and after asking him some questions I took him into custody—I have here the parcel that I found in his possession; it contains sewing silk—as we were coming out of the door, we met Whale—Norris said, "This is Mr. Whale"—I said, "Do you know this young man?" pointing to Norris—he said, "Yes"—"Do you know what firm he represents, or where he is employed?"—he said, "I know him as a traveller from Spitalfields"—"Did you expect him to bring a parcel to you?"—"No"—"Have you done any business with him, or bought any silk of him?"—he stopped for a moment or two, he appeared to be thinking, and then he said, "Two or three times"—that was all that passed then—I took Norris to the station house—he was searched there, but no other property was found upon him but that which he had in the parcel—that weighs 2 lbs. 4 ozs.—after he was locked up, I accompanied Mr. Barnard to Whale's place again—I asked Whale to show me his books of the transactions he had had with Norris—he said he kept no books, but he had got invoices—I asked him to show me the last invoice of the last transaction he had had with Norris, and he gave me one of 30th June—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "June 30, 1857. Mr. Whale, bought of W. Norris, one coloured SS, 32, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Paid, W. Norris")—I then said, "Oh, you have done no business with him in July?)"—he said, "No, I have not seen him—he called on Monday, and left his name, but I did not see him"—I then asked him to let me see the whole of the invoices that he had got, and he pulled out about thirty or thirty-one invoices—these are them—one of these was found in his pocket book, the rest were on the file—Funnell found this one of 27th July at the warehouse—it was produced, and I called Whale's attention to it—he said, "Oh, yes, I quite forgot that"—the 27th July would be the Monday Whale had stated that Norris called, and he did not see him—Funnell had asked him if those were all the invoices, and he said, "If you are not satisfied, you had better look and see for yourself;" he did so, and found this—we found 35 lbs. of silk on the premises, that was claimed by Mr. Barnard—this produced is it—a parcel of 2 lbs. was found by Funnell, and kept separate; Funnell will speak as to that—I found on the file these other invoices—40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per pound is the price charged there—it was in consequence of finding those invoices on the file that Mr. Barnard gave Whale into custody—after this property was found, I heard Whale beg Mr. Barnard not to lock him up, he might take anything he liked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You found a good many other invoices besides these? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were a great many others—these were picked out from the others in my presence, by Mr. Barnard—(<hi rend="italic">these were for very small amounts</hi>)—I should think there were twenty or thirty invoices besides these—I did not find much larger quantities of silk on the premises than I have produced; the were other silks—Norris was taken into custody at Whale's warehouse—I left Whale there—it was somewhere about an hour before I went back with Mr. Barnard—at the time he said he had not seen Norris on 27th July I had not that invoice in my possession, only that of 30th June; he was looking over the file at the time—he told Funnell if he was not satisfied, to look himself, and I believe he did so—Mr. Whale</p>

               <p>expressed some surprise that no address of the seller was given on these invoices, and asked him if he knew where he lived—he said, "No, I do not"—while looking over those invoices, I discovered several other invoices of other houses, which sets forth the value of the silk as very much more than the price on the other invoices—Whale was asked when he had seen Norris last, and when he had had the last transaction with him, and he answered, "I have not had any transactions with him in July"—I cannot say that I recollect anything being said about the last invoice or the last transaction, in my hearing—he was asked when he had last seen Norris, and he said he had not seen him, but he believed he had called on Saturday—I think this was Wednesday—I think Monday was the day he named—I then claimed the whole of this silk as mine—there was a very small quantity that I did not claim—he had a number of remnants and odd<lb/>ments, but he had very little else besides this in that form; he had some of that kind of silk, not so much as you have on the table there—there is 37 lbs. or 39 lbs. there I think altogether—I do not know the weight of what he had besides this, and I did not weigh it—(<hi rend="italic">George Scott.</hi> I weighed it; there was 10 lbs. left)—After I had found the invoices, I went round the shop, or room, or warehouse, whatever it is called, and I immediately saw this silk; it was covered with a wrapper—I said, "This silk is mine"—he said, "Yes, this is the silk I bought of Norris; you may take it away, only don't give me into custody"—I afterwards found the parcel that lies before me—I said, "Why, here is another parcel of the silk"—he said, "Oh, yes, this is what I bought last Monday, and I had forgotten it"—I have gone through the invoices that were found—they amount in quantity to 63 lbs. 13 ozs.; that includes the whole number of invoices found by myself—the value of it is about 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per pound at least; some of it is worth 46<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I do not know the weight of that—there is none of less value than 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I am now speaking of the ordinary market value.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You are in a very large way of business, I believe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Moderately so—I should say we were in a much larger way than Whale—we never sell silk; we buy silk, and manufacture it into goods, and sell them, not only fringe, but anything else—we buy our silk in the raw state occasionally; sometimes we buy it thrown—raw silk is silk which has undergone no process, and has simply been wound from the coomb—silk in the gum is silk which has undergone the process of throwing; that is, two or three ends of fine silk are thrown together, and form a thread, from which we weave—we buy our silk raw, in the gum, and dyed—we do not dye our<lb/>selves—there is no process of gumming; it is throwing—we are not throw<lb/>sters—we only buy occasionally in the raw state—the great bulk is bought in the gum—occasionally, when out of a special colour, we buy it ready dyed; that is rather an exception—I should not think there was silk to the amount of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Whale's premises—I did not know before this that there was such a man in being—there was not the slightest concealment of the silk—the invoices were given up to me after some hesitation—I should say there was only a fair amount of hesitation.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Any man might hesitate before he showed his invoices? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Quite so—I occasionally buy silk myself—the value of this is 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the state in which it now is—if I wanted to buy it, I should have to pay 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a lb. for it in any quantity—if I wanted 1 cwt. of it, I should pay the same price as for 1 lb.—the price in the gum depends on the year, and the quantity of silk in the market—silk will vary forty per cent sometimes—it is dearer now than ever it was—it has varied forty per cent, during the last</p>

I am in partnership with my son, Richard—on Friday night, 7th Aug., I shut up my warehouse myself, at half past 7 o'clock, and turned the gas off at half past 10 o'clock—I went round to all the doors, they were quite safe—the counting house is connected with my dwelling house by a covered way—in that warehouse I had three boxes—the covers were open—they were what we put old metal in—they contained yellow metal, and copper, and some composition called pump chambers, a brass tube that is put down in the pump to keep the pump from chafing—my son's coat was hanging up in the warehouse—I went to the warehouse the next morning about 7 o'clock—I found a part of the warehouse door broken right through, and bars and bolts twisted off—the three boxes of metal were then gone, and all the things I have spoken of—I noticed that a rope that I left inside when I went to bed was fastened on the wharf, and hanging over it towards the river, they had lowered the boxes down with it—a person, if the tide served, could bring a boat up to our wharf—that rope was in a position so that anything might be lowered from the wharf—I think it must have been high water somewhere about 3 o'clock on the morning of the 8th—some metal was shown to me afterwards by inspector Bridges (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I can speak to it—there is my own name on it—this is some of it.</p>

On the morning of Saturday, 8th Aug., I saw the prisoners, Reardon and Mackness, between 5 and 6 o'clock—Reardon placed his boat on the shore alongside of mine, that was at Limehouse Stairs, which is a good distance from Mr. Jolly's warehouse—that boat laid on the shore about half an hour, until I took some passengers across the water; when I came back, I rowed my boat to the same place, and took some more over—that boat was still there—about half an hour afterwards, Mackness came down—I did not see any one with him at that time—he went down to the boat and carried up a case of yellow metal—he had a cart with him—there was another man with him—I could not swear to Plank, but I believe he is the man that brought the cart—he was a very stout man, like him—Mackness carried a case of copper out of the boat up the alley into the cart—Reardon carried one up too; he fell down on the stairhead with it—the other man took it off his back, and put it on his own back, and took it down to the cart—they each carried a box—the boxes were taken one after the other—as each box was put into the cart, the tail board was put up very quickly—they put the tail</p>

I never saw a man knocked about in that way; rescue him! rescue him! they are like a lot of pigs upon him"—I saw Morgan, he assisted Waggett in rescuing the first prisoner—Morgan laid hold of the man's waist, and was dragging him away—I have no recollection of seeing any other of the prisoners at Church End before that man was got away—I saw Morgan afterwards in the court, but I did not see him do anything in the court—I saw Lepine in High Street, Shoreditch, after we got out of the court—he was assisting in rescuing Waggett, whom we then had in custody—he and others came up together and rushed upon us, and tried all they could to pull him, and get him away—after we got to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> rank, Lepine took some water, and threw it over one of the constables—the cab rank is nearly 100 yards from Pear Tree Court; it is facing the Church—other constables came up and assisted me in taking Waggett to the station—Mor<lb/>gan, and Cohen, and Lepine, and Wright, and Ballard, and Dane were taken—I received a mark on my neck, a black eye—I was unfit for duty for nine days.</p>

               <p>and laid hold of Waggett—an officer and I took him out of the court—I saw Ballard lay hold of Waggett with both her hands, and she tried to pull him away—I saw Cohen, and Lepine in his shirt sleeves—he several times tried to get Waggett away—he was the most violent man amongst the whole of them—Cohen was in High Street, about two doors from Pear Tree Court—I saw him go to Alexander, and put his hand upon his number—he said, "I will take your number for using violence towards the prisoner; you are acting cruelly, you villain"—I said to Cohen, "If he has done any harm, take his number, and apply to the proper quarters"—but Cohen rushed on to Alexander, and laid hold of his collar, and said, "You scoundrel, you vagabond, you are murdering the man; rescue! rescue! take him away"—he had a roll of paper in his hand—he was flourishing it about, and leading them on—the street was blocked up—I went for further assist<lb/>ance—none of the prisoners used any language to me at that time, but pre<lb/>vious to that, Dane said to me, "I will remember you; I will <hi rend="italic">do</hi> for you"—I saw Wright outside the court, very busy about the mob; I cannot say what he did, he appeared to be taking part in it—Morgan made himself very busy—I saw him take hold of Waggett, and try to get him away—I saw Cohen taken into custody in Old Street Road, very near the turning going towards the station.</p>

On the afternoon of 30th March I was passing from Shore<lb/>ditch in the direction of the City—I was near Pear Tree Court, and saw Waggett brought out by two policemen—I should think there were from 300 to 500 people—two constables had Waggett in custody, and two more were behind, endeavouring to keep the people back that were assailing them with sticks and stones—I endeavoured to render some assistance to the police, taking hold of Waggett's arms, and I was assailed myself—I saw Dane, I believe, throw a stone, and he was taken by a constable—at Shore<lb/>ditch Church the mob became more violent, and increased in numbers there, and I saw the police more violently assailed with oyster shells, and one likewise took up a pail with water, and threw the pail and water at the police—at that moment I saw Cohen—he had a piece of paper in his hand, which much resembled an official envelope—it was in the shape of a long letter—he was telling the people that he would see them righted, and stand by them, and the police were butchers and cowards, and it was rascally on their part to drag a man in the way they were doing—I told him that no unnecessary violence was used by the police—I am of opinion that if they had used more they would have fared better—after that language was used by Cohen, the mob was more violent—he seemed to move his hand amongst the people—he might have said a great many more words, but not that I recollect; such as calling the police great vagabonds, and so on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hatter, and live in High Street, Shoreditch. On 30th March I saw a man in custody of the police near Pear Tree Court—there was a large number of people looking at the police and at the prisoners—they hemmed the police in—I was at my door—I should say I was forty yards from where I first saw them—they came nearer to me, and passed my door—I observed the conduct of the police—I did not observe that they used any unnecessary violence in taking the prisoners—I thought they only acted in the way they were obliged to do to keep their prisoners—I saw them use their staves merely to keep the mob back—I saw Mr. Cohen there—he seemed to be a little excited; no more than any one would be at so fearful a sight; such a number of policemen using their staves to any one coming up at the moment, it appeared fearful—he was saying some<lb/>thing, but I could not hear it, there was such a noise.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Wick, near Bath. From the latter end of Sept. to the beginning of Nov., 1856, I did duty for my uncle, the incum<lb/>bent of Little Stanmore, and resided in the school house, where I had the exclusive use of a bedroom and sitting room; Sir Henry Ellis occupying the rectory in my uncle's absence—the prisoner lived at the school house, his family consisting of his wife and children and a servant, Maria Ginger, who used to go home to sleep every night—on 6th Nov. I received from Sir Henry Ellis 67<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; there was one 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note, three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, two sovereigns, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I put it into my desk, which was on the table, locked it, and put the key into my pocket—on the following night I went out to dinner; shortly before going, I had to go to my desk, and the money was safe; I locked the desk, and took the key with me—I returned about half past 11 o'clock, and let myself in with a latch key, as every one had gone to bed—I struck a light, and on going into my sitting room, saw that the position of my desk had been altered—I tried it, and found that it was still locked—the window was closed, and I believe fastened—there was a table with a glass vase in front of the window, and seeing that that was undisturbed, I went to bed—next morning, at a little before 7 o'clock, the prisoner came to my door, and asked me if I had left my desk open the night before—I said, "Certainly not"—he said, "It is wide open now, Sir"—I got up immediately, went down stairs, and saw that it was wide open, and the money gone—the staples of the lock had been wrenched, and the vase was removed, and placed on the sofa, which was on one side of the window—I told the prisoner that 67<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. had been taken from the desk,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185708170097"/>
               <p>and that I did not know the number of the notes—I sent for a policeman, and examined the outside of the window, but could see no footmarks on the flower bed under the window—persons might have been there and left no trace; I do not think the ground was damp enough to make a trace—I told the prisoner that Sir Henry Ellis had paid me the money, and he said that possibly some of Sir Henry Ellis's servants had taken it.</p>

Mr. Tuson, instead of giving him a cheque, I went to town and got the money for him; my house in Bedford Square was dismantled, and therefore I may have put the initials on them in the country—this entry in my diary was made on the 5th or 6th—I entered the numbers in my pocket book when I went home; Mr. Tuson came to me with a policeman next morning, to know if I had taken the numbers, and I took him into my library, and gave them to him from my pocket book—I must have entered them the day before, because he came early in the morning—these two notes with "Healey" on them, I received from my butcher on 5th Nov.—I do not know what became of the other notes I got from Childs', I only took the numbers of those I was to pay to Mr. Herbert Tuson.</p>

I used to go there between 6 and 7 o'clock in the morning, and go away about 9 o'clock in the evening—on 8th Nov. I went there at about half past 6'clock; the prisoner was up, and in the school—I went into Mr. Tuson's parlour, and saw his desk open—the prisoner was coming out of the school room door, and I said, "Have you been in the parlour this morning?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Will you come in then?"—he came in, and then went up, and called Mr. Tuson.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Who let you in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The prisoner—there was nothing extraordinary in his being up; he was always up before I came—he did not let me in, but the door was open, and he was in the school—he did not say that he had opened the door, I only suppose he had—the things in the parlour were tossed about, and I thought there had been thieves there—the prisoner said that he was writing lectures in the school—I saw him write, and have heard him deliver lectures—in the morning he used to compose the lectures that he had to deliver—I recollect the anniversary of the chapel; it was on a Thursday, I do not know the day of the month—the prisoner was at home the whole of that day—I did not see him the whole day—lie had been asked specially to play the organ on that day—he might have been out of my sight for three hours—I did not see him the whole day on Thursday; he was at the Church sometimes—I got his breakfast that morning, and after that he went into the school to teach the children—he dined at home, and after dinner he went to the school for a short time, and then went to Church to play the organ—I did not get his tea for him; he said that he was going out to tea, to the anniversary, to the chapel—I saw him again in the evening, when it was getting dark—I was not at the chapel in the evening; there was service there in the evening, and I saw him come home, as if he had come from the chapel, with</p>

               <p>two friends, at 8 or half past 8 o'clock; I cannot say whether it was 9 o'clock—I know Mr. Green, but I do not think he came home with him, it was with Mr. Kilby—I did not leave that night; I slept there, as Mr. Tuson had left—the prisoner is the organist at the Church, and it was his duty to play the organ every Sunday—this was the anniversary of the chapel, but he had to play at the Church because the people asked him—there is no organ at the chapel.</p>

               <p>the gas down stairs; he told me there was a very great deal of gas, and there were more gas burners than any one had in Blackheath; he said I was not there when he was there eighteen months before—I was not—I did not see what was in the basket—he asked me to show him into the bed rooms; I said, "You will see the housemaid up stairs, and she will do it, I am busy"—while the prisoner was trying the burners, the other man did nothing, only what this one told him—he went up stairs, and did not come down till he had finished every room in the house up stairs—he came down into the kitchen and asked me for some grease to grease the handle of the gaso<lb/>meter, and I gave it to him; he said, when he had done he was going to make out a bill, and he must wash his hands first—I gave him some hot water; he asked me what time Mrs. Capper was going to dine, as he wanted to send up the bill—I told him she was at dinner—he inquired for the parlour maid—I said I would take up the bill as she was waiting on Mrs. Capper—I took up the bill—he wrote the bill on the table under the gas meter—Mrs. Capper said, "Has the man done all?"—I said, "Yes, he has"—he charged for six new burners—that is the bill he gave me—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "Six new burners, blowing two joints, and easing main cock, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

Palmer" some part of the name was sewn in—I could not see the name on the other two which were below, it was downwards—he went in the direction of the prisoner's house—when I last saw the cart it was about fifty yards from the prisoner's house—I did not watch particularly where it went to.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Messrs. Mynn, I have charge of their store in Coppin's Yard. On Tuesday, 21st July, there should have been 164 pockets of Gibbs's hops—I believe they are Mid Kent—there were twenty-one pockets of Palmer's East Kent—I left them all right a little before 1 o'clock—it was five minutes before 1 o'clock when I got to the Town Hall—I locked up the store and went to dinner—I returned from my dinner at 2 o'clock, I found the store locked up as I had left it for any<lb/>thing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185708170125"/>
               <p>that I could see—about a quarter past 11 o'clock the next day I set the pockets up in their place and missed two of Gibbs's and one of Palmer's—I communicated it to my master—I then examined the premises—I tried the boards all the way round, and about three boards below the pockets where I was tapping three boards fell down—the adjoining pre<lb/>mises are Messrs. Duncan and Jarman's—the boards made a hole sufficiently large for one or two men to go through, it was the width of a doorway—if a man got in that way he could undo the bolt of the door—I had bolted the door and went out at a little door afterwards—anybody who got in at that hole could easily open the great door—when I left to go to dinner I fastened all the doors, I bolted two doors and locked one—I knew the prisoner by working in the yard, that is all—I have lived up the yard for two years—the prisoner has never worked on Mr. Duncan's premises while they were there, but he worked for Mr. Capp, who occupied part of Mr. Duncan's premises before—I cannot say how long ago—it was last season—when Mr. Capp gave it up, Messrs. Duncan and Jarman took it—I have got samples of hops of Palmer's and Gibbs here—I had taken samples out of Palmer's and Gibbs' before—to take a sample we cut the bag down and take the sample out with a pair of clamps—the hops are packed very tight to form a solid substance—when you cut the piece it is like a slice, and that is brought down to the warehouse as a sample—when we sample hops we fill up the hole in the pocket with hops as near the same quality as we can—in sampling these pockets I put in some hops of a different kind—we generally fill up with trimmings, and with others of the same quality as near as we can get them—in sampling these I had not got enough to fill with the trimmings; I had some that had lost their colour which my go<lb/>vernor did not know anything at all about, and I put them in—that will enable me to speak to these pockets—I have some samples here—here are two of Gibbs's, and here is one of Palmer's—these were taken out of the pockets before the 21st—they were taken down to the counting house; I had a sample from each pocket, 146 samples—I have samples of the hope that were found at the prisoner's house.</p>

I am a hop merchant in the Borough—I have one partner—the business is carried on in the name of Mynn Brothers, and Company—I have a warehouse in Coppin's Yard—I know a carman named Wild, he used to do our business—Coppin's Yard is a large place, and has stables at the other end, and there are several warehouses and counting houses—Mr. Wild's stables lead out at the other end—there is a thorough—fare for foot passengers—I do not know whether carts can go through—I think they can—carts stand in the open yard—there are several generally there—I had at the time of this robbery a quantity of hops in my ware­ house—Mr. Duncan's warehouse joins mine—I had some Mid Kent hops in the name of Gibbs, and some East Kent hops in the name of Palmer—they had, on the outside of the pockets, the names of Palmer and Gibbs—in the course of trade persons who deliver hops give delivery orders—on the carman taking them, he takes the order and gets it signed by the person to whom he delivers them—I had not sold any of Gibbs's or Palmer's hops this season; not since Oct. 1855—we might have sold a few in Nov. 1855—we purchased them in Oct. 1855—I heard of the stealing of these hops and went up the yard, and saw Mr. Wild's foreman, and made some inquiry—I saw the boards and the hole—there is not the least doubt that that was the way by which my warehouse had been entered—in consequence of what was told me, I went, with an officer, to the prisoner's house, I think about 3 o'clock, on Wednesday, the 22nd—it is a private house—the door was open, I went in—the prisoner came into the passage to me, and I asked him if he had been receiving any hops—he said that he believed some hops had been brought there the day before—I asked him how it was that he had them left there, and who sent them there—he said he was coming to dinner, and he met a man who asked him if he would allow him to leave three pockets of hops in his house—I said, "Of course you</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JAMESGOOD</hi>. I am foreman to Messrs. Croziere, hop merchants. On the morning of 21st July the prisoner, whom I knew, called at our ware­ house; he said be wanted an empty hop pocket—he said, "I bought one of you some time ago, marked Walton; that was a very good one; I should like another like it, of the same mark"—I said, "As to what marks I have got I cannot say; you may go and look at them"—we went into the room, and the first pocket I laid my hand on was one of the mark which he had mentioned—he said, "That will do," and paid me for it, and took it away—I can tell that this pocket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one that has passed through our house, but this black horse has been stamped on it since—I have seen the other pocket, marked Walton, outside; I believe that is the one that I sold the prisoner before—I have seen the samples taken from the pockets found at the prisoner's house, and compared them with the samples taken on the prosecutor's premises—I have been in the hop trade twenty-one years, and have had great opportunities of looking at hops—these so exactly correspond that I should say they must be the same.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long is it since you sold the first pocket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might be six weeks, or two months—Walton may grow 200 pockets, more or less—I have not sold to the prisoner several of Walton's pockets within the last six months, to my knowledge—he is a dealer in hops and in pockets—I would not undertake to say that I have not sold him three or four pockets within the last six months—he never exchanged a pocket in his life—it is not a very difficult matter to identify some parcels of hops when out of the pockets—it would be difficult to identify some, most un<lb/>doubtedly.</p>

On 22nd July I accompanied Mr. Mynn to the prisoner's house—the prisoner did not mention the name of Ross in the house, but he mentioned the name of Ross or Robinson when he was in ray custody, on the road to the station—Mr. Mynn was not present then, he came to the station afterwards—when I got to the pri<lb/>soner's house, I saw him in conversation with Mr. Mynn, in the passage—I heard Mr. Mynn ask him if he had not had some hops brought there within the last few days—he said, at first, that he had not—some further conversation passed, which I did not exactly catch—Mr. Mynn turned round to me, and said, "I believe the hops are in the house"—I then asked the prisoner if he had got any hops, or received any hops lately—he said, "Yes, I have got several pockets; I am a hop dealer"—I then said, "Did you receive three pockets of hops on Tuesday?"—he said he did not recol<lb/>lect,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, practising at No. 3, Finsbury Chambers. I had been acting as solicitor for the prisoner—on Wednesday, 8th July, I accompanied him to the Queen's Bench prison, for the purpose of seeing Mr. Robertson, a creditor, lying there—I was also accompanied by a gentleman of the name of Gower—this was nearly, or about 2 o'clock in the afternoon—some conversation took place between me and Mr. Robertson, and the prisoner, and Mr. Gower—Mr. Robertson came to his room and took a seat in an arm chair—the chair was with its back to the window—I had a seat on his left hand side—the prisoner was standing—he was stand<lb/>ing at the time, it might be about five feet from Mr. Robertson; he was in front of him, facing him—Mr. Gower was some distance behind, still fur<lb/>ther from Mr. Robertson—after the conversation had proceeded some minutes, De Salvi drew nearer to Robertson, and it appeared to me that he</p>

               <p>struck him with his fist—previous to that occurring, De Salvi was addressing Robertson on the subject of the debt which Robertson owed him—De Salvi said he owed the money, and the other denied it—there was an angry feel<lb/>ing between the prisoner and Robertson as to the debt—as he struck, the prisoner's left hand was on Robertson's shoulder, Mr. Robertson was seated at the time, and the prisoner struck with his right hand—he appeared to strike Mr. Robertson four or five times—he struck him on his right side, on his cheek, temple, and about the shoulder—Mr. Robertson was seated in a chair when the prisoner first struck him; he then went forward about four feet, and then he went to the ground—it was very quick, and I immediately jumped up, and De Salvi left—I immediately ran to the assistance of Mr. Robert<lb/>son—after the first blow was struck, Mr. Robertson went forward, and he had to sit down on the ground.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the Queen's Bench prison about the latter end of June.

               <p>not to be trifled with—in consequence of what De Salvi said, I communi<lb/>cated with other persons—in consequence of what De Salvi said, I did appre<lb/>hend personal violence from him—at the end of June, or beginning of July, De Salvi came, and Mr. Manson, a prisoner was present, and De Salvi then said I should regret it if I did not make terms—it was from De Salvi's general con<lb/>duct and language that I apprehended bodily harm—when De Salvi, Gower, and Mr. Thompson came, I asked Gower to sit down—he said, 'I will not sit down with such a villain'—I am positive those were the exact words—it was about five or six minutes after they came into the room before the first blow was struck—De Salvi and Gower were standing close to each other, and before any, blow was struck Gower pat his hand on De Salvi's shoulder, and said to him, 'As long as I have a sovereign in my pocket, I will not desert you'—Gower said I should find them ugly customers, and that they, would pull together—when the first blow was struck, Gower was close to De Salvi, with his left arm on the mantelpiece—the expression made use of by Gower, 'Give it to the villain,' was while I was in the chair, and before I was on the ground—I think I was struck three times on the ground, and Gower did not leave whilst the blows were given—I should think it was not more than two minutes from the first to the last blow—I had a straggle with De Salvi, by putting my arm out to prevent his striking me—Gower did not interfere—after the first blow way struck, I cried out 'Murder!' several times, directly I received the first blow, and continued calling out—Gower heard me, and did not interfere—after I called out 'Murder!' Gower said, 'Give it the villain.'—Robert Hender<lb/>son Robertson, his x mark."</p>
