Another Evidence deposed, That he-being put in possession of Murth's Goods by the Lord of the Mannor, found a Musick-book, with Doctor Grant's Name to it behind a picture, and a pocket Book, wherein was an Account of the Robberies committed by him in the Year 1716.

The Prosecutor deposed that Rochford came to his Shop, pretending to buy a Diamond Ring, he asked him, what price? he told him about 10 l. that he shew'd him one about that price, and the Prisoner bid him 5 l. for it; whereupon he looking in the Case to shew him one of 5 l. price; the Prisoner pointed at several, that there were five shew'd him; that immediately in comes Follard and asks for two Gold Rings, which he shew'd him, but they proved too heavy; and that then he seeing him looking for the Ring, was very urgent to be shew'd other Rings, saying, he was in haste, and if he would not serve him he would go to another Shop, that he shew'd him two others, and weigh'd them, he bought them for 23 s. and 6 d. and paid him for them, and was going away, while he saw him earnestly looking for the Diamond Ring.

The Evidences deposed likewise, that Rochford being search'd, had no more than a Board-piece of Gold and half a Guinea to pay for the 10 l. Ring he asked for; and that Follard after he had paid for his two Gold Rings, had about 4 s. and 6 d. left. The Prisoners denied the Fact, and Follard said he only took up the four Rings to see the Beauty of them.

In answer to which, he gave himself the Character of so fair a Dealer that way, that he never took any Money of his Clients, till he had perform'd their Business.
