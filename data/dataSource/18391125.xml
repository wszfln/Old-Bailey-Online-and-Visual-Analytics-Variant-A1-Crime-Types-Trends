Barclay and Co., pay to self 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as advised by Messrs. Gurney and Co. "—he said, "I am indebted to you something; if you let me have 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on this I will call or send you an order at the beginning of the week to make up the deficiency"—I let him have the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., supposing this to be a genuine paper, and that there was money in the bankers' hands to meet it—he told me if I went for it on Monday, or paid it to any of my tradespeople, or at the bank, it was as good as the Bank of England—I presented it, but it was not paid—I saw Mr. Chaston at the bank.</p>

Gurney, to see if your statement was correct, and then I went to the banker's, and there was no effects—I did not say if this money was paid I would forego the prosecution—the money was never tendered me—some one came, and said something about it, but that was after it was out of my hands—after you were committed they offered me the money, and I referred them to</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the banking-house of Robert Barclay, Bevan, and Co. I have seen this cheque—we had no orders transmitted to us to meet it—I know that by reference to the books—we have an account with Messrs. Gurney's—if an order of this kind had been received from them I must have known it—the cheque was produced to me—I referred to the advice-book, and there were no orders—I have written "NO" at the corner—Messrs. Gurneys reside at Norwich—they have no London house—we are their agents—the prisoner kept no account with us.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> How many banks have Gurney and Co.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About twenty-one, I believe—we have had cheques presented when there was no advice, but we do not pay them—we have paid cheques, expecting that the advice would arrive—if this had been presented as it is now I should have had a demur about paying it without the sanction of the firm, as it bas not "or bearer" on it—sometimes they put the words "or bearer" on it themselves.</p>

I traversed this case from last Session, thinking I should have had a witness from Vienna, but as I do not think I should have been able to produce him, I did not traverse again—I have had considerable experience in banking-houses in London for fourteen years, and I have seen similar cheques to this, which have been paid—the sum of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was to have been paid into one of Messrs.

               <p>I was surprised by being taken up—I was irritated, and said, "How could you think of treating me in the way yon have done?"—he said he did not care, he would go on—I went before Mr. Twyford and ex<lb/>plained the case—he dismissed the case, and in a few days I was taken again.</p>

On Saturday afternoon, the 9th of November, (Lord Mayor's-day,) between four and five o'clock, I was going along Cheapside towards St. Paul's—there came a mob down from the west towards the Mansion-house, and two men arm-in-arm stood before me, evidently to prevent my getting on—they quitted me suddenly—I fancied that my watch and chain were gone, but I felt, and found the chain had broken at the ring connecting it with the watch, and the watch was left In the fob—I said I was robbed, and the persons standing by me said, "Yes, and this is the man that robbed you, sir," taking the prisoner—I lost my gold watch-chain, seals, and key.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Greenhill, Harrow. On the 20th of October, on going round my farm, I missed a Welsh sheep, which I had seen the day before—I had one hundred altogether, and they were right the day before—I went round the field, and in a ditch found the skin and entrails tied up together—the skin was marked "R I "—the initials of the man that brought them from Wales—I found foot-marks by the skin, and traced them about a mile and a quarter or a mile and a half—I went afterwards with the patrol to the prisoner's house—I traced the footsteps to there—the prisoner was at the door—the patrol told him I had lost a sheep, and he had come in search of it—the prisoner said he had not got any thing but what belonged to him, and he might search—I remained outside while they went in—I afterwards went into the cottage, and saw in a dish on the table the head and, legs, a small piece of pluck, and about half the loin—they were all boiled—I asked him bow he came by the meat—he said that was his business—he said he had bought it of a man who was driving a drove through to at place—I asked if he knew the meat—he said, No"—he afterwards said he did know him—that he would not tell me who he was than, but he would another day.</p>

The prisoner came to me on the 23rd of October, and told me my husband had fallen overboard with a basket of bottles, and that he was waiting for a change of clothes, which he had come for—I gave him a great-coat, a pair of trowsers, a pair of stockings, a shirt, and an apron—he said my husband had laughed at him for falling over, and now he had got the laugh at him—I gave him the things, believing this story.</p>

I am the daughter of the late General Brooks—the prisoner came into our service on the 7th of January—I had a sister, whose husband was abroad in February—she died on the 30th of March—I attended her up to the time of her death—she had a rosewood dressing-case containing a variety of jewellery—after her death I collected the articles belonging to her, and put them into her dressing-case—there was a pearl necklace worth about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., two dia-mond rings and other articles, worth altogether between 50 and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—Mr. Clark, the brother of my sister's husband, had sealed the dressing-case in my presence, put it into a leather case, tied a piece of red tapeover it, and I brought it to my own house, and placed it in my bed-room—I had no idea of its having been opened up to the 22nd of September, the prisoner continued in our service, and on the 22nd of September she asked leave to go out—I said, "You may go out, but don't be gone six hours"—she said she should not be gone more than five minutes—she went, taking the key of the street<lb/>door with her, and never returned—I did not suspect any thing till about a fortnight after—I then lifted up the case, and found the rosewood box and its contents gone—my children were aware of the contents of the dressing-case—they very often talked to the prisoner about it, and I heard her say, if she had one of the diamond rings she could make her fortune, and she would go to Ireland—I did not hear any thing of her till October, when I found her in possession of clothes which she had not when with me—I have since seen a gold watch, ear-rings, and brooch, which were in the dressing-case—this is part of the property lost—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Michael Hawthorn, and live in Fleur-de-Lis-street, Spitalfields—the prisoner lived in the ground floor of our house—On Tuesday evening, the 29th of October, I was in my room on the first floor—I heard a noise in his room, opened my door, and stood on the stairs, imagining he was quarrelling with the woman he lives with—I heard him say to his child, "Turn out"—I went down stairs, and saw the child run out—as I came down stairs I met the prisoner in the passage and caught him by the arm as he was striking the child, and entreated him not to strike the child, who was then gone out of the house—the prisoner was following him—he made me no answer, but followed the child, and struck him in the street—it was a dark night, and I could not tell what he struck him with—he then caught him by the shoulder, dragged him several paces along the street, brought him back again to the door, caught him by the shoulder, and threw him into the gutter facing the door—he held him by one hand and threw him down—I think the child's other shoulder came against the ground—he kept his head up—I do not think it touched the ground—I ran over, pushed him from the child, and took the child from him—I screamed loudly, which attracted the attention of persons who came round—I took the child into my own room, and found the blood streaming from his head—the child was always very dirty and very much neglected—a person took him from me and washed him—there was dirt and blood together on his head—I gave him a piece of bread and butter, and he ate it very eagerly—the prisoner told me some time before that the child was six years old—he was rather small for his age—his mother has been dead three years—it was the first time I had seen him ill-use the child—he has lived there nine weeks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a musician, and live in Little Wild-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields. On the evening of the 12th of November, a few minutes after six o'clock, I was sitting in my kitchen, by the fire-place, with the prisoner's wife, who was living with me—she had separated from her husband, and had lived with me nearly eleven months—I heard a knock at the kitchen door—I said, "Walk in," and the prisoner immediately rushed into the kitchen—Mrs. Levy caught him round the body, to pre<lb/>vent his coming in—I attempted to get up from my chair and approach him, and, directly I did so, he struck out his arm, and struck me in the temple with a clasp-knife, which appeared to be ready-drawn for the pur<lb/>pose—I had no opportunity of separating him from his wife, for the blow was inflicted the moment I got up—I had not touched him—he struck me over his wife's shoulder—he did it wilfully—it cut me an inch in length, and it bled for about three hours—I was attended by a surgeon—it was rather a deep wound, nearly to the bone—I was ill at the time—I had not been out of bed four hours from an attack of rheumatic fever—I was confined to my house in consequence of the wound—the surgeon attended me a week, both for the fever and the wound—at the time the prisoner struck me he said, "There, you——, take that; and come up stairs, and will give it you again"—he went quietly up stairs, to the iron railing in front of the house—he did not offer to strike me again—there was a light in the kitchen—the prisoner's wife went and fetched a policeman, and I gave him in charge—he had assaulted me before, and was committed from Bow-street on the 20th of August, and cautioned not to molest me again—I suppose it was on account of my living with his wife—she came to live with me voluntarily.</p>

On the 6th of November I went into the ware house, and saw him behind a pile of waistcoating—he was shuffling about, and moving a piece of goods, and putting it straight at the top—I saw him then throw something under the counter—directly he saw. me he said there were three packs we ex<lb/>pected from Manchester that morning, and I had better go and fetch the book to <hi rend="italic">copy</hi> the weights—I said, "No, they must bring it in themselves"—I staid in the warehouse, and after some time I saw him take the duster, and rub down the counter—he then took some paper, and what he had got under the counter, huddled it together, and walked to the top of the cellar stairs—I asked what he had got—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "Let me see"—he fell down on his knees, and said, "For God's sake don't any a word about it, and then he showed me two pieces of waistcoating which he had got—I told him I would not stand by, and see my master robbed—he said he would make amends for it at the end of the week—I said that would not do—he immediately put on his hat, and went outside the door with the waistcoating—soon after Mr. Coates came in—these are the two pieces of waistcoating he showed me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Alexander Mackay, a piano-forte<lb/>maker—he lives in Little Drummond-street, Euston-square—I got into an omnibus, to go to the Bank, between two and three o'clock in the after<lb/>noon, on the 4th of November—when I got in I sat on the right-hand side, going down the New-road—I sat two from the door—the prisoner was in the omnibus when I got in—he made room for me to sit by his side—he sat the third on my right hand, on the same side—I wore my pocket on the side next to him—I had a shawl over my gown—after I had been in about two minutes I felt a touch at my pocket—I had some keys in my pocket—I felt them pressed against me—I was putting my hand to my pocket, when I felt a second touch, and the prisoner directly said to the conductor that he wanted to get out, and told him to stop—I found that my pocket had been picked, and I said "You have robbed me"—my money had been in a purse—the money was taken out, and the purse put back, and it was the putting it back that I felt—I had known it was safe not one minute before I got in—I have sometimes found the snap of the purse loose—there was in it one half-crown, six shillings, and one six-pence—I lost it all—I gave the prisoner into custody—when I detained him, another man with a cloak on, who had been sitting opposite the prisoner, left the omnibus—I was the last person that got in—I said I had lost 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at first, but when I counted it up, I had the odd halfpence of the sixpence in my pocket—I had 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. exactly, I am sure, when I got in—I had this money about me before I got in, and I had 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my pocket—one of the shillings I had was a new shilling—the prisoner was searched by an officer directly he was taken to the station-house, and the exact sum that I had in my purse was found in his waistcoat-pocket—one sixpence, one half-crown, and six shillings—the prisoner said, when I accused him of robbing me, he would rather give me all the money he had on him than be exposed—he would give me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if he had it—this is the money—I believe it to be the money I had—the bright shilling is among them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a whip-maker, and live in Burlington Arcade. On the morning of the 8th of November I went to Mr. Cheek's shop, at half-past eight o'clock, from information I had received, and found the prisoner behind the counter—the door was, to every appearance, fast, and the padlock and staple in its place—I had no idea I could get in at the door—I went and peeped in through the window—I then gently pushed the door, and the padlock fell down, and the staple with it—I went and found the prisoner behind the counter—he seemed in a confused state, but was doing nothing then—he was standing there, with the goods on the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a letter-carrier at the Post-office. On the morning of the 28th of October I was in Maiden-lane, standing upon the canal bridge—I saw a chaise-cart coming down the lane—the horse was at a full gallop—there were two persons in the cart—the prisoner was driving and another sitting—there were some cans and mop-handles in it—when it got to the top of the bridge I observed the man who was. sitting by the pri<lb/>soner, speak to him, and the prisoner laughed—I did not observe him whip the horse at all, nor attempt to stop it—I saw them get opposite the Albion public-house, and saw two men coming out of Collard's dust yard, one a little in advance of the other—they did not come through the regular gate, but a place where some palings had been pulled down—they were walking,—they stepped off the foot-path, and made a start forward to cross the road just before the horse—the foremost man succeeded in getting across—the second tried to get across, but finding he could not get past the horse, he made a swing round, when the near shaft struck him in the back—he fell forward, but in falling he caught the shaft, and was dragged several yards—the horse was in the centre of the road at the time the man was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183911250040"/>
               <p>struck, but while he was hanging on, the horse got close up to the foot<lb/>path on the left-hand side of the road, which was the side he had stepped off of—just as the horse got to the foot-path, the man left go or was thrown from his hold and fell forward on his face, with his head to the foot-path and his feet in the road, lying in a slanting direction—the near wheel took him just across the hip, and passed over his back from left to right—several people ran and picked him up, and carried him to the Albion pub<lb/>lic house, and afterwards to the hospital—the cart went on a short distance, and then the prisoner stopped—I was behind the cart after the shaft struck the man, and could not see him—I did not observe him attempt to pull up before it struck him—if he had made a dead stop instead of going over the road, he could not have been run over—he might have seen the cart coming if he looked that way—he could see into the road out of the yard—when he stepped off the foot-path on the road he began to run directly—step<lb/>ping off the foot-path into the road, which is a descent, gave him rather an impetus.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at Puckeridge, in Hertfordshire. On the 25th of October I was going from the Bell and Crown public-house, Holborn, to Puckeridge, between three and four o'clock—I had a bag con<lb/>taining the articles stated—I left it inside the booking-office, and walked to and fro in front of the office door a little way, waiting for the coach—I returned in five or ten minutes, and found the bag gone—I saw it again about two minutes afterwards—I cannot exactly say who had got it—a number of people came round the door, and the two prisoners were in cus<lb/>tody—I distinctly saw James in custody, but not the other, at the moment—I was rather confused at the time—the bag and the articles in it are my property.</p>

About twenty minutes before four o'clock I saw the prisoner Miller go into the coach-office, take the bag out, and give it to James, who was standing at the corner of Leather-lane, about twenty yards from the coach-office, I think—Miller said, "Here, Jack," and James came to him—they walked as far as Leather-lane, and then Miller gave him the bag—I asked Aldridge, my fellow-servant, who was standing there, if the bag did not belong to one of his passengers—he said it did—I said, "There are two young men just gone up Leather-lane with it"—we followed them up</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, and live in Wilmore-gardens, Kingsland-road. On Sunday night, the 27th of October, I had been to see some friends at the West, between eleven and twelve o'clock—I went to a house in St. Giles's with a woman—I suppose it was a brothel—I was drunk, so much so I did not know then what I did; but after I got into a room there were two women—I sent one out for some liquor, and the prisoner was left in the room—I suppose I fell asleep—when I awoke I found my waistcoat and neckcloth off, and two sovereigns were gone, which were wrapped up in my waistcoat, in a piece of paper with red letters on it, two knives, and a pin—I spoke to the people who came up into the room,</p>

               <p>and while speaking to them the prisoner came up—there was nothing in my hat then, but, as I was going down stairs, my cravat and pin were have in to my hat—somebody must have dropped them in, as I am confident they were not there before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I said, "That is the man"—I saw him drop the loaves, and I picked them up. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>.

On the 28th of September he asked me for a piece of print for a shipper or merchant to offer as a sample of a lot—he had had patterns previously—he returned, and said he had shown the print to the shippers—I gave him a piece of twenty-eight yards, and after be had it I inquired who it was for—he said it was for Dunsford and Turner—he was to take an order for the goods—I meant to them to Dunsford and Turner—he did not come back to bring me the money—he ought to have left the print at Dunsford and Turner's, or to have brought me the money, if they had bought it—he did not bring back the goods—he came back on several occasions after—I asked him when the sale was to take place—he stated that Dunsford and Turner's agent or agents in Manchester were purchasing for them at the time, and they were waiting to receive an account of what goods their agent had purchased—some few days after the 28th of October, he not having come for some time, I went to Dunsford and Turner's—when I caught the prisoner I asked him what he had done with the goods he had—he refused to give any account of them—I sent for a policeman, and gave him into custody—the goods are here now—these are what I gave him to sell.</p>

I have made no deposition—on the 4th of Oc<lb/>tober the prisoner came to the warehouse, and asked for a piece of goods to show to the same parties that he had had them for before—he did not name who, I knew he bad the goods for a shipper—he put his hand on this piece, and said, "I want one of these"—I took and threw it down on the counter—either he or one of the young men took it up, and I saw the pri<lb/>soner leave the ware-room with it.</p>

I have known the prisoner about two years—I have occasionally employed him for steering the craft up and down the canal—I was at the Rose and Crown public-house on the 29th of September—the prisoner came in with another man afterwards—while I was passing to go out, the other man held me, while the prisoner took my money out <hi rend="italic">of</hi> my pocket—he took four shillings and one sixpence—I called the landlord—I held him—in five or six minutes the man who were with him got away—they threat<lb/>ened to <hi rend="italic">punch</hi> my head for interfering with them—I accused the prisoner of robbing me—the landlord came—I kept the prisoner—the landlord searched him—he said he had no money, and none was found on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brick-maker, and live in Broad-yard, Lower-road, Islington—the prisoner is my brother—Sarah Bailey is my sister. Last Monday week I was engaged in removing some things of hers, to her house in York-street—between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the back-parlour of her house with my brother-in-law, Benjamin Bailey—the prisoner came in, took Bailey by the hand, kissed him, and said he was a murderer—he did not say of whom—he said nothing more than I have said—he produced a rope from his pocket, but said nothing, and he produced the key of his door to his sister—he lived in Lower Chapman-street—he did not say what he produced the key for—we then accompanied him to the coach-stand in St. Luke's, and went in a coach to Chapman-street, with my wife and sister—he wished us to go with him the coach stopped before we came to his house, in a street in Chapman</p>

               <p>street—I cannot say who paid for the coach—I know the Chapman's Arms public-house, kept by Pedder—the prisoner and I went into the Chap<lb/>man's Arms public-house, and the women went over to the green-grocer's—the Chapman's Arms is not far from the prisoner's house—the prisoner called for a pint of half-and-half and a pipe of tobacco, and I had a pipe—I did not believe what he had said, that he was a murderer—he was not sober then—he appeared drunk when he came to me—I did not rely on what he said—he and his wife were both in the habit of drinking, and when drunk were very quarrelsome and very passionate—I cannot say how long we staid at the public-house—it was not half-an-hour—I did not smoke my pipe out before we went away—I do not recollect whether I saw Kaines—after being in the public-house a short time, the prisoner took the half-and-half into the tap-room or parlour, I do not know which, and I went out to see for my wife and sister—they were over at the green-grocer's—I did not hear any conversation with any body in the public-house—I do not recollect whether Kaines was there—when I went to the green<lb/>grocer's I left the prisoner in the Chapman's Arms—I went with my wife and sister towards the prisoner's house—my sister had the key—she tried to open the door, but could not, and I unlocked it—we all went in but my wife—she came in in a few minutes, but could not stay, and went back again—this was between four and five o'clock—it was the shop-door I opened—the shop was dark—when the door was opened my sister felt about—I do not remember her saying any thing—I could not discern any portion of the body of the deceased, it was too dark—the prisoner fetched a light—he had not come to us from the public-house—when we came from the green-shop he was coming out of the door, and we went down together—he went to fetch a light, and returned with one—when he brought the light, I discovered his wife lying on the floor of the shop, dead—I was agitated, and did not take particular notice of the body.</p>

On the Monday afternoon in question I was at the Chapman's Arms public-house, about five o'clock—I saw the prisoner there—I knew him before—he came in with his brother, the last witness, while I was standing there—he accosted me by name, and asked me either to give him some tobacco, or had I got any tobacco—I said I had not, but I would fetch him some—I was receiving some money at the house—it is a corner house—the prisoner passed me, and was about to go out at the other door—he</p>

               <p>had come in at one, and was going out at the other—this was not a minute after he spoke to me about the tobacco—his brother caught hold of him by both collars of his coat, and said, "Bill, you shall not go, you are a murderer, you hare murdered your wife, and his brother said the Almighty required him for something—but the rest of the sentence I lost—the prisoner said nothing to that—I looked at him, and saw he was very agitated, and very pale—he must have heard what his brother said—when I looked at him, I noticed some blood on his shirt collar, and one of his hands was covered with blood—I cannot remember which hand, as I did not notice—it was not spots of blood on his shirt-collar, but as if it was a smear with the thumb, or something—when the brother took hold of him by the collar, I asked the brother if it was so—he seemed agitated, and said it was, and that his wife laid dead on the floor of the shop—he said that in the hearing of the prisoner—the brother appeared very much agitated—the landlord of the house was about to send one of his sons for an officer, and I intimated to him, by a nod of the head, that I would fetch one—I went immediately to the prisoner's house, and found two females standing on the step of the door, crying—I believe it was the two witnesses—the door was shut at that time—I brought a policeman to the public-house, and when I got there the prisoner and his brother were gone—the landlord gave me some information, in consequence of which I went after the prisoner, towards his own house—I passed through the Rein Deer public-house in Richard-street, into James-street, and found the pri<lb/>soner towards the Commercial-road end of the street, walking in a direc<lb/>tion to the Commercial-road, which is in a direction from his own house—there was no one with him—I and the policeman went up to him—I said to him, "Where are you going?"—he said, "I am going up here"—I said, "Come along with me"—he turned round to come with me, and the policeman laid hold of him—he said he did not want any policeman, he would not go with a policeman—I said, "Come with me, you and I will walk together," and him and me walked arm-in-arm to the station-house, the policeman sometimes behind, and sometimes by the side of us—he went with me quietly to the station-house after that conversation—after he was searched, I went back to his house, and saw the body of the deceased lying on the floor, close to the back door, with her head to the fire-place, quite dead, and appeared to have been dead some hours, two hours, I might say, for she was quite cold—the inspector was there before me—I was not acquainted with the deceased.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at No. 3, New-road, St. George's in the East—I knew the deceased—I saw her for the first time on Monday afternoon, the 18th of November—about ten minutes after two o'clock I received a message to go to the house—I got there about a quarter past two o'clock—I was detained some time knocking at the door before I could get in—Hall let me in, and the deceased came down from up stairs—I found her in a nervous condition, and after a little conversation with her, she had two distinct hysterical attacks—as if she had been excited—she was perfectly rational and decidedly sober—she continued under each attack from two to three or four minutes—women are much subject to hysterics—it will arise from any exciting cause—either violence in the conduct of the person attacked, or from violence or quarrelling of any body else—the soon recovered—while I was there Mr. Cordy's brother brought some me<lb/>dicine—the latter part of my conversation with the deceased was with regard to a pain she felt in her back—the prisoner was not present—she assigned a cause for that pain—I inquired of the gentleman who brought the medicine, the composition of it, by her desire—it was an effervescing mixture, a draught calculated to quiet her and tranquillize the system—in my judgment, she did not require any thing else—there was nothing at all in her conduct or in her answers to my questions which denoted to me that it was unsafe to leave her by herself, nor any thing to denote that she was not perfectly self-possessed—she came down to me in the shop—I was in the shop ten minutes or. a quarter of an hour—if there had been a cord suspended to a beam there I should have observed it—I did not observe it—I had opportunities of observing, being by myself some time—the place the cord hung from was afterwards pointed out to me by the offi<lb/>cers,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183911250078"/>
               <p>and I should say it could not have escaped my attention—the prisoner came in while I was there—I knew him before—I knew his person—he had been drinking—I observed no excitement about him beyond what might be the result of taking drink—when I came away I left the prisoner, the deceased, and Mr. Cordy's brother in the shop—the prisoner did not administer any medicine to her in my presence—I think he went to fetch a cup for her to take it in—I was remunerated for my attendance by the deceased, in the prisoner's presence—the prisoner was present when she desired me to ex<lb/>amine the medicine—her object was, as I had been questioning her as to her symptoms, and knew more of her state than the gentleman who had not seen her before, she wished me to ascertain whether it was proper for her to take—she appeared to be alive to the propriety of taking care of herself—she was particular about my examining the medicine—after I got home, I received another message from the inspector of police, at half-past five o'clock—I proceeded immediately to the house—I found a great many persons outside the house, and in the room besides—I saw inspector Nor<lb/>man there—I saw the body of the deceased between the foot of the stairs and the door leading into the yard—she was with her face fronting the door—her knees were drawn up, the left arm under her body, and the right lying on the body—on examining the head and face I found a consi<lb/>derable number of wounds, they were on the face and neck and head—there were eight in number, and with one exception they all partook of the character of incised wounds—that one was rather a stab, a puncture, a contusion—it was not exactly a bruise—the largest, the deepest, and most important of the incised wounds was on the left side of the neck—that in<lb/>cision measured four inches at least in length and two inches in depth, but not all the way, more in the centre of the wound—in that incision all the principal and main arteries of the left side of the neck with the veins and nerves were totally divided—the windpipe was severed through, with the exception of a small portion at the posterior part—in my judgment it was a mortal wound, and death would ensue in a very short time—a querter of an hour, perhaps, or twenty minutes—the arteries on the right side would have carried on the functions of life for a short time—she was a slight spare woman—immediately above this large wound was another, as if there had been a previous attempt—it was parallel with it and merely dividing the skin, merely superficial, and of no importance at all—the next wound of importance was on the lower lip—in that incision the upper part of the lower lip was divided through—the wound took a curved direction to the left—it went right through the upper part of the lip, and was to the extent of two inches and a half—there would have been considerable hemor<lb/>rhage from it, and it divided important arteries—it was a deep wound—the next was on the right side, opposite the other, on the same lip—it divided the skin and a portion of the lip and took a straight direction—that was not mortal—the fifth was on the right side above the lip on the cheek—that incision was merely cutaneous—the sixth incised wound was opposite the right eye—that incision extended through the skin and some considerable portion of the muscles and flesh, aid took a straight direction—it was about an inch and a half or two inches in length, and about half an inch in depth—the seventh was behind the right ear—it was a short but deep incised wound—it extended to the bone, which is rather prominent just there—I should say it was half an inch deep, that I also consider an incised wound—the eighth was on the right cheek, that was deep and partook of the character</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183911250079"/>
               <p>of a punctured wound—it was far different to the others, and in the inflic<lb/>tion of which there must have been some considerable force used—it went to the bone—it slanted off a little at the side of the bone—it did not pene<lb/>trate into the mouth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at the instrument which lies before you; with regard to the first wound you speak of, is that razor such an instrument as would have inflicted such a wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Decidedly so; the other wounds about the left cheek, the lower lip, and the back of the ear, might also have been inflicted by such an instrument, and on reflection, I have thought that the wound on the right cheek would correspond with this part of the razor—(<hi rend="italic">pointing it out</hi>)—I understand what is called <hi rend="italic">jobbing</hi> with a knife—that wound was not done with a <hi rend="italic">job</hi> of a sharp instrument, but I think it must have been done with the upper part of the razor, from its appearance, and the direction it took—I do not think it could be done with the heel of the razor—the wound was not of that shape.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment could those wounds be inflicted on the deceased by herself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Decidedly not—according to my judgment the large wound commenced at the back part of the left side of the neck—the body was lying on its left side.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is your reason for saying the wounds could not have been in<lb/>flicted by the deceased herself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Judging from the position of the deceased, lying on her left side, with her left arm under her body, corresponding to the wound in the throat, with an immense quantity of blood on the floor, the manner. in which the razor was found, and knowing her previous con<lb/>stitution, and after the infliction of those wounds on the face, in my opi<lb/>nion it would be impossible to inflict that on the throat—assuming that the wounds on the other part of the face had been first inflicted, I consider it impossible she could inflict that large wound on the throat, they were of such a serious extent—she would not have power to inflict that on the throat—there would have been considerable hemorrhage from the one on the lip especially—assuming the wound in the throat to have been first in<lb/>flicted, it would have been quite impossible for her to have inflicted the others—the blood would have been so great it would have immediately exhausted her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Looking at the nature of the wounds, the quantity of blood, and the position of the body, can you undertake to say with certainty whether or not those wounds must have been inflicted while she was on the ground? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were; especially the wound on the neck—supposing her to have inflicted the wounds on the other part of her person, and fallen from ex<lb/>haustion, I should say it would be impossible that she could inflict the larger one when on the ground—the prisoner had not applied to me for a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of his wife's body—there was no appearance of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> about her on my first visit, nor any appearance afterwards which could account for it—I did not in any way give the prisoner to understand that she had died of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>, nor say any thing about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at that old rope; supposing it to have been suspended in the shop, is it possible or probable that that rope would have given way with the prisoner's weight, supposing he had attempted to hang himself with it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If he had been suspended with all his weight on the rope, I should say it would have given way, but there is another mode of strangling by being on the ground—I should say if his weight was hanging on that rope, it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183911250080"/>
               <p>would have given way—I cannot say whether the same consequence would have taken place if the deceased had put herself in that rope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Regard being had to the state you found her in at a quarter-past two o'clock, was she a woman, in your judgment, who about three o'clock would have been able to make any successful resistance to an attack? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She appeared quite incapable at my visit to her, for even in common con<lb/>versation she had two hysterical attacks, but not knowing her general constitution, I cannot answer—I do not think she was in a state to have used sufficient violence to inflict the wound on the cheek, which must have been inflicted with violence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> With regard to the possibility of the wounds being self-inflicted, I observe, you hesitated before you gave your answer; did that arise from any doubt on the subject? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not at all—I certainly give it as my perfect conviction, that it would be impossible for her to inflict all the wounds herself—I consider it impossible a person could inflict wounds on the neck and face, from the nature of the wounds and their extent—after the seven on the face, it would be impossible to inflict the one on the neck, and after inflicting the one on the neck, it would be impossible to inflict the other seven.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Bose, who keeps the King of Prussia public-house, in George-street, Whitechapel. The prisoner was employed by us as a jobbing carpenter—we went into the house about three weeks before we were robbed—the prisoner came on Monday, the 21st of October, to fix a bedstead—while he was in the house, I went to my bed-room, and found a box in which I kept money with the lock forced, and the screws almost out—this was three or four days before the robbery—I went down to the prisoner, who was at work in the club-room, and said it was very strange, the screws were forced, and I was in the habit of keeping my money there, and I should remove it—he said, "If I was you, I would"—I said I would put it into my drawer, which I did—after that, I went to a drawer in my bed-room, to get change for a sovereign, while the prisoner was at work in the room—he saw me go to the drawer—I locked the drawer, as usual—on Tuesday, the day before I missed my money, I found all my money safe at ten o'clock in the morning—the pri<lb/>soner had finished his work in the house on the Monday, the 28th, and left his tools behind him—he had no business there on Tuesday, but he came between eleven and twelve o'clock, and asked the servant for his tools—I saw him in the house—I saw him come down stairs, while we were dining in the parlour—he had no business up-stairs at all—I had some drawers in an upper room, which had not been put into the chest, and there were locks on all of them—having just moved, we did not put the drawers in their places, they were lying about, and after the robbery I missed a lock off one of those drawers—the same key opened all the drawers—when I went to my drawer, on Wednesday, the lock had not been forced—it must have been opened by a key—I lost a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver—I have two small children, and one servant—it was a very serious loss, for we had saved it to pay our brewer.</p>

I am the prosecutor's servant I recollect the prisoner being employed to work in the house, which he finished on Monday the 28th—he left his tools behind him—he came on Tuesday to fetch them, and I saw him coming down stairs—I had not seen him go up stairs—he had no business there—I was in the parlour—he came to me, and asked me to give him his tools, which were in the bed-room—I went and got them, and gave them to him in the club-room—the bed-room door opens into the club-room—I left him there—in the evening I went into the club-room, and found the tools still on the table, where I had left them—he had not taken them away—I saw mistress in her bed-room about ten o'clock on Tuesday morning—I went into the room for change for a half-sovereign, and she gave me the change out of the drawer—the money was then safe.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On the 11th of October the prosecutrix was brought to the London-hospital, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon—she had several wounds on the left-side of her head, and the upper and back part of her head—they were wounds of a serious description, and were dangerous—there were two on the left-side of the head, of nearly equal size, about an inch and a half long, dividing the flesh from the bone—they were such wounds as might be made with a quart-pot—she is not yet discharged from the hospital—I do not consider her perfectly out of danger now—she was not senseless when she came in, but she seemed stupid—she seemed to have been drinking, but was not in liquor—her breath smelt of liquor.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Whitcombe-street, Leicester-square, at Mr. Saphill's, who married my sister—I am a working jeweller, in the employ of Brown and Kay, manufacturing jewellers, Tavistock-row, and have been nearly eight years in their employ. On Monday, the 30th of September, I was walking to my lodging from Brown and Kay's, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I think nearer eight, and saw the prisoner Henry—I stopped to look at some books at a shop in St. Martin s-court, and he came up and remarked on the cheapness of them—I said, they were so—I put the book I had in my hand down, and walked on to Leicester-square—he walked with me as far as my own door, and then wished me good night—he had followed me and entered into conversation—on the evening of the 1st of October I had just come from my own house to go out for a walk after business, about half-past eight o'clock—I was passing down my own street, and at the corner of James-street Heny came up to me and said, "How do yon do, sir?"—this was about four houses from my own house—I acknowledged the compliment and walked on—he followed, and entered into conversation with me—I went down</p>

               <p>the street towards Charing-cross, and passed on through Charing<lb/>cross past the Horse-guards—he still continued walking with me—I kept straight on down the street towards the front of Westminster<lb/>abbey, not Parliament-street, hut the street on the right hand side—I went on down Dean-street, and when we got down Dean-street, near the corner of Peter-street, he seemed suddenly to recollect himself and he remarked that a friend and himself were going to open an eating-house, that the men were at work on the premises, and be would go and see how they got on, and would I go with him—I went with him to No. 66, Peter-street, as I have since ascertained, it was about the middle of the street—when we got to the door, he took a key from his pocket and opened the side door in the passage close to the street door—he went in first, I did not follow him immediately—I did not intend to go in, but he turned round and asked me to step in, which I did—the moment 1 had stepped in, he closed the door and seizing me by the collar, said, "Now you are in my power"—there was a candle burning on a little shelf in the corner in the shop, which was under repair—there were workmen's tools there—I said, "What do you mean?"—he said, "I will show you what I mean; let us see what you have about you"—I struggled with him to get loose—he said, it was of no use, he would call the police, and give me in charge for unnatural practices, if I attempted to make the least noise—he then tore open my waist<lb/>coat and trowsers, turned my pockets inside out, and took from my trowsers' pocket 1 sovereign, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and some halfpence—at that moment 1 heard footsteps in the passage, and a man's voice call out "Henry"—Henry did not answer, and I heard footsteps go to the back of the house, and I saw Taunton throw open a sash-window, and come into the place where we were—I am certain he is the man—Henry was about removing my watch<lb/>guard from my neck at the time he 'came in—it was a black ribbon—Taunton said, "Holloa. Henry, what have you got there?"—Henry re<lb/>plied, "Oh, it is all right, a regular b---"—after that Henry proceeded to take the rings from my fingers—I resisted him rather faintly, I confess, for I was in great trembling and fear—Taunton then said he would fetch in the policeman, and give me in charge—Henry said, Oh, never mind, let him go, we have got all we can"—he let go of me, and I then made my way into the street, and got home as well as I could.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183911250112"/>
               <p>not make a memorandum of them—I am quite certain Taunton said he would give me in charge—I have always been quite sure about that—I was very much confused and agitated—the door of the room could not have been fast, for directly I put my hand against it, it opened outwardly—I did not say he locked the door—I said he closed it—that has always been my opi<lb/>nion—I struggled with Henry before Taunton came in—we did not make much noise, except the noise of our feet—it was after that that Taunton came in at the window—I never saw Taunton from that time till he was taken into custody—he never came to me, nor asked for any thing—I had never seen him before, to my knowledge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am butler to Thomas Metcalfe, Esq., of No. 24, Fitzroy-square, and have been so for sixteen years; I have the charge of his plate. I have known the prisoner fifteen or sixteen years—he is a schoolmaster, and a teacher of languages—on the 9th of March last I employed him to teach me French, and he was teaching another person in the house reading, writing, and arithmetic—I used to take my French lessons in general in the butler's pantry—the plate we had in daily use was kept in a drawer in the pantry, and during the day that drawer was not locked—the prisoner was there twice a-week—between May and Septem<lb/>ber, several articles of plate were missing—on the 7th of November, Stan<lb/>nard made a communication to me while I was in the kitchen, and in con<lb/>sequence of that I requested the prisoner to walk up stairs—I said to him, "Le Maine, you have been taking my master's property"—he said, Do you suppose I would do such a thing?"—I said I was sorry to suppose it, but from the information I had, I was obliged to think so—he said, "If you suspect me, search me"—after a fork had been found on him, I begged him to confess that he had taken the things, and what had become of them, so that we might be able to get them so that we might be able to get them back again, and put them in their back again, and put them in their place—I said if he would tell me where they were, that we could get them back, and nothing further should he said about it—I placed 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into his hand, to go to a shop to get some of the property back—I appointed a friend to go with him knew nothing of it—I put my hand up to her throat, and she spat out two shillings and a halfpenny—I kept my hand to her mouth till we got to the station-house, and then found four shillings more in her mouth.</p>

                  </hi>. I drive the Southgate coach, and live at Southgate. I received a parcel for Mr. Fletcher, a grocer at Southgate—it was put into the boot—I afterwards saw it in the possession of a constable—I had taken it in the morning, but the coach did not pass the place, and at the end of my journey I told the man that Mr. Fletcher would send for it—he did not, and I was bringing it back to London, not aware that it was in the boot, the boot was fastened with an iron catch and key, but not locked.</p>

I saw the prisoner and another boy in company—I watched them about twenty minutes—I saw the Southgate coach pass towards town—they ran after the coach, and got up behind—I followed as far as I could, but could not overtake the coach—I thought I saw them get down, and go down a turning—I went another way, and met the prisoner with this parcel—I asked what he had got—he said, some linen that he was going to take to Hackney-road, and then he said he had it from Mr. Rogers, a linen-draper in Chiswell-street—I took him to the station-house, and found it contained tobacco and cigars—it was tied up in this handkerchief, which does not belong to the parcel.</p>

The prisoner was in his employ as a plumber—this lead was taken from a house—the pri<lb/>soner had access to it—when he left work on the 19th of November I suspected him, and asked him if he had not got something that did not be<lb/>long to him—he denied it—I took him back to the house and found this lead concealed in the waistband of his trowsers—here is 29lbs. of it—I have compared it with some lead on our premises, and it had been cut from it.</p>

On the 20th of November, I was at the Dun Horse public-house, Kingsland-road, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I had two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank-notes in my pocket—I called for a pipe of tobacco, and took one of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes from my pocket in mistake, thinking it was a bit of paper—I broke it in two, and gave one part of it to the boy to go to the fire to get me a light—he did so, and I could not light my pipe with it—I then gave him the other part of the note, he took that to the fire, and then he said it was part of a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I directly put my hand to my pocket, and found I had taken the note in mistake—I took the part of the note and gave it to a man named Reynolds—he saw what number it was, and gave it to me again—I was looking to see the number, and the prisoner who was sitting there came across the room and said, "I can read, I can tell you the number"—he made a grasp at the note, took it out of my hand, and put it into his pocket—I took hold of him and there was a noise—the landlord came in and sent for an officer—I gave the prisoner into custody—the note has not been found.</p>

(which I thought they were)—he said, "They are not geese"—I then found they were ducks—he said he had bought them at Brent<lb/>ford, but he did not know the person he bought them of—I said, "Should you know him again?"—he said, "I don't know that I should"—I also found a shoulder of mutton and some fat on a shelf—there have been several sheep lost in the neighbourhood—I then handcuffed the prisoners and brought away the ducks—I sent for Long, and he identified them.</p>

               <p>knocked at the door in Ashby-street, and went up stairs—the came out in about five minutes—I stopped her, and asked what she had done with the bundle she had under her cloak just now—she said, "I have left it at my sister's"—while I was talking to her, I saw the prisoner, William Lewis, and the man not in custody, who went into the house in Cromer-street with the basket—Lewis saw me, and crossed over to me—the other made his escape—I gave Lewis into the custody of another policeman, and went with Jemima Dorsett and Pocock to No. 22, Ashby-street, where, in the second-floor, front room, I found the prisoner, Cecilia Lewis—I know she lives with William Lewis by seeing them together before—I asked her what she had done with the bundle her sister had left there—she said she had not received any bundle from her sister—I turned up the bed, and between the bed and sacking found these two pictures—Pocock found a bundle in the room—Cecilia Lewis said, "How dare you look at that bun<lb/>dle? don't open it"—she went to snatch it from him, saying it was filthy linen, not fit for him to look at—he opened it, and it contained nine linen shirts, and other things, wet—I left them in custody and went with the male prisoner—I took him into a chandler's shop, and found in his coat pocket, a bag containing eleven skeleton keys and some lucifer-matches—I have since been to the prosecutrix, tried the keys to the outer door, and two of them open it—when I returned to my brother officer, the prisoners were down in the street, and Jemima Dorsett said that was not the bundle she had taken to her sister.</p>

I saw Collier watching—I saw Jemima Dorsett standing at the door of No. 31, Cromer-street, a long time, and I saw William Lewis go into that house—Collier was behind me and could not see him—it was about ten minutes after nine o'clock—Jemima Dorsett was standing at the door at the time, and a man named Dorsett, who is not now in custody, immediately followed with a basket on his shoulder—I afterwards saw the man Dorsett come out and go up Cromer-street—he crossed over towards us—Collier and I immediately ran down the court; Collier was first—I called out," There is no thoroughfare, George"—we returned in a few minutes, and saw Dorsett at the door of 31, Cromer-street—soon afterwards we went up towards Battle-bridge—we crossed the fields, the quickest way to Ashby-street, and in a few minutes saw Jemima Dorsett pass us with a bundle under her cloak—we watched her to No. 22—she came out in two or three minutes, and Collier stopped her and asked what she had done with the bundle she took to that house—she said, "I left it at my sister's"—just at that moment Lewis and the man Dorsett came down a court into the street—the man Dorsett ran away and Lewis made a stop—I went up to the room—Catherine Lewis was sitting in a chair, with her shawl and bonnet off—I found a bundle of linen in a cupboard—she came there and caught hold of me, and said, "I <hi rend="italic">dare</hi>, you to touch my dirty linen"—Collier said, "Open it"—it consisted of</p>

I found these things in a court in Totten<lb/>ham-court-road, and asked my brother to carry them home, as nobody owned them—I asked him to put them on his shoulder, and take them home—he said he would—I meant to go in-doors—he said Dorsett and his sister should not know any thing about it—he put them in-doors, and instantly told her to go out to take a bundle of linen to my sister, in order to get her out—when she was gone out, I went in with the pictures—I afterwards went home to my own place with the bundle and the pictures; but the prisoner Dorsett knew nothing of it at all; she did not see me with the bundle—it is very hard that she suffers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Jemima Dorsett's Defence</hi>. About half-past nine o'clock my husband came in with a basket on his shoulder—I asked what he had there—he seemed very cross, and I did not ask him more—I went with the bundle to my sister, containing a blanket, a pair of stockings, a shawl, and other things—when I got there she was not at home—I came down stairs, and went out—I returned again, and knocked the door, and said, "Will you allow me to leave these dirty things at my sister's door?"—they said, "Cer<lb/>tainly," and I left them—I came down, and as I was going towards home</p>

               <p>Collier called me, and asked if my husband had been in company with Chapman King—I said I did not know—after some hesitation, he said, "What have you done with that bundle?"—I said, "I have taken it to my sister's"—he had me taken there, and then I found my sister at home—the bundle I took was tied in a shawl—it had been opened, and the bed made—I was anxious to get the bundle there, as it is a furnished lodging, and the blanket did not belong to her—she had lent it to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in Trafalgar-road, Greenwich. In September last I had two sheep at Maze-hill, in Vanburgh-fields, about a hundred yards from Mrs. Cousins's garden—I saw them safe on Sunday, the 22nd of September, about one o'clock, in the field—one was a white-faced sheep, and very dirty behind, the other was short-legged, and dark-brown faced—they were ewes, and Cheviot bred—they bad been turned into the field on the Friday before—I had bought them on the Monday before, (the 16th) at Smithfield, of Mr. Waugh—in consequence of what I heard, I went on Wednesday, the 25th, to the prisoner's house—I had previously sent my lad Bennett—I asked the prisoner if he had fetched two sheep from Mrs. Cousins's garden—he said he had on Monday—I asked if he had killed them—he said he had killed them. on Monday—I asked him to let me see the skins—he said no, be would not allow me on the premises, the skins were gone—I told him my boy could prove the skins were on his premises that morning—I fetched the boy, and he took him into the yard, for the boy to show him where the skins were—the prisoner said he was a liar—I said I thought it was clear they were my sheep, and I would see what I could do—I went home, and gave information to Dorsett the policeman, and went with him to the prisoner's house when he was absent, but found no skins there.</p>

I may as well dismount and go with you," which he did, and went with me to the station-house—he said, going along, that he had fetched two sheep from Mrs. Cousins's garden—I said he was my prisoner, and whatever he stated to me I was bound to tell the Magistrate—he then said, "Three months ago I had five sheep, I killed three, and lost the re<lb/>maining two—the two I lost were wethers—having heard that two sheep were in Mrs. Cousin's garden, I went and looked at them, and found they were not mine—I came home, and had some conversation with my wife, and she said, 'For God's sake, have nothing to do with the sheep, you will get into trouble'—I said I would not—my wife soon afterwards went up stairs—I then put my horse to the cart, and went to Mrs. Cousins, fetched the sheep, brought them home, and put them into my slaughter-house—I had them there about ten minutes in the slaughter-house—I then turned them up—I found they were two ewes—knowing they could not be mine, I then opened the door leading into the street, shook my apron, and turned them out—no one saw me torn them out into the street, and my wife never knew that I brought them home"—he said, he believed them to be Mr. Couldery's sheep, but being on bad terms, he would not acquaint him of it—he said he had not killed a sheep on his premises for two months—I saw two sheep in his' shop on Wednesday, which ap<lb/>peared to have been killed within a day or two—I could not see any ap<lb/>pearance of sheep having been slaughtered there—they were two whole carcasses, without the heads, the legs were on—the prosecutor was with me at the time, and he said one of the legs appeared short legs, but I could not see any difference—the prisoner said he had bought two car<lb/>casses of mutton on the day previous the (Tuesday) in Whitechapel, and one of Mr. Co veil, of Broadway, Deptford, which was hanging in the shop with one of the two he bought in Whitechapel—I found several joints of mutton besides the two carcasses—I am positive he said he bought them on Tuesday.</p>

I have done no such thing," and he rushed his hand towards the woman's hand—I said, "I will go and fetch a policeman"—the woman said imme<lb/>diately, "What does he say you have done?"—he said, "He says, I have robbed him" he said, "If you say that again, I will throw you into the river," and the woman said, "Throw him in"—I said no more, but bade him good night, went along the railing, and turned to the left—I walked fast, and then ran—they did not follow me—I overtook three men, and asked if there was a policeman about—they said there was none in the parish, but I turned back and met Lonergan right opposite the road that leads to the canal, and about a hundred yards from where I was robbed—I pointed out the spot where I was robbed to him—he got assist-ance from the station-house, and we went to several houses, but could not find the prisoner, but as we came back we met him and one of the women coming round the paling—I pointed him out, and he caught hold of him.</p>

He merely stooped to tell him to go home, and upon rising up for the first time saw a policeman standing near him, who told him to be off about his business. He then got out of the crowd, and waited at the corner of Lamb-lane, when he was taken into custody.

On the 26th of No-vember I was sweeping the area steps, and heard a noise at the pantry window—I afterwards heard a noise again, as of silver rattling, and then the window shut down—I then saw the prisoner outside the gate, as if he had just gone out—he held his hand up to me, as if he had something to sell, but I could not see what was in it—the gate he came out at leads to the kitchen as well as to the pantry—it is the house maid's business to look after the plate, and she is not here—I had put the toast-rack in the pantry a very little while before, and missed it the next day.</p>

I bought a silver watch of the prisoner about five weeks ago—I did not wear it at all, but gave it to my mother to take care of, in the course of the day, and did not see it again till it was at the pawnbroker's—I had a box with one sovereign in money in it in the house, and there were three sovereigns and five half-sovereigns in a small box in another room—my own box was in my own bed-room, and there was a half-sovereign lying on a table in the room—the other box was in my mother's care—on the 3rd of November I went up stairs to get some money, as my mother asked me to let her have a few shillings, and I found the box broken open—I had seen that box about a fortnight before—my watch was not in that box—I missed the three sovereigns and five half-sovereigns—I missed a sove<lb/>reign from my own box, which was also broken open—I had seen that box safe a fortnight before—I did not see my mother's small box a fortnight before, as I did not know where she kept it—the prisoner was in the habit of coming to my father's house for three or four months—he used to work with me, and came backwards and forwards to the house every other day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Toby, a shoe-manufacturer, in St. Thomas's-place, Great Dover-road. The prisoner came into our service on the 1st of June—on the 14th of September she came up to my bed-room door, about seven o'clock in the evening, and told me she was very sorry to be going to leave me at a moment's notice, but she had seen her uncle that afternoon, and he wished her to come home—I said I thought it was very strange, as I had been given to understand from her sister that her uncle and her had not been friends for twelve months—she said it was the case—she had her bonnet and shawl on, and when I went down stairs she was gone—that day and the day before we had been packing some shoes up for a foreign order—I missed three or four pairs on the 13th, and five pairs on the 14th, but</p>

               <p>I had not the least suspicion of the prisoner till the 7th of this month—I then accompanied the officer to her lodging at Lewisham—I had had their address from her sister—I saw her there, and saw a box which she had had when in my house—the prisoner produced a key, and opened it herself, and in it I found a crape handkerchief, which I had lost from a drawer, but I did not miss it, and could not tell how long it had been lost—I am quite certain it was mine—nothing more was taken out of the box then—next day we went again, and found some more things in the box, which must have been placed there since the first search, as they were not there then—I also found my thimble in a work-basket on the table, and an apron of mine in a drawer down stairs—the prisoner's sister lived in the same house, and she was frequently in the habit of coming to my premises—a pair of shoes were found on the prisoner's feet at the station-house, which was one of the foreign pair.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coach-maker in Stanhope-place, Southwark-bridge-road. A few days before the 2nd of September Brown came to my shop—he asked if I had a headed phaeton to let on hire—I said, "Yes," and showed him one—he did not approve of it—I showed him another one, for which we agreed—he wished to hire it for three months—he told me he was a ship and insurance broker—that his offices were at No. 18, East India-chambers, and he resided at Blackheath—I saw him again on the 2nd of September, when he brought a memorandum of agree-ment with him—this is it—he inquired if the phaeton was ready for him—I told him it was, and he produced this memorandum, which he signed in my presence, and he brought another, which I signed—a man from a livery-stable brought a horse, which, was harnessed to the phaeton and he drove away—I saw him again repeatedly—in about a week after, he said he would buy the phaeton for a friend of his who liked it, if I would take 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. instead of 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I could not take that, and then he inquired for a new britska—he looked at one and made me an offer for it—I think I told him 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as the price—he offered 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I refused—I never agreed to take 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he came a great many times after that about the britska—on some of these occasions Smith was with him—Brown came almost every day; perhaps five or six times—I agreed to sell the britska for 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a German shutter and some other things were to be added to it—Isaw both the prisoners several times—Smith generally came with Brown in a phaeton which was hired of Mr. Gray—on—the 16th of September Brown came and asked if his clerk had been there—I did not know who he meant—I said, "No"—he said he should have been there half-an-hour ago, with a check for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay me for the britska—while we were talking Smith came in with a check for 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and gave it into Brown's hand—he said "What do you bring me this check for? this is 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; you should have brought me a check for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Smith said that was what Mr. Marsden had given him—Brown scolded Smith for not bringing him the cheek he ordered—it was dated forward—Brown said to Smith, "This is making it appear as if I wanted to do Mr. Clarke out of the britska"—he said to me," This is a very vexatious thing that he should have brought this—I can't pay you for it now, and I have made an arrangement to use this carriage—I wanted to use it for two or three days to go into the country—this will entirely put me out of my arrangement"—he told me that Marsden was a friend of his, in the corn-trade—that he had lent him 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to make purchases in corn, and as corn was getting up, he thought it was a good speculation, and the money was to be paid when he demanded it—that he had seen Marsden and told him he had pur-chased a new britska and wanted a check for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay for it; "and now," says he, "I suppose he thinks I want the money, and he has written me out this check, which has a few days to run, thinking it would be of service to him"—he then proposed to give me a bill, and he sent Smith for a stamp—it rained fast and Smith asked if I would lend him an umbrella—I went to get one, but had not one at home—after that Smith went out and was some time gone, and Brown and I had some conversation—I said "A gentle-man's word is as good as his bill; I don't require a bill if you will pay me the money before Saturday night"—he said, "The money shall be sure to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183911250184"/>
               <p>be paid before Saturday night"—Smith then returned, and the two prisoners rode away in the britska—a horse and harness was brought to take it—in a day or two, Smith came and asked me for something, as it was usual to allow the servant something—I said, "You are not his groom or servant, you are his clerk"—he said no, he was not, but his servant had asked him to call for him, as he was unable to come from Blackheath to receive it—I said, as Mr. Brown was to pay on Saturday, after I received the money I would give the servant something—Brown came about the 18th or 19th of September, about buying the phaeton—he agreed to buy it for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after that he brought the phaeton he had hired of Mr. Gray, and asked what I would paint it for—he said it belonged to a friend of his—I afterwards found it belonged to Mr. Gray—he said he and his friend would call the next Monday—he did not leave it, and I never saw him again—on the Saturday on which I was to have been paid for the britska. I received a note from Brown—I afterwards found my phaeton at the police-office, and the britska at the Red Lion, Maidenhead.</p>

On the 21st of September Brown drove up to the door in a double-bodied chaise—Smith was sitting inside—Brown came in, and said, "Is Mr. Richards in?"—I said "No"—he said, "I want a hat," and he tried on one—he then said, "My servant wants a hat"—Smith came in and tried one on, and got one to fit him—Brown then said he wanted one with a gold band, not so good a one as that—I said we had very good ones at 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—at last he got one that fitted him—Brown said to Smith, "Is that one that fits you?"—he said "Yes"—I showed Brown the pat-tern-book for the band, and he chose one at 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said, "I will take these two, and you can send that before five o'clock"—he had thrown down his card before that, as residing at the East India Chambers—he said, I must send it before five o'clock, as he left town at five, for his house at Blackheath—Brown took his hat away on his head—I put Smith's in a box. thinking he was the servant—I had some doubt, while I was putting it into the box, whether I should let them go, but Brown took up a leather-case and asked me the price of it—I said 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I thought I would let them have the two hats at a venture—I sent the other hat and the gold band at five o'clock, and they were not there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sadler, and live in the Borough. I saw both the prisoners at my shop in September—Brown came in, while Smith sat in the phaeton—Brown asked me the price of chaise and carriage harness, but more particularly of carriage harness—I agreed to make him a set of carriage harness to order for 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the chaise harness was not determined about—he said he resided at Blackheath, and had Cham-bers at the East India Chambers—the harness was to be made and sent by that day fortnight—he said the horse he had at Blackheath was of the same size as the one at the door, and one collar would fit either—after we had agreed about the harness he said he wanted a saddle and bridle immediately, to ride the next day, being Sunday—we looked one out—he said his servant, meaning Smith, would call for it in half an hour—I think he was to pay five guineas for that—Smith called, and took away the saddle and bridle—I have never been paid for either.</p>
               <p>— <hi rend="smallCaps">BLACKWELL</hi>. I live in Oxford-street, and am a sadler. Brown came to me in a phaeton, and agreed to purchase a carriage harness, for which he was to pay twenty-five guineas—if was lo be made for him, and paid for before delivery—he gave me a card with "East India Chambers" on it, and said he lived at Blackheath—a saddle and bridle were to be sent by the carrier to Blackheath, as he said he wanted to ride on the Sunday—Smith was sitting in the phaeton as a servant—Brown went to the carriage again, and said he was going to dine at Connaught-square, and his servant should call for the saddle and bridle as he returned—I said it should be ready, and asked for a reference—he looked at my book, which was on the table, and said he knew several of my customers, and said they were friends of his—Smith came about half ah hour alter, and took away the saddle and bridle—I asked him where his master resided at Blackheath—he said, "Very near the Hare and Billet public-house"—I said, I never was there but once, and did he know Admiral Oliver's—he said, "Yes," it was a very little way from there—he took away the saddle and bridle, and I heard no more of them till they were at Union-hall.</p>
