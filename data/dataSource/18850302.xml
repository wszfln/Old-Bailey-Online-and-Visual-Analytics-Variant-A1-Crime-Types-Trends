                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 28, Great Knightrider Street—I have no partner—early in August last Letts called at my office with this bill of sale of the ship Ætna, and said "Me and my partner want to borrow about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to defray certain expenses on the ship; I will leave the bill of sale with you, and call in a day or two to see whether you Will lend me the money." (<hi rend="italic">The bill of sale stated that the Ætna was a steamer built at Sunderland in 1863, registered at Liverpool No. 47,460, tonnage 866, and concluded with the words I, Charles Henry Pile, of Great St. Helens, London, in consideration of 10,000l. paid to me by Peel and Letts, transfer 64 shares in the ship to Peel and Letts, to have power of transfer.</hi>) That had been executed by Pile and was left with me—when this was said to me Letts said "You will see we have paid 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the ship, and bought her subject to a mortgage of 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—I said I should want a mortgage on the ship, and he then said "To give a mortgage for such a small sum as 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would damage our credit in Liverpool"—I asked whether he and his partner would be prepared to make a statutory declaration that the ship belonged to them, and to give me a letter that they would execute a mortgage if called upon—Letts then went away, and shortly afterwards returned with his partner Peel—I repeated the question, and one of them, I think Letts, said "Yes, we are prepared to do what you ask"—I then drafted out this statutory declaration and gave it to Letts, and told them they could go into another room and make a copy of it; they took it with them to another room and copied it, and brought it back to me—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188503020002"/>
               <p>read it over to them, and asked them whether it was correct, and told them they could find a commissioner somewhere in the neighbourhood to make it before—they left my office with it, leaving the draft with me—they afterwards returned bringing the declaration. (<hi rend="italic">In this declaration Peel and Letts declared that they were the owners of the Ætna, trading between England and the Mediterranean, and mortgaged to Messrs. Forward Brothers, of Liver<lb/>pool, for 3,000l., the interest on which was paid up to March last; that there were no other charges or incumbrances on the ship whatever; that when it arrived in London about October there would be due to them for freight and other<lb/>wise 1,000l.; that thy were solvent, and worth about 3,000l. after the payment of all claims against them; that the Ætna was insured at Lloyd's and North Country Clubs for 11.000l., and this declaration was signed "Peel and Letts, 25th August, 1884, before Edgar F. Jenkins.</hi>") After that had been handed to me they also gave me this document, a kind of equitable mortgage. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that in consideration of Mr. Dinn discounting their bill of 25th August, 1884, for 200l., Messrs. Peel and Letts deposited the bill of sale.</hi>) They also gave me a bill of exchange for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. drawn on 25th August, payable two months after date, accepted payable to Messrs. Smith, Payne, and Co., and signed "Peel and Co." by Letts, I think, in Peel's presence—they were both together while this took place—on the receipt of those documents I gave them a cheque for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable to order; it is endorsed on the back "Peel and Co."—I have been debited with that amount at my bankers—when I parted with it I believed that the mortgage they had told me of by Forward, of Liverpool, was the only encumbrance on the ship, and I parted with my cheque on the faith of those statements—I made no search at the Customs House to see if there was any encum<lb/>brance—I took their word for that, holding their bill of sale as sufficient evidence that it was not mortgaged.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BUCK</hi>. This is not the first time I have lent money with good security, but the first time I have lent money on a ship—I knew nothing about the law of ships, or that I night have seen the entire register of British ships at the Customs House—Letts left the bill of sale with me for some days, and I knew where his address was—I understood that he had paid 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I did not know that he had paid 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. Pile—he did not tell me how the 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was made up—if the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been paid in coin, and the other 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in bills which had been met, then this mortgage would have been the only encumbrance—this matter was sent for trial—I have not taken a bill of exchange for 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. drawn by them and accepted by another person; they left such a bill with me for me to make inquiries—it is not endorsed to me—I have got that bill—Letts left with me 23 shares in the Pacific (they are not worth the paper they are written on I am told), and promised to call the next day, but he has not been, and they remain in my custody—that was before the committal—I have had no agreement by which Letts undertook to mortgage an annuity from the General Post-office—I have at no time had any wish to prosecute—I wished to get my money back—I do not know that this ship was locked up in Marseilles during the cholera for 10 weeks.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. FULTON</hi>. I believe the vendor of this ship was Mr. Pile, whose cross-examination at the Mansion House I heard—I thought he had the ship and that the 169<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was spent on the ship—I do not know that I said ho ought to find the money to meet the advance</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188503020003"/>
               <p>made by me—he applied to me that he had taken possession of the ship—the ship was of more value than the amount due to him, and therefore I thought he would have to account to them—I thought some 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was due to him, and that he would have to hand over the balance between that and 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Letts told me the 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he got from me was required to defray the expenses of the ship—the words in the rough draft, "No other mortgage, charge, or encumbrance thereon," are an interlineation, and when they were added I don't know—they are in my handwriting—my impression is that the document was drawn up before the prisoners came, and that in their presence I inserted the words—they left the bill of sale with me—they did not request me to make no inquiries about it—they always admitted the mortgage to Messrs. Forward of 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shipbroker and shipowner, of 34, Great St. Helens, where I have carried on business from about 1866—this is my signature to the bill of sale—I saw the prisoners sign this mortgage of 5th May, 1884, for 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in cash, and 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. secured by bills of exchange which were dishonoured; they are not all due yet—since then the defendants have become further indebted to me beyond the 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—these acceptances of the prisoners, one for 301<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., due on 6th July, 1884, one for 303<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., due on 6th August, 1884, and one for 559<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., due on 6th September, 1884, have been dishonoured.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. FULTON</hi>. I did not understand the agreement between us that they should have 14 days' notice of any proceedings to be taken by me as referring to the bills—the first bill became due on 6th July—I gave them no notice at that time, verbal notice—I did not give them notice that I was going to telegraph out to where the ship was to seize it—I telegraphed out to the captain to seize the ship—I have not since realised upon the freight the whole amount of the bill—I have received on the freight about 1,079<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in actual figures, but there were certain expenses I had to debit to them; I have received about 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in the agreement I had undertaken to pay off the original mortgage of 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Messrs. Forward—in the mortgage as drawn they were not still liable to the Forwards' mortgage, but the ship was, so that the ship was liable for the 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and then for 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., although I had agreed to pay the 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and in addition to that I had 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in hard cash—I do not know that the whole of the 169<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. obtained from Mr. Dinn was used for paying the wages of the crew and the advance notes—I do not know who paid the crew's wages, I have not, I presume somebody has—the ship ailed somewhere in May, there was some delay—I had received a portion of the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when that delay took place—the dates of the biils were not altered on account of the delay—all the documents were executed on 5th May—the bills were payable at an interest of 7 percent.—the mortgage they executed on 5th May was for the full sum of 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that iucluded 542<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the interest at 7 percent. on the biils as well from the date of the mortgage—9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on which the mortgage was given, included all the bills added together and the interest, and the mortgage covered 7 percent.—they did not make me a present of 542<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by executing the mortgage—the mortgage does cover Forward's—I agreed with them I would pay off Forward's at stated</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188503020004"/>
               <p>intervals—the mortgage is subject to Forward's, so that the ship is liable to Forward's mortgage and my 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as well—it was understood between us—they never thought it was only Forward's mortgage they were executing for the 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 98, Alderney Street, Pimlico, and am in the employ of Sims, Martin, and Co.—on Tuesday night, 27th January, I came in about 8—I then had an alarm clock, value 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on my parlour mantelshelf—I went downstairs and had my supper—at 10 minutes to 10 my wife went upstairs and I heard her say "What right have you in my room?"—I saw the prisoner running out of the front door—I pursued him, crying "Stop thief"—a gentleman stopped him and detained him while I fetched a constable—I afterwards saw the clock in the constable's hands—I saw nothing of any other man—the prisoner smelt strongly of drink but knew what he was about—a little before 10, when I went up, I had seen that the front door and the parlour door were shut.</p>

I am the last witness's wife, and live with him in Alderney Street—Mr. and Mrs. Page, a mother and son, also live in our house; he has a latch-key, and came in about 12 on this night, after this happened—my father came in about 9; he stays in the house and has a latch-key—I heard the door shut again after he came in; it has a spring lock or latch—there is only one street door—the windows were all closed and fastened before 10 o'clock—I was in the ante-room about 10 and heard footsteps in the parlour apparently—I went up into the front parlour—there are folding-doors between that room and the room be<lb/>hind, and those doors had been properly closed about five minutes before—one of them was wide open—I saw in the back parlour a man, not the prisoner, taking things down from pegs on the door—while I was speak<lb/>ing to the other man the prisoner came up from the other side of the room and I asked him what he wanted, what he was doing—I touched him; he merely said he had come to see Mrs. Jones, and then he and the other man went past me out at the door—my husband came up the stairs and ran along the hall after him—I called out "Stop thief"—he was caught and detained—I went to the station and saw the prisoner there; he is one of the two men that went out of my house—I saw at the station the clock that had been removed from our mantel<lb/>shelf—there has never been any one of the name of Mrs. Jones in our house.</p>

I am manager of the Duke of York, 44, Fouldham Street—the boy lives about 20 yards off—on February 20th, about 8 o'clock or 8.30, my barmaid handed me this half-crown—the boy made a statement, and I went out one way and told the barmaid to send the boy out at a different door—when he came out I followed him—he stopped, and I saw a man peeping from the corner towards our house—the boy looked at him, and I went after him—he was trotting away from the corner—I overtook him and said, "Are you the man who gave the buy the half-crown?"—he said, "I did not give any boy a half-crown"—I said, "You will have to come back with me"—he said, "I am not going back, you will have to let me go or else I will make you"—I held him more tight, and took him back to the boy, who was outside his father's house, and said, "Is this the man who gave you the half-crown?"—he said "Yes"—the prisoner made a snap at the boy, he bent his body towards him and said, "Am I the man who gave you the half-crown?"—the boy said "No," he appeared very frightened indeed, but his father came out, and I gave the prisoner in custody with the coin.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This stated that in consequence of the dishonesty of a clerk, the cheque, with others, had been returned, from want of funds, but would do what was necessary to avoid a like occurrence.</hi>)</p>

In consequence of information received I went with Sage and True to the Red Lion public-house, 82, High Street, Hoxton, where I saw Mrs. Clark, the landlady, who showed me four bags—I made inquiries at Hoxton, and about 9.15 a.m. I went to 88, High Street, Hoxton, the prisoner's address—I saw him, and told him we were police officers, and were making inquiries about fur and plush bags stolen from the City, and asked him whether within a fortnight or three weeks he had bought or sold them—he said "No"—I asked if his wife was in—he said "Yes"—I asked her if she had bought or sold any fur bags—she said "No," in the presence of the prisoner—I cautioned them to be very careful, and asked them some questions, and they said they were positive they had not—I told them they must consider themselves in custody, as I knew they had sold some to the landlady of the Red Lion—the female said "Oh yes, I did sell her one"—I and Sage searched the premises, and found three lady's jerseys—I afterwards, in company with Parker, on the morning of the 31st, Saturday, again went to the prisoner's house, and from off the landing on the second floor Parker handed me these 17 aprons—I then showed him a stall in the street, from which he picked out these seven woollen shawls—I have seen the prisoner some<lb/>times and sometimes his wife at that stall.</p>

I live at 18, Mornington Crescent, Maida Vale—on the morning of 11th January I left home about a quarter past 4 and proceeded towards Charing Cross in my brougham—I had then this bag with me, in which was a purse containing two rings, (this produced is one), a bank-note, and two sovereigns—the other ring was a marquise diamond—when I arrived opposite Nichol's, the tailor's, in Regent Street an accident happened, and I had to get out of my brougham—there was a crowd round—I had not opened my bag between the times of leaving home and of getting out of the brougham—I had the bag in my hand when I got out—I got into a cab, and then directly noticed the bag was wide open, and I missed my purse containing the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and two rings—I have not seen it since—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of the rings.</p>

I manage Mr. Walters's pawnbroker's business, Aldersgate Street—about 20 minutes to 4 on 27th January the prisoner brought this ring to me and asked 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—I asked him if it was his own—he said "Yes"—I asked him where he got it—he said he had bought it at Messrs. Johnson and Dymond's, Gracechurch Street, auctioneers—I asked him if he knew the pawnbroker who sent it to Messrs. Johnson and Dymond—he said he did not; he said he was a dealer and that his name was Morley—I asked him where he lived—he said, "I can soon satisfy you," and he gave me a card—I asked him if he had any objection to leaving the ring and to my making inquiries—he said he had, if I kept the ring I should have to keep him, he would rather the police were sent for—I said he could be accommodated, and the police were sent for—I had said there was a ring of similar descrip<lb/>tion in the police list, and in the same paragraph a ring of another description, and I asked him if he knew anything of that—he said he did not, he had no other ring offered him for sale, he knew nothing about any other—I sent for the police—I said to him, "Are you sure you bought this under the hammer at Johnson and Dymond's?"—he said, "To make it clear, I did not buy it under the hammer, I bought it</p>

I am a married woman, of 10, Well Street, Canning Town—on 10th February, about 11.45, I was in the East India Road, near the Poplar Hospital, and saw the prosecutor on the other side of the road—I went to a coffee stall, and while there saw the prosecutor lighting his pipe or counting his money; I won't be certain which, opposite the lamp; when I left the coffee stall and went on and got up to him he was on the ground on the opposite side to me, and I saw five men on the top of him—I saw the last witness there, and said to him "What are they doing?"—we were close to the men—he said "I don't know"—I saw Madegan on the top of the prosecutor's head, and Martin on the lower part of his body—the prosecutor called out "Murder!" and "Police!"—he got up—the prisoners went a little way off; they afterwards came back, and</p>

On 10th February, shortly after 12 o'clock at night, I was in the East India Road, off duty, in company with Sergeant Duncan—I heard cries of "Murder!" and went up and saw the prosecutor lying on the ground, and Martin lying on the ground by the side of him; they were struggling, and Madegan was running away—I ran after him some distance, caught him, and said "What have you done to that man? I am a police officer, you will have to come back"—he said "Let me go, I have not got anything"—I pulled him towards where the prosecutor had been lying; he struggled to get away, and got his legs between mine several times—I repeatedly told him I was a police officer, and that he would have to come back—Duck was struggling a few yards off with Martin; he blew his whistle—Madegan caught hold of me by the shirt collar, and forced his finger round my throat and almost choked me, but the mounted sergeant came up on hearing Duck's whistle, and held Madegan; he was very violent—at the station I searched him, and in his pocket found a knife with the blade open, and some fireman's discharges, and one shilling in silver and one penny in bronze.</p>

I had to walk the streets to support him. He got two years' imprison<lb/>ment for housebreaking, which expired three years ago. I have not seen him since from that time till the night I went to his house, having been told he was living with a woman who was on the streets and whom I have known for years. I went to ask him for some money, having just buried one of his children, nine years old. I own I was the worse for drink. I saw that woman there; the pepper-box and vinegar bottle were on the counter. She called me a dirty whore. I took up the vinegar bottle and threw it at her. I declare I had not taken anything to the house, and threw nothing but what was on the counter. I know for a fact that the prosecutrix has been in prison 18 months for robbery, and she has had three months' imprisonment for keeping a disorderly house."</p>

On the night of 9th February I saw the prisoner at the hospital where Thompson had been taken—I asked how he could account for having knocked the constable down and injuring him—he said "I couldn't help it, the pony was running away with me"—I said it didn't appear so, as he pulled up directly afterwards and then got on his cart again when he saw what he had done and drove rapidly away—he said "I did that, sir, because I was frightened at what I had done"—he was sober.</p>

I am a bachelor of medicine, and partner of the last witness—I saw Mrs. McArdle on Tuesday, the 27th; she was in an extreme state of collapse, almost pulseless, and almost immediately after I saw her she went into a convulsion, from which I scarcely thought she would recover—she did rally from that, but died the next night—I made the post-mortem—I found on the breast a lump of the size of a split pea, and also a bruise—the cause of death was rupture of the heart—a blow from the fist would cause that—there was no✗ disease—she was conscious almost up to the last.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor in partnership with my brother in Bartlett's Buildings; we acted for the late Mrs. Batt in a Chancery suit in which she was a plaintiff—we had to see her constantly from 1877 to 1882—I constantly saw her write lots of times—I was familiar with her handwriting—to the best of my belief the signature to the alleged will is hers—when this will was brought to me I carefully examined the signature and compared it with other signatures of hers in our possession, and I have not the slightest doubt it is genuine—in July I saw the medical officer of the asylum in order to get evidence of her state to prove in Chancery proceedings, and I ascertained that she was suffering from chronic bronchitis and was very weak—the word "Matilda" is rather weaker than her usual signature, but her surname of "Batt" I have no doubt about—when the will was brought to me on 19th December I noticed that the attestation clause was irregular—I explained to the prisoners that before the will could be proved it would be necessary to get the evidence of one of the attesting witnesses—they made no objection to that—they knew that I was acting for their mother—they came next morning with Mrs. Sansom; I pointed to her signature and asked if that was her handwriting; she said it was—I then pointed to Mrs. Batt's signature and asked if that was Mrs. Batt's handwriting; she said it was—I asked if she saw Mrs. Batt sign her name; she said she did—I asked her if she signed her own name in Mrs. Batt's presence; she said she did—I asked if Mr. Goddard was present when Mrs. Batt signed the will; she said yes—I asked if Mrs. Batt signed it in his presence; she said she did—I asked her if Mrs. Batt told her it was a will; she said she did—upon that I filled up the ordinary form of affidavit for an attesting witness—it then occurred to me that pro<lb/>bably the officials at the Probate Court might raise some objection to her signature, as it was very irregular—the will had been signed at the infirmary and she had not her spectacles at the time, and was not a good scholar; and in order to explain that I added the words "At the time I signed the will I had not my spectacles on, and the signature was written in the way it now appears"—I read the whole affidavit over to her and asked if she understood it; she said yes—I asked if the statements in the affidavit were true; she said they were, and she was sworn to it in my presence—she appeared thoroughly to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188503020045"/>
               <p>understand it—every one of these signatures to these receipts which were put before Charles Batt were written in my presence—looking at those and the will I am of opinion that the signature to the will is Mrs. Batt's handwriting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I knew that Mrs. Batt had property—I conducted the Chancery proceedings for her; that was the only property she had—I did not visit her at the workhouse to take instructions—she told me she intended to make a will when she received the money, I think in 1881 or 1882, that was the last time I saw her—I acted as her man of business from 1877—she never asked me to make a will—when I say this is her signature it is purely a matter of opinion—I did not see her write it—she died on 24th July—I first saw the will on 10th November when the prisoners brought it—I had not acted for them or seen them, or written to them—I wrote to Charles Batt, I think, at the beginning of November, stating that Mrs. Batt was dead, and asking if there was a will—we acted on the prisoners' behalf in proving the will—they did not give me any of these receipts; I don't think they knew of their existence—I don't know where the old lady was living immediately before she went to the infirmary—she told me in 1881 or 1882 that she had been living with her daughter—she spoke kindly of her daughter—I don't remember the name.</p>

I saw no more of him till he brought me a stick and said "Put that down," and put it by my feet. As we got to King William Street I said "I will get down now, I have arrived at my destination." He said "You may as well treat me." Harrison immediately jumped out and ran away. When I got down Bush Lane I stopped for a minute, for I was dumbfounded seeing the crowd and did not know what they were about till the police-man came up. At to my conviction, it is 10 years ago, and I was quite a lad then. I am very sorry I got into the trap, but I did not know what these men were going to do.</p>

February I went to bed about a quarter to 11o'clock, having locked up the house—I had latched the hall door, not bolted it, it could not be opened from outside without a key—about 20 minutes past 1 o'clock Inspector Fraser called me up—he had the two prisoners in the passage, and asked me if they had any business in the house—I said "No, I don't know them at all"—Fraser then took some keys away from Brown, who had his hand in his pocket—he tried the keys in the door and they fitted easily—Mr. Daven was there—nothing</p>

On the morning of 12th February at 20 minutes past 1 o'clock I was standing next door to the prosecutor's house talking to Mr. Daven, and I heard the latch of the door of No. 73 pulled back and the door opened gradually from the inside, and Brown came out first and stood on the doorstep—Saunders almost immediately followed him and appeared to close the front door—I allowed them to go about 20 yards down the street and then I went and tried the front door, No. 73—I pushed it and it readily opened—I left Daven at the front door and followed the prisoners, who gradually increased their pace to the double, I caught them at the corner of Warwick Street and Hugh Street, I had not lost sight of them at all—I was in uniform, on duty—I stopped them and said "What were you doing inside that house?"—Saunders replied "A girl took us in there"—I said "You will have to go back with me "—I took hold of them—they went back—I called Goodfellow and asked him if they had any right in the house "—he said they had not—I again asked him "What were you doing inside this house?"—Brown said "You have made a mistake this time, we were not in this house at all "—while speaking to the landlord Brown turned away from me and put his hand in his right-hand trousers' pocket—I searched him at once and found these four skeleton keys in his pocket, a Hanoverian medal, and a knife—the wards of the keys have been filed out, they are simply latchkeys that open a great number of doors—I tried one of the keys in Brown's presence and found that it opened the door of the house readily—I took the prisoners to the station assisted by Daven until I met a con<lb/>stable—at the corner of Douglas Street, Westminster, I turned to speak to Duncan, who was close behind me, when Brown by a quick movement of his hand threw something away—I directed the constable to search, the street, and he afterwards showed me a patent key with two wards filed out—they made no answer to the charge.</p>

               <p>hand—I had not seen him before that I know of—I did not speak to him; he hit me on the head with the hammer as soon as I stepped on the landing—I had this hat on, it was chopped through in front—I felt him holding the hammer over me, I did not feel him hit me—I next found myself in Beresford's room—I went to Dr. Mills the night of the accident, and have since been to Charing Cross Hospital.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had worked with Beresford before this—nobody went up with me and Beresford—we went up directly.</p>
               <p>—<hi rend="smallCaps">MILLS</hi>. I am a divisional surgeon of police at 3, South<lb/>ampton Street, Strand—I saw Wooten on the evening of 7th February—he was brought to me by a policeman, bleeding severely from a lacerated wound on his forehead, high up on the right side—the bone was bare; a large blood-vessel was divided, and it bled furiously—I controlled the bleeding first by pads and bandages—I got the help of another surgeon—I did not examine the wound then—he went into Charing Cross Hospital—I have since had an opportunity of examining the wound—it still remains open—it was serious; the superficial portion of the brain is quite exposed, and there is some dead bone to come away, which will be a matter of two or three months perhaps—some blunt instrument would cause such an injury; whatever did it, it would have required a con<lb/>siderable amount of force; a plasterer's hammer would cause it—the cut on the hat corresponds with the cut on the head, and there was blood on the hat when he came.</p>

On 7th February I was called to this house a little after 6.20 p.m.—I first saw Beresford in his room, two women having fetched me—he spoke to me, and came downstairs with me, and I went away to my point—about a quarter of an hour afterwards I went back again into the room and saw Wooten there with a cut on his forehead, bleeding very much, lying on the floor—he said something to me which the prisoner could hear, he being outside the room against his own door—Wooten said to me the prisoner had hit him over the head with a chopper-hammer, and I then took the prisoner into custody—he was standing just there—he only said he thought the mob had come up to fight him—I could not find the hammer—there were about 15 people up there—when I first saw Beresford he had two black eyes and a little blood coming from over one of his eyes.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It was cracked in about three different places right up to the top—I did not notice a fender in the prisoner's room; I noticed one in Beresford's room—I examined it and found no blood or nothing on it whatever, only a little dust—it was a round iron fender, not very large—Wooten was about two yards from it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am at present living at 108, Graham Road, Dalston—I have no occupation at present—I was formerly a member of the London Stock Exchange; I ceased to be so in the early part of 1878—Mr. Cottrell was at one time in my employ; he subsequently became a member of the Stock Exchange, and I became his clerk—that was in May or June, 1882—I continued with him as clerk and bookkeeper up to 10th May, 1884, When he left London—I recollect Mr. Kennedy having a large account with Mr. Cottrell—shortly before the action was commenced, in September, 1883, I had several conversations with Mr. Cottrell with regard to Mr. Kennedy's account in the ledger, at pages 927 and 928—I recollect Turner coming; before he came there were several alterations made in those pages, and I think Mr. Cottrell thought it best to have them removed—there were erasures with a pen—some, I think, were made by Mr. Cottrell, and some by myself—some of the alterations were in favour of Mr. Kennedy, and some otherwise—I knew that Mr. Edwards had been instructed to alter the pages, Mr. Cottrell had told me so—it was in the evening that Turner came, after business hours—I don't think any one was in the office except myself—the book was on the desk, and I said "That is the book you want," simply pointing to it—I didn't point to the particular pages of Mr. Kennedy's account, he had to follow that—he brought the blank pages already numbered—I didn't see them before they were put in; they were in paper—I left him in the office at work with instructions to close the door after him and turn out the gas when he had finished—I came to business the following morning—I then examined the ledger containing Mr. Kennedy's account; of course the new folios were then in the book, in the place where Mr. Kennedy's account had been—I believe the original leaves that were taken out were in my desk at the time; they were kept on the desk during the day, and locked up at night—they were left on the outer part of the desk for some days, I believe—I didn't remove them, I rather think Mr. Cottrell did—I was not present at the time of the removal—to the best of my belief the pages had been taken out when Turner came; to the best of my know<lb/>ledge they were removed by Mr. Cottrell—I am not sure; I didn't remove them; I was not present when they were removed, I found them on my</p>

               <p>desk—there were three or four others in the office as well as myself, and one of them may have removed them; when I came in the morning I found the original leaves, and locked them up—I examined the leaves the following morning; at that time the edges of the leaves that had been inserted were clean; the writing was inserted on the new leaves on the following day by myself, in Mr. Cottrell's presence, I followed his instructions, which were to re-copy the account with the alterations—when I had finished the copying it appeared as if there had been no alterations—the original leaves were kept for some time in my desk, up to the time of Mr. Cottrell's leaving, on 10th May—I had them in my possession up to that time—I ceased to have them about August last, Mr. Cottrell having gone, and the action having been commenced I destroyed them with other papers, there being no further occasion for them—I was present when Woodley Smith and Mr. Inderwick attended at my em<lb/>ployers' place for the purpose of inspecting the books, I think on two occasions—at one time I showed them the ledger; at others, Mr. Cottrell, if I was not present—Mr. Cottrell was present on one or two occasions when the books were inspected; they were shown to Mr. Inderwick—I had no idea that Mr. Cottrell was going away on the 10th May; I ex<lb/>pected him on the following Monday—I had no idea that he was likely to become a defaulter; he said he was going to Margate from Saturday to Monday—the books had then been partly destroyed—he stated that the action being withdrawn, he had no further occasion for the books, and having a new set they were destroyed—he said that to me on the Saturday morning as far as I recollect—Mr. Cottrell asked Thomas to leave the office for about an hour, at least he told me to tell him so—I gave the message to Thomas, and he did leave, but he came back sooner; Mr. Cottrell was then burning some of the books, by placing them in the fire; he divided the books—the ledger was burnt, a portion on that day, various folios; the bulk of it was burnt; I assisted in the burning of the books—I had no conversation with Mr. Cottrell about the interrogatories before he went away; to my knowledge he knew that information had been going on for a long time—I can't recollect what he said about it, the substance was of course that Mr. Kennedy was aware of what was going on with the books; I told him he was quite aware no doubt—I think he knew I had communications with him—I told him that I had confirmed the evidence that he had received from some one—this might have been a month or two before he went away; I can't recollect the date; he referred to it on more than one occasion—I think I first received money from Inderwick in April—I confirmed the information that he had already received—it was both before and after that that I had the conversation with Mr. Cottrell—I think I saw Mr. Cottrell again about September or October, prior to the bankruptcy proceedings—I met him at various places; I didn't go abroad with him, I merely met him in the ordinary way—when he came back he gave me instructions to finish burning the books, which I did; simply the leaves I have referred to remained; I mean the leaves that were removed from the ledger; those books, which were of no importance, were destroyed after Mr. Cottrell went, and those that remained were sold to a waste-paper man—I recollect Mr. Cottrell drawing a cheque just before he left, and the counterfoil I gave to him on his return, about October I think—of course the books in use were not destroyed, only the old books.</p>

                  <hi rend="largeCaps">JOSEPH HAMMERSLEY</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Surgeon of Police</hi>). About 7 o'clock on the even<lb/>ing of 25th January I saw the constable at my house at Catford—he was lying on the couch partly conscious—shortly after he had a convulsive seizure, and then he was insensible for about five minutes, and then he came round and told me what had happened—I applied remedies—I found he had some injury to the head—I had him stripped, and found he had had some bruising under his right shoulder blade and on the right elbow, hip, and outer side of the tight foot—I found at the next examina<lb/>tion a swelling about the size of a walnut at the base of the brain on the occipital protuberance—I was not satisfied there was any fracture, but I came to the conclusion there must hare been concussion, because the right pupil was dilated—I found no further symptoms; I have attended him ever since—I don't like his condition the last day or two, and he was taken to the chief surgeon of police at my request since I saw him to set his opinion—the bruises and injuries to the body were consistent with his having been knocked down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The partially conscious state was the result of injuries to the head, which would result from his striking his head against the ground—I think I heard that the vehicle struck him in the shoulder blade, and that is where I discovered a bruise—the injury to the brain might have resulted from his being thrown on the frosty ground—a slight blow will sometimes cause great injury to the brain—I observed no mark of his haying been struck in the front.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He was also bruised on the elbow, hip, and foot, and on the left shin also, I noticed afterwards—the injuries might have been caused by a man having partially turned round being struck for<lb/>ward, and then the wheel or step bruising the hip and elbow—there was no such bruise as if he had been struck by the shaft in the chest—he was stripped when I saw him—I don't know if he was in uniform.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief clerk at the Southwark Police-court—on 30th January I took down the depositions of John Tetlow in the case of Collett and Russell and then on the remand on 6th February—Tetlow was further examined—he was not then charged, but Collett and Russell were under the Vagrancy Act, and he tendered himself as a witness for them—I took down his evidence in this note-book, it is not signed by him, (<hi rend="italic">The deposition of George Tetlow stated that he was superintendent of the Volunteer Fire Brigade at Elmira Street, Lewisham, and that the Brigade had assisted in extinguishing fires; he produced the balance-sheet and first annual report showing that they had 268 annual subscriptions and applied the money to the purposes of the Brigade.</hi>

I was with the last witness on 29th January about half-past 8 or a quarter to 9, and saw Russell and Collett go into the King's Arms and into a shop adjoining that, Mr. Joel's, and then into Mr. Pond's—Martin went in, I stopped outside—afterwards Martin called me, and in my presence told the prisoners that he was going to charge them—I told Collett he would have to go to the station with me—he said, "We are only collecting for the South London Fire Brigade"—I took this book (C) from him—he said, "That is where we enter the money that we collect—I have examined the book—it covers from 22nd December, 1884, to 29th January, 1885—in that time the amount collected is 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I searched Collett and found on him a tobacco-pouch, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. bronze—I went with Martin to the premises on the second occasion.</p>

I am 14—I live at 11, Abingdon Road, Mr. Jones's dairy shop; he is my uncle—on 30th December, at 7 o'clock, two women came in; I served them with two eggs, which came to 1 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each; they gave me a shilling—I gave them change—they left, taking the eggs with them—I put the shilling on one side, where we keep the coppers for change—I noticed there was "one shilling" on it; it was not all worn smooth—afterwards my aunt came into the shop, and I put the shilling in the till—directly afterwards the constable came and spoke to me, and I took the shilling out—there was another shilling in the till, which was worn quite smooth—I am quite sure the one I took out and showed to the policeman was the one the prisoner had given me—afterwards my uncle took it to the police-court and gave it to the policeman.</p>

               <p>and said "It is wrong lot altogether"—I passed a constable in Stamford Street, but his back was towards me—I gave Garrod in custody to a City policeman on Blacakfriars Bridge—he said he lived over this side of the water, but there was another charge against him and a warrant out for him, and he lived on this side of the water—in the end I had hold of the watch, and he would not give it to me, but he gave it to a constable of the L Division, over the bridge—I did not see my more of Williams till he was apprehended on Monday evening, when I identified him from a lot of men—I didn't count them, there were a goodish many—I picked him out without any trouble—I can swear these are the two men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Garrod.</hi> Idid not ask you for the watch—you did not show it me till we got to the cigar shop—I did not say, "You give me the watch and you keep the chain"—you did not ask me to treat you, and I did not say "Yes"—the houses were closed before this affair took place—you asked me for some tobacco—when I saw you take the watch you did not lay any hands on the prosecutor, you did not use any violence; it was the other prisoner that used the violence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Williams.</hi> I stated before the Magistrate that you had the gentleman's handkerchief round your neck, your pal told me so—I did wot see you go into a shop with the prosecutor—I heard him say that he did not want to go down the turning—I was close behind—you struck the gentleman on the facae or neck—I do not know the name of the public-house or the barman.</p>
