                  </hi>. I am seventeen years old, and am apprentice to Mrs. Montague, of Ickenham. On 24th June I was with the prisoner, and a boy named Finch, coming from Ickenham—I had two trace chains in my hand—I put them round the prisoner's legs and round my arm—I caught hold of his legs, and Finch took his arms, and we carried him—the chain was not tight, so as to hurt him—we carried him ten or twelve yards, and he said, "Put me down"—we put him down, but he did not get away, as the chain was round his legs and my arm—he said, "I have got something in my pocket which will make you leave go, you b——r"—he put his left hand in his pocket, pulled out a knife, and cut me across the wrist, round which the chain was—it drew blood—I saw the knife coming a second time—I was not quick enough, and he cut me across the left knee—I told Finch it was a <hi rend="italic">tidy</hi> gash, and that he had cut my knee—he said, "You b——r; and I will rip your b——y guts out when I get up" (he was sitting on the ground with the chain still round me—I was going to release it when I put him down, but he would not give me time)—Finch said, "No, you shan't"—I caught hold, of</p>

               <p>him, and took the knife away; the point of it stuck into my finger, but that was an accident—we walked on together some distance, and were good friends, and Finch gave him back his knife—I asked him to give me a piece of sticking-plaster, and I would say no more about it—he said, "No, I shan't; I <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it, and I shall not give you any"—we all went to his mother's; she strapped it up for me, and told me to have him locked up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am seventeen years old, and live at Ickenham. On 24th June, the prisoner, Cursley, and I were at play—Cursley had some chains, which he put round the prisoner's legs, and round his own arm, and told me to catch hold of his shoulders, and we would carry him—we carried him ten or twelve yards, and when he told us we put him down gently—either Cursley did not let go of him just at that minute, or else he could not get away—he pulled out his knife, and said, "I have got something in my pocket which will make you leave go of me"—he pulled out a knife, opened it, and cut Cursley across the wrist—Cursley said, "This is a <hi rend="italic">tidy</hi> gash"—he said, "Yes"—Cursley then said, "He has cut my knee"—the prisoner said, "Yes, and I will rip your b—y guts out"—his knee bled very much—I took the knife from the prisoner, and said he should have it when he got home—we went to Mr. Treadaway's public-house to see the cut, as it was bleeding—Cursley asked the prisoner for some sticking-plaster; he said, "No, I have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it, and I shan't give it you"—we went to the prisoner's mother's, who gave him some sticking-plaster, and strapped it up.</p>

I should advise you to keep it a little while and get a situation"—he said, "You are a good sort of a fellow; I will treat you to a glass of brandy and water"—I said, "Thank you, but I don't want any now"—Bailey did not appear to know Lawler at that time—Lawler asked Bailey whether he could play at <hi rend="italic">knock-em-downs</hi>—Bailey said, "I don't know what you mean; in my county we play at bowls on the green, with a wooden ball"—Lawler said, "If you can play at that, you can play at <hi rend="italic">knock-em-downs"</hi>—he said, "I don't know what you mean, but I have got plenty of money, and don't mind playing you for a bottle of wine"—I said, "You can't play here; there are no skittles here"—Lawler said, "Oh, I will take you to a place where you can play"—Bailey said, "Put your money down, and I will put a sovereign into the butcher's hands"—Lawler said, "I have but 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, but that is enough for a bottle of wine;" and he put 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. into my hands—I said, "Where are you going?"—Lawler said, "You follow me; I will take him down to the John Bull"—the prisoners walked arm-in-arm, and I went with Ward to the John Bull, in Brewer-street—we went into the skittle-ground—Lawler and Bailey commenced playing, and Bailey lost—Lawler knocked them all down at one time, and Bailey went about seven or eight times; he threw the ball as though he could not throw it at all—the wine was brought and paid for, and drunk—they then commenced playing for a sovereign, and Bailey kept losing—I said to him, "You had better not play; you will lose all your money"—he said, "Oh, I don't mind losing a hundred or two; I have got plenty of money"—every game he played he lost—the money was handed over as it was lost—a knock came to the door, and another party was let in—Lawler said to him, "This is private; you can't come in here"—he said, "Yes, I can come in here for a minute; you don't mind me," and he let him in—that person went by the name of Johnson then, but he gave me a different name afterwards—Bailey still kept playing, and Johnson betted, and Bailey lost all the time—Johnson betted with Bailey and Bailey paid him—Lawler said to me, "Why don't you have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it is a shame that this man (referring to Johnson) should come in and win his money"—I said I did not want his money; I should not bet—he said, "You may as well have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he is sure to lose it all"—I then betted 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and then Bailey went in and won—he was then playing with Lawler—I betted that Bailey would not get them down in five times—he had got them down in about eight or nine times before, and then he got them down in five times—I paid that 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Bailey—I then had the same bet with him again, and lost another 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he got them down in four times—he then said, "I will bet you 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185007080015"/>
               <p>you can't get them down in nine times"—I said, "No, I can't bet you 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for I have not got any money in my pocket"—Lawler and Johnson the came to me and said, "Oh, you can go and get 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it will not be much trouble for you"—I said, "No, I can't; it would not do for me to go home"—they said, "Have you not got anybody in the neighbourhood that would lend you the money?"—Johnson said, "If it was not so late I would go down to my brother, who is a merchant in the city, and he would lend me the money in a minute"—I said, "There was a party in the neighbourhood, if he was at home, that would lend me the money;" and I went with Johnson to Mr. Thorp's, in St. John-street-road—that was about four o'clock in the afternoon—I got 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Thorp, and came back with Johnson to the John Bull—before I went for the money Bailey wanted me to put 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down for a deposit—I said I had but 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I had 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when I left home, and I had lost 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Johnson said, "Well, I have got 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I will lend you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to make up the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I put into Ward's hands, and then I went and borrowed the 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which made it 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on our return Bailey said, "Oh, it was for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that we made this bet, and unless you stick to the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or put down 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I will not bet"—I said, "Why, you know I have been out to borrow this money, and I have not got 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., therefore I cannot stake it; and Ward immediately came up, and gave Bailey his 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Johnson 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was the deposit—Bailey then said, "I will play you for 20<hi rend="italic">l."</hi>—I agreed—Lawler and Johnson put up the pins—a party wanted to come into the ground to put them up, but Lawler would not allow him to come in—I said I wished some one else to come in, but Lawler said, "I will put them up for you," and he did—I went first, and got them down in four times; Bailey got them down in three times—I paid him the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Lawler said he thought Bailey was getting stronger, and he said I was <hi rend="italic">funking;</hi> but he said, "You are sure to beat him next time; go on again"—I went on again for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the result was the same as before—I think I went five times; Bailey went less than I did—I paid that 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Lawler said, "The landlord thinks we are playing for money, and we must go from here"—I said, "I have lost my money"—he said, "Come along with me, and I will take you to a place where you are sure to win it back again"—I had been drinking at this time—I went in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the Sportsman—Ward, a man whose name I now believe to be Powell; Lawler, Bailey, and Johnson, also went—we had six glasses of brandy and water there, and some cigars—we did not go into the skittle-ground there—we then went in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the Duke of Bridgwater, near the Haggerstone gas-works—just before we got there Lawler ordered the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man to stop, and said he would go and see whether the ground was all clear—he went, and came back and said it was all right—we went into the skittle-ground there, and Bailey and I played—I knocked them down in five times and Bailey in less—I lost 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and paid it—I then said I had lost all my money and had not got any more—Bailey said, "Oh, you are a respectable man; you can give me an I O U, or something of that, for anything you like, or a check on your banker"—I said, "No, I "can't do that"—he said, "Oh, I will go and fetch a pen and ink"—he did so, and a piece of paper, and I wrote "Pay to Mr. Stephens;" Bailey went by that name—it was for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I signed it in the name of "William Brand"—Lawler said, "We know that is not your name; you are a respectable man, and we can make you pay another day; we can prove that you wrote it"—Ward said, "Don't, Tom, give them a check," and I said, "I am not such a fool as to sign my own name to anything of the sort"—we played, and I lost—I was then stupid drunk—Bailey kept up the appearance of being intoxi<lb/>cated all the time—I put the paper into Powell's hands before that, and when</p>

               <p>I lost he handed it over to Bailey—Bailey then pulled out his watch, and said it was past seven o'clock, and he had got an appointment to meet his dear Mary, and he could not disappoint a lady, and he must be off—Lawler said, "Oh, don't go yet; have another game"—he said, "Well, I will have another game, but I must go outside to make water"—he went out but did not return—I went out, and found he was gone out of the house, and I saw him running down the street—Lawler laid hold of my arm, and said, "Don't you run after him; I can run faster than you; I will fetch him back;" and he prevented me from running, and then he got out of sight—he said, "I will take care you shall have your money back again"—I said they were all a set of sharpers together—Lawler said, "You must mind what you are saying, I am as respectable a man as you are; and if you say so again I will bring an action against you to-morrow for defamation of character"—I asked him his name—he said, "My name is Dixon; I live at 16, York-place, City-road"—I afterwards went there, and could find no such number or any such person—Johnson said his name was John Weston, of 48, Cleveland-street, Fitzroy-square—there is no such number, nor any such person living there—I became rather stupified afterwards—this occupied altogether from three o'clock till about seven—I cannot tell exactly how much I had drunk—I had part of the bottle of wine at the John Bull, some brandy and water at the Sportsman, and we had some more brandy and water at the Duke of Biridg<lb/>water—I had not drunk any very great deal.</p>

On 3rd April, I saw Mr. Bland there, playing at skittles with Bailey when I took some wine to the wicket, which was fastened—I have seen Bailey there before, about four or five times, playing at skittles—I know Lawler, but not quite so well as Bailey—I saw him at the back of the house on 3rd April, but I understand since it was his brother—I heard so from three or four persons since I was before the Magistrate—I heard his brother say it was him—his brother is here to-day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a woollen-draper, of Aldgate. The prisoner was in my employ about two months—on 1st July I called in an officer—I had observed the prisoner to go up to his bedroom at a time when he had no right to go there—I asked him, in the officer's presence, why he went there—he said he went for his handkerchief—his boxes were searched, which were in his bedroom on the third-floor—he was present—I found there a piece of black kerseymere and a piece of marsella quilting for waistcoats—I asked him where he got them—he said he bought them, fifteen months ago, of a man in the Borough, who was since dead—they were wrapped in these two papers, which had come out of the shop—one of them is written on—I compared them with the pieces from which they had been taken, and which I produce—this white one matched in every respect, except that a piece has been cut off it—this black one matches thread for thread.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single. On 17th June, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening I met the two prisoners—they asked me to direct them to the British Museum—I turned round to direct them, and Ellis turned round very quickly, and came to my right side—while I was speaking to them, a young man stared at me—when I turned again, Ellis moved her shawl very quickly—we separated; and in consequence of her coming so close to me, I put my hand into my pocket the moment I left them, and my purse was gone—there was one sovereign and seven shillings in it—I had it safe about three minutes before—I had only come from No. 4 to No. 6, and had walked straight along—I went back—the prisoners were both together, and a young man was speaking to them—Ellis was looking after me—I did not go up to them—they stood there a minute or two, and went across the road—I followed them—they went down Chandos-street, and down Queen Ann's-mews—the man went in an opposite direction—I followed the prisoners—they ran up the steps of a house in the mews—I gave them into custody—the man was five or six yards from me.</p>

On 30th or 31st May I saw this brooch in a small Indian in laid box on the drawing-room table—the box did not belong to me—I don't know how the brooch came in it; it was usually kept in my own box, in my bedroom—it was produced to me on 24th June—it was the prisoner's duty to clean the drawing-room—she had been in my father's service about five months.</p>

On 29th Jan., about a quarter to twelve o'clock in the day, I was going towards my own house by a footpath which leads from Silver-street to Church-rood, and the prisoner and a man named Burgess stopped me—they were standing on the footpath before me—I understand there were three, but one I could not swear to, because he was the watcher—I am quite sure the prisoner was one of them—I had seen him before—he lives in Water-lane—the prisoner clasped me round the arms, and pushed me up against the wall, and Burgess came and unbuttoned my pocket, and pulled out my purse, which contained eight shillings and one sixpence, and they both ran away—Burgess was taken and tried two sessions ago.

Last Monday, about half-past four o'clock in the morning, I was at the Red Lion, in the Strand—the prisoner was there, and nine or ten others—I was standing, talking to some people, and the prisoner got up, and began sparring with me—I was afterwards leaning against the bar, and a woman came up and pushed me, and my watch was snatched clear away from me—I cannot say who did it—the prisoner was standing next to me—the young man serving at the counter said, "Your watch is here"—I turned round, laid hold of the prisoner, and in turning him round the watch dropped either from his side or the person next him—there were three or four others there—a friend with me laid hold of the prisoner, and said, "You stole his watch"—he said he had not—I gave him in charge—I did not see him do anything.</p>

I was equerry in waiting on Thursday, 27th June—Her Majesty left Buckingham Palace about six o'clock that day, in an open barouche, of the usual height—it drove up Constitution-hill and down Piccadilly, to Cambridge-house, where Her Majesty alighted—she left Cambridge-house about half-past six; the carriage came out of the east gate, the one nearest St. James's-street, and furthest from Hyde-park—there was, at the gate, the usual crowd that always attends on such occasions; not an unusaal crowd—the carriage necessarily proceeded slowly, to enable the leaders to turn into the street; it was almost stationary—I saw a well-dressed man step forward as the carriage passed the gates—what he did I could not exactly see—I saw Renwick, the footman, who was behind, lean forward and seize that man by the collar; and that man was the prisoner—I was on horseback behind, and had not got out of the gate—as I was passing on the prisoner came behind the rumble, and the crowd instantly closed in—I saw the police take hold of him, and I went after the carriage, which drove on—when Her Majesty arrived at Buckingham Palace, Sir James Clark was sent for—I afterwards saw a bandage on Her Majesty's forehead, and the blood was coming through the bandage.</p>

On Thursday, 27th June, about twenty minutes past six o'clock, I was among the crowd waiting for Her Majesty to leave Cambridge-house—I was standing in the front part of the crowd, and the prisoner came and took his station at my right elbow, so close as to touch me; he made an attempt to get in front of me, and I put my arm in front of him again—while stand<lb/>ing by the side of him Her Majesty came out in an open barouche, and at the moment it was in front of us it halted a second for the outriders to clear the way—we were at the Hyde-park side, the right side of the carriage, the same on which Her Majesty was sitting, and the prisoner made one step in advance and struck Her Majesty—he had his right hand free, and he struck with that hand—the blow appeared to me to fall partly on the Queen's bonnet and partly on her face; I could not see distinctly.</p>

                  </hi>. I was Lieutenant-Colonel of the 10th Hussars in 1841, when the prisoner joined it as cornet—he became lieutenant in due time—he remained in the regiment till March, 1846—when he joined it was quartered in England, we were afterwards a few years in Ireland, and then went back to England—about 1844, when we were quartered at Cahir, and he at Clonmel, an accident happened to some horses and a dog of his—between the time of his joining the regiment and that time, I had noticed peculiarities in his manner—the very first day he joined I thought there was something very odd about him—he had his hair cut close to his head, and I was under the impression that be had had his head shaved for some complaint, and he had rather a wildish look about him—as an officer he discharged his duties very well, to the best of his abilities—I never had occasion to find fault with him; and as to his being a gentleman, there was no doubt about that—he was very much liked by his brother officers, and respected by the regiment—he had a favourite Newfoundland dog, and, I think, as many as three valuable horses, to which he was very much attached—Major Walling<lb/>ton had then the command of the regiment at Clonmel—it was reported to me that Major Wallington's dog bit Mr. Pate's dog, and the horses after<lb/>wards went mad, and were shot—after that I noticed a change in the prisoner's conduct and appearance; and there was another circumstance, he had a very sensitive mind, and he appeared to be exceedingly annoyed at some correspondence that took place between his father and the Duke of Welling<lb/>ton, in respect to the loss of these horses—there was some claim made on the Major for the value of the horses, in consequence of the accident having arisen through one of his dogs—he felt hurt that his friends should make such a claim on a brother officer—after that he appeared not to have the same love for his profession; he did not seem to do his duty with the zeal that he did before—previous to that be used to mix with the other officers—afterwards his life was more secluded, and he was in the habit of taking very long walks, particularly when he went to Newbridge, in very wild secluded places—I cannot speak positively whether he estranged himself more from the company of his brother officers, because, from my position in the regiment, I was not so much among these gentlemen as the junior officers were—some time after that, at New-bridge, he complained to me that he was unwell, and said he had applied to the doctor of the regiment, and he had given him no relief—I asked what was the matter with him, he answered, and said his stomach and bowels were full of bricks, and that the doctor had not the skill to remove them—I saw directly the delusion he was under, and endeavoured to persuade him what was the fact, that the doctor was a person of great ability, and be was considered on the sick-list after that—to the best of my knowledge he did not replace the horses—he may have replaced one; I cannot speak positively, but I had great trouble about them—in June, 1845, I sent him from Newbridge with a detachment to Dublin, ordering him to return the following day; he left the detachment at Dublin, without leave, absented himself, and I was told he went to Eng<lb/>land—that is a military offence of a serious character—I communicated with General Wyndham on the subject—he came back after some days; I forget exactly the number of days he was absent—he was not brought to a court-martial</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185007080051"/>
               <p>—I saw him after he came back; I thought him very wild, and he could give no account of himself why he went away—in consequence of what I observed in his conduct and demeanour, I made a communication with his father, putting it in as delicate a way as I could—I did not like exactly to tell his father that I thought him insane; a few months after, I think, he left the regiment.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did that altered manner and appearance continue until he left the regi<lb/>ment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was sot so much after he was released from arrest; at least, I had not the same opportunities of seeing him—when I did see him I had not opportunities of observing him so closely as I had before—I was not with the regiment when he left; I was on leave—he made a present of his uniform and accoutrements to the adjutant of the regiment—I have known parts of an officer's appointments given, and I have known the horse given, but I never knew a man give the entire of his things—he gave all—on the very afternoon of this unfortunate transaction I met Mr. Pate, about three o'clock, in Picca-dilly, and I observed that his manner was more excited than usual—he was walking in his usual manner, but swinging bis arms and his stick a little more than I had ever seen him do before—he was in the habit of swinging his arms—he has a very peculiar gait—every one used to turn round and look at him—he always carried a small stick; I never saw him without—I have frequently seen him since he left the regiment, always taking his usual walk between Duke-street and the Parks—I have met him at different hours taking the same walk, and always swinging his arms in a peculiar manner, but I never saw him in such an excited state as he was at three o'clock on the Thursday—I was walking with a friend at that time, and we both remarked his appearance.</p>

I joined the 10th Hussars in 1842, after Mr. Pate—I was quartered with him first at Ballincoli, and afterwards at Cahir—I forget whether I saw him in Dublin or not, but I saw him at Newbridge after the accident to his horses—he seemed rather more odd in his manner than he had been before—he was always odd—I think his manner and conduct was matter of conversation and observation in the regiment—I have only seen him once since he left the regiment—that was in the Green Park, near Piccadilly, about the beginning of this year—he was walking down the Park, very fast, and very upright, swinging his arms a great deal.</p>

               <p>one particular spot; near a pond which he used to pass in his walk, and he would frequently stop there, and stand and notice it for a few minutes, and then run and jump into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he would sometimes order me to go as fast as I could gallop, and then he would pull me up, and order me to walk down Roehampton-lane—I then used to take him to Barnes-common—he used to get out at one certain place there, and take a regular walk over the common among the furze-bushes and briars—I used to take him up again at a certain point, always the same point, and then drive him home—he would sometimes stop at a nursery-garden and buy 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-worth of flowers; we always came the same road home, over Hammersmith-bridge—his manner was very peculiar in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—his manner of ordering me first to gallop, then to stop, and jump<lb/>ing from one side of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the other—as I sat behind, I used to open the trap and look through, my curiosity was very much excited—it used to be dark in winter-time driving down Roehampton-lane, a large avenue of trees; it would be dark before we got to Barnes-common—he would walk through the furze-bushes there in the dark, hail, rain, blow or snow—while in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> he would sometimes jump and start very much, and sometimes he would sit still and never stir the whole journey—he used to have a small cane with him, which he used to flourish about this way and that way—I cannot say whether this is the cane (<hi rend="italic">looking at the one produced</hi>)—it was similar to it, if it was not that—he would lay on the front of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and take the cane and cut it this way and that way—I do not know what performance it was; he seemed to be thoughtless, or something of that kind—I suppose some sudden thought caused him to jump and start, as if he did not know what he was about—many respectable people on the road would stop me in their carriage, and gentlemen on horseback, to ask who or what he was, whether, he was not a madman—this lasted every day for fifteen or eighteen months, without any interruption, whatever might be the weather, and Sunday the same—he used to pay me every day when I brought him home—at first it was 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and afterwards reduced to 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I do not know how it came to be reduced—he said to me one day that he should only give me 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he paid me with the 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he contined on paying that, and I never contradicted it, as it was a sufficient remuneration for the journey—he always paid me in shillings, never anything but shillings, and they were always placed with the man upwards, and all the men's faces one way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Isabella Fleming, a silversmith in St. Martin's-lane; it is her dwelling-house. On 28th June, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the shop, and saw the prisoner dash his fist through a square of glass—I went out and brought him into the shop, and a soldier handed me this watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which had been in the window—it is Mrs. Fleming's property.</p>

I was in St. Martin's-lane on this day—I heard some glass break, turned round, and saw the prisoner thrust his hand into the window, and pull out this watch—I seized him; took it from him, and gave it to the shopman; held the prisoner till a policeman came up and took him—his hand was bleeding at the time—I asked what motive he had for doing it, he said he wanted a watch, and he thought that one would suit him.</p>

The prisoner Macklin is my brother—this negligee chain was in the box, at Dr. Tilt's, in which the linen was that the cook and I took out—I do not know who took this chain out—it was taken out in York-street—the cook was not there—I did not take it out—I did not see it taken out—I did not see it again till it was at Guildhall—when it was produced to me, I said it was a chain that was in the box—I had seen it in the box at the time we opened it—I know these spoons—I saw them taken out of the box—I believe they were taken out by my brother—Osborne was present in the kitchen—they were both standing together—it is a very small kitchen—I should think Osborne was half a yard from the box—he could see what the other prisoner was doing—the chain was not visible then—the chain and the spoons were taken together—I saw the spoons taken, but not the chain—the chain was still in the box when the spoons had been taken—I never heard my brother say anything about the gold chain—this was about 30th May—they were taken out the same day that my brother was taken prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married. I know the prisoner Macklin by his being acquainted with my husband—on 30th May, he came into my place, about five minutes past one o'clock—he asked me if I could go on an errand for him to pawn these things—I said I did not altogether like going—he said I should do him a great service that he was sent by a person who went by the name of Chapman, but her proper name is Hammond—he asked me to go to Martin's, and to ask 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the spoons—he said they had been in pawn before for 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and to get as much as I could on the chain—he said he did not know whether it was gold or no—he asked me to go, because I was known at Martin's—he said I might as well go, and said the chain belonged to Mrs. Chapman—he was alone—there was no one there but me and my little child—he did not come with anybody—he never brought a soul into my place—I left him in charge of my little child while I went to the pawnbroker's—some demur was made, and I went and fetched Macklin—I told him I though they suspected something was wrong—he came at once, and I followed him with my little child.</p>

On 3rd June, between seven and eight o'clock, some policemen and the prisoner came to the bottom of my stairs, and the prisoner halloed out, "Is my brother here?"—I said, "No, he is gone to work"—he said, "Here are two policemen after him, I do not know what he has been up to"—the policemen asked if the <hi rend="italic">missus</hi> was up—I said no, but they were welcome to come in—the prisoner's brother does lodge with me—they came in, and I told them he had gone to work—the prisoner was in the room, by their side—one of the policemen asked me if I knew where he was at work—I said, "No"—he said he would find him—he is a bricklayer's labourer—the prisoner was there all the time.</p>

In consequence of directions, on 20th May I made inquiries respecting this character paper—I found Churchman at the Swan, at the foot of Westminster-bridge—I showed him the paper, and asked him if the signature "Church-man" was his writing—he said, "Yes," he was aware he had done wrong, he did not know it at the time—while we were talking, Sibree came in, and Churchman said, "You have got me into a nice mess, here is a gentleman come to inquire about the paper I signed for you"—I then showed Sibree the paper—he said he did not think there was any harm in it, he had filled it up himself—I said, "Do you mean the whole of it?"—he said, "Yes, the whole of it"—I pointed out the signatures to him—he said they were his writing, that Smart was his landlord, he thought there was no harm in putting it—he did not know his Christian name, he believed it to be "William"—I called his attention to the signature of "Gibbs"—he said he did not know what his Christian name was, but he believed it begun with "P."</p>

                  </hi>. I live in King-street, Drury-lane. On 27th April I lived at 19, Short's-gardens, Drury-lane, on the second-floor back, in the same room with the prisoner and his wife—they had three children living in the room—the wife's name is Ann—on Sunday, 28th April, I went home, about a quarter to one o'clock in the morning, and found the prisoner, his wife, and a little boy, in the room—the prisoner was sitting in a chair, and she was standing in the room—they were quarrelling—I understood they had been drinking together—they were drunk, but he was the most so—I said to her, "Let him go to bed; have no words with him; you know what an awful tem<lb/>per he is"—she went to make the bed, and made him some improper answer—he got over a chair, and struck her with his fist on the side of the head, as she was making the bed—she fell on her side—he kicked her several times, when she was down, in the side and back—he continued beating her half an hour before 1 left the room; she called out, "Save me! do save me, Mary!" I said, "Mr. Donovan, pray don't hit her any more; consider what hour of the morning this is!"—he said, "Keep out from me, I will serve you the same;" and pushed me aside—she kept crying out, "Oh don't, <hi rend="italic">Dan,</hi> pray don't hit me any more!"—and the more she begged of him, the worse he hit her—I went out of the room for a policeman, but went some distance before I could find one—I returned in about twenty minutes, and found she had been thrown out at the window, and taken to the hospital—I saw a great quantity of blood in the yard, and on the floor of the room.</p>

I remember some policemen coming on a Saturday night, and taking my mother to the hospital—I was sitting up in the room, and my father and mother came home—they quarrelled, and he said, "If you give me any more words I will cut your jaw"—my mother was making the bed; it was on the floor, and he broke the leg of a chair by beating it round my mother's back six or seven times—she said, "Pray let go me," but he did not stop—when the leg came off the chair, he took it and beat her on the side—Mary Burke and my sister came in together, before the chair was broken, and my sister said to my father, "If you leave go of my mother I will give you a quarter of an ounce of tobacco in the morning," and he gave my sister a punch with his hand—my sister and Mary Burke went down together—my mother then said to me, "Show me the stairs"—my father was then looking for the pound weight, and he sent me down for a three-farthing candle—he asked me for the weight and the poker, and I would not give them to him—my mother went to the stairs—he said, "Come in," and she came in—she thought he was going to let her be, but he locked the door at the top, where I could not reach it, and then beat her with the leg of the chair, and held her down, and punched her with his hand—she was lying by the cupboard, and he took her to the window; she did not go there of herself—he opened it; it draws in like a door—she said nothing, but I saw blood on her face—he put her on the ledge, and then <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> her out; she fell into the court below—he then put on a clean shirt, dressed himself, and told me to lie down and go to sleep, and then a policeman came and took him—I am sure my mother did not jump out; he lifted her on the ledge, and she held by the ledge—he said to me, "If you tell I <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> her out I shall beat you, and if you don't pretend to be asleep I shall beat you"—they were singing when they came home; the window was shut then; it was opened after Burke went out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gentleman, and live at 32, Great Prescot-street. My wife died in May, 1849—the female prisoner was then a servant in the house—the male prisoner afterwards married her, and slept in the house—on Wednesday, 28th May, I went to Gravesend with the male prisoner, leaving the female in possession of the house—I returned home about eight o'clock, and she was gone—I looked about, and missed two sheets, two blankets, two pillows, and a great number of other things—I saw the male prisoner again on the following Saturday, and asked where his wife was—he said he did not know—I never gave her any of the property—I am seventy-three years old.</p>

               <p>throw it at him—I got the prosecutor up, and he said, "I have been robbed of five sovereigns, and now they are trying to murder me"—a sergeant came—I left him at the house, and I took the male to the station—as I was returning I met the sergeant and the two women on the way to the station—they were not in custody then—it appeared to me that the prosecutor was <hi rend="italic">bothered</hi> by the striking he had had, and did not at the time exactly know who had been ill-treating him—when he had recovered a little he recognized the female Haseman, and the next morning he recognized Smith.</p>

I went to 12, John's-place, on the night of 1st July, and found Pye there, and the three prisoners and the prosecutor in the front parlour—the prosecutor was bleeding from just over the eye, and his waistcoat and handkerchief were covered with blood—I asked him, in the prisoners' hearing, what was the matter—he said he had been assaulted and robbed—I asked who did it—he said, "That man," and pointed to the male prisoner—I asked if he would give him into custody and charge him—he said, "I will"—the other constable then left with him—after that I was searching, and the female Haseman said to the prosecutor, "You had better go to Mr. Cooper's public-house, where you were this afternoon, and see whether you have left it there," and both the females said, "Search him"—27 <hi rend="italic">K</hi> asked the prosecutor if he had got it himself, and he said, "I have it," and I saw 27 <hi rend="italic">K</hi> take the purse and contents from the prosecutor's left hand—I examined it, and it contained seven sovereigns—the prosecutor was stand<lb/>ing near the drawers at the time—Haseman said at the station, "I know nothing about the man."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, and live in Henry-street, Old Kent-road. On 23rd June, I was at a public-house in High-street, Deptford—I came out about twelve o'clock, and on my way home I saw six or seven men quarrelling—I stopped and looked on, but did not interfere—some one came and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> us off the path, and told us to go on—I went to go on, and as soon as I got to the corner of the street, I saw the prisoner and another run<lb/>ning after me—I saw the prisoner pull a brickbat out of his pocket as he ran—I ran to a policeman for protection, and no sooner had I got behind the policeman than the brick hit me on the head, and knocked me down—the prisoner threw it with force when he was not more than three yards from me—it wounded my head—I could not see out of my eyes for a week from the effect of the blow—it bled a good deal—he was taken on the spot—I had done nothing to provoke him—he was one of the party quarrelling—they were not fighting.</p>

About one o'clock in the morning of 1st July I was in the New Kent-road—I met Emma Smith and two females—she came and spoke to me—I went home with her, in a turning out of the Kent-road—I remained about a quarter of an hour—I had a handkerchief in my right coat-pocket when I went in—I saw nobody but her in the house—when I came out I missed my handkerchief—no one was near me after I left her before I missed it—I went back, saw her and two other females—I asked her whether she had got my handkerchief—she denied it—I gave her into custody—I afterwards saw James Smith in custody—either he or the officer took his hat off, and I saw my handkerchief in the officer's hand—this is it.</p>
