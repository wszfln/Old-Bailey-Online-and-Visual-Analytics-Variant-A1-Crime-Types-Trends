I am a musician, of 67, Sussex Road, Holloway—on the early morning of November 10th I was going up St. Martin's Lane on the right<lb/>hand side, and when I got to New Street I saw the prisoners standing there—Doolan stepped aside, as I thought, to allow me to pass, and as he stepped back I received a very heavy blow with some hard instrument on my right shoulder<lb/>bone, and I fell down—my hand was in my coat pocket, and as I lay on my back Doolan was over me—I had a valuable diamond ring in my scarf—I felt a hand at my throat—I clutched at the hand, and was struck on my hand—I saved the ring—I was struck with the instrument while I was down—there was a light in the public-house at the corner—I saw their faces quite distinctly—they were photographed in my mind—after the assault I felt a hand in my pocket, where I had £2 10s.—the prisoners ran away—there was no one round—I endeavoured to get up, but my shoulder was so painful that I could not rise—I eventually got on my feet and went along St. Martin's Lane till I met a policeman—I told him, and he took me to Bow Street, where I gave a description of the men—I afterwards went to Bow Street again, and picked out Doolan from eight other men—I have no doubt he is the man who robbed me—I went to Bow Street again and picked out Casson—I have no doubt about him.</p>

I live at 3, Great Wild Street—I saw Horan about 2.30 outside my shop on November 13th—he went with me to Mr. Woodyard's, at Bloomsbury, where I bought a pair of soles and some nails—I gave them to Horan, and he took them to my brother Alexander, at 3, Great Wild Street—I told him to meet me at Southampton Row; that was about 10 minutes to 3—I told him I was going to Shoreditch, and he could go with me if he liked—we got on a tram, and went to Shore<lb/>ditch—we then went to Bethnal Green Road, and I went into a ware-house and bought my goods—I gave the parcel to Horan, and he carried it for me to Shoreditch Church, where we got on a tram and returned to Great Wild Street, at about 4.30 or 4.40—I then left the prisoner talking to my brother, and I went down to tea—the prisoner was making arrangements to order a van to do some moving which took place that evening—I left the shop about 4.50—I did not see the prisoner fter<lb/>wards.</p>

Failing to gain the evidence they required, they let then go, and a fortnight after, during which time they obtained more serviceable material to work on, in the person of the convicted thief, Joseph Morris, they again arrested McCarthy and Barton, and brought against them Joseph Morris as chief witness, and made him (Bennett) responsible for stealing almost everything they found at his house. He submitted that for a wealthy railway company, with every resource at their command to obtain respectable evidence, it was an unfair way to build up a case against them, and that there was no evidence to show that he conspired with the other prisoners.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live with my mother and step<lb/>father at 210, Clyde Road, Tottenham—my mother's name is Norris—we have been living at Clyde Road about seven years, as near as I can say—we were living there when I first made the acquaintance of the prisoner, which was about three or four years ago—the deceased was born on April 24th, 1896, and I took charge of him when he was three weeks old—I had advertised that I was willing to take a nurse<lb/>child, and in answer the prisoner came to Clyde Road and saw my mother and I—she asked what my proficiency and experience was, and I told her I had been a nurse for a clergyman's family, and that I was willing to take the child—I was to be paid £1 17s. per month, and I was paid the first month in advance—it was arranged, a few days after the first interview, that I was to go and fetch the child from Mrs. Ballard's, of 17, Highgate Hill, Islington—I took the child back to Clyde Road, and prisoner came with me—from that time up to October 22nd, with a few exceptions, when the child was in the hospital for an operation for circumcision, it remained with me—the child had three operations; two at home, and one at the hospital—while the deceased was in our care the prisoner came and saw him once a fortnight at first, but about 18 months ago she began to come once a week—it was about then that she went to live with her sister, Mrs. Cadisch, in the Bethune Road—she seemed very fond of the boy, and the boy of her—I became very fond of him, and he of me—we were all very fond of him, and he of us—he never seemed quite so well since he has been circumcised, and I told his mother so—he seemed weaker—the £1 17s. per month was always paid, and if the prisoner came on a Wednesday and the money was due on the Saturday, she would not wait till then, but would</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189912110031"/>
               <p>pay me on the Wednesday—the boy was about the same in October; he did not get weaker—the prisoner generally came on Wednesdays—I remember coming on Wednesday, October 4th, and taking the deceased out—I remember her coming on the 11th and taking him out, and my meeting them in the Seven Sisters Road, and we went on to Tottenham Green—we got there about 3.30, and stayed there till about 5—the prisoner and I sat about, and the child was playing—we were talking about the boy—we always had something fresh to ask about him—at 5 o'clock we thought it was time to go home to tea—we were very upset that day because the boy was so sick—we were sitting on a seat, and the prisoner said, "I think Manfred looks rather heavy about the eyes"—I said, "Yes, he does," and she said, "Don't you think we had better be getting home?" and so we went, and the little boy came over very pale—I thought he was tired, and his mother carried him home, and when we got home he was very sick—his mother was there then; she stayed till between 6 and 7—a doctor was not sent for while she was there—when she left the boy still seemed to be very sick, and I sent for a little brandy—after she had gone I went for a doctor, and I met the prisoner—she had said she was coming back to see the boy; she was bo sleep at the house—I said to her that I was going for a doctor, and she saw him when he came—he prescribed for the boy, and he got better—I was with the prisoner the whole of the time after she and the boy left the Seven Sisters Road—she did not speak to any<lb/>one else—from the time that she took the boy out till I met her in the Seven Sisters Road was between a quarter and half-an-hour—the arrange<lb/>ment to meet was made at home—the next day the boy seemed worse; he came out in a rash, and I sent for the doctor again—the prisoner had promised to come on the Friday, the 13th, but she did not come—her next ordinary visiting day would be the 18th, but on the 18th my mother got a letter—this is it, and it is in the prisoner's writing (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—before we received it we had had no intimation that the prisoner intended to remove the child from our care—it came as a great surprise to me—<hi rend="italic">This stated that the prisoner had seen the child's father, and that the child would be sent for to be removed from the care of Mrs. Norris, as his father wished him to be brought up in his cousin's family, and to start learning French; that she was very sorry to have to remove him, but did not like to raise objections, as she thought she would be in the way of his future prospects.</hi>)—on Wednesday, the 18th, the prisoner came—both I and my mother saw her, and October 27th was fixed for the child's departure—she did not say where she was going to take the child to—she did not name any country—it was first arranged that I should take the child to London Bridge, and she said that they would put up for an hour or two at an hotel until the boat started—I did not know where the boat started from, I was to leave them at London Bridge—the prisoner never made any statement as to the nationality of the child, or say anything about the father—she told me to take a change of clothing for the child, and told me what to take—she told me to put into a parcel a flannel shirt, a chemise, a petticoat, a white serge dress, and two overalls, and bring them with the child—I next saw the prisoner on Wednesday, the 25th, my mother being again present</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189912110032"/>
               <p>and an alteration was made in the plans—my mother suggested that I had better leave Manfred at the Birdcage public-house on Stamford Hill, where the <hi rend="italic">'buses</hi> start from, because the farther I went with him the more he would be opposed to parting with me—the Birdcage is not very far from Clyde Road or from Bethune Road—I was to be at the Bird<lb/>cage at 12.45—on the Friday I dressed the child—he had on a little red sailor hat; it had black ribbon round it, with "H.M.S. Raven" on it in gold letters, a blue serge frock trimmed with white braid, and a little band of white braid to form a cuff; a turn<lb/>down collar trimmed with white braid,' a little waistband of same material, with white braid on it—he had a blue cloth coat on, with brass buttons, with an anchor on each; it had fawn<lb/>coloured cuffs, with two capes of fawn colour—he also had on two petticoats, one of white flannelette and one of a grey striped flannel, a pair of white flannelette drawers with lace at the bottom, a white cotton shirt, with lace round the neck and sleeves, a pair of black socks which had been a good deal darned, brown shoes with little brown straps fawn gaiters, and a white silk tie round his neck—this blue cloth coat (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) he had last winter, and this blue serge frock (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) he had in the summer—the coat had a grease<lb/>mark on one of the sleeves—this. (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is the dress he had on; I see now that the white braid is taken off, and the collar and the band, also the braid which made the cuffs; I can see where the braid has been; there is a piece of it here now, and there is the cotton where I should think the collar has been taken off—I am sure that this is the little child's dress—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is the little boy's coat; the cuffs have been taken off, and the capes, the buttons, and the turn<lb/>down collar—I have got one of the capes in my bag, which matches; it was taken off some time ago by the prisoner—the greasefspot is here now—I have no doubt that this is the coat which was worn by the child when I took him out on October 27 th—when I took him out I took the change of clothing which the prisoner had spoken to me about, in a brown paper parcel—I also took a little pair of toy scales (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) in a separate brown paper parcel—the boy was accustomed to weighing things—he had had some sugar and currants on the morning of the day he went away—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is a photograph of the boy; that is how he looked on the 26th, when that was taken—we left on the 27th, and went by tram to the Birdcage, where we got out and met the prisoner—we got there first, and waited for her a few minutes—there was a <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> standing by the Birdcage—I think the prisoner got in, and I got in with the boy, but I would not be sure who got in first—I put the two parcels in the 'bus—I got out and waited till it drove off—both the boy and I were a good deal upset at parting; he screamed when I left him—that was the last time I saw him alive—I had asked the prisoner if she would give me a letter of reference; I said I had one from a doctor and from a clergyman, and she said she would give me one, and on Monday,. October 30th, this letter arrived, addressed to my mother, from her—(<hi rend="italic">This stated that she was very sorry to have had to take the boy from Mrs. Gentle's, that he had been thoroughly taken care of, and that she would be very pleased to answer any inquiry.</hi>)—letters had come from time to time to Clyde Road, addressed to Mrs. Mason; they had three stamps on them with</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189912110033"/>
               <p>a kind of a three on them; I should say they were foreign ones—the prisoner had asked me that if a letter came for Mrs. Mason, would we kindly for<lb/>ward it to 29, Bethune Road, addressed to Miss Masset—there was a second letter in the envelope which we received from her on October 30th—(<hi rend="italic">This stated that the prisoner had just returned from her journey, that the boy cried until she got to London Bridge, that she was very ill on the boat, that she enclosed the letter promised, and that the boy sent his love.</hi>)—I do not know what time those letters arrived, I was not at home, but I should say between 9 and 10 on the Monday morning—by then I had heard of something in the newspapers, and on the Monday morning I went to the Hackney Mortuary, between 9 and 10—I read something in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Mail</hi>, and I thought it seemed to tally, and before I did anything further, I went to our family doctor for advice, after which I went to the mortuary—that was before I went to the police—I was shown the body of a child which I identified as Manfred's—I did not identify him by the face—there were signs of injury to the face and head—it was dreadfully disfigured—it was like this photograph (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I think Sergeant Birch came to the mortuary while I was there—I made a statement to him, and then I made out a list of the clothes contained in the brown paper parcel—the sergeant took them down in writing—at that time I spoke from memory—I had not been shown any of the clothes—I was afterwards shown the serge dress, the blue coat which I identified, and the little toy scales—there was some sugar in them which the child had been playing with in the morning—I was also shown a piece of brown paper which I had received from a Mr. Shaw, who is a draper at Tottenham; it had "E. Shaw, draper, Tottenham," on it (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—the piece which I received from Mr. Shaw was too large for what I wanted it, and I cut a piece off, and. in doing so I cut part of the name off—in the piece which I cut off I wrapped up the extra clothes for Manfred; the piece which I kept and the piece in which I had wrapped up the clothes in were afterwards fitted together in my presence—these (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) are the scales, and the little pans in which Manfred weighed the sugar on. the 27th—I have no doubt that the body which I saw in the mortuary on the 30th was the body of Manfred Masset.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw the account in the paper of my having identified the child, but it said a middle<lb/>aged person—I will not be sure whether it said that the child was the child of a Frenchwoman—I read it in the <hi rend="italic">Evening News—(This stated that the poor little victim of the Dalston murder had been identified by the child's nurse, that it was the child of a Frenchwoman who took it away from her, that the police had an important clue, and that the nurse had frequently seen the mother, and that it was believed to be an illegitimate child</hi>)—during the last 18 months the visits of the mother had been weekly, sometimes oftener; the visits were generally on Wednesdays—Tottenham Green is about 10 minutes from our house—we generally went to the Down Hills—the prisoner might go with the child to Tottenham Green, but not often—by the little boy's conversation with his mother I think they had been there on October 4th—I did not go with them—I did on the 11th—the prisoner went first, and I went afterwards—we arranged to meet at the Seven</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189912110034"/>
               <p>Sisters Road—we stayed from about 3 o'clock to 4.30 or 5—there were no other people there—it was very quiet—the child did not play with any other children—we were sitting down talking, and the child was playing just in front of us—I can swear that he did not play with any other children on that day—that was the day the boy was not well—the doctor came in the evening—I do not remember him saying it was indigestion or a bilious attack—the prisoner came on the 18th—she did not take the child out; the 11th was the last day she took him out—he cried very much on the 18th; his mother noticed it—I think she stayed till about 6—after I put the child in the omnibus at the Birdcage I got out at once—I could not stay, I was so upset—I never had any difficulty in getting my money for the child—I was paid in full up to the time of the child being taken from my care—the prisoner was always very fond of the child—she was very worried when he underwent the operations—I did not pay for the operations—I do not know if any<lb/>body paid for tht m at the London Hospital—the child was hasty, but only the same as other children—he was always a good boy to manage; I could always manage him—I know I spoilt him a bit—I cannot remember the prisoner saying that she thought I spoilt him; she might have said, "You give way to him too much," or something like that—she said once or twice that the child exhibited a little temper when out with her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, living at 8, Ruel Road, Tottenham, and am the attendant at the first-class ladies' waiting<lb/>room, main line section at London Bridge Station—it is near the refreshment room—I was in attendance at the waiting<lb/>room on October 27th—I went on duty at 2.30 and remained there till 12.10 midnight—I saw the prisoner there about 2.40—I observed the little boy first; he had his back to her—then I looked at the prisoner to see what she was doing to the little boy—she was sitting on the couch—this is a photograph of the little boy (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), but he had a coat and a red hat on—if anybody is talking to me in the lavatory, I have a habit of always looking at the door to see if there is anybody there who ought not to be, and I saw the little boy going backwards, and I looked at the prisoner—I saw that the child did not want to go to the lady who was with him—I did not speak to him then; I spoke to him about 15 minutes afterwards, during which time the prisoner remained seated upon the couch—I was putting away my umbrella and bonnet in a cupboard where we hang them, and I saw the little fellow near the prisoner's knee, and he looked up, and I said, "What are you grizzling about?"—he came towards me, and I said, "There is nothing here for little boys"—he looked at me again, and I looked at the prisoner and said, "What is he fretting about?" and she said, "His nurse"—then she said, "Perhaps he is hungry; I will get him a cake"—I said, "He is a fine little fellow; how old is he?" and she said, "Four next April; have you a refreshment<lb/>bar here?" I said, "Yes, on the left as you go out of the door"—she got up and turned round and picked something up with her right hand, but I do not know what it was, and took the little boy by the right</p>

               <p>hand by her left and went out at the door; as she was going out she turned round and looked at me—I thought she was looking to see which way for the bar—I should think she left about 5 or 10 minutes past 3, the two minutes to three bell rang as I came out of the lavatory, and before I spoke to the little boy—I could not see in what direction she went because the door was shut—I next saw her coming up the room about six minutes to seven, but I did not notice that it was the prisoner until I went to draw some, water for her—she asked for a wash; she had her hat on—the lavatory is attached to the waiting<lb/>room, and has three basins in it—she washed in the middle one opposite the looking<lb/>glass—she was drawing up her sleeves, and I turned the water on for her—I looked at her in the glass, and said to myself, "Where have I seen you?"—and then I thought, "Oh, you are the lady I saw this afternoon with the little boy"——I was alongside her, and the glass was in front, and I saw her reflection—she washed her hands, and I went to the cupboard to get the towels; we lock them away—I gave her a towel—I did not see her do anything to her hair—I was making my tea in the waiting<lb/>room—after I had made my tea, I remembered I had not got any sugar, and I went in to the cup<lb/>board to get some, and the prisoner was brushing her jacket down and said to me: "Have you got a clothes brush?" I said "Yes; shall I brush you down?"—she said "No"—I said "You will have to hurry up, because it is quarter past 7 now"—when I was drawing the water, she said, "When is the next train for Brighton?" and I said "twenty past seven"—I gave her the clothes<lb/>brush—I did not see whether she used it—I went back to my tea——I saw her go out of the waiting-room door—that was about 7.18 or 7.20—the last time I looked at the clock it was 7.15, and the train goes at 7.22; but we always call it 7.20, as it has gone for so many years at 7.20—the prisoner had a brown paper parcel with her gloves on it at the end of the washing slab; it was not a tidy<lb/>looking parcel—the little boy was not with her then—on November 24th I went to a courtyard attached to the Dalston Junction, where I saw a cluster of women, and amongst them I saw the woman whom I had seen in my waiting-room on October 27th—I have no doubt that the prisoner is the woman.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not called before the Coroner—the incident at the Police-station was about a month after I saw the prisoner in the waiting-room—I had read of this case in the meantime—it interested me on account of London Bridge being mentioned—I do not think I read a description of the supposed murderess—I have read nothing that has been going on about it—I saw a supposed likeness of the child—I did not read a description of the child: one was not furnished to me—I do not think I said before the Magistrate, "I wondered if this was the child, from the description I saw"—I said, "I wondered if it was the boy with the red hat"—I saw the prisoner without her hat—that was long before I went to the Police-station—I said to the Magistrate, "I was putting the kettle on when the prisoner came back," and that I said nothing to her about having seen her earlier in the day—I did not ask her where her boy was—I was convinced when I saw her washing in the lavatory that she was the woman I had seen earlier in the day with the little boy—the gas was alight at 7 o'clock—sometimes we use 12 towels a day; it all depends on who the customer is—they</p>

               <p>pay extra for washing, and that includes one towel—in a quiet season sometimes we do not have a wash in the day—in the Brighton season sometimes 200 or 300 people, on an average, use the lavatory in the day—I cannot say how many use the waiting-room—I have taken £4 or £5 odd in the day in pennies—that was the Sunday before Jubilee, a great deal more than usual—there may be more people on Sundays—I do not know how many trains go—I have been in the waiting-room since July 24th, 1877—there are fewer trains on Sundays—I took an interest in the case, but I did not want to have anything to do with it—I did not com<lb/>municate with the police; they went to the Station Superintendent, who sent for me—there was a gentleman from the police with him when he sent for me—he asked me if I had seen a lady with the little boy on such a day—I think he mentioned the day, but I am not sure—I did not deny it—he did not describe the little boy to me, or the woman—he asked me if I should know her, and I said I should know her if I saw her—when I got to the station I had no hesitation about identifying her—I saw her on the steps of the station, and I said, in my own mind, "There you are"—it is not true to say that I stopped two or three times before reaching the prisoner, and looked up and down all the persons—some door shut, and I stood on the steps, ana I understood that I had to identify the woman I saw in the waiting-room; I put my glasses on, and I looked at the cluster of women; I saw the woman I wanted, and I said, "There you are" to myself—I walked down, and a voice said to me, "Look steadfastly at them, and touch the one you want"; when I came to the prisoner I stood a minute and looked at her; the voice said again, "That will not do, you must touch her," and I touched her—I did not like doing it, and the voice said again, "Walk this way," and I walked on—I do not know if the inspector stood just behind me—it was a yard, and paved with gravel and asphalt—I did not hear anything but the man's voice—I do not know if it was Inspector Forth; that is the man (<hi rend="italic">Pointing to Inspector Forth</hi>)—I had my glasses on when I identified her—I was about 2ft. from her—I am not short<lb/>sighted; if I want to see I put my glasses on—I do not generally use them in, the waiting-room—I had not them on when the woman and the child were in the room—betwen October 27th and November 24th I had seen thousands of people in the waiting-room—there was no peculiarity about the prisoner; she was dressed in black, which is a very prevailing colour, especially for travelling—a great many children are continually travelling, and coming into the waiting-room—I cannot give you a personal description of anybody who was in the waiting-room other than this woman on October 27th, on the day before or after—I could recognise hundreds of ladies who go out and in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I read the account of the murder in the newspapers on the Sunday—I did not make any communication about the case to any<lb/>one on the Sunday, because I did not think it concerned us in any way—there was nothing about London Bridge in it—I went back to my ordinary work on Monday, October 30th, and in that week I had a conversation about it with Marion Fitzgerald, who is book<lb/>keeper at Bertram and Roberts' refreshment<lb/>room at London Bridge—I was in very great fear that anyone should find out that I knew anything about the case—I did not want to give evidence in the case—I made a statement</p>

               <p>which was taken down by the police—there is no ground for the suggestion that I was helped in any way by the police in identifying the prisoner—I had, and have, no doubt about her identity—I take in the <hi rend="italic">People</hi> every Sunday—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is a copy of the <hi rend="italic">People</hi> of November 5th, in which I saw the likeness of the prisoner and the little boy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer at New Streatham. Road, Croydon—I am married to the prisoner's sister—she visited us. from time to time at Croydon, before October 30th—I think the last time she came was at the beginning of August—I did hot expect any visit from her on October 30th, but about 11 p.m. I answered the door and found her there—she said, "Can I speak to you?"—I said, "Yes; what is it?"—she said, "I am being hunted for murder, but I have not done it"—I said, "The child found at Dalston was not yours, was it?"—I think she said, "Yes, I am sure that it is," or something like that—I asked her what she knew, and she said that she had seen at Dalston that evening a placard of an evening paper stating that the body had been identified, that she had bought a paper, and from the description she was sure that it was her child—she was very much agitated, and I tried to calm her before I said much more to her—I was fairly successful in calming her, and then I asked her to account for her movements on the Friday—she said she had handed the child over to two women at London Bridge railway station (South Coast), and had after-wards gone by the 4 o'clock train to Brighton; that she arrived a little before 6 o'clock, I think it was; that she went to Mutton's restaurant and had something to eat, and afterwards went to Mr. Findlay's hotel and engaged a room there; that Mr. Lucas was at Brighton on the Saturday; that was the first I heard of the visit to Brighton—by that time it was nearly 12 o'clock—I then left home and went to my brother-in-law, Mr. Cadisch, at Bethune Road, leaving the prisoner with my wife, her sister—I got to Bethune Road about 2.30 a.m., where I saw Mr. and Mrs. Cadisch, and had a conversation with them—I stayed the night there, and next morning left with Mr. Cadisch to go back to Croydon—we went to London Bridge Station on foot, when I noticed that we were being followed, and on our arrival at London Bridge, finding that it was the police who were follow<lb/>ing us, I spoke to them and made a statement, in consequence of which they accompanied us to Croydon, where we arrived about 10 a.m., when the prisoner was arrested.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was in a very hysterical state when she came to me—I told her that if she would tell me all about it, whatever it was, I would do my best for her, and I think she said, "How could you think I could kill my own child?"—then she told me about Lucas going to Brighton, and that the story about the child going to France was untrue—I think I had heard of it from my wife—it was then that the prisoner told me of the meeting with the two women at Tottenham—I think she said at Tottenham Green—at any rate, one day when she had the child out—she</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189912110048"/>
               <p>said that they had found out that it was a nurse-child, and that they were forming a home at King's Road, Chelsea, and that they said they would take the child for £12 a year; that she had agreed to hand over the child to them at London Bridge Station on the Friday, I understood in the general waiting-room; that she was to pay the £12 down in advance—I am not sure that she told me that she had gone to another waiting-room first—she said that she had met the two women, that she had given them the £12, and that they had left to go to the refreshment-room, taking the boy with them, for the purpose of getting something to eat—she said that she knew Lucas was coming on the following day, and asked me not to mention the fact to her people—she did not say she would go to the Police-station if she was wanted—I told her she must go, and she said, "Very well"—she made a statement to Sergeant Birch at my house in my presence, which he took down in writing—I know Dalston Junction and No. 3 Platform fairly well, and that there is large traffic there—I went with the prisoner to the station, where she twice asked to see the dead body of the child—her request was not granted then—I had an interview with her in the cells after she was remanded, and she urged me to arrange for her to see the child; which she did, in spite of my telling her it was not in a condition to be seen—I was aware of the existence of the child, and we all considered her to be very fond of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I never saw the child myself—I knew it was at Tottenham—I believe I heard of its intended removal to France on the Friday when the murder was committed—I heard that the pair had gone to France with the child to hand it over to some relations of the father, who would take care of it in the future—I did not hear that the father had been in England in the week which ended on October 14th—the prisoner told me of more than one meeting with the two women prior to October 27th—I believe she said that the place of meeting on each occasion was at Tottenham Green, at about 2 o'clock—she told me that she waited in the waiting-room on the 27th for the purpose of getting a receipt for her money which she had paid the two women—it was from her that I first learned of the visit to Brighton, as well as the fact that Lucas had been down there from the Saturday to the Sunday night.</p>

               <p>head towards the corridor, and its body towards the seat of the closet—the left leg was bent at the knee, the outer surface of the leg resting on the ground, and the foot under the right thigh—the body, with the exception oi the head and legs, was loosely covered with a black shawl; it was simply laid over it, not tied round it—I felt the body on my arrival, and found the trunk was warm; stiffening had not set in, the extremities were cold—I saw some bruises and abrasions on its head—I should say it had been dead about one hour, but I cannot fix the time—in my opinion the longest period ihat it could have been dead was two or three hours, four hours would be the outside time—I think the shortest time within which it could have died would be within an hour—the photo<lb/>graph which has been produced shows the condition when I saw it on October 27th—I did not then come to any conclusion as to the cause of death—I noticed that the tongue protruded slightly between the teeth, which is one of the signs of death by suffocation—there were bloodstains on the head and forehead, and a small clot on the floor to the left of the child's head—I saw a clinker brick there, and I afterwards made an examination of it—there appeared to be bloodstains upon one corner of it, but I cannot say that it was bloodstains—there wete also two hairs corresponding to the hairs on the eyebrows of the child—the brick was an instrument with which the injuries to the child's head might have been inflicted, and I believe it was the implement with which they were caused—I do not attach any importance to the position of the left leg—I beheve the child died in the closet, and was not removed there after death—the child's bowels had been evacuated, which, I should say, took, place at the time of death—the clot of blood on the floor could have been covered with a florin—the blood being there would indicate, I think, that death had taken place in the closet—the lips were blue, which would be another indication of death by suffocation—the upper lip was slightly swollen—the tip of the nose was bruised, which might indicate pressure; over the nose—under my instructions the body was conveyed to the mortuary, where I made the <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> examination, when I found a bruise on the forehead extending from above the centre of the left eyebrow to the outer side of the right eye-brow—it was of recent infliction, but I cannot say positiviely whether before or after death, but it was immediately before or after death—it would require much violence to inflict—it was a bruise only, not a wound—it might have been inflicted by a clinker brick—there was a lacerated, punctured wound 1in. above the inner side of the left eyebrow 1/4 in. long—there was a small wound of the same character immediately beneath it, and at the outer end of the right eyebrow there was a lacerated, pene<lb/>trating wound, and a very small wound beside it—at the inner end of the right eyebrow there was a small lacerated wound—outside the left eyebrow there was a small abrasion and a bruise—there was a curved bruise extending from the right side of the nose across the cheek to the outside of the right under eyelid, about 1/2in. wide at its widest part—a bruise of a similar character extended from the left side of the nose across the cheek to a little beyond the centre of the left lower eyelid, ending in a small lacerated wound—there must have been a good deal of violence used to cause those</p>

               <p>wounds and bruises—in my opinion they were all caused by some hard substance; a clinker brick would have caused them—the <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> was made at 10 p.m. on Saturday night—I and Dr. Jackson, the livisional surgeon of police, made it together—when at the closet I saw a depression in the centre of the forehead about the size of half-a-crown, with some gritty dust on it; it was gritty to the feel of the fingers—at the <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> I found the surface of the body pale, with the exception of the face; the body was clean and well nourished—the child had been circumcised—there was no disease of the organs—the brain was congested, and the large venus channels in the interior of the skull were full of blood, which was indicative of death from want of air—it is a sign I should expect to find in death from suffocation—I believe the child died from suffocation—I speak of suffocation as quite distinct from strangulation the injuries on the child's head were not sufficient by themselves to cause death; it is not possible to say whether the external injuries were caused immediately before or after death; the appearance would be the same—probably the child would be stunned, and probably the stunning and suffocation would be quite close to each other; they might almost be simultaneous.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not have an opportunity of judging how long it had been dead by its temperature; I think it is impossible for Dr. Fennel or for me to say how long the child had been dead—he did not tell me what the temperature was; he did not say that the w.c. was draughty—I wish to differ from Dr. Fennel when he says that the child had been dead an hour when he saw it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Heat may remain in the body for eight or 16 hours after the death, if you wrap it up; under the conditions in which this body waa found it might be from eight to four hours.</p>

I am a qualified medical practitioner and resident surgeon at the North West London Hospital—Carr was brought there at an early hour on, Sunday, October 22nd, bleeding from his chest—there were three wounds, one about two inches below the collar-bone on the right side, over the second rib, a small wound on the shoulder and another between those two—one was a punctured wound, which might be pro<lb/>duced by this knife—it was not more than 3/4 in. in length—he was detained as an in<lb/>patient five weeks the wound was bleeding</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189912110059"/>
               <p>freely, and I had to cut down the wound to find the bleeding vessel—I turned out the clots and stopped the vessel—he is now an out<lb/>patient, I believe—he has fairly recovered—he was in a state of collapse—the septic condition of the wound was the reason he was in the hospital so long—there must have been violence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said at the Police-court that the importance of the wound was owing to the amount of blood lost, and no important vessel was injured.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner, in his defence, on oath said that he only left his lodgings to fetch necessaries, but could only get a loaf so late, which he carried in paper under his arm, when he was knocked down; but lie used no knife, and the stain on the knife produced was from his hating cut raw meat to cook at his lodgings.</hi>

I am an engine-driver on the Midland Railway Company—I live at 8, Midland Cottages, Wellingborough—I did not know the prisoner till I saw him on October 21-22—I had come from Northampton, and went to the Highgate Lodging House for the Midland Railway men, with three other Midland men, a driver and two firemen—the night was foggy—Jelly, one of them, is here—about 200 yards from the lodging-house I heard a struggle in the road about 15 yards off—I stood at the edge of the pavement—the prisoner came up—he was dressed in ordinary clothes—he was sober—he had a paper parcel—he spoke to one of the other men; I cannot say what he said—we all went on to the lodging-house together.</p>

I am a "past fireman" on the Midland Railway; I am a driver, too—I was going to the lodging-house on this foggy night—I saw Carr strike the prisoner in the road twice—the prisoner struck him back—I say the prisoner did not strike him back—Carr shoved him. down in the road—after that we walked away, Stimpson with, us—he had a short jacket on, not a Midland coat—he had a parcel under his arm—he did not seem drunk to me—we were in the mess-room when the policeman came.</p>

Fowler," is also his—I should say that he has made out the ticket, as well as signed it; he does that in the majority of cases; the tickets are in three parts; he hands one to the, customer, one to me, and the third is in the book—I took this under the impression that it had been signed by Fowler, and the other ticket I took in the same way, and gave the prisoner credit for 14s.—I take it to be the prisoner's writing; the same as the writer of the ticket—it is not part of the traveller's duty to sign the customer's name—the prisoner did not pay in his cash or credit notes on November 14th—he never came back.</p>
