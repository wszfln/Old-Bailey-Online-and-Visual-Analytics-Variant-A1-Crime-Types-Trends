Jones denyed the Fact, saying they came back to buy more Silk, and the piece mention'd was found in the Prosecutor's Shop, and call'd several to her Reputation. Simpson pleaded, that Jones came to her House for a Petticoat she was quilting for her; that she ask'd Jones to go along with her to buy a Furbelow Scarf; that they went into several Shops but could meet with none to fit her, being a short Woman; whereupon they went into the Prosecutor's to buy Silk to make one; that she bought Silk for one and paid for it, and going Home, bethought her self that her Hood, which was old and rusty, would not look well with a new Scarf, they went back to buy more Silk for a Hood, and were charged by the Prosecutor with stealing the Silk aforesaid, which she declared she knew nothing of, <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171901150002"/> and called several to her Reputation, who gave her a very good Character.

The Drawer deposed that the Prosecutor rung and sent him for a Constable, that he saw the Prisoner raised up in the Chair feeling about her Petticoats; that he found 4 Guineas under the Chairs she sat in, and the Bag just by her; that a little after he found two more, and one dropt from her Petticoat; that she acknowledged nothing then, but swore and tore and made a great noise for a long while. The Constable of the Night deposed, that the Prisoner made so great a Disturbance, that he sent for another Constable to his Assistance, who searching her before him, took 11 Guineas and half, and some Silver out of her Pocket, and gave it to him, who perceiving a Six Pence mark'd ask'd the Prosecutor if he had any remarkable pieces among his Money; who reply'd Yes, a Sixpence mark'd with three Letters, viz. 1 E S, which answer'd exactly to one of the Six Pences taken out of the Prosecutor's Pocket; that the Drawer, when he took up the Bag, also gave it to the Constable, which was remarkable for its being dearn'd with White Thread on one side, which the Prosecutor also described. The other Constable confirmed the same. The Money and Bag were produc'd in Court, and the Bag and remarkable Sixpence swore to by the Prosecutor. Also the Person who that day pay'd the Prosecutor that remarkable Sixpence among other Money, appear'd and justified the same. The Constables likewise deposed that when they took her the denied that she had any of the Prosecutor's Money, or knew any thing of it, which she did also before the Justice, and said that she had about 5 l. in Gold and Silver about her of her own. The Prisoner in her defence said, that the Prosecutor and she had been acquainted together for some time, and that she had received several Sums of Money from him, he using to call upon her when he came to Town; that while they were at the Tavern together he gave her half a Guinea, but she complaining that she had then urgent Occasions for a greater Sum, he said she should have it all if she would do him some Services, and gave it to her; that they were very Friendly at the Tavern without any Disturbance a great while, that he paid two Reckonings there, and when she refused him some Requests, would have had his Money again, so sent for a Constable, and said that she had robb'd him. The Prisoner call'd the following Evidence to prove what she had said in her Defence. A Woman who deposed that the Prosecutor met her in Cornhill, and ask'd her to drink a Glass of Wine with him, but she shov'd him away, and bid him go about his Business; that the Prisoner, then going by, he went to her, and she saw them go together down Grace-Church-Street towards the Bridge. The Drawer of the Hoop-Tavern being also call'd again, deposed, that they were there two Hours and upwards, and had paid two Reckonings before any Disturbance happen'd, and that afterwards the Prosecutor complained she had had pickt his Pocket in the House; One of the Constables deposed also that he said he lost his Money there; and that neither of them were fuddled. The Prosecutor denied that he was acquainted with her, or that he ever saw her before to his Knowledge, and that he was in a great Surprise when he said he lost his Money in the House.

Do you know us both? Yes. Are you sure you do? Yes. He said Betty, did you stab your self? She answered, No, no; he ask'd her; who did then? She answer'd my Mistress, he ask'd her over again who did it, and she reply'd again, Her Mistress; he ask'd her if she was sure of it, she said Yes. Upon which the Prisoner's Husband said, for God's sake ask her no more Questions, for if you do I shall be undone. That he advised her Husband to send for Mr. Hawkins the Surgeon, who came and probed the Wound, and said she was a dead Woman; that there was no Weapon found; that the Blood in the Kitchen and Parlour was mopt up and Sand strewed upon it; that he put away the Sand with his Feet, and discerned the Blood under it; that she had no Headclothes on, and her Hair lookt as if she had been dragged out of the Kitchen into the Parlour by it: That the Deceased had received a Cut on her Arm about 6 Weeks before, which she came up and shewed him, saying her Mistress did it, and that she believed she should be Murdered one time or other. That he spoke to the Prisoner not to be so passionate to her Maid, who replyed, D-n her, a B-, I'll be her Butcher one times or other; he replyed, have you a mind to be hang'd for her then, and she answered, that for believed no Body would think it worth their while to hang her for killing of her.</p>

That he observed the Kitchen and Parlour mopp'd up and strewed over with Sand; and that a Lock of Hair stood out on each side the Prisoner's Head, as if she had been dragg'd by them; that he bound up her Arm when it was cut as aforesaid; and that he enquir'd for the Weapon with which this Bloody Fact was comitted, and Mr. Griffin answer'd that he did not know where it was, but he would search for it; and that he has often heard the Prisoner abuse the Deceased.</p>

That the Prisoner's Wife desired him to let the Deceased alone, saying he would hurt himself more than his Apprentice, whom she would not have workt any more that Night; but he told her that there were some Shoes that must be done, or else his Master would beat him again. That he workt about a Week after, and then went home to his Mother; that he was Blooded the same Night he went to his Mother's, and again the next Day, when he said that his Master had beat him, thrown him down Stairs. pusht him in the side, and said, that if he died his Master was the Occasion of his Death, and desired his Mother to Prosecute him; and that he told his Mother his Master had beat him with a Last. Mr. Knockells the Surgeon deposed, that he was sent for on the 24th of November, and found him on the Bed in a Fever, and a Tumour in his Side; when open'd it appeared that there was an Imposthumation in the Liver, and a Bruise on the Region of it, and a Quart of Corruption, and that himself, and other Surgeons he consulted, were of Opinion that the Bruise was the Cause of his Death. Mr. Wilkins deposed that he was sent to see the Deceased on the 3rd of December, and found him in a Fever, and that he complain'd of a pain in his side; that he sent for the Surgeon who drest him, who took off the Plaister, but he saw no Discolouration of Tumour.

Mr. Knockells standing up again, deposed that there was a Depression, and that so much Matter must occasion a Tumour. The Prisoner in his Defence said, that the Deceased had been at the Alehouse, and he gave him gentle Correction with his Hand only, and did not kick him.
