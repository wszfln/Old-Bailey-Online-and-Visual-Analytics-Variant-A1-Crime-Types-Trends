                  </hi>. I am a coal merchant at Swansea for myself, and also act as agent for other firms—on 11th April I received by post this letter dated 10th April, signed John Harvey, 1, Marion Villas, Lansdowne Road, Dalston, asking the price of coals for his nephew at Dieppe—I sent an answer giving the prices, and on 14th April received this letter dated the 13th, signed in the same way—I wrote to him on the 16th, stating the terms for cash—other letters passed between us, I asking for cash and he proposing bills—on 20th April I received this letter dated the 19th. (<hi rend="italic">This enclosed the names of Messrs. Poore &amp; Co. and Messrs. W. Thompson &amp; Co., of</hi> 61, <hi rend="italic">Watling Street, as references.</hi>) I wrote to Thompson &amp; Co., and got this reply.

(<hi rend="italic">This stated, "Whatever arrangement you make will be binding on my part</hi>"—<hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN HARVEY</hi>.) That "John Harvey" is in the same writing as a previous letter—I declined to give up the bills of lading without the money—he said that I had better take them back—I said that if he was prepared to give me good bills I would take them in payment—ten or fifteen minutes passed, and he said that he had some bills of exchange at home, and though he had no authority from Harvey to part with them, he would do so, as the vessel was probably at her destination—he also produced a cheque, and said "I wish I could endorse it to you"—he left me, and in the course of an hour came again, and produced these two bills of exchange, and afterwards one other was drawn—I returned the one drawn on Standing—it was arranged that those four bills should be held by me as collateral security—I saw Johnson sign this bill in the name of John Harvey, and it struck me that the writing was the same as the letters I received—I said "I have got a letter con<lb/>firming our arrangement," and he wrote this letter in my presence—I said "I am astonished to see your writing so much like John Harvey's"—he said "My brother-in-law is a self-raised man, he is unable to write, and I do the whole of his correspondence; he is a very respectable man, and very well off"—he accepted the bill, payable at the Bank of England; he said, "All Harvey's bills are payable at the Bank of England; everything is paid there"—I asked him the name of his nephew at Rouen; he said "John Harvey," and then I made a pencil memorandum—I told him I did not know either of the names on those bills, and asked for a reference—he said "I don't know that they would care about having their names hawked about, they are very respectable people; but if they do not pay, John Harvey is quite capable of paying," and I did not write to them—he said that Henry Pool was an iron and steel factor, and that these bills were given for iron and steel, and were regular trade bills; that Freeman was a Government con<lb/>tractor, and a very respectable man, and John Harvey had dealings with him, and all his bills were met—after that conversation I kept the bills, and endorsed the bill of lading over to him—the ship had left two or three days previously—here is the bill of lading which we endorsed—I paid the bills to our banker, and in consequence of what he said I came up and put myself in communication with the police, and wrote to say that I should be at Kennan's Hotel on the following Monday—I received this letter from a person signing the name of Buckley—I went with Sergeant Peck to Kennan's Hotel, and met a person who called himself William Buckley, who said he had full authority from Johnson and Harvey to enter into business with me; that one of them was at Hull and the other at Sunderland—he said that he was a coal factor, doing business at King's Cross and Chalk Farm—we had some conversation about coal, and I proposed to telegraph to Johnson to come up and see me—he went away with that intention, and I went off to Dieppe the same evening, where I found the vessel with the coals on board, minus 10 tons out of 330—that was 24th May, I think—I saw the</p>

               <p>bill of lading; it was endorsed first by myself to Harvey, and from Harvey to John Hart—the Harts are large brokers and merchants at Dieppe—I sold the coal at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; the invoice came to 247<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the coal was sold by Hart for 202<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. less than the cost price—after some conversation with Hart, I went to Hilton's Hotel, Dieppe, and, after some conversation with the landlord, I found John Garner in bed there, though Hart had told me he had left for Rouen—I had some difficulty in waking him, until I put a candle to his nose—I then told him that he had better not leave for 24 hours at least, my object being that he should leave—I went on board the boat for England a few hours afterwards, thinking he was on board, but he was too sharp for me, and two days afterwards I found him in custody in London—I am satisfied that he is the person who called himself Johnson—William Garner was also taken; he is the man who came to me as Buckley.</p>

She went up stairs, and I after her, and seeing the second landing bedroom door open, I imagined she was there. I saw no one. I heard a clock ticking. I had no bed to go to, and thought I would stay till morning. I got on the chair to see what the time was, and the clock weight came down, because it caught my hair. I never thought of committing a burglary. The girl</p>

On 10th July I had been working for Mr. Kelk, and, in consequence of a letter I had received, I was going home—I called at a beershop kept by a Mr. Woodbridge, at Great Stanmore, and had a pint of ale—I saw the prisoner there—he was asking for beer, and he asked me if I would stand a pint—I gave it him—he then asked if I was going to a station—I said "Yes"—he said "I am going to Barham Wood Station; we will both go together; I have got a horse outside"—we went outside—he asked me to ride—I said at first I would rather walk—he said "You may as well ride," and he gave me a leg up on the horse—when we had got some little way, he hit the horse and made it trot—I said I would rather walk than ride so, but he hit it the more, and went faster and faster—I said I should fall off, and I dropped my bundle and basket and scythe—he then banged back against me, as if to knock me off—I caught my foot on the ground and fell down—I got up again in a minute—he stopped the horse and got off, and asked me to get on again—I said "No, I would rather walk and carry my things"—I put my things together, and as I stooped down to lift them up, he knocked me down with his fists, and I was blinded in a minute with blood—he struck me on the eye, you may see the scar now—he hit me several blows, and he said "How much money have you got?"—I said "Not much"—he said "I will have it"—I said "You won't"—he said "I will," and he tried to dive his hand into my pocket, but I had my belt buckled round me tight, and he could not get it in—he pulled the front of my trousers up, and pulled one button right off—in trying for my</p>

               <p>money he felt my watch, and said "You have got a watch; I will have it"—he hit me again several times, and got hold of my chain, but I kept hold of my watch and purse—he broke the chain—he then kicked me four or five times on the arm, and I believe once in the eye, but I was in such a state I could hardly tell where I was kicked—he then asked me whether I would give him my purse and watch—I said "No," and begged him not to kill me—I halloaed "Murder" twice, as loud as I could, and he then jumped on the horse and went away—I afterwards gave a description of him to the police.</p>

On 10th July, about 6 o'clock in the evening, I was called by the prosecutor—I found him very much injured—he gave me a description of the man that did it—I found the chain in the place where the struggle took place, and also this brass button—there were signs of a very severe struggle, and a great quantity of blood, I should think a quart or three pints—there were no stones about there—it was in a ditch.</p>

On the night of 10th July, in consequence of a description that had been given at the station, I went to Harrow Weal Common, and found the prisoner in a gipsy cart—I told him I should take him into custody for violently assaulting a man in Wood Lane and attempting to rob him that evening—he said "You are mistaken, I am not the man; I have not been near the place"—afterwards, on the way to the station, he said he had been in company with a woman who gave him a pint of beer at the Load of Hay beershop, at Stanmore—he after<lb/>wards said "I was in Wood Lane with the man, and gave him a ride, and we both fell off the horse, but I am not the man that committed the assault"—I found blood marks on the front of his shirt, and on the toe and seam of his right boot, which I produce.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, living at 28, London Terrace, Commercial Road East—on Friday evening, the 21st June last, I was near Spitalfields Church at about 7.30, when I saw the prisoner strike a woman in the face with his first—he struck her four or five times—I went up to him, and, taking him by the collar, said that if he struck her again I should strike him—he said "You would, would you?" and, at the same time, he put his hand into his right trousers pocket and withdrew something—he then made a blow at me with a knife, and as he did so, I turned on one side, and, instead of the knife catching me in the stomach, it caught me in the groin—he then ran away, and I called out "Police! stop him!"—I caught hold of the wound to keep it together and stop the bleeding, and some time afterwards I was placed in a milk-cart and taken to a hospital.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had a stick in my hand at the time, of about 1 1/2, in. in thickness—it was a roller, such as is commonly used in drapers' shops for ribbons—I might have struck the prisoner with my fist at I <hi rend="italic">grabbed</hi> him by the collar—I said when before the Magistrates that the prisoner struck the woman three or four times—I can't say whether my evidence was correctly given in the depositions—I don't understand their writing—after I saw him strike the woman, in the first instance, I followed him, and when he struck her again, I interfered—I believe he would have struck her more, and he might have used the knife if I had not gone to him—when he struck at me I felt myself hurt.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Warner Street, and on the afternoon of Saturday, 13th July, was in the Caledonian Road—when about 100 yards from the railway station I saw a waggon and three horses coming along from king's Cross towards Holloway—it was a waggon such as is used by market gardeners to bring their produce to market—it was laden with manure, and the prisoner was sitting on the top, apparently asleep—stand<lb/>ing by the pavement was a pony and van, and the deceased was near to it in the act of posting a bill on a hoarding—I called out twice to the prisoner, but he took no notice, and almost instantly the waggon came in contact with the van, and upset it on the pavement—the deceased ran to the pony's head as if to save it, when he was knocked down, and fell close to the near wheel of the waggon—the wheel went over his left arm—he was soon afterwards taken to the hospital—the prisoner seemed to be re<lb/>clining on the manure, and made no effort to stop his horses—I don't believe he knew at the time that he had ran over a man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was examined at the Police Court, and also before the Coroner—I was not asked how far the waggon proceeded before it was stopped—it went at least twenty yards—there was a distance of about eight yards when I first saw the waggon coming towards the van—it is a wide road—it happened about 2.30 in the afternoon—I was crossing over. to the middle of the road at the time—there was no other vehicle near—I had been reading an excursion bill just before, and did not notice the waggon until it had got within about a dozen yards of the van—I don't know a Mr. Soaper, and no such a person has ever examined me—I have no interest in the matter, and wish I had not seen it—I can't say whether Featherstone's widow has commenced an action against the owner of the waggon—the deceased's van and pony were standing close to the kerb—I can't tell bow the deceased got under the van—he was about a yard and a half from the pony's head when the van was struck, and had the side of his face towards me—there is a slight incline in the road near the station.</p>

I was called into the house about 9.80, and on going upstairs to the second floor I found lying on a bed the body of a child, with its throat cut—it was quite dead—the prisoner was standing at the foot of the bed, and said "I have done it; I have killed my child; I will go with you; I will not run away"—she then pointed to the knife, and said "That is what I done it with; is my child dead?—said "Yes," and</p>

               <p>she observed "Thank God! she is better off; T have done it, and shall have to suffer for it"—I then sent for a surgeon, and took the prisoner down stairs, when she told me that her husband died about three years ago, that for sixteen months she had lived with a cabman named Alfred Chatterton as his wife; that he had ill-treated her occasionally; that they had quarrelled that evening, and he had slapped her in the face and gone out; that she said to him "I suppose you will not expect to find me here when you return;" when he answered "Go, and it will be a very good job too; take your child with you;" that preyed on her mind, and, knowing that she had no shelter for herself and child, caused her to do it—when she saw the knife she said "That is what I did it with; I sharpened it on the poker"—she was taken to the police-station, when I observed blood upon her hands, and there she repeated what she had previously said at the house—the man Chatterton was called as a witness before the Coroner.</p>

I am a married man, but my wife has deserted me—I have had a great deal of trouble in my time—my wife left me with two children to brine up—I met with the prisoner, who is a widow, and she has. lived with me lately—she has always been a steady, good woman, and attended to me when I was laid up with the rheumatic fever; she nursed me all through my illness as my wife—one of my children I put out to nurse at Kensington, but it died of scarlet fever, and, as I was afraid the other one would fall ill too, I had it home again; she is about eight years old, and the prisoner took every care of her, as if she was her own child—she had one child of her own, a little girl aged three years, and she was doatingly fond of them both; and a day scarcely passed but she bought them toys or something—I have had enough trouble to send a man mad; I gave way to it, arid it has all been through drink—lately I was fined by the Magistrate for furious driving, and I offered to help another man the next day who was fined 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the same offence—I and my mistress were three days on the loose; we were drinking from the Wednesday until the Saturday night—we had no money then, and she took her boots off for a friend, and the children's boots, too, and pledged them, in order that they might have some victuals on the Sunday; but all the day she and the children had only a bit of bread and butter, and I had to do as well as I could elsewhere—I had myself pledged my whip and cape for food and rent—on the day of the occurrence I came home and found she was out—I left word with the child to tell her mother that she ought to have stayed at home—I had heard that she was out with a cabman's wife whose company was objectionable, and I was very angry about it—I went out to look after her, and proceeded to the cab-rank—about 6.15 I came back and made the children some tea, and stopped at home till 7.15, when I left word that I was very angry indeed at her being out drinking with the woman—when I returned again I found her at home, and we had a fearful <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, and I knocked her about a good deal then—I had ill-used her previously, and about four months before, I threatened to sell the furniture</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gentleman's servant, living in Clarges Street—on Tuesday morning, 30th July, I was in the Brompton Road at ten minutes to one o'clock—Hazle, who was with two men, left them and accosted me, and wished me to treat her—I refused, and she asked me to go home with her, which I refused also—we walked a few yards, and she struck me on my face with her umbrella, and began halloaing—I ran backwards, and several young men came round me and knocked me down—I got up and tried to get away—Winter ran across the road after me, and I was knocked down a second time and stunned—I can swear that Winter was one of those who ran after me, but I cannot swear that he struck me—I was picked up by a policeman, and then missed my watch and chain, and locket—the policeman took me to the hospital—I was taken to the station next morning, and saw</p>

               <p>the prisoners and several young women, but no men except Winter—I picked Hazle out as the woman who struck me first—I identified Winter as being there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a photographer, of Lloyd's Place, Brompton—on the night of 30th July I was in the Brompton Road between 1.5 and 1.10 o'clock, and just as I was going to turn down Lloyd's Place I saw Tebbey standing by the female prisoner—two other girls were by—I saw Hazle strike Tebbey with a parasol or umbrella—she knocked him down—he got up and she knocked him down in the road again—I went to her and asked her what she was knocking the man about for, and she struck me and called out "Harry!" I think, and twelve or fourteen men, who were nearly 100 yards further up the road, came down to the scene, and I told Tebbey to run if he could—I ran and called "Police!" and Tebbey ran—as he ran I saw him knocked against the steps and knocked on the pave<lb/>ment by a man, but I was nearly twenty yards away, and could not see who did it—I saw a policeman come up, he removed Tebbey in a cab—I pointed out to the police a girl named Green, who was standing by, but not who had anything to do with it—she is not here—I am positive Hazle is the woman who used the parasol—I am not positive about Winter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Hazle. Q.</hi> Can you swear I knocked the man down? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it was not the female who stood with you—I cannot describe your dress, I only go by your face—you do not look able to knock a man down, but I have seen you before do something very nearly the same—I have no animosity against you, I never knew you to speak to you—I am quite sure it was you—I did not notice that Tebbey had a stick in his hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you hear any altercation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I heard no words used, but all of a sudden she struck him with a parasol and knocked him down in the road—the first time she fought him off the kerb with her hands up, and the second time she fought him off the kerb into the middle of the road.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have no recollection of seeing Clara Phillips there—I have seen her outside here—I only knew her by sight—if she had come into sight I should have recognised her—Tebbey did not fight Hazle, but he went into the road; it did not look like fun; he came back in a sort of expostulating way, as much as to say "What are you doing that for?" there was no quarrel before, so far as I could see—I have often seen the men together who came up: they live near about, I believe—I have seen them with Hazle before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the registers of the principal Registry of Her Majesty's Court of Divorce—I produce the original petition for dissolution of marriage of Harry Lewis Ayling, dated 15th December, 1869—it states that he was married on the 23rd January 1865, to Emma Merritt, that there were two children by the marriage, and alleges that his wife had committed adultery with one John Collier, between 1st May and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187208190040"/>
               <p>30th January, and prays for a dissolution of marriage on that ground—the petition was presented by himself in person—I also produce an affidavit by the same person, Henry Lewis Ayling, verifying the petition—a copy of the citation is served on the respondent and co-respondent by showing them the citation and leaving them a copy—the two citations would be given out with the seal of the Court attached, and copies would then be made—this is a blank form; it is first signed by the registrar, and then sealed—the parties themselves can make copies, and serve them on the respondent and co-respondent—on 22nd December Mrs. Ayling appeared in person—this document purports to bear my signature as registrar—it is a forgery—it is dated 17th January, 1870—there is a seal attached to that; it appears to be a genuine seal of the Court—as far as I can judge it is similar to the seal that would be attached to the citation when issued—the document bears two sets of initials—I can swear to my own signature, but I am not prepared to say whether the other is genuine or not—the first two initials of my signature are very good, the remainder is not so good—a decree in the Divorce Court is not usually sealed; it can be sealed, but it is not usual—by the minutes nothing appears to have been done in the Divorce Court after the appearance of the respondent—this decree is not on a form of the Court—the Court makes the rule nisi and then absolute, which dissolves the marriage in the first instance—I believe this to be a Scotch form; it is not our form.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The first step is to take out a citation of petition—I really can hardly tell you how the party gets that form of citation—the first I see of it is when it comes up in the usual form with the initials of the senior clerk, and then I or one of the registrars issue the usual form, which is afterwards sealed—I know of one or two cases in which unquali<lb/>fied persons have tried to act as attornies in the Divorce Court, but I don't know whether they have succeeded.</p>

Blake &amp; Sons, solicitors, in Blackfriars Road—he first commenced to pay attention to my daughter about six years ago—his wife called upon me about six months after he made my daughter's acquaintance; it was about 1867—I saw the woman who represented herself as the prisoner's wife—I saw the prisoner the same evening and told him I had seen his wife, and begged him to have nothing more to say to my daughter—he said "Very well, I don't intend to," or something of that sort, and he bid me good night—he said "If I am married, where was I married?"—I said "At Greenwich;" and he said "It is too true"—I lost sight of him for some time; some months—I after<lb/>wards saw him in Kennington Lane—that was about twelve months before he married my daughter—he told me then he was trying for a divorce, and he should get it in six months—my daughter was living with me at that time—I received this letter from him; I think about November last year, and I went to see him—this is the letter: "252, Kennington Lane. Will you look down this evening; the Court has granted me a divorce, and I am now, thank God, free. Yours truly, H. L. Ayling"—I said "You have got the divorce, I see"—he said "Yes"—I said "I suppose you will soon be married then?"—he said "I have got it here," and he showed me a piece of parchment folded up—I saw him afterwards, and said I was surprised he had got it so soon—he said he was in the law and he knew how to do it sooner and cheaper—I had said I thought it was very expensive—the pri<lb/>soner was lodging at 252, Kennington Road—my daughter was married from his lodgings—it was at his lodging I saw the parchment—on the morning of the wedding it was lying on the table; he said "I must not forget to take it with me to church, for fear some of the opposite party may be there"—I went with my daughter to the church, and they were married on 14th February, 1870—after the marriage the prisoner came to my house and brought the document with him—I asked him to bring it in order that the rest of the family might see it—we had no doubt, but it was for our satisfaction—my husband was present when it was read—it was a document exactly like this—I did not understand it, but I heard what the substance was—it was a document of divorce from the first wife that he might marry my daughter—he took it away with him after he read it—some time after<lb/>wards my daughter brought the document to me, and I had it in my possession about a fortnight, and after that she fetched it away—I never opened it—I afterwards saw it in the possession of my husband, and he gave it to Mr. Coleman, the solicitor, in my presence—some time in the present year proceedings were taken in the Lambeth Police Court for bigamy, and then I found out that the document was not genuine.</p>

I am a solicitor, practising in Greenwich and in London—in the early part of this year I was consulted by the prisoner's first wife, and afterwards by the second—the prisoner was given in to custody in May for unlawfully marrying Mary Jane Doery, his wife, Emma Ayling, at the time being alive—I produce two marriage certificates; the first is dated January 26th, 1865; it is the certificate of a marriage at Green<lb/>with Parish Church with Emma Merritt, and the other is on 14th February, with Mary Jane Doery—the document which has been produced was placed in my hands by Mr. Doery—I made some inquiries, and found it was a sham—I was present when the prisoner was charged with bigamy the Sessions before last—he pleaded guilty, and sentence was deferred until after the hearing of this case.</p>

Mr. Shannon and two or three others pulled him away, and I went down stairs.

I am a porter, and live at 14, Short's Gardens—on 27th June, about 11 o'clock on a Wednesday night, Elliott and I were standing at the prisoner's door, and I heard him ask Elliott what made him rob his mother—Elliott said he had not; it was a lie—the prisoner said that he did not believe him—Elliott then called him a liar, and prisoner pushed him but did not strike him—Elliott then went away, and the prisoner proceeded indoors—I had stood there for about a quarter of an hour when I heard a row in the passage—I saw the prisoner and the deceased fighting there—they were striking each other, and I saw the deceased kick the prisoner in the ribs—he had on thick boots—the prisoner's wife came out to part them and she was knocked down—all three fell, and the two shutters which were in the passage came down on the top of them—the prisoner was underneath each of them—the shutters fell on the deceased, who was on the top—I cannot say what conversation took place between the prisoner and the deceased before I heard the <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—I was not aware that any con<lb/>versation took place at all—I might have heard a word or so said about the chaff—when the fight was over in the passage the deceased went down stairs and the prisoner into his own room—I remained standing at the door for about a quarter of an hour—I did not hear anything take place in the kitchen—I could not see all over it—I did not hear any words in the kitchen, but there was a slight <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, as if something had fallen, and in con<lb/>sequence I went below—I found the deceased lying on the floor close beside the fender, bleeding from the head—I only saw one wound—I cut off some of his hair and washed the wound.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any other person there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I did not see the prisoner from the time he went into his own room until I found the deceased in the kitchen—I did not notice that the deceased was bleeding from the face before he went to the kitchen—the passage was dark and I could not see anything—I advised the deceased to go to the hospital, and he said he should be all right after he had lain down for a bit on the form—the prisoner was very drunk and so was the deceased—both of them were drunk and fell all over the place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The deceased struck the first blow—he struck the prisoner by the side of the ear, but I did not see the beginning of the row—I first saw the deceased strike the prisoner in the face—the shutters which fell were 5 or 6 feet long, and about 2 feet wide, and there was an iron bolt on each—they fell right across the deceased—I did not see any<lb/>thing like a hammer there, though I was the first who went into the kitchen—I went down directly it was done—the prisoner was very drunk when he went into his own room—I picked the deceased up, and he did not make any complaint to me—the prisoner had not a hammer in his hand when he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187208190049"/>
               <p>went into his own room—I did not see a hammer, or anything like one, when I got to the kitchen—I did not see Elliott looking down the area—he was not there, or else I must have seen him—the deceased's health was not very good—he was never hardly at work, and complained at times of not being very well—I did not know from what he was suffering.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of David Shannon, lodging-house keeper, of 15, Short's Gardens—I was sitting near to my front door when this occurrence took place—I heard a disturbance next door, and when I went to see what was the matter I saw the witness Smith in the act of taking off some shutters from the top of the deceased, and the prisoner was underneath him—I saw the deceased kick Doherty in the mouth with his naked foot—it is not true that he had thick heavy boots on; he had no boots on at all during the struggle in the passage—I helped to separate them, and then the deceased, after I had got him into the parlour, went down stairs; I advised him to do so, and it was with some difficulty that I prevailed upon him—he stopped calling Doherty names—I then went into my own house, next door, from which I could hear the least noise in Doherty's—I heard a sound like the falling of forms about the place; it was as if something heavy had fallen—I then came out again aid stood at the area—I could see a little way into Doherty's kitchen, and I noticed that the gas was burning—I did not see the deceased there, only Doherty—Smith was standing at the area railings at the time—Elliott was not there after the fight.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Charing Cross Hospital—the deceased was brought there on the night of the 28th June—I at<lb/>tended to him—he was perfectly sensible—he was helped in, not brought in on a stretcher—he had a slight contused wound on the right side of his head, and another wound at the back, on the protuberance over the neck, and the bone was fractured—it was a compound fracture—his injuries were attended to, and he went on well for some few days, when alarming symptoms set in, and he died on the 21st July—the wounds must have been caused by some heavy instrument—on making a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination I found that the membrane of the brain under the seat of the fracture was inflamed—it was a small round fracture, about the size of a penny—abscesses had formed on the liver, lungs, and other internal organs—they arose from pyema, incidental to the fracture—blood-poisoning had taken place—the abscesses had not arisen from natural causes, but were owing to the wound upon the head—the body was not in a healthy condition generally, because pyema had set in—it was pyema that killed him—I could not tell what had been the general state of the body before he was admitted, or shortly before his death, because pyema had caused much disease—I have heard all about the shutters falling, and the prisoner being seen with a hammer in</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant and member of the firm of Ladbury, Collinson &amp; Viney, 99, Cheapside—on 5th July, I was appointed trustee to his estate—at the close of the meeting, Mr. Mason said to the defendant "If you have any cash or any property you are bound to hand it over to the trustee here present"—he said he had nothing more than was shown in the balance-sheet—on the following Monday, 8th July, he called on me in Cheapside—he gave me up nothing, and made no state<lb/>ment of any further assets,</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>, <hi rend="italic">after calling attention to the dates and circumstances of the case, submitted that the case failed, because under the</hi> 125 <hi rend="italic">sec. of</hi> 32 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 33 <hi rend="italic">Vic, c.</hi> 71, <hi rend="italic">par.</hi> 4, <hi rend="italic">the liquidation commenced from the date of the appointment of the trustee, which was made on</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">th July, and that therefore the defendant was not liable for anything he had said or done before that date, which was the official commencement of the liquidation. Again it appeared by the Act that the certificate could only be granted by a Judge or Registrar in Bankruptcy, but the certificate in question had been granted by a Deputy Registrar. The maxim, "delegatus non potest delegari," operated here, and therefore the deputy's appointment was void. No proof had been given of the transfer of the proceedings from Grimsby to London, or that the alleged offence had been com<lb/>mitted within the jurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court, He contended therefore that the liquidation not having commenced when the prisoner concealed from his creditors' knowledge the fact of his possession of the notes, he was not responsible for so concealing them.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">considered that the certificate when granted gave the Trustee power as from the time of his nomination by the creditors, and that he having, as</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">admitted, a right to receive all the property, had an equal right to know of it.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">replied that the appointment was surely not retrospective as to the right of instituting a criminal prosecution, and that there was no repetition of the false statements after the liquidation had legally begun.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>, <hi rend="italic">in reply, contended that the appointment of a Trustee dated from the very moment that the creditors selected him, and that the subsequent granting of a certificate was a mere rati<lb/>fication of their choice, and did not necessarily nullify an act committed in the mean time. The Act did not contemplate that in the all-important matter of the decision of the creditors as to whether the debtor should be made a bankrupt or allowed to liquidate, he should be permitted to make any number of false or misleading statements, which he could withdraw was the matter was settled.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The first part of</hi> 125 <hi rend="italic">sec. provided clearly that at a meeting between a debtor and his creditors a Trustee might be appointed, and from that moment the appointment was virtually complete. The Trustee was appointed under certifi<lb/>cate on</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">th July, and the prisoner not having contradicted or altered his state<lb/>ments there was a continuing misrepresentation. There had also been a removal of property into the Jurisdiction of this Court.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">on the same side called attention to the</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">th sub-sec, of the</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th see. of the Debtors' Act, c.</hi> 62, <hi rend="italic">by which it appeared that if any person whose affairs were liquidated by arrangement, made any material omission in his statement relating to those affairs he was guilty of a misdemeanour, unless the Jury were satisfied that he had no intent to defraud.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">was heard in reply.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DEPUTY RECORDER</hi>: "<hi rend="italic">My opinion at present is that I could not stop the case on any of these objections. With regard to the objection that the Deputy Registrar had no authority to sign the document, I have Had the opportunity of taking the opinion of the learned Judges. As to the transfer of the proceedings I under<lb/>stand that objection to be withdrawn, as the papers may be transmitted by book post or in any other way. The third objection is that up to the 5th July the prisoner was never within this jurisdiction, and that the false statements must be made after the appointment of the Trustee. I don't think that will hold, I think the sections show clearly that any false statement or omission he makes of his affairs is within the meaning of the Act. Then at to the Jurisdiction, the offence was clearly committed in London. I am not at all certain that between the</hi> 8<hi rend="italic">th and the</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">th there was not also a repetition of his statement so long as it remained uncontradicted. With regard to the removal of the property, it would be a question for the Jury whether it was with him in London, and whether he did not take it away, intending to deprive his creditors thereof.</hi>

I am a warehouseman, of 14, Store Street, Shepherd's Bush—on the morning of 26th June, from circumstances which were called to my attention, I searched my house—I missed a large quantity of property, a great coat, a diamond ring, and other goods, and almost every room in the house was in a state of great confusion—I had fastened the back window of the dining-room at 8.30 the night before, and I saw it safe at 12.30—every<lb/>thing was safe when I went to bed—on the morning of the 26th I found the dining-room window eighteen inches open, and away from the window in the garden there were footmarks—I have seen a coat which was found under one of the beds; it is not mine—a shirt and a piece of wire were also found in the kitchen, which did not belong to me—I handed them over to the police—a coat has been shown me by the police which I identify as mine; this is it—the back of a locket was also shown to me, which I can identify as having been stolen from me.</p>

I am the son of Mr. William lovejoy of 37, Russell Square—on Sunday, 14th July between 4 and 5 o'clock a.m, I had occasion to get up early, and heard a noise down stairs and voices—I went down and saw Pocock in the hall—I watched him a few minutes, and heard him say "How shall we move these things?" and another voice said "We had better take a cab"—I went up stairs put on some clothes, and went back and saw the prisoners folding up some clothes, and told them the best thing they could do was to, go they made no answer—they had some coats on belonging to the house—I kept my eye outside the door, and seeing a figure pass who I believed to be a policeman, I told them they had better go—I was talking to them five or six minutes—I had ample opportunity of observing their faces—I looked out at the door and saw a policeman there—I talked to them at the door half a minute, and suddenly called "Police!" and "Thieves!"—they ran away, and the policeman pursued them—the door open into Montague place, where it joins the square—the policeman came down Montague place to<lb/>wards the square—I called my father, and in about five minutes Bell, the policeman, came to the house, and I went over it with him—the side board and cupboard in the dining-room and library had been turned but—I found a cupboard and door open down stairs, and the drawing-room the same—a bag was in the hall, containing a cruet forks a toast rack, mustard pot, wine strainer, salt cellars, eighteen forks a flute, some billiard balls, and other articles belonging to my father—the silver cruet frame was crushed—there were footmarks on the portico railing, and the bell had evidently been bent from being stood upon, and there were marks on the top of the portico and on the window-sill—both the lower and upper parts of the window were open—I am not sure whether we had been played at billiards the night before, but the billiard balls were all there when I last played—they were not there when I examined the room—there were marks on the carpet by the window, as if a man's feet had been wiped there—I saw no marks by the door—I picked out Hastings from a number of men at the station, and on the following morning I picked out Pocock—there were about four persons on each site of him—I had no doubt about their identity, then or now.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was coming down the Commercial Road from White<lb/>chapel—I had been to the theatre, but I had to walk right to Fenchurch Street, so I did not hurry myself—a man named Bishop was charged at the Police Court—I thought at first he was one of them, but afterwards I said he was not—I was not wrong in charging him—I said I thought he was one of them; and when I saw him the next morning I could not swear to him; I changed my mind—I was perfectly sober—there were a lot of men standing together, and the prisoner was with them—I did not see Green again until the constable had him—I kept sight of him until he turned the corner, and then the constable caught him—Bishop was not taken till afterwards—I saw at the station that Green was one of the company—I halloaed "Stop thief!"—I left the theatre at 12 o'clock.</p>

I am a builder, of Rushey Green, Lewisham—I know Mr. Stainton's premises well—on Saturday morning, 13th July, I was leaving my premises, and saw on the high road a cart with iron hurdles in it and a well-boring rod—I followed it some distance, and directly I came back I gave information to the police—I have seen a quantity of iron hurdles in the possession of the police, and identified them as the prosecutor's property—I am constructing buildings for him, and know the premises per<lb/>fectly well—he has marked out some private property of his, called Spring-field Park Crescent, with iron hurdles—I examined that part of the property, and missed about the same number of hurdles as were in the possession of the police—there is a summer-house on the property with two iron rails and balusters attached, which were wrenched off from the base, and I saw them in custody of the police and fitted them to the summer-house, and they corresponded exactly—the total value of the hurdles in the possession of the police was from 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were in good condition, and it is impossible that they would be taken for old iron—Styles is a kind of gardener at Lady Well, a mile and a half from the property—I do not know Stradling, but I know his marine store shop in the lower part of Lewisham—you can get a cart into Mr. Stainton's property by opening a gate, which is always supposed to be locked—there are notice, boards to say that the land is private property.</p>

                  </hi>. I am eight years old, and live at 11, William's Terrace, Blue Anchor Road. Bermondsey—the prisoner is my father—he is a hair-dresser—the deceased Sarah Margaret Rogers was my mother—the family consisted of my father and mother myself and a little boy, three years old—I remember a Sunday afternoon when we went to Victoria Park together—I don't know the date, it was five or six weeks ago—we had tea before we went out—we started about 5 o'clock—we rode in an omnibus—we had some ginger-beer there that was all we had—I saw Mr. Doffy, our landlord, in the park, and walked about with him—we were all friendly together—I think it was getting on for 11 o'clock when we came away—we came back by omnibus—when we got back we went into our own to get some only had one room that was the back parlour down stairs—we all slept in that room—we had supper when We got home—I was sent out to get some vinegar; I could not get any, and my mother afterwards went and got some—before we started to go to the park, there was some quarrelling between my father and mother, because my mother's frock was dirty at the bottom—he said she ought to have washed it, she said she could not; that was all that took place—there was no further quarrelling when we came back—after supper I went to bed, before my father and mother—I slept on the floor by the side of their bed—they slept in the bed with the baby—I went to sleep—I was awoke by my mother calling out "Eliza, your father has cut my throat!"—it was then nearly daylight—I saw father lay the razor down on the table; I think it was open—my mother was lying in the bed with the baby—I don't know on which side of the bed she was lying—father was sitting down at the foot of the bed, and ran and sat on the foot I did not notice his throat—mother got out of bed, and ran and sat on the foot of the door-step—she had her chemise on; there was blood on it, and there was blood on my little brother's face and head—I did not notice anything on my father's clothes—he kept his razors in the bottom box by the door; that box could not be reached from the bed; you would have to get out of bed to get to it—before this I had once seen my father split my mother's head open; I can't tell how long ago that was—they have been <hi rend="italic">rowing</hi> and</p>

I live at 11, William's Terrace, Blue Anchor Road, Bermondsey—the prisoner and his wife lodged in my house—they occupied the back parlour on the ground floor—that was the only room—they had lodged with me about three months—the prisoner was a barber and hair-dresser—he used to work for his brother, and go out to work in the day—they had two children living with them—sometimes they would be quar<lb/>relling, at other times they would be pretty happy and comfortable—before this occasion I have been disturbed at night with their quarrelling—I slept in the back room upstairs—I got up on one occasion, and called out to him, and asked what he was making that noise and disturbing, all the house for at that time in the morning, and I would not have it—he did not make any answer—I could not hear what the quarrelling was about—on one occasion when I got up and called out to him he said it was his wife that com<lb/>menced upon him, that she was always <hi rend="italic">jawing</hi> at him—she made no reply to that—that was about 3 o'clock in the morning—I could not tell what the noise was about—it was a quarrel between themselves—I never learnt what it was—the prisoner was a sober man all the time he was lodging with me, and the deceased was a sober woman—on Sunday evening, 16th June, they went out—I went out before 5 o'clock—she had been at home all the morning, and he had come home to dinner—nothing had occurred during the day that I heard—I was in Victoria Park in the evening, and saw the prisoner, his wife, and the two children there—I left them in the park about 9 o'clock—I was with them there some little time—they were both sober, and seemed very friendly—I got home about 12 o'clock—they were then at home—James Stone, the brother-in-law, was at the door when I went in—the prisoner and his wife were in their room—I did not see anything more of them that night—I went to bed in the back room over the kitchen on the first floor—I heard nothing before I went to sleep—about 2.30 I heard a shriek—it was then just about break<lb/>ing day—it was Mrs. Roger's voice—I got up and came half down stairs and called out "Mr. Rogers, what do you mean by disturbing the house at this time in the morning?"—I got no answer—Mrs. Rogers called out "Come and help me, I am bleeding, he has cut my throat"—she was in her room, and the door was shut—the little girl then opened the door, and came running out and said "Father has cut my mother's throat"—I saw the</p>

               <p>prisoner standing near the fire-place undressed—the deceased came to the door in her night-dress, bleeding from the throat, and said "Oh, do help me, he has cut my throat"—I said "All right, I will," and I called Mr. Dight down—the prisoner made no remark—he was two or three yards off—I went upstairs and put on my trousers, and came down again, and then the deceased got hold of me and said "You are going to help me," and I then led her to the street door as I was going out—she sat down there and fainted on the door-step—I saw Mr. Dight take hold of the prisoner, and set him on a chair in the room—he was bleeding from the throat—I went for a constable, who came, and a doctor—I afterwards returned to the room—the prisoner was still sitting on a chair, and Mr. Dight with him—just where he was sitting the floor was smothered with blood—there was a large pool of blood, and there was blood in the bed and a few spots round the bed—Mrs. Doffy had got the boy in her arms; his clothes were all smothered with blood and his face—about an hour after, the police and the doctor came—the prisoner said to his brother "Bill, you know all about this; you have often given her drink and sent her home to beat me"—the brother said "What do you mean?" and he repeated it again—nothing more was said then—afterwards the brother went into the room again and said "What did you do it for?" and the prisoner said "You know all about it; she knifed me once before," pointing to his wrist—I think it was the left wrist—I could not see whether there was any mark there, on account of the blood—the doctor attended to them as they were taken to the hospital; the deceased on a stretcher, and the prisoner in a cab.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The room was dark—I have known the prisoner about three months—I thought him to be a very strange man, in simple ways; if they Were quarrelling or anything, he had childish ways with him, he seemed as if you could hardly get a word out of if you spoke to him; simple in his ways—he was out in the garden one Sunday, standing right in the middle of a bed which I had been digging up, and I said to him "you will get into a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> directly; look where you are standing," and he said "I did not know" in such a simple manner—he was decidedly strange in his manner—he appeared to be fond of his wife, and he would not rest till she said "Good morning" to him when he went out—I never saw anything amiss with him and the children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> By being childish in his ways, I meant he had such a simple way if you spoke to him; he would not bring out his words as you might do, as though he had to look at his words before he spoke them—I could understand what he said pretty well; he spoke rationally, pretty fair—there was nothing else that I noticed, except a few words when they have been quarrelling—I heard him once say that she had torn his coat up at the back—I know they did quarrel, I could hear them when I was in bed—I suppose I have heard them quarrelling four or five times, in the night—she once threw the teapot at him; I heard the teapot go down the stairs—I could not tell the particulars of that quarrel—at that time they were living in the back room over the kitchen—I go out about 8.30 in the morning, and I don't get home till about 7.30—the prisoner worked for his brother—he was able to attend to his work—after they had had a quarrel he would not leave his wife till she had bid him "Good-bye."</p>

                  </hi>. I am Court Keeper at the Southwark Police Court—I attended with the Police Magistrate of that Court on Monday morning, 24th June, between 12 and 1 o'clock, at Guy's Hospital, and was present with him at the deceased's bedside—he asked her certain questions, which I took down in writing; this is what I wrote—it is correct (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "The examination of Sarah Margaret Rogers, taken on 23rd June, at Guy's Hos<lb/>pital. This deponent, on her oath, saith as follows: 'I conscientiously believe that I am dying. I recollect last Monday morning. I was in bed about day-break, with my baby on my arm, on my left side, the side I am on now. I had been asleep, I was not thoroughly awake; I heard my hus<lb/>band saying something, I don't know what, I was too tired; I partly raised myself in bed to put the baby off my arm, when his arm came round my neck, my husband's; a violent blow, I knew it was a razor because it was so sharp; I called to my little girl "Eliza, your father has cut my throat!" and she called Mr. Doffy, the landlord, and Mr. Dight, the lodger. I struggled a little with him to protect my baby, I think; and when they, the landlord and the lodger, were coming into the room he, my husband, said "Don't go out, nobody will know anything about it." Then I got into the passage, and sat on the street door-step; I think the cold stones to my feet brought me to; and then a policeman came in; he went in and said "De<lb/>tain that man." I don't know who fetched Mr. Moore of the Blue Anchor round; he came to me; he sent for somebody from this hospital, and they took me on a stretcher to the hospital. Eliza and the little boy Billy were in the room when he struck me. It poured like a pail on to my child. Between 12 and 1 o'clock, when I got into bed, he tried to choke me with his hand, thumb and finger; we had no words particular, only about my frock being dirty at the bottom; we had some words when we first went into the Victoria Park, about half-past 5 o'clock; he said I was lazy, and might have done it up; it was not dirty, I had only worn it once. We met our landlord and landlady, Mr. and Mrs. Doffy, in the park; we had two bottles of ginger beer going and coming back; he was quite sober; he had signed the pledge on 17th April, and we were just home in time to get some vinegar at the public-house. We went home and had supper com<lb/>fortably together; he ate a little, and so did I; he said if he did not eat anything I should think him proud—then we both laid on the bed and went to sleep. We had no quarrel that day; he was very strange in his manner. He used to say I thought of somebody else better than I did of him. I had no thought of wrong to him; I thought there was something the matter with his mind; I thought so for some months. My brother William, some months ago, advised me to go to a Magistrate and have him put away. He had let his shop and could not get another, and I think that preyed on his mind; he used to say I got him off that; he was working for his brother and doing well I told my husband I was happier when he was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187208190080"/>
               <p>out all day. We were always quarrelling; I stabbed him once with a knife about four months ago, on his wrist, because he called me a bad name, before we left Bermondsey New Road; it was a little table knife. I said I would do anything if I could only have seven years to get, away from him, he led me such a dreadful life.' The prisoner was not present when this statement was taken—his brother was there, and he suggested one or two questions to the Magistrate."</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer, attached to the Metropolitan Fire Brigade—on 28th July, about 3.20 in the morning, I went with the engine to the house in question—on arriving there the back door had been opened—I broke open the front door, and went in that way—I found a great body of fire in the back part of the shop, on the left of the front door; it was a quantity of toys and things burning in a pile, as though they had fallen down on the floor—I assisted in extinguishing it—that fire did not appear to com<lb/>municate with any other fire—as soon as the fire was sufficiently extinguished I searched the house to see if there was any one in it—I found there was not, and then made my way down stairs—I found fires burning there in the floor underneath the shop—there was a fire burning under the dresser in the back kitchen; it was a quantity of material, something like rolls of paper—there had been a good body of fire there; it extended to the dresser, which was partly consumed; it had not touched the flooring—that, was quite unconnected with any other fire—I went from the back kitchen into the front—I found the flooring had been broken away, and I found a small fire in the centre along by the dresser, between the passage and the fire<lb/>place; that had been very slight; it appeared to be from the old flooring—I found about half of a newspaper, which appeared to have been forced under the flooring after it was broken away; that was about a foot from where the fire was—that was quite a distinct fire—there was no fire there then—there had also been a fire on two chairs, standing close together, in the front kitchen; that was some linen stuff, or some material which, I believe, was</p>

               <p>used for dressing the dolls, cuttings from the dresses—there was no great quantity—that was on fire at that time in each of the chairs—that was another distinct fire—I afterwards discovered a hole in the ceiling of the kitchen—in making my way to the stairs I found another fire under the coal-cellar door—there was a small hole in the flooring, and the fire was burning in the hole, burning the flooring and the bottom of the door as well—I could not see that there was any material there, anything beyond the wood that was burning then; it was not connected with any of the other fires—I should think it was 6 ft. or 8 ft. from the kitchens—I made a further search in the shop, and found there had been another fire in the right-hand corner—it was a quantity of paper, that appeared to be used for wrapping up the goods in; but that had evidently burnt itself out—I saw the paper ashes—that was not connected with any other fire—it was quite at the opposite side of the shop from the other fire—I afterwards discovered a fire in a drawer between those two used for keeping goods in—that fire had been very slight—something may possibly have dropped in there—I found nothing else on the ground floor—I think I have now described six separate fires—there was nothing above but the heat up the staircase—after the fire was extinguished I asked the prisoner if he could give me any idea as to the cause of the fire—he said he could not—I asked if he could ac<lb/>count for the fire in the back part of the shop—he could not do that—I pointed out the other fires, and said it looked very suspicious, there being so many separate fires—he said he could not account for it, no further than he had had the sweep, and he mentioned something about the front kitchen chimney, whether it might have been caused from that—he said a fire had occurred there in the afternoon, and he had called a neighbour in to help him put it out—he pointed out the place to me; it was close to where the fire had been in the front kitchen, near the dresser, where the hole was—there were marks of fire about the hole, and also on a part of a packing-case that was standing up by the side, leaning against the dresser—I noticed some paper put up before the front kitchen window as a blind—I asked him why it was there—he said that the servant-girl had put it up to keep the boys from looking in at her—the gas-pipe in the back kitchen was melted—the gas could not have been on, or I should have smelt it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of police at Kennington Lane—I went to the house about 3.45 on the Sunday morning—I made a careful examina<lb/>tion of the premises—in the back kitchen there had been a fire underneath the dresser; the whole of the inside of the dresser was completely burnt; the drawers were entirely consumed; the legs were partly burnt through, also the table of the dresser; a large roll of carpet that lay on the dresser</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187208190085"/>
               <p>was burnt through three or four folds; there was a large quantity of what appeared to be rags and burnt paper under the dresser; on the opposite side of the kitchen there was a packing-case full of paper and wood, such as would be used in the business, portions of packing-cases broken into small pieces; there was no fire about that—in the front kitchen near the dresser opposite the windows the flooring was broken up about 6 feet in length and two feet in width—a portion of that flooring had been on fire and a portion of a packing-case that was placed edgeways was also burnt; it was leaning one edge against the dresser and one over the hole where the fire had been in the flooring; the side against the flooring was burnt—I afterwards made a further examination of the flooring, and found that it smelt very strongly of some mineral oil, which I thought to be paraffin; I produce some of the pieces, it smells now—there were two chairs on the opposite side of the room behind the door, in each of which there was an appearance of fire; one of the chairs was charred, the other did not appear to have been touched ex<lb/>cept that the paper and rags that it contained were partly consumed—near the chairs were three boxes standing containing paper and wood, the sort of boxes that dolls would be brought in and used in the business; they con<lb/>tained a large quantity of paper and wood—one of them contained a portion of another box that had been used for a collection of shells; the shells were on it; that was broken up—there was also a hassock filled with shavings; these were standing near the chairs, nearly touching them—there were also three pieces of packing-cases extending from the chairs into the passage, and to a door at the foot of the stairs; they were very long, about 8 or 9 feet in length, all three lying together; there had been a fire there, but it was then out; one of the boards was partly burnt—inside a closet under the stairs there was a large quantity of paper, and a portion of that door was burnt; that was all on the basement—at the shop door, the passage leading from the stairs there had been a fire; it appeared to have extended both outside and inside; it was rather a considerable fire, as if the door had been burnt through; the door was entirely gone; the materials there were dolls and toys, and there were the ashes of a considerable lot of paper and rags for dressing the dolls—the ceiling of the shop was broken through, leaving the rafters and laths exposed in two places and in the passage outside the shop; one of the holes extended right up to the door I have spoken of; that ap<lb/>peared to have been done recently—in the shop at the right hand corner opposite the front door there had been a fire; a large quantity of paper, folds of paper that had apparently burnt itself out; it was perfectly dry, and did not appear to have been touched with water—going up stairs the framework of the staircase window had been on fire, but I concluded that was from the heat of the fire in the passage; the banisters were very much scorched, charred in some places—I am positive there were six distinct fires that could not have communicated with each other, and in addition to those there were others which might or might not have communicated—in the second floor front room the prisoner showed me his bed, which had ap<lb/>parently been laid in; the trap door was open, and a child's cot was placed on end which formed a sort of ladder, and from there I got on to the roof—I found a dressing-case between the roof and the ceiling, between the two traps—during this search I spoke to the prisoner; in fact, I asked him to accompany me during my examination—I asked him what time he went to bed—he said about 12 o'clock, and he had not heard anything until he was aroused by the police springing the rattles and knocking at the door, he</p>

               <p>then made his escape by the roof, finding the house was on fire—I asked him if there was any one else in the house at the time—he said no; his wife and children were away, having been ordered away by the doctor for their health; his father-in-law, who lived with them, was also away on a holiday, and the servant did not sleep in the house—I then told him that the circumstances were so suspicious that I should consider it my duty to take him into custody for setting fire to the house and its contents—he had a brown paper parcel with him and a cash-box—I asked him what they contained—he said the lease of his house and also the policy of insurance——this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the policy; it is for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the London and Liverpool Globe Office, dated 17th February, 1870; 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on stock in trade, and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on furniture—he said the whole of the furniture did not belong to himself; the furniture in the room which we were then in belonged to his father-in-law, and also other furniture in the house—and he said his father-in-law was insured in some other office, but he did not know the name, for, he thought, 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner had on his night-shirt, boots, and neck-tie, his hat was on the table—on a further search I found this two-quart tin can containing paraffin, in the cupboard in the front kitchen—when I told the prisoner I should charge him, he said he knew nothing about the fire; and at the station he said he could satisfactorily account for it he felt confident—he gave up a purse which contained these four duplicates of property pledged on 24th, 25th, and 26th July.</p>

The boards leading from the one where the fire was to the door where the Inspector has mentioned seeing the paper, is one mass of dry rot; it extends to nearly the whole of the kitchen. After Mr. Barker left, I pulled up the two boards, so as to be perfectly safe with fire, and I saw no traces of it. I poured four buckets of water; I also moved the packing-cases from where they had been standing two months, and put them up against the wall, further from the fire, so that they might be out of the way in case the fire should smoulder and light again. I did this before the servant went home. I also moved some of a collection of shells to a chair, and covered them with newspaper to keep the dust from them. A parcel of cuttings of dolls' dresses were in the chair adjoining, they were placed against the wall farthest from the fire-place, a bare wall I put a sheet of newspaper across the window, because the girl had complained to me of boys looking down into the kitchen. I must have left one piece of board standing against the dresser. I saw nothing more of the fire till I heard a knocking at the door. I jumped out of bed and smelled smoke. I went down in my night shirt to my father-in-law's bed-room to awake him, but as I entered the room I recollected that he was not there. I took his writing-case and ran up to the top. I knew I could not get out at the window. I took my lease out of the drawer and my cash-box, intending to throw them out of window. I got out at the roof, and got some of the things out, but the smoke came up so strong I could not get them all. I called out 'Fire! Police!' Before this I had heard the rattle. I hastened to the parapet. Mr. Parker called to me, and I got through his trap-door. While I was waiting on the roof I put on my coat and my socks. I went to the back of the house and saw the blind was on fire, and as soon as I could get in I went into the shop with my cash-box. I went to bed at half-past 12 o'clock. We have never used paraffin since I have been in the house. I wish to add I was on the roof after I had called 'Fire! about ten minutes, during which time I put on my clothes."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at 11, Suffolk Court, Harrow Street, St. George's, Southwark—on Saturday night, or Sunday morning, 2nd June, between half-past 12 and 1 o'clock, I was up stairs in my own room, my wife came down as I went up—we had had a quarrel previous to that, between 8 and 9 o'clock—when my wife went down between 12 and 1 o'clock she sat on the staircase at the foot—she was alluding to some con<lb/>versation regarding another woman, not the prisoner—I put my head out of window and saw the prisoner come down the court—she had no bonnet on—she passed my door, and returned back and said to my wife "Mrs. Walsh, are you alluding your conversation to me?"—she said "Yes, Mrs. Green; if the cap fits you, you can wear it"—the prisoner said "You dirty old dusthole ranger, I think myself superior to you"—that was because my wife works at a dust heap—with that I could not swear whether the pri<lb/>soner came in or my wife went out, but as I stooped down I saw my wife take hold of Mrs. Green round the body; Mrs. Green up with her hand and struck my wife a blow with her fist, my wife fell back, and brought Mrs. Green down with her, on the top of her—I put on my boots and ran down stairs, and met my wife coming back from Mrs. Green's door, and as I met her she lay down along the wall of the next house—I went up to the prisoner's house, and met her in charge of a constable—I said "I charge you with assaulting my wife"—she made no reply—she was taken to the station, and my wife Was taken to the hospital—she was covered all over with blood—the doctor attended to her, and I brought her back the same evening—her wounds were dressed, and I led her home—she did not get better, and went to the hospital again on the same Sunday afternoon—she did not stay there—on the Tuesday she got worse, and died on Saturday, 6th July, but she said she would forgive Mrs. Green—I called in a doctor on the Friday—she dressed the wound herself—it was on the left temple, about three quarters of an inch long—it continued running; part of it healed, but the other part kept discharging—my wife had not been injured by any one else—in the afternoon she was not sober, and I shoved her down the court, and she fell down; I put my foot like that, and she fell against the window ledge, and the back of her head got scraped against it—I am quite sure she fell on her back—she was taken up by her own brother, and one of the witnesses brought her up stairs—the skin was a little scraped at the back—the doctor examined that at the hospital, and said it was of no avail.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had quarrelled with my wife on occasions; not to any extent—I had to bring her to order—I did not do that by knocking her about—I was not drunk on this day—I did not knock her down; I <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> her with my hand—I am sure the doctor saw the wound at the back of her head; I showed it to him myself—I did not kick my wife; I only put my foot like that, to tell her to get up and go indoors—I did not use any violence—I was not having words with my wife at the time I saw Mrs. Green; it was previous to then, between 8 and 9 o'clock—I had not seen my wife after that for four hours—I had been to a beershop till 12 o'clock, and then I went up to my room—I saw the blow struck by Mrs. Green with her fist—I did not see her take up anything—she might have got it up before I came down—I saw the whole transaction from the window—my daughter was down stairs—I saw her when I went down, after my wife had</p>

               <p>been struck—there was a little blood from the wound at the back of my wife's head, which I caused in the afternoon; but from this wound in the forehead she was covered all over—she kept on her work from 2nd June to 2nd July, but not so carefully as she did previously—I am not aware of any quarrel between those dates—I was at the Gladstone Arms on the Monday following the blow, with my wife and <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> Driscoll—we were not all three quarrelling there—I and Driscoll had a few words, and wanted to fight; it was all over in three minutes—my wife had nothing to do with it—she was not drinking there; she might have had a glass of beer—I have not had any conversation with my daughter about the case—I did not knock my wife down flat on the ground on this afternoon, and use my foot to her three distinct times—I don't know a Mr. Butcher or Mrs. Martin—I know that man (Butcher), but not by name—my wife did not rush out against Mrs. Green and tread on her dress, nor did they both trip up and fall on the ground—my wife was in liquor between 8 and 9 o'clock, but at this time she was sober.</p>

I am the daughter of the last witness—on 2nd June, between 12 and 1 o'clock in the morning, I was standing in the passage, just at the step of the door, with my mother, outside the house—I was asking my mother for a half-penny—she called me a little b—h—the prisoner was coining down the court at the time, and she said "Mrs. Walsh, are you alluding to me?"—my mother said "If the cap fits you, wear it"—she said to my mother "Go on, you dirty dusthole-ranger"—my mother said "If I am a dirty dusthole-ranger, you are very glad to burn my hard sweat," meaning the cinders she brought home from the dust-yard, and which Mrs. Green used to burn—Mrs. Green then runs to the gutter, and picks up a stone—I partly guess it was a stone, because there is nothing there but stones—against Mrs. Green's gate there is a pile of bricks, but she did not go so far as that—eye had the stone in her right hand and she hit my mother on the left side of her forehead, and said "Take that, you dirty dusthole-ranger"—my mother fell, and Mrs. Green fell on the top of her—I did not see Mrs. Green do anything else to her—she ran into her passage—my mother's face was covered all over with blood—they had a struggle on the ground—I partly think when Mrs. Green was on the top of my mother, that she was trying to use her fist again at my mother—I saw my father up stairs, looking out of the window—he put on his boots and came down, and ran for a constable—I ran for one, but could not see one—I was living in the house with my mother till she died—there was a little scratch on the back of her head; not much—I was present when that was done, between 7 and 8 o'clock—my father <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> her; she fell down, and her head knocked against Mrs. Maddigan's window-ledge—she fell on her back—I did not see my father do anything while she was on the ground—Mrs. Mitchell lifted her up, and there was a little scratch at the back of her bead; it bled, but not much—when Mrs. Green struck her there was such a lot of blood that mother was covered with it; it was on the face.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer employed by the Mint—I live at 39, Radnor Street, St. Luke's—about 9.15 on the evening of 29th July I met the prisoner in Lambeth Walk—I pointed him out to the officers who were with me, and they took him in custody—I told him who I was, and that I had a search warrant for him; that he was suspected of dealing with counterfeit coin—I said "Where do you live?"—he said "Up there"—I said "Where?"—he said "I have got no home"—I said "I will find one"—I took him to 3, China Walk—on entering the door he requested to go to the closet—I procured a light—I saw Inspector Hoskinson remove a loose board in the floor and take out this piece of paper, which he handed to me—before I opened it the prisoner said "I know nothing of that" or "them"—I found in it nine counterfeit half sovereigns, wrapped separately in paper, as they now appear—we took the prisoner up stairs to the second-door front room—I was present when Sergeant Kenwood took from the cupboard an iron saucepan containing white metal, which had been melted, a lid of a tin containing blacking, a piece of a brush, a file, and some copper wire, some of which had been dipped in solution—I afterwards received from Rodgent his galvanic battery (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and this piece of wire, which has been dipped in solution—the battery is complete—I also received two bottles, one containing cyanide of silver and the other nitric acid—all those implements are used for making and colouring counterfeit coin—I also found some plaster of Paris in powder, white sand, some rosin, and a piece of antimony, which is used to increase the weight of the coin, and to give it a clear ring—the following day I accompanied the officers back to the same room, and saw one of them find under an image on the mantel-shelf these two pieces of silver, which have been in acid, and almost reduced to nothing.</p>
