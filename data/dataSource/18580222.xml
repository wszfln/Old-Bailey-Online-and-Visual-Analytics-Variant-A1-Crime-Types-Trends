Judkins, which was referred to me for arbitration—I produce the particulars of demand in the action, and one letter; that is the only letter—this is the order of reference—I have not got the summons—on 12th Nov. there was a meeting, at which the defendant was examined—he was sworn on the New Testament—I produce the papers which are in my possession, but I would take his Lordship's opinion whether I am bound to give any evidence of what took place, before me as arbitrator; I believe it has been held that it is a matter for the arbitrator's discretion, and, if he wishes it, the Court will not compel him to give any information of any thing that transpires before him—I think there is a case to that effect in 3 Carrington and Payne; besides, this can be proved by other witnesses—(<hi rend="smallCaps">THE RECORDER</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and reside in Amherst Road, Hackney. I have a place of business in the city. On 2nd Feb., I was re<lb/>turning from my place of business to the neighbourhood of my own residence—it was about half-past 7 o'clock—there were lamps lighted, and it was a very light night in consequence of the great fall of snow—Amherst Road is a very wide road, and winds round with a gradual curve—I saw the prisoner coming—I should say I saw him 150 yards off—I was near a turn when the prisoner came parallel with me—he was on the same footpath with me, and within a yard of me, and he turned and fired a pistol at me, as he was in the act of passing me—I felt my jaw struck, and three of my teeth were knocked out—I had never seen the prisoner before—I put my hand to my face, and the prisoner stood there while I did so—I cried "Police!" and the prisoner ran away, and I pursued him—he did not stop to assist me—he was taken by a policeman very shortly afterwards—I am sure the prisoner turned slightly towards me when he fired—I had not spoken to him—nothing had passed between us—we had not knocked against one another—I do not think any one was by at the time—I cannot say that I saw the pistol—the prisoner never uttered a word—when I found I was shot, I called "Police!" and he ran away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Medina Villas. On 2nd Feb., a little before 8 o'clock the prosecutor was brought to me—I examined him; he was bleeding profusely from the lower lip and jaw; after washing his face, I found the marks of seventeen shots on the right side of the lower jaw and cheek; some of them had lodged in his face, one or more had perforated his jaw, three teeth had been broken short off in the lower jaw, one shot had separated the gum from the jaw, and had lodged in the opposite side—the shots produced are of the same size as the one I extracted—the wound was a severe one—I saw the marks of powder on the right side of his cheek and nose—they were very much marked with powder—I think the pistol must have been fired off very close to him, still the contents of the pistol were scattered about wide—in all probability the injury had been inflicted by a pistol like this—I did not apprehend that the prosecutor was in danger, he was in very great pain—there was very great loss of blood—if erysipelas comes on it may be dangerous.</p>

On 19th Jan., a cheque for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was presented for payment, I do not know by whom—it purported to be drawn by Mockford and Co., who have been customers of the bank for a number of years—I have seen the prisoner come to the counter—this is the book in which I made the entry at the time I paid the cheque—I paid with a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, No. 47,878 a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, No. 24,177, and 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—the dates are not entered in this book—after cheques are cashed they are taken away by another clerk, and entered by the ledger keeper, and are finally written into the pass books of the customers by a junior clerk, the cheques are then put into the pocket of the pass books and returned to the customers with the pass books.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant, of Kennett's Wharf. On 1st Jan., this year, I went into partnership with Mr. Mesnard—the prisoner has been in my employment five or six years—his duty, among other things, before 1st Jan., was to take charge of the cheque book, and he invariably went to the bank for me—I bank at the London Joint Stock Bank—after Jan., Mr. Mesnard was to keep the cheque book, but the prisoner still went to the bank as before, and brought me the pass book occasionally—I have one other clerk, Mr. Poisson; his duties were chiefly to attend to the French correspondence—the prisoner kept the cheque book until Mr. Mesnard was initiated into the business—before 1st Jan., the prisoner filled up the cheques for my signature, and after that, Mr. Mesnard, but sometimes the prisoner—the bank honours my signature alone—I had my pass book on Monday, 18th Jan., and again on 27th Jan.—the prisoner was at business on the 19th, and was in and out all day on business—he left on the 22nd, on a plea of illness—when I looked at the pass book on the 27th, I discovered an entry, "1051, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 19th Jan."—I had not signed a cheque for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that day, but I had about that date; I cannot say when, because I have not got my cheque book here, but it was paid on the following day—(<hi rend="italic">The cheque book was sent for</hi>)—the only two cheques for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I had drawn in Jan.,</p>

On 18th Jan., as well as I recollect, I sent the prisoner for the pass book, and again on the 27th, and gave him a cheque to get cashed at the bank—I went out, and he had returned when I came back—my attention was afterwards directed by the prisoner to the pass book, in my office; I asked him if he had brought the pass book, and he pointed to it; I did not take it up immediately—about half an hour after<lb/>wards, the prisoner told me that he felt very unwell, and, if I had nothing particular for him to do, he should like to go—I told him he might go, and he went—while he was away, I took up the pass book and examined it; I noticed the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque of the 19th almost immediately—I found a debit of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. against me—I examined the pocket of the book, but found no cheque corresponding to that amount; all the other cheques were there—I saw the prisoner next morning, and told him I wanted the return cheque from the bank, corresponding to the amount in the pass book—he looked a little confused, and said, "I have not got it; I know nothing about it"—he made two or three answers—he spoke to me during the day several times about it, and I spoke to him—I had then been to the bank to make inquiries, and I told him that the cheque had been changed for notes; he made no reply, but some time afterwards he told me, that if the cheque had been exchanged for gold, he did not see how we could trace it.</p>

I was on duty in Whitechapel on the morning of 17th Feb.—I heard a cry of police, I ran to the place, and found the prosecutor and the two prisoners; Brown was stooping over the prosecutor, apparently in the act of robbing him—I took him into custody—Brian had a tussle with the prosecutor, and got away from him; he made a kick at him once or twice—I cannot tell whether he struck him—as he ran away he picked up Brown's cap, which he had dropped—I took Brown to the station, and four or five minutes afterwards Brian came back with the cap and said, "Policeman, he has done nothing, let him have his cap "—I recognized him, and told a constable to take him into custody; he ran away, I sprang my rattle, he was pursued by another constable, and brought back—I am sure he is the person—about seven or eight minutes previous to their attacking the prosecutor, I saw them cross the street within about fifty yards of the spot—I knew them both by sight previously.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business as a merchant, at Kennett Wharf, Upper Thames Street; the prisoner has been my clerk several years. On 1st Jan., I took a partner into my business, Mr. Mesnard—up to 1st Jan., it was the prisoner's duty to keep the cash and pass book; he did not after 1st Jan.; he occasionally filled up a cheque, but Mr. Mesnard took the cash and pass books—the prisoner always went to the banker's for the cheque and pass book—I sign the cheques invariably—this has been the cheque book during the present year—I did not issue a cheque on 19th Jan., for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but Mr. Mesnard did one—I remember Monday, 27th Jan.; the prisoner was in the office that day—I did not see him come in when the pass book came in; I saw him in the office in the early part of the day—I saw him with the pass book; I think he handed the pass book to Mr. Mesnard—I saw him leave the office, and after he left the office, Mr. Mesnard called my attention to the pass book, and I looked at it—after looking at the pass book, I looked at my cheque book—I observed a cheque was missing, about 19th Jan.—supposing a cheque had been spoiled, I had told the prisoner it was to be cancelled by crossing the margin in the cheque book—here is no such word in the cheque book on that day, or about that day.</p>

               <p>Mr. Mockford—the prisoner sometimes took them to him to sign, and some<lb/>times myself—there were some cheques drawn in blank, since 1st Jan.; I am able to state that I filled those cheques up—there were crossed cheques drawn, and blank cheques—I did not fill up the crossed cheques; I filled up those which were not crossed—I remember, on 27th Jan., I sent the prisoner to the bank for the pass book—I was not there when he returned; I came in afterwards, and found him there—I did not see the pass book at first; I asked him for it, and he pointed to it on the table—this is the pass book—after I had asked him for the book, and he pointed to it on the table, I was talking to Mr. Mockford, and remained talking a short time, and the prisoner shortly afterwards told me he did not feel well, and if I had nothing parti<lb/>cular for him to do, he would like to go—I told him he might go, and he did go; he did not return that day—after he had gone, I took up the pass book; I looked at it; I found an entry in that pass book which attracted my atten<lb/>tion—I then looked into the pocket of the pass book; I did not find any cheque there, corresponding to the entry in the pass book, of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not find a cheque for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 19th Jan.—I am able to state, that on that day no such cheque was drawn—I filled up a cheque on that day, but it was after bank hours, and it was dated on the 20th, being filled up after bank hours——I saw the prisoner the next morning; I did not speak to him at first; I immediately went to the Joint Stock Bank—when I came back, I saw the prisoner—I said to him, "Ratcliff, I want the cheque for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which has been taken out of the cash book, corresponding with this entry of the 19th"—he looked rather confused, and said, "I have not got it"—I explained what cheque it was, a cheque for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 19th Jan.; he denied any knowledge of it—I found a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I told him we had discovered that the cheque had been paid in notes, and some time after he remarked to me, that if the cheque had been paid in gold, he did not see how it could be traced—as well as I can recollect, that was after I told him we had discovered it had been paid in notes.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Hampshire.

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer of the London police. On Monday, 15th Feb., I went with Foulger to where the men were at work, at the new Clothworker's Hall—I went to a spot were I could see the men at work—I saw the four prisoners there; certainly three of them—I will not swear whether Field was the other man or not—Ginger and Shore were bringing lead from different parts of the roof of the building, and taking it to Jones, who was beating it up into a smaller bulk on a kind of scaffold—a portion of it he put into his own trousers, and part he put down to some one underneath, who I believe to be Field—about ten or twelve pieces were brought to him—I saw Shore unbutton his trousers, and put some lead in, I believe, from the distance I was at—that was all I saw that day—I went there between 4 and 5 o'clock, and left about twenty minutes after 5 o'clock—I went again on Tuesday, to the same place, about ten minutes before 5 o'clock—I saw the same three that I had seen before, and I believe the fourth man—I saw the lead brought by Ginger and Shore, and Jones beating it up, and putting a portion in his pockets, and putting some down to some person below—I left where I was and went into the street, and at half past 5 o'clock the gate was thrown open—I met Jones coming out of the building—I felt that he had something very bulky and heavy—I saw a portion of lead in his pockets—I asked him how he accounted for having his master's pro<lb/>perty—he said he took it to get some beer—I took him to the station, and found on him various pieces of lead, altogether 72lbs.—about 50lbs. was in the fall of his trousers, and the other in various pockets—I found on him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 91/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Jones gave a false address, No. 12, Robert Street, City Road—Ginger gave the address, No. 14, Windsor Street, Islington—I went there, and found a number of copper nails in a box, and a number in a jacket in the room.</p>

I went, on the Monday, with the last witness and Mr. Taylor, to a place where I could com<lb/>mand a view of the roof and dome of Clothworker's Hall—I saw Jones, Ginger, and Shore, and I think Field, but I cannot swear to him—Jones brought a box of lead from one part of the roof which we could not see—Shore came and got on a lower part of the scaffold—Jones beat these pieces up and put in his pocket—Ginger kept throwing pieces of lead to where these</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on the business of a plumber in Clements Lane. I am engaged in doing the plumber work at Clothworker's Hall—the four prisoners were in my employ as labourers—they all receive the same wages—in consequence of information, I went with two police officers, on Monday, 15th Feb., to the building—I went about 3 o'clock, and put myself in an office which overlooked the building—the men were at their work—about 4 o'clock, I saw Jones take his position on a part of a scaffolding at the back part of the building, and, a few minutes afterwards, Shore came forward with a quantity of lead, and handed it to Jones—about a minute afterwards, Field came forwards and he got underneath where Jones was sitting—he brought some lead, and put it on the scaffold where Jones was sitting—Ginger then came and brought some lead, and threw it on to the scaffold—Jones had a brick in his hand, and he was knocking up the lead that was brought to him—the men who brought the lead could see what he was doing; they were standing within a yard of him—he handed several pieces, nine or ten, underneath to Field—I could see Field distinctly, and could see what he did with the lead; he lapped it round his body—the lead that Jones did not give to Field, he put some into his pocket, and fastened a portion under<lb/>neath his stomach—I have seen the lead that was found—I have not any doubt that it is my lead—the prisoners had not any right to take it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SOLICITOR-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you account for the difference between the 1,407<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the 1,322<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 81/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We have not charged against him some small sums—this last account was received on 23rd Dec., 1856, six months after the time—taking his accounts as they stand, they show a very large balance due to him, 1,532<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—during the period over which these accounts extend, there was a very great press of business in the office, and an immense deal of correspondence—the first account was examined to the extent of seeing superficially how it was made out, and a letter was written on the subject—on 9th March, 1857, the result of the ex<lb/>amination of all his accounts was sent to him, and he was called upon to pay 1,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the cash balance—we first sent in a detailed claim for 1,935<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in<lb/>cluding various sums for explanation and vouchers; that included the 1,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in Jan. last, criminal proceedings were taken; many demands had been made from time to time for a settlement; the matter was finally referred to the solicitor of the war department, and then these proceedings were instituted.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MONTAGUE CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you first gave him notice that you intended to proceed in the Court of Exchequer to bring him to account? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not aware of that—I do not know the precise date at which the matter was referred to the solicitor; in April, 1857, the solicitor was engaged in a correspondence—I now say that our real demand, on the most favourable view of the accounts for the paymaster, is 1,322<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as a cash balance—we have not excepted two or three sums which he debited himself with, which has caused the small difference between the 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, and the 1,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—the balance never stood even in any quarter—the last two quarters he was decidedly in excess—at one time, on the face of the account, he was in advance of the public, that was at the beginning of his career—he did not always send in vouchers; a great many were not sent—the audit passed through two or three hands—I was not personally the auditor at the time; it passed through the hands of the juniors in the department to which militia accounts were allotted—when the first quarterly account was sent in I had not anything to do with it, except to record the amount in the books of the office, and the same with the four other accounts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then nobody attempted to audit or inquire, until after the last account was sent in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, they did; a clerk in the War Office, of the name of Stillwell—he is not one of the witnesses for this prosecution—three or four persons were engaged in going through these five quarterly accounts; one of them is here, Mr. Sidney Kirby, a son of mine—the first pay list in March was declared to by Captain De Tessier—the first account which the prisoner signed begins with a balance—I have got the account which Captain De Tessier sent in—the course of business with respect to these quarterly accounts is anterior to the money being paid, to make what is called a monthly estimate of the probably expenditure required during each month—that is the proper mode of proceeding—the monthly estimates are here—three monthly estimates are sent in every quarter, and a supplementary one, if necessary—the army agent sends in a quarterly account to the War Office; we give them a printed form; that is a very different form from these, a very simple form compared to these—these printed forms for the quarterly accounts are supplied from the War Office; there are twenty-eight forms, all bound in one volume—the captain of each company pays the men, and he is intrusted with money by the paymaster to do so at the end of each month; he is bound to balance</p>

               <p>his account with the paymaster, and the paymaster adopts the charges, and introduces them into his pay list—a form is provided for the purpose of getting the acquittance of the captain each month.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Here is a large sum of 7,235<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. taken credit for, as having been paid to captains and others, which was never paid; but after all the balance now claimed is only 1,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd; there must have been some over payments made by the prisoner on other accounts, or the balance would be larger. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he over debits himself, as has been already proved, for the drafts under the name of estimates, and that stands to his credit, and is withdrawn on the other side—he did not receive the sum that was to be paid to the officers, it is only an estimate; an estimate is sent in to justify the paymaster in drawing at all—he claimed to a very large, extent beyond what he wanted, therefore he was always in a condition to draw more public money than he could want—he might have drawn much more than he did—he might have drawn to the whole extent of the 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but as soon as his quarterly pay list came in, it would have been seen what a large balance he had—it was in his power to do so, no doubt, for a time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I see here that he is required to make a statement of sums paid to officers, as shown by the abstracts and monthly pay lists; where do the abstracts and monthly pay lists come from? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The officers prepare them, and hand them to the paymaster at the end of the month, and there is an account current between them, which is adjusted every month—he takes the amount from what the officers hand to him, in order to get their receipt—the proper course of business is, almost immediately after the quarterly account is delivered, for some person to examine, and then send to the paymaster what is called an abstract of examination it is very desirable that it should be done as soon possible after the quarterly account is sent in; it is the ordinary practice, but it was very much inter<lb/>rupted during the Russian war—the duty of the examiner is, to take the abstract, and to put down his objections—there are printed forms, in order that all that may be done—every single charge that is objected to, is to be entered in the abstract of examination, and then the paymaster, having that called to his attention, is called upon to answer the objections, and to return it, so that it may be seen whether he has answered them, and whether his answers will be allowed—no abstract of examination was sent, in this case, until the receipt of the last pay list; after his last account was sent in, he would receive five abstracts of examination; he would have to go back through all those five abstracts of examination, to see whether he could answer the queries and objections—the burden would be thrown upon him, of correcting the errors in all the five accounts—he would not have to alter the figures in his accounts, but he would have to say yea or nay, whether it was correct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose, not being a good accountant, he had entered a sum of money on the wrong side, or entered it twice over, and that pervaded all the accounts, he must make the correction or allowance in all the accounts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly—in the third quarterly account he charges against himself 81<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for income tax; he debits himself with that amount in the Dec. pay list—he also charged the pay short of that, but in the next quarter he resumes the charge; he corrects it—that is noticed in the abstract of examination; that was after the whole of the accounts were sent in, I am not aware that it was noticed before—his quarterly debits consisted, generally, of the three monthly esti<lb/>mates; the estimate is made about the middle of the month preceding, but the money to be credited is not the estimate, but the draft—there is nothing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185802220050"/>
               <p>for estimates but the pay of officers; and there is his solemn declaration that he paid it—he both credited and debited himself upon estimates.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I want an explanation of this: I see here, "To pay of officers, after deducting income tax, to be accounted for by the agent;" does the agent send in any account? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The system, with regard to the pay of officers, is rather peculiar; the agent makes out one annual account, in which he charges all the pay of officers, name by name; that is done to prevent a double charge between the paymaster and the agent—the agent would have to charge and account for the 1,291<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in this first account—in form No. 11, you will find a statement of the stoppages for men in hospital; that is, where he debits himself with stoppages; and where he credits himself, he must produce the account, to prove that he paid it, and if it was a wrong charge, it would be struck out—if there had been time to follow the proper course of business, we should have gone regularly through the account, quarter after quarter, and called upon him to produce his vouchers, and have seen which way the true balance was—he would not have to pay up that balance at the end of each quarter; he would have to carry it forward to the next quarter, as a debit against him or a credit on his side.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then what I understand you is, that there is a running account between the paymaster and the War Office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is limited to a very small sum, regularly; it is limited by taking exception to any charges that appear to be improper, or where there are not vouchers produced—we point out the sums which are incorrect, and he corrects them in a future pay list; the balance goes on from quarter to quarter—I have had a very long experience in these regimental accounts—occasionally, young men go into the army as paymasters; in "the Line," it is usual to have a man already a soldier, an officer; but in the militia, you cannot get that—in the army, they are gene<lb/>rally old captains, and gentlemen who have given their attention to accounts; but in the militia you cannot get that, and are obliged to resort to persons who have not had experience; we are obliged to take the recommendation of the Lord Lieutenant of the county, he appoints; we have scarcely any option in the matter, except we know something against the character of the party—I have never seen any account so irregular as this—the agent pays the officers—the agent sends in quarterly accounts—I have compared the defend<lb/>ant's quarterly accounts with the agent's; they are usually examined with the pay list; that is done in a branch of the office which I now superintend—these accounts have very much the appearance of having been prepared by a man who does not understand the proper way of preparing accounts—the paymaster is responsible; he may commit it to whom he likes; a pay sergeant might help him—in the regiments of the line, undoubtedly, there would be sergeants more experienced than in the militia—it would be the business of a young man to make himself acquainted with the accounts, if he accepts the appointment—I do not know whether the charge originally made against the defendant, at Bow Street, was for embezzling 1,900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I was not there then—I have stated that 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is the amount of his deficiency; I have explained the way in which I account for the difference between that amount and the 1,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—he became a clear defaulter in the quarter ending March, 1856; I mean, there was then a balance against him of 1,322<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>my bed was on the other side—The prisoner slept in the next bed to the deceased—on the night of 10th Feb., between 9 and 10 o'clock, the prisoner came to the deceased, put his hand on him, and said, "Don't make such a noise, you prevent my sleeping, and the other men as well"—and he had said that to him before on other nights—the deceased made no answer to that—I did not see whether he was awake or not—I saw the prisoner get out of his bed between 1 and 2 o'clock, and put his two hands to the middle of the deceased man's bedstead, and he turned the bedstead on it's side, and the deceased came out on the floor—the fall of the bedstead was very heavy on the floor—the bed and bedclothes came with the deceased on the floor—the prisoner then put his hands to the bedstead a second time, and threw it right over the deceased—the deceased cried "Murder!" three times when he was on the floor, and the prisoner took the bedstead off him, and put it in it's proper place—the deceased got up, put his bed to rights, and got into bed—when I got up at 7 o'clock in the morning, I saw blood on the floor about three feet from the bed—I saw the deceased get up in the morning at the usual time, 7 o'clock; he put every thing on with the exception of his coat—I left the room at half-past 7 o'clock, the deceased was then sitting on the prisoner's bedstead, and his face was down on his own bed—I left Crawford in the room—I did not hear of the deceased's death till after breakfast, about 9 o'clock the same morning—I went up to look at him about half-past 9 o'clock, I saw him dead—I did not see any bruises on him—I thought he was sleeping when I left the room.</p>

I was in the prisoner's house on 12th Jan., No. 12, Cartwright Street, Westminster—I went to the house about 11 o'clock in the day—the prisoner and his wife were at home—they went out together, and returned in about an hour, both in liquor; the prisoner was very much so; the deceased was not so much as the prisoner—a quarrel took place between them which lasted about a quarter of an hour—towards the close of the quarrel the prisoner told his wife that if she did not hold her noise he would smash her head—she replied, "Do it; do it"—my head was then turned from them, and when I turned my head again, I saw the prisoner with a five-pint tin saucepan in his hand—the deceased got hold of the saucepan lid, and tried to return the blow—the lid had fallen off the saucepan on to the counter—I had heard it fall—the deceased did not return the blow—I prevented it—there were no more blows struck after that—the deceased was bleeding from the left side of the upper part of the head—the prisoner asked me if I would go with his brother to the chemist's to have her head dressed, and I and the deceased and the prisoner's brother went to the chemist's—this happened on Tuesday; I saw her afterwards on the Thursday, she seemed better, and went to the theatre—I won't answer whether her head was bandaged—I saw her on the Thurs<lb/>day after, and she was not quite so well.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chemist and druggist. On 12th Jan., the prisoner's wife came to my place—she had a scalp wound on the left side of the head, about an inch above the temple, about an inch and quarter long, and of slight depth—I dressed it within a couple of hours—I saw her afterwards, and did every thing that was necessary to the wound.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a doctor of medicine and licentiate of the Apothe<lb/>cary's Company. I first saw the prisoner's wife on 22nd Jan.—she was suffering from erysipelas—she had a wound a little above the temple, on the left side of the head, which I look upon as the exciting cause of the erysipelas—I know no other cause but that—the wound itself was very slight, but it would be sufficient to produce that effect—I had known her for years—I am</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185802220061"/>
               <p>speaking of her general habit and temperament—I continued to attend her till her death on 31st Jan.—she died, as the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination showed, from contusion on the brain—I connect that with the erysipelas I had seen on the 22nd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Might the contusion on the brain be caused by other diseases as well as erysipelas? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I look on the effusion as the consequence of the erysipelas—I found nothing else to account for it—erysipelas continually takes place without any wound having been inflicted—some persons are more predisposed to it than others—being given to drinking is one of the most common causes of it—I should call her a person singularly predisposed to erysipelas—erysipelas is a disease of the whole system, and her indulging in drink might have produced it independent of and quite irrespective of the wound—I look upon that wound as the most manifest exciting cause of the erysipelas; but erysipelas and effusion are quite consistent with constitutional derangement—supposing there had been no wound, the erysipelas would have proceeded from natural causes, and more especially so from her previous state—the wound was of the most slight description—it did not go through the inner skin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SALTER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is erysipelas a disease which will spread over the whole body? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it is a disease of the whole system—it requires an exciting cause to develop it, in any one given spot—it will very frequently occur without any manifest exciting cause—the wound did not appear to be the <hi rend="italic">nucleus</hi> from which the erysipelas proceeded—it was on the left temple—the greater part of the disease was round the neck and face.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But may it happen that where there is a wound, the erysipelas does not appear to spread from the wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The erysipelas will develop itself at a distance from the wound—the development may, in all probability, have arisen from the constitutional cause—the erysipelas had ex<lb/>tended up to the wound—I attribute the erysipelas to constitutional causes, but I believe it was excited by the wound—I believe the constitutional causes and the wound produced it—it might have arisen without the wound—I considered the wound but a very small matter, but it being there I could not but notice it—I had seen symptoms of erysipelas in her once before—the death in this case may have been caused by the erysipelas, without any wound at all—she died of erysipelas, and I think the wound had very little to do with it.</p>

On 2nd Feb., between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was near Mr. Brady's house, and saw both the prisoners, and another, who went away so quick that I could not see his face—the second one was Ridgway; he had a white flannel jacket on; but since the police have been after him he has altered his coat—they were run<lb/>ning from Brady's premises, jumping over the fence—I heard the crash first, and heard Brady talking to them out of the window as I came up to the gate, and Mrs. Brady was close behind me—I said, "Chappell, what have you been doing?" he ran a little way down the street and came back again—when Mrs. Brady came up we went to look, and the door was in pieces, and the goose and piece of pork were gone—we went round the neighbourhood to see if we could see any police, but could not—I was at the public house that night; there might be a dozen males and females there—it was a female's wedding day, Mrs. Hill; Mrs. Brady was with us, and the prisoners; we were all close together—the prisoners were quite sober.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you quite sober. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and so was Mrs. Brady—we went to the public house at 10 o'clock; it was the Three Colts—the prisoners were in their own company—we had a little ale; we had no spirits—Mrs. Brady did not propose that we should go home and have some coffee—I do not know <hi rend="italic">Piggey George</hi>; I know George Shaw as a neighbour—I have known the prisoners a considerable time; I knew them when they had a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi> moving the water butts—my house is not opposite, it is in the next street—I did not blacken my face that night—I and the prisoners were not marching up and down the street, and singing—there was singing in the public house—I got home about half-past 1 o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a prisoner in Newgate, under sentence of four years penal servitude for forgery (<hi rend="italic">see page</hi> 127). I know the prisoner—I remember a conversation between him, Sowden, and myself in August—I cannot say the day or the week, but it was about 5 o'clock in the afternoon—Sowden met us <hi rend="italic">promiscuously</hi>, as I thought, but no doubt it was a planned thing, he told the prisoner he was going to do his <hi rend="italic">swell's drum over</hi>—I asked him what he meant, he said he was going to <hi rend="italic">screw</hi> into the <hi rend="italic">governor's</hi> house, which I afterwards found out meant opening the front door—in consequence of that, I went over with the prisoner to Mr. Edmand's house on the same day, about half an hour afterwards—Sowden stood at the corner of Pier Street, which is very near, it was the prisoner's practice to carry a bag con<lb/>taining skeleton keys and housebreaking instruments, and he introduced a key which opened the door—I was at the gate—he said, "I have got him at last," and opened the door, and told me to go in—he said, "Come along," and I went in with him—we proceeded over several rooms, and several articles, three mats, a table cover, and a paper-knife were packed up in a bag, and the prisoner carried them away, except the knife, which was given to Sowden; and it was taken by me to a man named Ainslow, a tailor, of Queen's Road, Chelsea—the prisoner waited outside while I went in—on the same evening, between 6 and 7 o'clock, we went to the prosecutor's again, and got a very large hearth-rug, with a lion upon it, and another rug; one was tied up and left behind the door, and the other was taken—that was all, I believe, that was taken that night—the door was only locked each time—(previously to the robbery taking place he had mentioned to me that there was such a robbery going to take place, and I had refused to have any thing to do with it)—we went again the next night, and the prisoner used a skeleton key again, we took several frock coats, two waistcoats, several pairs of trousers, the pair of grey trousers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), many shirts, a set of three studs, a gold swivel, a hearth rug, a pack of cards, and this dressing case, but there was another razor in it, I think—we took them all at once in a large bag—the prisoner afterwards said that he intended to sell the trousers, and the coats, and waistcoats—I gave information to the police on Christmas Day—I was only in the prosecutor's house on those three occasions.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman R</hi> 144). It is my duty to stand at the gate of Woolwich Dock Yard, when the men are going out at night—I am authorized to search them if I think it expedient—I was on duty at the outer factory gate about a quarter to 6 o'clock, and the prisoner attempted to go through, (he is the leading man or foreman of the labourers)—a sergeant of my division was with me who touched the prisoner, and I searched him and found in his jacket pocket three pieces of leather, thirteen pieces of candle, two whole candles, and a brass sheath (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the pieces of leather were between his waistcoat and shirt—the candles were wrapped up as they are now—I asked him no questions, but he said, "It is a bad job," and seemed very much confused—I left him in charge of the inspector inside the gate, and went to a locker in the Dock Yard and found this piece of leather (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I found the key on the prisoner when I searched him—next day I showed it to him, and he asked if it was the leather that was found on him—I said, "No, it was found in your <hi rend="italic">cabin"</hi>—he said that he had it in his <hi rend="italic">cabin</hi> for the purpose of mending straps which were used in his business—I compared the band of leather with the pieces found on him, and they cor<lb/>respond as if cut from one another—an hour after I took the leather to him he said that the candles and leather he could give no account of, or something to that effect, and the sheath he picked up while going round the yard with a gang of men, and placed it in his pocket, with the intention of giving it up to the proper authorities—he had actually reached the gate, and was passing out when he was touched by the inspector.</p>

On 6th Feb., I was on duty at New Cross Road, Deptford, nearly a mile from the prosecutor's premises—Mar<lb/>getson was with me—I saw the three prisoners about a quarter past 5 o'clock in the morning, going in the direction of London—another policeman named Edmunds came up, and we went down Five Bell Lane, into the high road again, about a quarter of a mile further up; we watched the prisoners come up, and then walked out in front of them. I took Bailey, and asked him where he came from, he said, "From the docks." I said, "What docks?" He said, "Below," moving his hand in the direction of Deptford—I asked him where he lived; he said, "In the Borough"—I asked him what he had about him; he said, "Nothing"—I put my hand into his right hand coat pocket, and took out this silver watch, and a quantity of rings; four dropped on the ground, I picked up two of them at the time, and afterwards went and picked up one, and another constable picked up another—I searched his left pocket, and found a quantity more rings, in all forty-two—I asked him how he accounted for the possession of this property; he said, "We picked it up near a horse trough at a public house; did we not, Ben.!" Williams replied, "Yes"—when we came past the Marquis of Granby, he said, "This is where we picked it up; did not we, <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi>?" Williams replied, "Yes"—I looked at Bailey's hand, it was cut, and from some remarks which I made to him, he said, "I have met with an accident on the road, as we have just come from Chatham across Blackheath."—I found this handkerchief saturated with blood (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) round his hand; I also found on him a knife, a key, and a pen knife.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Union Buildings, Woolwich; I am carman to the South Eastern Railway Company. On 31st Feb., I was re<lb/>turning home from an Odd Fellows' Club, and before I turned into Union Street, I saw Pearce standing at the corner, and Ginger a short way down High Street—I walked on, and when about three minutes walk from my house I heard some one behind me, I looked back, and saw that it was Ginger—I walked on, and found that he drew nearer to me, and when he was within five or six yards of me, I looked back, and got out into the road for him to pass me; he would not, but seized me by the collar—I begged of him to let me go, as I had not interfered with him—he knocked my cap off, and as I stooped to pick it up, he seized me by the throat, and Pearce came up and said, "Take his watch, take his watch"—I snatched my watch of the guard and put it in my trousers pocket, but in vain—they plundered my pockets of 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and my watch—Ginger then squeezed my throat till I became insensible, and when I came to my senses I went for the police, and found Pearce in bed—the policeman took the clothes off him and said, "Is that the man?" I said, "Yes; I suppose you thought I did not know you, <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi>, but I did"—I had known him more than twelve months about the town—Larking took him to the station, and I went with the other constable to Ginger's house, and found him in bed—my watch, and chain, and purse have not been found—I believe Pearce said he had not been in Ginger's company that night, but I am not positive—I was perfectly sober—it was a bright, moon-light night, and there was a gas lamp very close.</p>

I said, "Yes"—he asked the policeman if he had brought a piece of paper for him.</p>

On Saturday evening, 6th Feb., I was in her shop—the prisoner came in behind me—I had seen him before that with a man who has escaped—I heard the other one say, "Go in and get a halfpennyworth of black thread," and the prisoner came in and stood behind me while I was served—I came out before him—I went across the road, and when I came back I saw the one who has escaped and the prisoner walking up Blisset Street together—I stood at our gate and watched them; the other one went into the shop, and came out with some<lb/>thing on his shoulder and walked across the road, and they went away, and I saw no more of them—I had seen the other one three or four times before—I knew him by sight; he used to be potman at a public house close by—I did not see the prisoner after that I saw him go across the road and the other one follow with something on his shoulder—I should not think it was quite ten minutes after the prisoner went in for the thread that the other man went in and got the roll—they had been loitering about there nearly all the evening.</p>

MATTHEWS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the defendant the person to give the notice of removal of a body for the purposes of dissection, according to the usual course of the workhouse? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was his duty to send the notice to the inspector of anatomy; the medical certificate of death would be sent to him at the same time, in the ordinary way—the master was supplied with printed forms of notice of removal, in compliance with the Anatomy Act, 2nd and 3rd William IV.—the master represented the guardians, for the pur<lb/>pose of sending bodies to the hospital—I never heard the master's authority questioned in that respect—I have known Mr. Feist during the entire time that he has filled the office of master—I have had an opportunity, nearly daily, of seeing in what way he performed his duties—his conduct, as master, was exemplary, as far as my observation went, until I heard this accusation—I have had an opportunity of knowing the inmates intimately, and they speak, generally, well of him, those who are well conducted; those who are other<lb/>wise would, of course, not like his discipline—there was no disregard of the feelings of the poor under his care; on the contrary, as far as my observation went—the guardians, with the consent of the Poor Law Board, have twice raised his salary in consequence of his good conduct—I am generally familiar with the management of the workhouse—the burials would be under the care of the undertaker—there was a contract between the undertaker and the guardians as to the burials; it was the office of Mr. Hogg, the undertaker, to manage and conduct the burials of the paupers—I do not know whether he had the control of the dead house—the number of paupers in the workhouse averaged about 550—Mr. Feist's duties were very numerous and very rigidly attended to, as far as my observation went; he was very regular in the per<lb/>formance of his duties—there were a large number of visitors; he would not have much time to give to each—there was a resolution come to by the guardians on 24th Dec. last, "That the master of the workhouse have the sole charge of the dead house, and the responsibility of the proper disposal of all bodies deposited therein;" that resolution was passed after the master had left.</p>

I was not specially appointed to make the inquiry; it was one of the ordinary inquiries made by the poor law inspectors; and, under the authority of the Act of Parliament, I administered an oath, as I always do and always have done for many years past—I did not require the defendant to take an oath in this instance; when he first appeared before me, I asked him whether he would be sworn or not, I left it to himself, and he said he would rather be sworn—I asked whether he had any objection to be sworn—he said, not at all, he would rather be sworn—if he had said, "I had rather not be sworn," I should have taken his declaration, under the peculiar circumstances of the case, but not from any doubt that autho<lb/>rity was vested in me to administer the oaths—when I say I would have taken his declaration, I do not mean I would have administered the form of declara<lb/>tion to him, I mean I would have heard what he had to say—this is what I took down—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "I am master of the St. Mary Newington Workhouse, and have been so for two years and ten months—there has been a great number of deaths in this workhouse since I have been here—the same contractor has always buried the dead from this workhouse while I have been here, his name is Robert Hogg—I keep one key of the dead house and there is another kept by the porter—I am aware there is a law which enables guardians in certain cases to deliver the dead bodies of paupers to properly licensed persons for the purposes of dissection—I do not know whether there is any order of the guardians in their books to this effect—Mr. Hogg was the contractor for burials when I came to this house—the clerk has informed me that although there was no record of the fact, nevertheless the guardians availed themselves of the 2 &amp; 3 William 4c., 75, s. 7—The next day after I came in as master, the dead body of a pauper was forwarded to a school of anatomy, it was taken away by Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">HOGG</hi>—I have a form of certificate under which I forward the dead bodies of paupers to schools of anatomy (<hi rend="italic">form put in</hi>) this form is always accompanied by a medical certificate (<hi rend="italic">form put in</hi>) I have for<lb/>warded many bodies of paupers to schools of anatomy—I remember Mary Whitehead, she died in this workhouse—her body was sent to a school of anatomy—I always send to the friends of paupers deceased—I can not recollect whether any of Whitehead's friends attended—I am satisfied that if any dead pauper has a friend who claims the body, that such body would not be forwarded to a school of anatomy—I have been at Guy's Hospital; for the last twelve months all bodies from this house have gone there—I have been twice at the hospital on business which I was sent for—the secretary sent</p>

I have been employed for five or six years by the parish of Newington to bury the paupers—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my bill from 29th Sept., 1856 to 21st Feb., 1857—I have charged the parish for the funeral of Mary Whitehead on 2nd Feb.—I cannot recollect the burial of Mary Whitehead in particular—I have seen the witness Louisa Mixer—I saw her at the work-house when she came to attend a funeral—I have produced the warrant with reference to Mary Whitehead—these papers, the notice and the certificate, were given to me by Mr. Feist to take to the inspector—I did take them, and obtained a warrant with Mary Whitehead's name in it—I kept the warrant as my authority for the removal—the body to which that warrant relates must have been sent to the school at Guy's Hospital—I recollect the relatives going into the dead house to see the body—that was the ordinary course—the body was in a coffin in the dead house, and was seen by Mrs. Mixer—I saw her look at a body; it was the body of Mary Whitehead—that body was left behind in the dead house, coffin, and all—I was in the dead house, and saw all that was done there—the relatives followed a body—I have no recollection whether there were three bodies in the hearse or only two, but there must have been one that was brought from the hospital for interment, and that was buried in the place of Whitehead—the body that Mrs. Mixer had seen, was taken to Guy's Hospital; it was by the direction of Mr. Feist that this was done.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Whose body was taken to the cemetery instead of Mary Whitehead's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That I cannot say; it was a party that was brought from the hospital, that had been for dissection previously—I cannot recollect this burial in particular; I cannot recollect whether two or three bodies were placed in the hearse that morning—I never saw Mary Whitehead whilst living; I did not know her by sight in any way—there was no name on her coffin that I am aware of; the names are only put on in chalk by the paupers when they bring them down stairs—I recollect taking that body to the school by having the warrant, and by the notice papers being sent to the inspector—I know that the warrant referred to the body of Whitehead, because there would have been no other body left behind on the burying day; I can only tell which body was left behind, from the daughter seeing it—upon occasions when there have been no coffins there, the bodies have been brought down to</p>

               <p>the dead house in shells, but when there have been coffins there, they have brought them down in the coffins they have been buried in; that is the regular practice—I had the conduct of the funerals—I had not access to the dead house at all times; a key of the dead house was kept at the porter's lodge; I could go to that when I thought proper—I was in the habit of bringing the bodies of paupers who had died out of the workhouse, into the dead house; that was by orders given by the relieving officers—I never removed a body into the workhouse without an order from the relieving officer—I did that at all hours up to 9 or 10 o'clock; I also brought into the dead house the remains from the hospital, I always had done so, to be buried with the other funerals; that was so regular that it was done for the last six years, ever since I did the work; I have always done so; I have never informed the guardians of that—when I removed a body from the hospital, the expense of the burial was paid by the hospital; they paid me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for each burial—the workhouse paid me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I charged both the hospital and the work-house in all those cases where the substitution took place; not for the unclaimed bodies—I did not know any of these bodies—I charged 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the funeral of Mary Whitehead; supposing the remains of Mary Whitehead to have come back again, and to have been buried at the expense of the hospital, I should charge them 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I do not know that it was contrary to my orders to charge the workhouse for the burial of bodies that I removed from the hospital; I had no orders at all about it; I assumed that I had a right to charge both; Mr. Feist never told me that I must not charge—5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was not an insuffi<lb/>cient price to pay me, not taking into consideration the unclaimed bodies which are sent for dissection during the period the contract is held; it is only by means of the unclaimed bodies that I am enabled to make it pay—the certificate of death and the notice of removal I always take to the Inspector of anatomy; sometimes they were sent to my place under cover, and some<lb/>times they were given to me at the time I went to the workhouse; I generally got them from the master; I never received any from the clerk; it was my duty to go to the workhouse to inquire what deaths had taken place; I was bound to see what bodies were in the dead house, two or three times a week; it was my duty to provide for all burials that I was directed to perform—I got the warrant from the Inspector of anatomy, and under that warrant I removed the body; when I removed the body, I took the warrant with me, and the master had a receipt for the body when I took it away; the Inspector's warrant is my authority for removing the body for anatomical purposes—in the case of Mary Whitehad, it was done by Mr. Feist's directions; those directions were given to me on the morning of the funeral, at the workhouse, in the dead house—nobody was present then.</p>

I am the sister of Phoebe Clarke, who died in the workhouse at Newington, on 21st Feb., 1857—I was called on to see her when she was taken bad, and I went to see her when she was dying, and I saw her the morning after she died—I went with my sister, Sarah Crutchley, to the workhouse, that was on Sunday morning, 22nd Feb., I saw Mr. Feist, and asked him if he would allow me to see my sister, Phoebe Clarke; accordingly he sent some person with me to the dead house, and we saw her—Mr. Feist went part of the way with us, but some person who was in the house opened the door—I saw Mr. Feist again when I came out, in the garden, but said nothing then—I asked him when the funeral would take place, and he referred us to Mr. Hogg; he said he thought it would take place on the Wednesday following, but we</p>

               <p>must apply to Mr. Hogg to be certain—on the following Wednesday morning my sister and I went to the workhouse about half past 9 o'clock—I saw Mr. Feist in the waiting room, I asked him if he would allow me to see my sister, and he refused me—he said he could not show me the body, for Mr. Hogg had the keys of the dead house, and therefore we could not see her—I asked him a second time, and he refused me—some time afterwards Mr. Hogg came, and my sister went into the dead house, I did not—Mr. Hogg said that a body was there that was very offensive, it would not be possible to go in—Mr. Feist did not go in while I was there, he was in the garden—when my sister came out we went into the waiting room again, and stayed there—I did not go into the dead house, my sister did—we were afterwards called out, and followed the body of my sister, as we supposed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">the person referred to in that section; and this objection applied to the first four Counts; the</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">th Count appeared to raise the real question; for by the common law it was a misdemeanour to delay improperly and unnecessarily the burial of a dead body, and to sell a dead body might, at common law, be a misdemeanour</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MATTHEWS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">contended, that no authority had gone that length; he argued, that a misdemeanour at common law must involve a trespass, and referred to the cases of Reg</hi>. v. <hi rend="italic">Gillies and Reg</hi>. v. <hi rend="italic">Sharpe, as supporting that proposition; he, however, relied upon the statute, as, in any event, furnishing a justification for all that the defendant had done</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICK WIGHTMAN</hi>, <hi rend="italic">as at present advised, was disposed to consider, that the mere selling a dead body for the purposes of dissection, might be an offence at common law, independent of the statute, and, as to that, he would take the opinion of the Jury upon the evidence; by the terms of the Act it would seem that, whatever may have been the cast at common law, it was lawful for any person having lawful possession of the body of a deceased person (leaving out the undertaker), to permit that body to undergo anatomical examination, unless the known relatives should require it to be interred without such examination; he did not find, in any of the cases in question, that there had been any requirement that the body should be interred without examination, although all might well suppose that would be done; but there was the further circumstance, which he should leave to the Jury, whether this was done for lucre and reward, as alleged in the indictment; and then the question would arise, whether this Act enabled a party, having lawful possession of a body, to sell it for the purpose of anatomical examination; as to that, he would at present give no opinion</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inmate of St. Olave's Union. I knew the deceased, Christopher Wright, he was an inmate and the prisoner also—on Saturday, 6th Feb., I was with them in the old man's hall, and a quarrel took place between them; it began by the prisoner calling the deceased <hi rend="italic">Yorkey</hi>, and jeering him; the deceased threatened to punch his head if he did not desist; the prisoner kept on, and the deceased got up and struck him once with the flat of his hand; there was a little bit of a scuffle, but I did not see the prisoner return the blow, he ran away laughing; in fact it was at that time all play on the part of the prisoner—the deceased returned, and kept <hi rend="italic">chaffing</hi> and jeering about the county he belonged to, and about Yorkshire pudding—the deceased got up and struck the prisoner a blow in the face, and the prisoner returned it with his fist that time, and on the left side of the cheek—there were one or two blows, and they closed almost immediately; the deceased fell underneath, and the prisoner on top of him—the deceased fell flat on his back, being paralyzed with his left arm; he was about 48 or 49 years old—a man named Kane, who was in charge of the room, pulled the prisoner off, and Wright was picked up and put on a form, and they asked him whether he was hurt much, he made no reply—as they went out to supper I saw the prisoner and Wright shaking hands—I went in with them to supper, and when we had been at supper some little time, Wright was taken in a fit—I told one of the men to untie his handkerchief; he was taken into the receiving ward, and the doctor was sent for.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inmate of St. Olaves Workhouse.
