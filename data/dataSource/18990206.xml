I am proprietor of the White Hart, Hayes—on February 12th I went to bed about 11.30, having fastened all the doors and windows—I left in the till five sixpences and about 2s. 6d. in bronze and £1 worth of silver on the shelf in half-crowns and silver, and some bronze and sixpences; there was two 10s. worths of silver—the prisoners came in that night abort 10.30, and left at 11—I was roused about 3 a.m. by Rolfe—I went down and found the window open leading into the back yard, and the glass removed—that window was locked when I went to bed—I went into the bar and found the till on the floor, and the box of the lock had been forced open—Taylor came next day with a pair of pliers with paint then on them—I tried them on the window<lb/>sill and they fitted—I also missed three half-pounds of "Old Brigade" tobacco like this—I found these papers outside the window.</p>

I live at 12, Kensington Palace Gardens—I am head of the firm of Montagu and Co., bankers, 60, Old Broad Street—the prisoner William Henry Gibson was my butler up to January, when I gave him notice—on January 20th he asked if he might speak to me—I said "Yes, after breakfast"—he said he was very much worried, would I lend him £30—I had two years previously helped him out of debt—I said, "What for? have you been drinking again?"—he said "Yes," and that he would like to commit suicide—he said, "You would not believe that your plate was in pawn?"—I said, "No, indeed, did you pawn it?"—he said "No," he would not think of doing such a thing, but it was his brother who induced him to bet at races—I sa id, "Where was it pawned?"—he said, "In the Earl's Court Road"—I said, "What is the amount of the tickets?"—he said, "I will go and get the tickets, I shall not be half an hour"—I said I could not have any more confidence in him because of his drinking—he said, "Oh I can face penal servitude, and if you prosecute me it is no more than you ought to do"—he left to get the tickets—I thought the matter was serious, and gave information to the police—I afterwards saw him in Church Street—I called a policeman—I said, "I shall give this man in charge for stealing my plate"—he said, "You are not going to prosecute me"—I said it was my duty—he was taken to the police-station, where he gave the address of his brother and a woman—I did not know the woman, but I fancy I have seen the brother—this coffee-pot, three silver ladles, two silver fish knives, two silver candlesticks, and the candelabrum, are mine—they are antique, and marked "S. E. M."—they were pur<lb/>chased by me—the candelabrum is one of a pa r that cost £328 8s., the date is 1731, the time of George II.—I bought it at Christie's in 1893, the pair weigh 154 oz.—the coffee-pot, which weighs 27 oz. 10dwts., is of the time of George III., and cost £10—they are hall-marked, with the initials "P. L.," for "Paul Lambri," which increases the value—the others are modern plate—the candlesticks are also marked "Paul Lambri," and are of the date of 1743—they weigh 41 oz. 15 dwts., and cost me in 1893 £40—I think they are worth half as much again to me—they are all marked with mine and Lady Samuel's initials except some of the small things.</p>

Abingdon Gardens, for Hilda Grant of same address"—I see the monogram would not be read for "Grant"—I have no doubt we did inquire, but nearly all silver is crossed with initials—I asked some question, and Grey said some things were left her by her father, and some were given to her—we accepted her statement that she pledged for her mistress—some of her pledges had been redeemed—I can see now if I had inquired at 23, Abingdon Gardens I should have found no such person—I did not think the property was worth so much as Sir Samuel says—I have had sixteen years' experience—I am principal manager—I am not an expert in antique silver, but I know a little about it—I should not like to say I was an expert in marks—on January 5th Grey pawned</p>

I am head storekeeper to the National Telephone Company at its chief office in New Bridge Street—we have a stationery store at Oxford Court, Cannon Street, where Shakespeare was employed as assistant storekeeper—I was present when he made a statement to Mr. Little child on December 19th—I never in any way endeavoured to influence him in making it.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Mr. Mathews then submitted that the statement was admissible, and the Common Serjeant admitted it.) Read</hi>; "George Edward Shakespeare, of 50, Swindon Street, King's Cross, says: 'I have been with the National Telephone Company since May 15th, 1896, as assistant stationery storekeeper. About two years ago Mr. Clarkson, the printer, of Garlick Hill, who does some of the printing work for the firm, asked me if I 'could let him have a ream of crown court vellum. I said I would try. This took place at his place, which was then at the corner of Queen Street and King Street. As far as I remember he sent his truck boy for it a day or two after. The next time I saw Clarkson, which may have been a day or two after, he put 4s., into my hand, I did not let him have any more paper for some time, but it went on from time to time, but only one</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189902060034"/>
               <p>ream at a time. Sometimes I send him crown court vellum, and sometimes I send him bank paper; he paid mo on an average 4s. a ream. The moat recent cases of my letting Clarkson have paper was about three weeks ago. I have frequently to go to him at Garlick Hill on business of the company, and while so with him on business he asked me to let him have some paper. I sent him two reams of crown court vellum, and one or two reams of bank—I am not certain if it was one or two reams of bank, I am certain of the two reams of crown court vellum—he paid me about £1 for these. I am not sure of the amount, but it was certainly not more. That was the last transaction. The kind of paper I sent Clarkson is the same as that on which he supplies forms to the Telephone Company. I sent it to him in the same wrapper, and just as it came from the mill. Once or twice I may have put an extra cover of crown paper round it. Clarkson asked me if I could tell him what the inquiry was that was being made. This was on Friday evening that I saw him, about ten minutes past six. I had called on Clarkson by Mr. Brown's instructions; I told him I did not know what the inquiry was. Clarkson told me he was going to meet Remington between quarter and half-pint six at a public-house in Queen Street, towards Thames Street, second house past St. Thomas Apostle. Fuller, the clerk to Mr. Clarkson, told me on Saturday morning that the letter Clarkson had written to the company was concocted by Brown and Remington. I know nothing with regard to Clarkson sending in a less number of forms than he ought to have sent in. He has never made any arrangements with me, and I am not aware there has been any arrangement with anyone else to pass off as full quantity. I was tempted into what I have done through the fact that in addition to having a wife and three children to keep, I have to support my mother.'"</p>

               <p>Clarkson came to me and put one hand on my shoulder and he pointed out a stack of work which had been printed, and said, "Barnes, this is between me and you, cut an those forms No. 170, and when you have cut them up you will find there is 94,000 or 96,000, and you will have to take some off each to make 100 parcels of 1,000 each"—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is a sample of form 170 used by the National Telephone Co.—they were printed before I went there—I did as I was told, and made up 100 parcels supposed to contain 1,000 each, which would make 100,000; but there were only 94,000 or 96,000—I made each 1,000 about 100 or 150 short, and put them into the rack, and the track took them away while I was away—I also remember a delivery of 30,000 No. 182 forms sent to the company about the end of November or beginning of December, they were 3,000 short—the truck boy Broadbear took the things to Oxford Court—he took them at midday—I was present when he took them from Garlick Hill—I have seen Shakespeare at Garlick Hill several times—he came to see Clarkson—he would see him in Clarkson's private office—he would stay generally about twenty minutes—he would come between five and six in the evening—on the morning of December 1st Clarkson told me to go over and tell Shakespeare he wanted to see him—I went over and told him—Shakespeare came across in the evening—Clarkson was in his private office—on December 3rd Clarkson asked me to go over to Shakespeare for some paper—I did not go over to Shakespeare, I went oat as though I was going, and returned and made excuses that he was not there—Clarkson. did not say any more about it—next day I saw four reams of crown court vellum on Clarkson's premises which had come from the National Telephone Co—I knew it came from there because I made it a rule when the truck boy came in to ask where the paper came from, and the boy told me where' it came from—Clarkson was present then; he told me to pat it away in the rack, which I did—I have heard Clarkson tell the truck boy to go over to Shakespeare in his dinner hour, and get some envelopes—on December 3rd I was going to the Telephone Office, and I met Broadbear with the truck in Cannon Street, opposite the National Telephone Company's Office, about 100 yards from Oxford Court—T spoke to him, and I looked at the truck; there was some brown wrapping paper, apparently waste paper, thrown into the truck; I picked it up, there was a parcel underneath—the truck appeared to be empty; if I had not lifted of the paper I should not have seen the parcel—when I got back to Garlick Hill I saw the same parcel on the bench—I spoke to the boy, and he opened the parcel; it contained two reams of extra strong bank paper—Clarkson was pre<lb/>sent; he asked Broadbear where he came from, and Broadbear said from Shakespeare—Clarkson told me to undo it and pot it away in the racks, which I did—that was the last paper which came over before I received notice—on December 10th I received a week's notice from Clarkson—he gave me no reason whatever—I did not ask him—he called me into the office to give me my wages, 21s. a week, and said, "I shall not want you any more after next week"—I said, "All right," and walked out—upon that same day I wrote a letter to the district manager of the National Telephone Company—on the morning of December 13th</p>

               <p>I went in, to my dismissal—the book was not kept properly, I was out sometimes—there was no paper that I ever saw there which I put into the stock book—Broadbear never made the slightest concealment about what was brought in from the Telephone Co.—it was mostly concealed at the bottom of the truck—the boy concealed it when he brought it from the company on December 3rd—it was mere rough paper—that was the only time I saw any concealment when he brought them, they were invariably put where I could see them—from October 28th I never mentioned that goods, had been brought in, or said that J did not know why—I knew that many of the parcels I have spoken of had been counted, and some of them were more than 1,000, one was 1,000 and odd—some contained more than 1,000, some less—this paper(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) bears no date or address—I wrote to Mr. Gill man some time in December while I was in Clarkson's employment—I cannot say the date—I had notice on the 10th, and it would be about two weeks before that—I cannot say whether it was in November—I did not see the answer addressed to Mr. Gillman, nor did I see him upon it—I did not write to him again—I wrote, "If a gentleman calls upon you, kindly say I am still working, and have been five years in the warehouse"—I had been in the place five years, and I thought I bad rather have a character from there—I do not know what reason I had to suppose that Mr. Gillman would give me a false character—I did my best to get Mr. Gillman to write what he knew was false, and I knew what sort of man Mr. Clarkson was—I had something to do with the trades union—Mr. Gillman was not a member of the trades union—I kept a special book for the Telephone Company, a receiving book, in which the goods should be marked down as they go out—the truck boy looked after that, and there was a receiving-book for all customers for goods going out—sometimes orders would come in from the Telephone Company for a large number of forms to be delivered quick, but I do not know that Clarkson sometimes had not enough paper to execute them—I have not known him to go and ask for paper, nor has he sent me over to do so—he asked me on December 2nd to go to the Telephone Company and ask for the loan of a ream of paper, but I did not go; I do not know who went, but two reams came from the Company, and they were used for the Company's order—I say that they were stolen because they were fetched over in the cart—they were brought in openly—the Company got them with the printing on them—a truck would not be required to bring it, it would only weigh 22 lbs.; he could carry it under his arm—it was a two-wheeled truck—Clarkson never to my knowledge sent to borrow paper before—I had nothing to do with making invoices out—the other man was called the machine-minder; he had the entire charge of the machine and the handling of the paper, and it came to me when it was printed—only those two, and the boy Broadbear had anything to do with it—I never received a penny beyond my wages; he never offered me any bribe or inducement to connive at this robbery—I have been out of a place ever since December—I have tried to get one several times, and the last time I told them that Mr. Clarkson was retiring from business—I did not say a word about Berke leys—Clarkson never said that I had been negligent and careless and frequently absent on Monday, or that I had made mistakes, or that I had</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 49, Hale Street, St. George's Road—I am a machine man lately employed by Clarkson at Garlick Hill—I left there on December 20th, the day after his arrest—I entered his service about ten months ago—whilst there I have seen from time to time paper coming in from the National Telephone Co.—last September or October I heard Clarkson tell Broadbear to go to the Telephone Co.'s office and be there about 6.15 with the truck—the same evening Shakespeare came to Clarkson's office—I cannot remember the date—Clarkson was not in, and he saw the clerk Fuller—next day Clarkson told Broadbear to be over at the Telephone office about 1.15 in the dinner hour, with his truck, or else his job was not worth much—later in the day I saw Broadbear come back to our office with the truck, and he had about seven reams of paper in it—he had some Monck ton's foolscap and double cap azure laid—I saw it—it laid flat in the truck with a few pieces of wrapper over it—he came to the side door, and unloaded the truck; he brought the paper just inside the door and laid it on the compositors' table, and after the dinner hour I took them down to the other end and took a couple of wrappers off, and put brown paper on them and stuck them in the rack—I only know Shake speare by sight—I have seen him on the premises when Clarkson was in—he would see Clarkson in his office; he was there several times—Clarkson always saw him if he was in—I was in charge of the machines when the paper was given out, and it would not produce the proper quantity—I had to take some off every lot, and make them up into the proper number of bundles—if the order was for 100,000; 100 bundles were sent in, each supposed to be 1,000—they did not contain 1,000; if they did there would only be about 92 bundles, and we had to take so many off each to make 100 bundles—I never remember making a less number of bundles than was ordered—I remember Burnes going, the day he left Clarkson said to me, "What do you think of that b—hound; you don't know what harm he has done me; he has even written to Peacock's; he has done me a lot of harm, and if this should come to a law point, will you swear that my work has always been sent home properly?"—I knew it had not, but as I had a mother to keep, I said "Yes," so as to retain my position—the establishment was afterwards broken up, and I left on December 20th, and after that I made a statement to the solicitors for the prosecution—I was at the police-court—I have got another situation now.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I made a statement to the solicitors on December 21st—I attended at the police-court twice—Mr. Peacock is the merchant who used to print for Clarkson—Clarkson asked (me to give false evidence—I did not agree to commit perjury—I was not on my oath then—I knew he was committing a fraud—I was about twenty-two then—I did not say, "I won't do this," because I did not send the work out—it was my place to print what was given to me—I knew he was sending the work out short—I did not say anything about it to Clarke—I remained with</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>). A large portion of the Company's forms are printed outside; contracts are sent to the printers—they put in tenders—the printers supply the paper—some of the printing is done at Oxford Court—up to May, 1898, the Company had supplied paper to the printers, but since then it ceased to supply paper, certainly so far as Clarkson was concerned—from that date he would have no right to have the Company's paper delivered to him—I did not know that he was receiving five reams of Monckton's paper, two reams of azure laid, four reams of crown court vellum, or two reams of extra strong bank—Shakespeare had no authority to hand him any paper after May 6th—among the forms printed by Clarkson there were Nos. 79, 170, and 182—if the stock of forms run short, the head storekeeper Fishley sends in an application for so many, and if I agree, the order is sent to the contractor, who executes the order, and he sends it to Oxford Court, and the storekeeper enters it in the duplicate stationery receipt book—the duplicate is sent to the head office, and then reaches me—if the order was for 30,000 and they were sent in in thousands, and there were only twenty-eight bundles we should question it, we should not count the contents of each bundle—they would be delivered at the stationery store, and there they would suppose that each bundle contained the specified number—the contractor sends his invoices in to me, and I should check them with the copy Toucher and then pass it on for payment if it is all right—I find on November 29th there was an application from the stationery department for 50,000 No. 170 forms—the order was sent to Clarkson to print and deliver them—I afterwards found out that he had delivered what he pretended were 100,000 forms—they were delivered to Mr. Fishley—I had nothing to do with counting them—on November 23rd I received an application from the stationery store for 30,000 No. 182 forms—it was sent on to Clarkson on December 1st for him to fulfil—I have no note of the 30,000 No. 79 forms—about December 10th a letter was received by the general manager from Burnes and handed to me—Burnes came to the office on December 16th, when a statement was taken from him—on December 17th this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), purporting to come from Clarkson, was received—Shakespeare made his confession on Dec<lb/>ember 19th—Shakespeare did not know the contents of Burnes' letter; we kept it private—Clarkson and Shakespeare were arrested on December 19th—I was present then, and also when Burnes pointed out the paper on Clarkson's premises.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The warehouse was searched, and a few things were taken away—there was nothing to identify the paper by—Clarkson could buy from the manufacturer, and it would be delivered in the same way as to us—we do not keep a stock of what goes through the stationery store; we have no stock book—we have a book in which we enter everything that comes in, and a second book in which everything that goes out is entered—we do not keep a ledger balance—we did not know what</p>

Ball and Co., and other firms—Clarkson could buy from them—we suggest that the people we buy from put in the ream of Partridge and Cooper by mistake—we knew we had the ream, and we missed it, and it was found on Clarkson'a premises—I do not know if Partridge and Cooper would sell their paper—when we got Burnes's letter we did not communicate with Clarkson, asking if he could give any explanation, we were investigating—between the dates we received Burnes's letter, and on December 19th we took deliveries of goods from Clarkson—I do not know how much, but I believe 182 forms—we thought then that he had been cheating us—I say the shortages must be very large—since Clarkson has been in custody we have counted some of the packages delivered by him, and found them short; we found one or two in excess of the quantities—we counted each form—we have no means of ascertaining that he had delivered forty-seven parcels instead of fifty—I am not giving Burnes anything now—I do not know anything about what is being done in regard to him—I saw him when he made his statement.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner</hi>). I have been four years in business for myself as a printer and stationer—prior to that I worked as traveller to people in the same trade—I began to do work for the Telephone Company a little over two years ago—it commenced by my tendering for a contract, and continued off and on till my arrest—the work consisted principally of these printed forms—when Burner came into my service. I did not tell him he was to assist in packing up shortage—there is no truth in it whatever, nor is it true, as Carter says, that he said the same thing to him—I never asked Clarke to give false evidence in the witness-box, and never bribed them or induced any of the three to be parties to a fraud—they never complained that I was putting them in a wrong position—when the delivery of 27 packages only, of 182 forms was discovered I gave orders for the deficiency to be made up—I have never up to the present time had any charge made against my honesty and respectability—if I frad not supple<lb/>mented this missing one the value of them would have been 5s. or 6s.—the net profit on the 30,000 would be about 8s.—they cut it very fiue on these contracts—these are casts—I should keep a few forms in stock—I have to pay for the paper, the ink and the labour, and that leaves me about 8s. profit—I had urgent orders from the Telephone Company to get on at once—they would want some 79 forms or 170, and bring the order in at mid-day and want them the same afternoon, and we sent them by bits as they were worked off, to dispatch them into the country—I have borrowed paper of the Telephone Company through Shakespeare from time to time in cases of emergency, and it ought to have been returned—my clerk, Burnes, had to send to Spicer's for paper to work the 30,000</p>

               <p>on, and they would send me an invoice—Shakespeare afterwards brought me orders by hand from the Telephone Company; he came over two or three times a week—I kept the parcel that was put in, to get the proper signature for all that I delivered—I do not know where I got the roll of Partridge and Cooper's paper; but I imagine that I bought it at a sale—during the last two years I have bought £500 worth at sales—I pay cash for it and take it away—it contained miscellaneous qualities and sorts of paper—it was Burnea's duty to enter in the stock book all the paper he saw on the premises—I have not invoiced the extra 50,000 to the Telephone Company, and as far as I know they are there—I have given Shakespeare dinner and lunch money, but 25s. a year would be as much as I spent.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first knew Shakespeare about two years ago, about the same time as I began to work for the Company; someone else came to my office at first, but he has come for about twelve months—I used to <hi rend="italic">go times</hi> and not give him lunch at all, it began about twelve months ago—I knew he was an <hi rend="italic">employé</hi> of the Telephone Company—I did not know that an entry would be made of small parcels of paper, such as Partridge and Cooper's—I did not know that they counted the packages; Shakespeare did not tell me—being in ignorance, I did not habitually send back my forms short of the number—I doubt its truth—it is not a true account—Burnes comes here to tell a falsehood, and Carter and Clarke, and the National Telephone Company, have told falsehoods—I had an order for 30,000 forms in November, and I ordered from Spicer Brothers on December 7th seven reams of paper; this is the order for it (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—each ream of paper will produce 3,840 of these forms without spoilings—seven reams would work out to 26,480—I did not order the paper, and am not responsible for the order—it is Broadbear's initials, I think—my clerk would give the order, not without my authority, but I was ill, and was only up for three hours a day—I did not hear that an inquiry was going on till Friday, December 16th, the day before my Arrest, but I heard that complaints had been made by the packers at the company's office—I heard that Burne had threatened to complain; I think that was on the Tuesday before the Saturday that lie left—that was not the very day on which I ordered another ream of the same paper to make good the deficiency; it was to make up the 182—I adhere to that date—it would be the same day of course—I saw the order book and saw that enough had not been sent in, and I got another ream—that is called "blue laid"—I kept no stock; I ordered as I required it—this (<hi rend="italic">the order for the extra ream</hi>) is my clerk Fuller's writ<lb/>ing—these two documents are written by the same person only one is larger than the others—one is dated December 7th and the other Decem<lb/>ber 16th—I wrote the letter of December 17th myself—this letter (<hi rend="italic">another</hi>) is Fuller's writing, but the signature is mine—I may have seen Shakespeare in the week ending December 12th, but I cannot recollect—I did not hear that Burnes had written a letter to the Telephone Company till after my arrest—I think I heard that someone had; I do not know when—I did not on December 13th hear of it and speak to Burnes as to a letter being sent to the Telephone Company; I simply asked him if he had got another job because I had got another man coming</p>

I am a draper, of 1, Palmerston Road, Waltham-stow—on January 23rd, about 1.45 p.m., the prisoner came in for a silk handkerchief—I said he did not want one, he had not worn out those he had the previous week—he said he had never been in the shop before—I called in my daughter and asked her in his presence if this was the lad who had been the week before—she said, "You are the lad who stole the silk handkerchiefs from me"—I gave hira into custody—on the previous Thursday I was away, and when I returned my daughter made a com<lb/>munication to me—the value of the property I lost was 10s. 6d.—I did not know the prisoner—I locked the shop door—my little girl first recognised him.</p>

I am a tailor, of 4, Hanover Street, Hanover Square—prior to November 8th I knew Senior as a customer—on that day he came to my shop with Brings, representing him to be Mr. Pine, of the Fish Docks at Grimsby, who wanted a suit of clothes—my foreman measured him, and he ordered about £13 worth of clothes after a con<lb/>versation Senior said he was going to telegraph to some friends to dine with him at the Hotel Cecil—after Senior went out Briggs asked me if I would cash a cheque for £27 17s. 9d.—after consulting my clerk I agreed to cash it—I handed in exchange these cheques for £7 10s. and £20 7s. 9d.—I saw my clerk hand him a pen, and him in the act of endorsing the £7 10S. cheque, and afterwards the cheque with the name appended as it is now—he complained of Senior not returning, and left a message for Senior to meet him at the club—Senior afterwards came back, and said he had been to a jeweller's shop, and showed me a stud which he said belonged to his wife, and was worth about £50, and hence the delay—the next morning I had an intimation with regard to another matter, and telegraphed to Senior—a cheque was returned that day—the cheque was paid into my bank the next morning by my clerk—it was returned I think on 10th, marked "No account"—I wrote and telegraphed to Senior about it—I received this reply in this envelope dated November 11th: "Dear Sir,—Your wire has betn sent on to me here from Paternoster Row. I do not know what you want to see me so urgently about as to wire me, but I shall be back from Liverpool to-night or early morning.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant</hi>). About 6.30 on December 10th I arrested Senior on another charge—I afterwards mentioned the cheque given by Briggs on November 8th to Mr. Neary—on December 24th he made a statement, which I took down, and he signed, and he initialled every page. (<hi rend="italic">The portions of this statement which was read were</hi>: "That day November 8th, I called at two or three places in the City with my clerk, Shepherd. I believe I signed the telephone agreement that day. Afterwards I returned to the Imperial Club, where I met Briggs, who took me to the Mitre public-house, Chancery Lane, where we met Street and Rusconi. Street practically apologised for his suspicions. Briggs told me in the presence of the others that he had got a small cheque, and if I would go up and introduce him to Neary for a suit of clothes he would try what he could do with Neary. We took a cab and drove to the Hotel Cecil, had drinks, and Briggs wrote a letter to his wife, which he read to me in the cab as we were driving thence to Hanover Street, Just before we got there he said, 'You had better introduce me in the name of your friend, Pine of Grimsby, and leave the rest to me.' I remonstrated with him against doing this; but in the meantime the cab had pulled up outside the shop. I introduced him to the cashier as my friend, Mr. Pine of Grimsby. He stated that he wanted an overcoat and vest, looked at some cloth, and pulled out of his pocket one of my pro<lb/>spectuses of George Pine and Co., Limited, which I did not know he</p>

               <p>had, but I subsequently found out that he had obtained it from the manageress of the club, in whose charge I had left a bundle of papers. I left Briggs in the shop selecting his cloth, and went to the post-office in Regent Street, also to a jewellers to fetch a brooch which had been re<lb/>paired and cleaned. When I returned to Neary's shop Briggs had gone, but left word with Mr. Neary that he had gone to the Hotel Cecil, and from thence to the club. Neary never said a word to me about the cheque. I took a cab and went to the Hotel Cecil; he was not there. Street stopped my cab as it was turning out of the Strand into Chancery Lane, and discharged the cab at the Rainbow. While we were speaking Briggs walked down Chancery Lane from the direction of the club. We went into the Rainbow, had drinks, and Briggs produced the cheque No. X22434 for £7 10s., drawn by Neary on the London and County Bank, Hanover Square, in favour of G. Pine, Esq. At this time the cheque was endorsed by G. Pine, and it is in Briggs' handwriting. Briggs asked me if I knew where to get it cashed. It was then about 7p.m. I suggested Stanley, the Windsor, Strand, as he was the only person I knew. We went there, but Stanley was not there. Eventually Briggs handed the cheque to Street, who said, 'I can get it cashed at a public-house (the name of which I have forgotten) at Brixton where I frequent,' and it was arranged that he was to meet us at the Windsor at 10 a.m. on November 9th. Street did not keep the appointment, and I did not see him until the following Saturday at 12, when he said to Rusconi and me, 'I was nor able to get all the money for the cheque as they were short, but I have got £4, and I have given Arthur Rusconi £1; I shall get the rest on Mon<lb/>day, and will settle with you,' which he failed to do. Rusconi, however, told me subsequently that Street had given him another 17s. 6d.," <hi rend="italic">and</hi> "'This statement I make of my own free will without fear, and without any promise having been held out to me, and I am willing to testify to the truth of it on oath'")—I arrested Rusconi on January 10th in Princes Street, Bedford Row, Holborn—I had the warrant the previous day—when I arrested Senior in Sainsbury's shop Rusconi was with him—on January 10th I arrested Rusconi—I told him I was a police-officer (he knew me as a matter of fact), and that I held a warrant—he made no reply—the warrant was for obtaining money from Wicks and others.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner: sworn</hi>). I desire to refer to the statement I gave to the police on December 24th, and with reference to the porti n read to pledge my oath to its truth: referring to the statement of Briggs that the four of us charged here were at Peele's Hotel,. there is not a word of truth in it; I never was with them at Peele's Hotel—there was no such discussion as Briggs swore to at Peele's Hotel or else-where as to ways and means, nor as to the prospectus of George Pine. I produced no bill of costs that day for £30, £40, or other sums—I never made out a bill of costs against Pine, and never had one. The terms I was on with Pine were other than a bill of costs—no suggestion was made by me to Briggs to personate Mr. Pine. The first time I saw the cheque for £27 178. 9d. was when I called at Mr. Neary's with Rusconi, after Mr. Neary had written me to call upon him with reference to that cheque being dis<lb/>honoured about 4 or 5 o'clock when his manager explained Mr. Neary was out, and when Mr. Neary was out and when Mr. Neary afterwards produced the cheque. That I told Mr. Walter Johnson I owned the White Hart at Orpington is true—I filed a petition in bankruptcy – at that time I was practising as a solicitor at Nottingham and Leeds, but I elected to file the petition at Croydon. I have not practised as a solicitor since the bankruptcy. I was introduced to Rusconi at the Royal Oak public-house by Walter Graham as their customer. On the prospectus of Hooper, Dyer and Co. and of Pine and Co., my name appears as a director. I was chairman of Hooper, Dyer and Co. at the time of my failure, and for ought I know to the contrary, I am now. When I saw the cheque given to Mr. Neary was marked "No account"</p>

I subsequently negotiated through Mr. Hunt, the agent of Mr. John Clear, a solicitor, of 33, Chancery Lane, with the hope of arranging terms with Mr. Neary, who declined to accept £7 and would not agree to wait a few days, and I was committed for fraud. I have been endeavouring to raise money to take up the cheque, unsuc<lb/>cessfully to the time of ray arrest, but have since been successful, and on January 28, at Holloway Prison, under permit received for that purpose from the Home Office, I executed a power of attorney in favour of the same Hunt, who knows all about the matter, authorising and directing him, out of a sum of £166 13s. 4d. due and payable to me, to pay, amongst other liabilities, this cheque, and I so, stated to the Magistrate before I was committed for trial here.</p>

I first became acquainted with Briggs in 1897, when I was managing clerk to a firm of solicitors in the City—I met him about October 22nd, 1898—I knew at that time that he had been convicted at Lewes Assizes of cheque frauds—I resided at the Waterloo Hotel when Briggs came to stay there—I was pressed, together with Briggs, by Mr. Hart, the landlord of Knight's Hotel, for the payment of the bill—I never saw the bill the amount was not more than £3—I was not pressed, I was asked—I had not got the amount on the morning of November 5th—that morning Briggs fetched me from the Imperial' Club to go to the Appletree and Mitre public-house—he there introduced me to Street and Busconi—they were then strangers—Street told me he was an undischarged bankrupt; that he had paid his creditors in full, and there was a balance of £600 due to him in Carey Street—Briggs men<lb/>tioned that Rusconi was the former proprietor of two West End public-houses—it was agreed that we were <hi rend="italic">hard up</hi> and wanted money to carry us over Sunday—Street told me he was in possession of cheque forms upon a bank where he formerly had an account—I went with Briggs in the direction of Mr. Neary's bank to cash the cheque for £20 7s. 9d.—I did</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MATHEWS</hi>. I did not write the body of the cheque "F"—the first time I saw it was when it was handed round at the police-court—(<hi rend="italic">Cheques produced</hi>) Iendoiued those—I have never seen this cheque of November 4th, 1898, before—it is on the National Provincial Bank of England for £23 19s. 7d., and drawn by Capel—the writing bears some resemblance to mine—I do not write two hands—this is my usual writing—T have no reason to write another hand—I should not write another hand—I saw the cheque for £23 19s. 7d. first at Mr. Neary's when I accompanied Senior—it was shown by Mr. Neary's assistant to-Senior—they got talking behind the desk—I heard no explanation—Senior said, "It must be a mistake, and I will see it is all right, I will take this cheque up"—I had made Senior's acquaintance about a week before that, and Briggs' about a fortnight—Street had a public-house about 300 yards from mine—I did not know his business—I did not know he had a banking account—I did not suggest to Briggs that Street had several cheque books—Street did produce an envelope containing eight or ten cheques upon four or five different days—I was introduced to Senior at the top of Warwick Court, Holborn—we met by accident—the Napier is in Holborn—I do not use it—it is not far from Warwick Court—I never produced a cheque there upon the National Provincial Bank of England, Exeter Branch—one upon Doyds Bank, Belgrave Road Branch, was not produced to me on that occasion—I never saw Street in the Napier—I did not say I was going to my rooms to fill up the cheques—I did not after that rejoin the party and produce those cheques—I never had a nhilling from Senior—neyer twopence from Briggs—nor a shilling from Street—I have not been at Peele's for over two years—I could not form an opinion whether the three cheques are in the same writing—they are not in my disguised writing—they are not 'ike it –not for the reason that they are disguised—I did not know Street had a banking account—I have seen Alfred Shepherd with Senior—I believe Shepherd was employed by him—I never was with Briggs and Senior at</p>

               <p>the Imperial Club—I may have been with Senior dozens of times—not at the Imperial Club on December 3rd—I was never there on a Saturday—I never saw Street waiting outside the Club—I went with shepherd to the White Hart, Theobald's Road—Street was not of that party—I did not tell Shepherd I had received a cheque from Johnson—I did not say I could not go to the public-house to cash a cheque—Senior asked, would Johnson cash this cheque—I said, "Johnson has gone before this"—it was Saturday afternoon, between four and five, and he asked would the publican do it, Mr. Percy, and I replied that gentleman supplied the wine and spirits for a smoking concert, and was not paid, and I would not do it—I had introduced the gentleman—Senior would not go in because he was waiting, and expected friends with a share of a bill from the City—I did not go to the public-house and show a card of Johnson and Graham—I did not go on my way to the public house to Johnson and Graham's office; I had no reason to—I did not come out and say Johnson was not there—I never gave Shepherd a cheque to cash—he went into the White Hart, and came out and said the landlord would not cash a cheque, and I said, "I do not expect the man will to a stranger"—I did not say it did not matter, and it is not true that another public-house was spoken of and I said I would try there—we did not then all go to the Sun at the back of the Royal—Senior said Shepherd used the Sun—I stopped at the Royal—I never went near the Sun—Shepherd did—he said it was no good, and I said, "Take it back to Senior"—he said, "We must go back to the Albion in Vernon Race"—I went to Chancery Lane—Shepherd did not come out of the Albion and say he could not get the cheque cashed there—I saw the cheque handed to Senior at the Imperial Club—I am not a member—Senior would be, and Briggs, I believe—Street is not—Senior said, "I know the landlord of the Napier, very likely he will give me the change"—I had to wait there because I was told the landlord was out to tea, and would not be back for half an hour—Senior said he could not get it cashed because the landlord had not sufficient money—I then left them—I did not go back to the club—I had been coming through Chancery Lane on my way home, and I met Senior and Shepherd at the top of Cursitor Street—Senior said, "Do you know where I could get a small cheque cashed?

Chapman said, "I have not <hi rend="italic">dipped</hi> any one"—that means robbed—I saw the prosecutor give Chap<lb/>man in custody—I said, "Do you know these men?"—he said, "Those are two of them."</p>

               <p>there, and he replied, "Nothing"—thinking he might have some <hi rend="italic">pals</hi> about I blew my whistle, and a constable and an inspector came and searched the basement—the inspector found this iron bar while I was there (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) near the spot where I seized the prisoner—he also dis<lb/>covered some marks corresponding with the bar—the bar seems to be a poker—it is bent—there was a little paint adhering to the flat end—I detained the prisoner while the inspector searched—the bar was found close to the prisoner—I searched him, and found on him 2s. 6d. in silver, 5d. in bronze, a cap, and two pawn tickets—I had been round there half an hour before—there were no marks on the door—I examined it with my lamp—there was no bar there or any person—I took the prisoner to the station, where he was charged—he made no reply—I did not tell the prisoner to go down there to relieve himself.</p>

On December 11th, at 3.55, I was on duty at Hill Street, Richmond—T heard apolice whistle—I went to Whitaker Avenue and saw the prisoner in the custody of Cheeseman—I said to the prisoner," What were you doing down there?"—he said, "I was asleep"—the constable and the prisoner stood on the top of the area, and I went down—they could see what I was doing—I saw an iron bar standing against the double doors, and on the end of it I saw a small portion of paint, and in the centre of the doors near the lock a mark which the bar exactly fitted—it had evidently been put between the doors to force them open—the door was not properly fastened inside; the bottom bolt had not b en let down, and it would make a noise, which could be heard for some distance—I called for the prisoner to be brought into the area, and said to him, "Do you see this mark?"—he said, "I see it is fresh paint"—I showed him that the bar fitted the mark, and he made no reply—the doors opens into a portion of the assembly-rooms, then into the bufiet, and after wards into the hotel—I think the prisoner was recovering from the effects of drink—he could understand perfectly; he seemed to know what he was talking about—I called up the proprietor, and said to him in the prisoner's presence, "This man has apparently attempted to break into your place"—he said, "I know nothing about it"—the prisoner was charged at the station—he made no reply.</p>

Baker—I went back to the Weavers' Arms, and Adamthwaite said that he had left his wife in a coffee<lb/>shop, and he would go and look for her, and he went away with my £23 in his pocket—he had taken the halter off the mare, and left a rope on—I never saw him again till he was</p>

Smith—he said, "You must be aware that a crossed cheque is no payment for horse-flesh, and only cash is recognisable"—I recognised that to be a fact—I went to my bank in a cab and cashed the cheque—as I went I saw Gess standing on the pavement, and said to him, "Where shall I find you when I return?"—he said, "I shall be here, I shall not lose an oppor<lb/>tunity of getting those horses; I will give you a deposit if there is a doubt about it"—he gave me £1—I handed the £40 over to the other man, and then I went to find Gess—I saw him waiting—Gess said, "All right?" and the other man said "Yes"—I went with the first man to have the horse handed over to me, leaving Gess in the public-house There was a man holding the horses, and the first man said, "Now the horses</p>

               <p>belong to this gentleman," pointing to me; 'they are his property, and I will pay you for the time you have held them," and he gave him 2s. 6d., and then he went away—Gess came up and spoke to the first man, and then went back to the public-house—I went after him, and the first man went away—I did not see Gess, and I never saw him again—then I rushed back to look for the horses, but both horses and man were gone—I never saw any of them again till I picked Gess out at Southwark Station.</p>
