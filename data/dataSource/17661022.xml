I made a full stop. and with some difficulty got myself back again from them. I went on the other side the gate till the mob was dispersed; I was standing reading a play bill that was stuck up, the prisoner came and laid his hand on my shoulder as before, and said, They will all be acted tonight, meaning the plays; I seeing the place was pretty clear, went to go the way I was going before, they both let me go; when I was about three yards on this side the hospital-gate, again I found myself much about the same situation as before; they took hold of my shoulders as they had before; some of them cry'd again, Drivethro', drive thro'. I had a little money about me and my watch; I clapped my hand down and found my money was safe; they drove me almost down by showing me at my back; after I took my hand away the prisoner let go his hand, and went from me: then I missed my watch: I looked about me and said, I had lost my watch; he that was on my left hand said, You should have taken more care of it; said I, I will take care of you, you insulted me while my pocket was picked; a boy who was standing by me said, He has not the watch, I saw another man take it out of your pocket, and he is gone that way, pointing towards Pye-corner. I was afraid to trust to him; then another boy said he saw him take it, and desired I would go that way with him, and he would shew me him; I went with them,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176610220003"/> and looking down towards Newgate-street, the the first boy said, there he goes, pointing to the prisoner; he was in Windmill-court; the prisoner got by the side of a house; he seeing he was pursued, stooped down, I saw him put his hand behind a spur-stone; I had a suspicion he had laid my watch down there; I ran after him and took him by the arm, and said, give me my watch; he said he had not got my watch, I might search him; said I, I saw you stoop at that place, you shall go back to it; I pull'd him; he said, what are you going to break my arm; I got him to the place, there lay my watch; I took it up and called for a constable; a gentleman near us said, you are a constable yourself, do you take care of him; I brought him here to the Old Bailey, the court was sitting; I took him into an inward room before an Alderman; the prisoner began first to tell his story; he said he was a Whitechapel officer, a housekeeper, and a citizen of London; I believe he is a Whitechapel officer; I have seen his name on a sign as such, in George-yard, Whitechapel.</p>

            . I am a hot-presser, and live in Chiswell street; I do not know the prisoner at all; I saw him pick up a watch the first day of Bartholomew-fair, in Smithfield, about five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts in Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Howard. It was betwixt the Cloyster-gate and the Red-cow, that is, on this side the gate, that is in the path way between the rails.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many people there at the time?</p>
               <p>Howard. No, there were but very few; I saw him stooping, and saw it lie before him on the ground; he put it directly into his right hand pocket as he rose up: I do not know whether he put it in his coat or waistcoat pocket, then he went on towards the Red-cow</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him upon his finding it?</p>
               <p>Howard. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you in Smithfield at that time?</p>
               <p>Howard. I was out of work</p>
               <p>Q. When did you know of the prisoner's being taken up?</p>
               <p>Howard. I heard he was in trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear that?</p>
               <p>Howard. That was two or three days after.</p>
               <p>Q. Where?</p>
               <p>Howard. That was of a stranger at a public-house, the Ship in Drury-lane; he told me a man was taken up for picking a pocket in Bartholomew-fair, and committed to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do upon that?</p>
               <p>Howard. I said I saw a man pick up a watch there; this was one Sunday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the prisoner after this?</p>
               <p>Howard. I went to Newgate out of curiosity on the Sunday to see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body go with you?</p>
               <p>Howard. No, I went alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you enquire for?</p>
               <p>Howard. I did not enquire for any body; the gate was open, and I went up to the door; there I saw the man by accident.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to him?</p>
               <p>Howard. I said, So you are got here for picking the watch up; he said yes, I am got here.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all you said?</p>
               <p>Howard. It was all I said, all that passed between us; I just looked round on the rest of the prisoners, and then came away.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got a subpoena?</p>
               <p>Howard. I have (producing it.)</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by it?</p>
               <p>Howard. A woman brought it to me yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the prisoner you knew any thing about the watch?</p>
               <p>Howard. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him where you lived?</p>
               <p>Howard. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came he to know how to send you the subpoena?</p>
               <p>Howard. I told it to the landlord at the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you guess how the woman that brought the paper came to know your name, or the place where you live?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176610220004"/>Howard. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she find you?</p>
               <p>Howard. She brought it me where I work, at the Bell in Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you used the Ship alehouse?</p>
               <p>Howard. I have for this month past.</p>
               <p>Q. What work are you employed in at the Bell in Drury-lane?</p>
               <p>Howard. I am a hot-presser.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who that woman was that brought the subpoena?</p>
               <p>Howard. I know nothing of her; I cannot say who she is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner ask you where you lived?</p>
               <p>Howard. No; I told the landlord at the Ship I saw the man pick up a watch; he asked me my name and place of abode, in order that I might be sent for if wanted.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your master's name?</p>
               <p>Howard. His name is Cornish.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. When I had the prisoner before the Alderman, there was a man there said he was afraid I was a very bad man, saying he saw the prisoner pick up the watch in Smithfield; I turned and looked at him, and said, you are one that was in company with the prisoner at the time; he directly turned his story, and said he was in good company elsewhere at the time; and told the Alderman that the prisoner was a very honest man.</p>

               <p>Cousins. I have seen him there with one that served his time with Mr. Cornish.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he not tell you he saw a watch picked up in Smithfield by a man who was accused with stealing it?</p>
               <p>Cousins. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not ask him his name or place of abode, in order that he might give evidence about it?</p>
               <p>Cousins. No, I know nothing about it?</p>
               <p>Court. He has been telling us that a stranger was telling him one Sunday evening, at your house, that there was a man taken up for picking a pocket of a watch in Smithfield, and that he told you he saw that man pick up a watch from off the ground; and that you desired him to tell him his name and where he lived, in order that you might send for him when wanted.</p>
               <p>Cousins. There were never no such words pass between us.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cornish. Howard work'd with me a month last Saturday; I hired him for a month certain, then he left me. I know no more of him.</p>

            , Esq: I lodge at Mr. Gibson's; on Thursday morning the 10th of this instant October, I came home between three and four in the morning, I found the door a-jar; the watchman was calling half past three, but none near the door; I hesitated a little time to consider what I should do; I call'd watch, but none were in the hearing; I then knock'd very hard at the door; after I had taken my sword out, and held it in my right hand, I still kept knocking hard; I heard a noise in the house, as if some body was walking; I ask'd who was there; nobody answer'd; I endeavour'd to shove the door wide open; I found an opposition, which I believe was the chain of the door, I think I heard it rattle; I hearing a noise again, turned round and saw a man, which was the prisoner; he was in the house, coming out between the door and the post; I put my sword to his breast, and ask'd him what he did there at that time of the morning; I kept him at arms length, and told him if he did not stop till a watchman came I would run him through; he ran out at the door; I made a lunge at him; I did not immediately observe it, but when I looked at it afterwards, I found it bloody, and when the prisoner was examined before the Justice, he had the mark of my sword on his side, and his shirt was bloody; as he ran off I saw a watchman; I ordered him to knock him down; he struck at him, but miss'd him; this was near Exeter-exchange; when he was in Exeter-street, a watchman hit him with his stick and made him reel; he threw down his lanthorn and followed him; when I came up with them, I found them both on the ground together; I told the prisoner, if he offered to make any attempt<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176610220006"/> to get away, I would certainly kill him; we carried him to the Round-house; but before we carried him there, a man brought Capt. Laber's hat to me, and said, Sir, I have brought your hat; I said it was not mine, but I knew it; we searched him at the Round-house, but found nothing about him but a handkerchief or two, not belonging to either of us; upon returning to Mr. Gibson's, they told me they had lost several things out of the house; the watchman was desired to look which way the prisoner had ran; he went, and came back with a silver spoon or two, and a pair of silver shoe buckles, the property of Mr. Gibson.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing drop from the prisoner?</p>

I call'd to the watchman, and said he is coming that way, the prisoner ran by him; that was the time I believe he threw away the buckles; he came running towards me as hard as he could; I put my lanthorn down, and held my stick up, and bid him stop; he ran on the other side of the way; I struck him a blow in Exeter-street; he ran staggering about twenty yards, and then fell down; when I came up to him, he began to turn about and tussel with me; I threw my stick out of my hand, and collared him with both my hands, and threw him down, and kept my knee on his guts, till I had assistance came; when the captain came up, we took the prisoner to the Round-house; going along, he put his hand into his pocket, and threw something down; I said he has throw'd something away, and the captain picked it up, it was this knee-buckle; when the prisoner was lodged in the Round-house, we went to see the gentleman home; when we came to Mr. Gibson's door, Mrs. Gibson said she had lost some silver spoons, and her husband's silver buckles; the gentleman desired me to search, to see if he had dropt any thing as he ran along; I went, and found the silver shoe-buckles and a silver tablespoon in Burleigh-street, and delivered them to Mr. Gibson (produced and deposed to.)</p>

They had broke a square of glass in the window, which looks to the counter; I had left my candle burning just opposite the glass which was broke; I missed five pair of fine cotton and worsted stockings, and nine pair of worsted, and a five yard worsted piece; they were lying within a quarter of a yard of the pane that was broken; we went in pursuit of the men that had been seen at the window; my neighbour said he should know one of them from five hundred, but could not meet with them. I got bills and delivered them to the pawnbrokers; I found one pair of stockings pledged in Catharine-street, at Mr. Styles's; he said he knew the woman that pledged them very well: she was soon taken; she said she had them of Donnoly.

            . I sell fish and oysters. Last Friday night between seven and eight, I was going through Covent-garden, I saw the prisoner taking stockings of a woman; he had but half a crown, and that all of a piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was this in Covent-garden?</p>
               <p>Pearson. This was under the piazzas.</p>
               <p>Q. On which side?</p>
               <p>Pearson. On the right hand side near the playhouse door.</p>
               <p>Q. How near?</p>
               <p>Pearson. Within two doors of the play-house gate.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Donnoly?</p>
               <p>Pearson. I have known him in St. George's Hospital; I was there for a sore leg, and I left him there when I came away.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is this ago?</p>
               <p>Pearson. He was there about three weeks before I came out, and I came out seven weeks ago today.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he buy the stockings?</p>
               <p>Pearson. The woman asked him 3 s. 6 d. for them. A man was going by, he happened to know him; he asked him to lend him a shilling, which he did; he bought and paid for them, and I gave him a pot of beer at the corner house, as we came out from under the piazzas to Russel-street.</p>

             I am a soldier in the first regiment; I have known Donnoly/ 15 months; I lent him a shilling on Friday or Saturday night to bay a pair of stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Wadsley. This was under the piazzas in Covent-garden.</p>

               <p>Wadsley. It was just at the bottom of James-street, on the same side the play house is on, at a bagnio door.</p>
               <p>Q. What person did he buy them of?</p>
               <p>Wadsley. He bought them of a woman, she took them out of a bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be there?</p>
               <p>Wadsley. I met him by chance.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he give for the stockings?</p>
               <p>Wadsley. He gave 3 s. 6 d. for them, he paid her a half crown, and the shilling I lent him.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Wadsley. This was about eight o'clock, within a quarter of an hour over or under.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour were they?</p>
               <p>Wadsley. They were whitish.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink with him afterwards?</p>
               <p>Wadsley/. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he alone?</p>
               <p>Wadsley. There was another man along with him, but I did not know him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Wadsley. I have known him about 15 months; he used to work at the new buildings.</p>
               <p>Q. How has he been employed lately?</p>
               <p>Wadsley. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. to prisoner. Can you give the jury a reason why you pawned them so soon after you bought them?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had no money, and I did not know what to do; I thought they were cheap or I had not bought them.</p>
               <p>Webb's defence.</p>
               <p>I was drunk, and I bought some stockings of a young man last Saturday morning; I gave 16 s. for fourteen pair; I had but 2 s. left, and I owed my landlady some money, and I pawned them to raise my rent.</p>
               <p>Taylor's defence.</p>
               <p>Webb is my master; he said he had broke into a little of his landlady's rent, and he sent me to pawn these stockings; we went to the gentleman; he said, how came you by them; Webb said he bought them of a pedlar; Powell said they were bought where we sell oyners, by the Black Horse; then the gentleman said, bring the man to give you a character and I'll buy them.</p>
               <p>Powell's defence.</p>
               <p>Webb called for some purl; we drank it; he bid us both come home; he said he had broke into his rent, and desired us to pawn the stockings to make up his rent, and the stockings were stopped; when he went in at the pawnbroker's, we went out; I pawned one pair at Mr. Bland's for 1 s. and gave him the money.</p>
               <p>Taylor. Webb pawned two pair at one place in a strange name, and a young body pawned two or three pair for him; he said he had bought 14 pair for 16 s. of a pedlar.</p>

             brought a gown and petticoat on the 6th of September, two aprons on the 8th, and two petticoats on the 10th, and pledged them with me; she is said to be wife to Siseland the prisoner; I never saw the prisoners before they were taken up. After this, Siseland the prisoner came to my shop along with the constable, and enquired for these goods, and we brought them down; he said they were pledged at different times, but could not tell what they lay for, but guessed within a little; he was right as to the gown and petticoat for 17 s.</p>

            , giving an account that they had got the two coachmen that had robbed the girl of her box; Sir Richard desired me to go up and bring them there; I went, and brought both the prisoners to Guildhall; there Siseland made a very free confession, and said he was concerned with the other prisoner in taking the box and opening it, and taking the things, and where they were; I found some at this last witness's house, some in Wardour street, some in Knave's-acre; he said his wife pawned most of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What said Barrill?</p>
               <p>Pain. He said but very little; I asked him while he was in the lodge at New Prison about them; he told me he had pawned one himself at a pawnbroker's in Wardour-street; I had Siseland and he handcuffed, and took them in a coach there, and there I found the gown as he had said; the pawnbroker let me have it very readily: his name was Hanse.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose name was it pledged?</p>
               <p>Pain. It was pledged in the name of Barrill, for I think 6 s. (produced and deposed to by the prosecutrix) I found a bundle at a workhouse by Berkeley-square, by the prisoner Siseland's direction, there were a great many of them; I found another gown at another pawnbroker's at Knave's-acre, by the information of Siseland, (all produced and deposed to by prosecutrix) there was a gown the prosecutrix described, which I heard Barrill own he had flung away.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I have got most of my things again.</p>
               <p>Barrill's defence.</p>
               <p>I was going home with my coach; just at the farther end of Great Russel-street, I saw something lying in the street; I got down to see what it was and found it to be a box; I took and put it into my coach and left it at Sifeland's house, and asked him if he would let his wife carry some of the things to pawn, accordingly she did.</p>
               <p>Siseland's defence.</p>
               <p>This man came and told me he had found a box and desired leave to leave it in my room, and I gave him liberty: I am a coachman also; I was then just come out of the workhouse, I had been sick.</p>

               <p>Five weeks before the last sessions I bought half a peck of beans of Shock-a-Tory; I was asked who I bought them of, I told them; they said, you know he makes short measure: as I was going along they came and took hold of me, and pulled me by the cloak, and gave me such a black eye, the swelling fell down just like a lump of blood; I was taken to Westminster, then brought down here to Newgate; they broke my door open, and here is the key of my room; they left me nothing in the room but my bare bedstead; I sent a penny-post letter for a woman to come, I sent her for some things to shift me; she told me all was gone but my poor bedstead; then I heard my gown was in pawn, and the woman that pawned it was gone a hopping; then I heard it was hanging up in Broad St. Giles's to be sold; I was frighted when the people and Shock-a-Tory dragged me about, as bad as I should be at a man with a naked sword; I got into a place where was no thorough-fare, and was just coming out in the mouths of all my enemies when they seized me; I never saw an inch of the things till they brought them before the Justice.</p>

No, said she; I said, Did not my maid bring you some silver here to change for a guinea? she answered, Your maid brought a guinea, part in silver, with her master's compliments, thinking I wanted silver; I said, Should you know the guinea again; she said, she believed she could; I laid the guinea down; she and her husband said they believed it was the same; Mrs. Robinson went with me to my house; when the prisoner saw her, she put her apron before her face, I said, Are not you a vilegirl; have I not told you, when you wanted money, to apply to Mr. Middleton; she went down into the cellar and brought up 2 l. 18 s. 3 d. and laid it on the dresser; then there wanted 8 s. 11 d. said I, there is a ring missing, if you will give me an account of that, I'll do all in my power to get you a flight punishment; she would not own to any thing about it; then I sent for a watchman, and she was taken to the watch-house; I took her afterwards to the Alderman, and she was committed.

He sent me out often with guineas; may be in one day, to get two half guineas, and when I had got them, in about an hour after he would send me out with them to get quarter guineas; I thought there was something not right; I bored a hole through the wainscot,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176610220020"/> through which I saw him, as near as I can guess, but cannot be positive, with a guinea in his hand, I cannot directly tell the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean you are not positive as to the piece of money?</p>
               <p>Garner. I could not tell what it was; it looked like gold, about the size of a guinea; I saw him hold it in his fingers, and use the file to it; I looked through this hole two or three times, and always saw something of the same sort going on, as near as I can guess they were guineas; they were gold, but what pieces I cannot tell: I can speak to looking through this hole four times; he shut the door, and the key was on the outside.</p>
               <p>Q. When he gave you guineas, or half guineas to change, did you make any observations on them?</p>
               <p>Garner. I cannot say I did; the people have sent me back with them not being weight.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you apply to on this affair?</p>
               <p>Garner. I applied to my father, and I believe he went to the solicitor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever take notice of any other pieces of money, that was of any other shape than that of a guinea?</p>
               <p>Garner. There might be some less, I cannot say to that</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever sent out with any other money besides guineas and half guineas?</p>
               <p>Garner. I have with five and threepenny pieces; I have seen him file money, it was bigger than quarter guineas; I am sure it was money.</p>
               <p>Q. What leads you to believe that?</p>
               <p>Garner. Because he used to send me out so to change money; I have minded sometimes I have been sent back with one of the half guineas, to get two five and threepenny pieces.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was the place where he worked from the hole you made?</p>
               <p>Garner. About two yards and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you near enough to see any sort of impression?</p>
               <p>Garner. I was not.</p>
               <p>Council. Then you suppose it was money from the size, and the circumstance of being sent out to change money?</p>
               <p>Garner. That is all I speak from.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do any thing to the guinea you saw in the skin?</p>
               <p>Garner. No, nothing at all as I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any filings in the skin at that time?</p>
               <p>Garner. I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any gold besides the guinea there?</p>
               <p>Garner. No, none at all; there were silver filings, no silver money.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he working any pieces of silver?</p>
               <p>Garner. There were pieces of silver lying near him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use this skin in his trade?</p>
               <p>Garner. Yes, to catch the filings.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the filings do not remain in a file till they are brushed out?</p>
               <p>Garner. They do.</p>

            . I am an officer; I apprehended the prisoner the 30th of August, Mr. Nash was with me; we were called up stairs; he was locked into a garret where they worked; we went in suddenly upon him, he heard the noise, and was standing up when we went into the room; we looked about, but did not observe any thing at first; my partner searched him, and found three guineas and a half in his pocket; and in the mean time the prisoner took a guinea out of his pocket, and laid it upon a block where a cloth lay hollow, he seemed to lay it under the hollow part of the cloth, but I saw it between his fingers and thumb before he laid it down; the other three guineas and a half were found in the other waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Had that guinea he put under the cloth any particular marks upon it?</p>
               <p>Rothwell. It had been just fresh filed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it filed all round?</p>
               <p>Rothwell. No, there was but about two thirds of it filed; (the guinea produced) I saw several files, one of which had gold in the teeth, that lay on the bench directly over the skin, near the filing place; the other files lay near to the same place.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any filings in this skin or apron?</p>
               <p>Rothwell. I took out the filings and put them in a paper, and brought them away, and delivered them to the master of the Assay-office at the Mint; I have part of the filings that were left, which the gentleman did not take of me; (produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any gold work in the shop?</p>
               <p>Rothwell. We could not find any, and we searched very narrowly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask the prisoner whether he had any gold work about?</p>
               <p>Rothwell. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any books in his custody?</p>
               <p>Rothwell. Yes; the next witness will give an account of that.</p>

               <p>I WAS employed with Mr. Rothwell in making this search; we had a warrant against the prisoner, it was some time before we could execute it; when we came into the room, he was very much confused, and stood up; I searched his breeches pocket, and found some silver, but no gold; in his waistcoat pocket I found two guineas and two half guineas; while I was searching his waistcoat pocket, my partner saw something pass, I cannot say I did; I saw some dust in the skin, that looked like gold.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it two guineas and two half guineas, or three guineas.</p>
               <p>Nash. My partner made a mistake, there were two whole guineas and two half guineas; as to the other guinea, I saw it on the block. I did not see it put there, it was designed, I believe, to be concealed; I took all the books I could find, and brought them to Mr. Chamberlaine; we found no gold-work, notwithstanding we searched.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chamberlaine. I received these books of Nash the officer, they are in the same condition I received them (produced in court.)</p>

            . I am assay-master.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the proper weight a guinea should weigh?</p>
               <p>Lucas. A guinea should weigh 5 penny-weights, 9 grains, and very near a half. In the book, against a guinea, is put 5 pennyweights, 4 grains, that is, 5 grains and a half lighter; so that 5 grains and a half must be taken off to bring them down to that weight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever weigh this guinea here produced?</p>
               <p>Lucas. It weighs 4 pennyweights, 21 grains, and a half, that is, about 11 grains and a half under the true weight.</p>
               <p>Q. How much is that guinea worth?</p>
               <p>Lucas. About 20 pence short of the real value.</p>
               <p>Q. There were some filings found by the man, part of which he delivered to you, and the other part are now produced in court, Did you ever weigh these filings?</p>
               <p>Lucas. The whole filings weighed about 10 grains.</p>
               <p>Q. How much does that guinea and the filings weigh?</p>
               <p>Lucas. It is within a grain and a half of the true weight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you try the filings?</p>
               <p>Lucas. I tried a part, which I found worse than the standard, about a ninetieth part below the standard.</p>
               <p>Q. I should be glad to know, whether by sweeping the filings from the skin, a small particle of other metal might not get among it?</p>
               <p>Lucas. A small particle of another matter might cause it.</p>
               <p>Q. What coin is this guinea?</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I acknowledge the files, that they had gold sticking in them; I have files for gold, and files for silver; when I work in gold, I use gold files, and let them lie till I work in gold again; as for the guinea, I believe I can prove where I took it; I always have gold and silver in my shop; I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176610220023"/> two shops, which are always open for any body to come in, the keys are on the outside.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner.</p>
               <p>- Goadby. I live at Lambeth, and am a grocer; the prisoner received 3 guineas of me the day before he was taken up, for a watch which I bought of him; one of the guineas he scrupled, on account of its being a light one; I agreed to take it back again, provided he did not get it off; how I came by it I do not know; whether this is the guinea in dispute I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing remarkable in that guinea?</p>
               <p>Goadby. Yes, it rather looked smaller, some part smooth, some rough, it had a very remarkable look.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it look as if part of it had been taken away?</p>
               <p>Goadby. It did; I thought it was rather too light, and he proved it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a new guinea or an old one?</p>
               <p>Goadby. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing particular in the appearance of it?</p>
               <p>Goadby. The edges were in some places smooth, in others rough; I do not know how it came so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dirty, as many are?</p>
               <p>Goadby. No, it was a bright guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any part particularly bright?</p>
               <p>Goadby. Yes, it looked as if it had not been in common use.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take it in your hand, or observe any thing particular in the feel of it?</p>
               <p>Goadby. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever deal with the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Goadby. Yes, we have had dealings.</p>
               <p>Q. He has had guineas of you before, I suppose?</p>
               <p>Goadby. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever object to your money, or you to his?</p>
               <p>Goadby. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. What has he dealt with you in?</p>
               <p>Goadby. In tea, and other articles in the grocery way; I have received of him to the amount of 14 and 15 shillings at a time.</p>
               <p>- Blaney. I went into the prisoner's workshop, and looked through the hole to see if I could see what a person was doing of as he sat at the board; I went again last Saturday, and sat in the same position a person would that was to work. I have known the prisoner about 8 years, I always looked upon him to be a very honest man, and one that lived in credit.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell the meaning of these words in the book, May 25, began gaming.</p>
               <p>Blaney. No, I do not.</p>

            . I went into the prisoner's workshop, and looked through the hole, to see Mr. Blaney sitting at work on the prisoner's seat; I looked as nigh as I could into every place, there was no such thing as seeing what he was filing, he sat about 2 yards from the hole, he sat with his back to the hole; we were let into the room afterwards, and stood within a foot of him; if he sat sideways, I could not see what he was filing of; I have known him four or five years; I believe he has pretty good business; I never heard any thing of him but a good character.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look through all the holes?</p>
               <p>Buckley. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you discover whether he was filing a tankard, or a thing the size of a guinea?</p>
               <p>Buckley. Not if he sat sideways, I could not see his hand nor his apron.</p>

I am a taylor; my master was to pay me there that night; when he went to Mr. Baxter for change, Mr. Baxter said he could not do it; then he suspected he had a thief in the house; the prisoner call'd for the paper, and was reading it I believe an hour and an half; when the people went from the table he was at, he turned round and laid the paper over the tankard, and looking afterwards, I found the tankard was gone; I went to Mr. Baxter at the door, and said, the man has stole your tankard; he said he knew that; the prisoner came past me into the yard; I collared him and said, You have got a tankard of Mr. Baxter's; he said, I have not, how can you charge a gentleman so; search me; then Mr. Baxter took him by the collar, and I felt and found the tankard hanging behind him; there was a handkerchief put through the handle; I laid hold of that and pulled it from him; (produced and deposed to.)</p>

               <p>I was drinking in that house; there were a great many people in the room; Mr. Baxter gave them a gallon of beer to watch me while I was there, to see if I took away this tankard; I took it to carry it to the bar, and Mr. Baxter took hold of one arm, and that man the other, and the tankard dropped down. I was brought up with my uncle, a woodmonger, in Scotland, and am waiting for a place under the government.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. What, tried for horse stealing, for stealing a mare, how is that?</p>
               <p>Court. Prisoner behave decently; consider you are trying for your life.</p>
               <p>Ashley. About half an hour after nine that night, I went to fodder up my cattle, the prisoner was in the yard; he came running to me with a fork, as if he intended to run it through me, and asked me what I wanted there; I said, I would let him know, and desired him to let me have the fork to serve up my cattle; he delivered it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Ashley. He is quite a stranger to me. The mare was in this yard; the yard is about one hundred yards from my house; after this he began to beg for mercy, for fear I should hurt him; I said, I had no ill against him; then he begged leave to lie down there; I gave him leave. I went home to bed; the landlord at a public house near me, was alarmed by his bitch; he seeing the prisoner on my mare in the road, called out at the window to me; two young men that are here, and my wife and I, ran out and took him on the mare.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the prisoner behave upon that?</p>
               <p>Ashley. He behaved foolish, as I thought.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in liquor?</p>
               <p>Ashley. No, he was rather foolish.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think he was in his senses?</p>
               <p>Ashley. Sometimes we thought he was, and sometimes not; we could not tell what to make of him; we took him before Sir

            ; Sir John asked him what he was; he answered, What am I, why a man. The Justice said, that was not what he asked him; he said what countryman are you; he said he was a man of Kent: the Justice asked him where he lay; he said, where some hogs and cows, and where the mare was; he asked him what he was going to do with the mare; he said, d - n the mare, she was not worth two pence. (Indeed she was just come off a journey from Leighton-Buzzard in Bedfordshire, and was very tired.)</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner a bridle or saddle?</p>
               <p>Ashley. He had, and a halter too; I had left them in a shed in the yard.</p>
               <p>- Dickenson. I was one that went to the prisoner when he was upon the mare; I asked him where he was going; he said, about four miles into the country to his farm; he had a pitchfork in his hand; I said, what are you going to do with that; he said he was going a haymaking; I said, where did you get this mare; he said out of a wood; I said, who does she belong to; he said, to his master; I asked him who was his master; he said, himself; the constable ordered me to search him; I found his pockets loaded with brickbats, and pieces of tiles, and glass, and the like.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he going away with the mare?</p>
               <p>Dickinson. The prosecutor's wife went up to him first; when I came to him he was on the mare, standing still on the road.</p>

               <p>They make a very long story of it, in telling a pack of lies; now they have told their story, it is time to tell mine: I was tired upon the road, and had no money, and destitute of lodging, I came by the house - there was no house: I saw a hay-stack or two; I went into the yard, and saw two horses, and two cows; thinks I, I must lie down somewhere; I saw a post-chaise coming by; I thought there was something more than ordinary; I thought something was coming over the wall; I took hold of a fork, and put up some straw; and got in among the hogs; I did not quite like that; then I got upon one of the horses, and rode backwards and forwards; I thought if any body came to hurt me, I would run the fork in them; some body called out at a window; there came five or six of them, and got hold of the bridle, and stopped me; I told them I was a centinel; I thought I would ride as well as sleep, but d - n the mare, she would not go when I wanted her to go; I wish I had never seen her; she was not worth a farthing; I could not see any body to ask leave; I have been a soldier; I lost my right-hand where general Wolfe was killed; I am an out-pensioner at Chelsea, and have been going on these seven years.</p>

            . I keep a house in Chancery-lane, and receive letters for the General Post-office; I remember being in the shop on the 14th of June last; the prisoner was at work in the shop that evening, and on the 15th, being Sunday, he went out, and returned the Monday se'nnight following, being the 23d; I received a letter from Newport-Pagnel, on Friday the 20th, that he was there; I went and found him; he had bought cloth for a suit of cloaths, a watch, and a pair of sleeve buttons, and changed the bank note for 25 l. to pay for them, and he had ten guineas about him; I confined him as a run-away apprentice, and brought him to town. On the 3d of July, being Thursday, Mr. Eversdale came to enquire about this letter with the notes; I shewed him the advertisement which I had put in the papers and shewed him the prisoner; the prisoner said he found the note of 25 l. when Mr. Eversdale said he must go to the Post-office; then as we were going out of the shop, the prisoner desired him to come back and he would tell the truth; then he confessed he took the two notes out of a double post letter, which was put in in my shop, and at the Post-office he confessed the same.</p>
               <p>Mr. Potts. I am secretary to the Post-office; the prisoner was brought to the office, charged with taking two notes out of a letter, put in at Mr. Eaton's; he confessed he took them both out of a letter; Mr. Eaton and Mr. Eversdale were by at the time; he said one was 25 l. and the other 10 l. the 25 l. he had changed, and the other he had.</p>

I having an opportunity of being very near her, I found her breath smelt as if she had been drinking; as soon as she was gone out of the warehouse, I said I don't like this girl, I don't believe she came from the people; I bid a servant take his hat and follow her; then Edward Ewer said, if I pleased he would go, and he went, and is here to give an account of what passed.</p>
