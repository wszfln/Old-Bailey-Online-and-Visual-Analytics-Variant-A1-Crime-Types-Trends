At the time in question I was staying with my father at Blackheath—I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper referring to some horses—I will not be quite certain as to the date—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the Times newspaper</hi>)—it was an adver<lb/>tisement to this effect—I had occasion to buy smile horses at that time, and on seeing the advertisement, I went to Gloucester-mews, Montague-square—I was there shown two horses and a mare by the younger prisoner, George Ward—on going into the stable, I inquired of the younger prisoner, before the elder came in, whether the two horses and mare then in the stable were the horses advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper, which I produced—he said they were, that he had the care of the horses, and that they belonged to a third party, who had sent them for sale on commission to the elder prisoner, stating his name to be Mr. Ward—from about twenty minutes to half an hour after, the elder prisoner came into the stable—I inquired about the horses, and the elder prisoner told me they were sent to him by a family of the name of Lloyd, that he had long known that family, that they lived near Stratford-upon-Avon, and that on the decease of the elder member of that family, these horses had been sent for sale, as they wished to have ponies instead—it had been stated by one and both of them that the two smaller horses had been driven together, and that the larger horse had been driven in a clarence, or brougham—at the time I was having this conversation with the elder prisoner, the younger one was in the stable, and within hearing—I agreed to purchase the three horses for 115<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—gave a check on Messrs. Glynn and Co. for that amount—this is the check—at the time I gave that check I had cash to that amount in the hands of Messrs. Glynn—it has been returned to me as paid—I received this receipt at the time—this was either a little before or after twelve o'clock in the morning, but I was there a considerable time talking about the horses, and seeing them out—I left about two—the elder prisoner handed me the receipt, not in the presence of the other—there was a small counting-house attached to the stables, in which he delivered it to me—I should say the terms of the receipt</p>

               <p>were not arranged in the presence of both the prisoners—I should say I was addressing the elder prisoner only—the terms were arranged entirely with the elder prisoner—I do not know that the younger prisoner heard what the horses were to be sold for, but he told me that 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been offered for the larger horse, and he thought something about that price would be taken—that was at some period before the sale took place, and I rather think it was before the elder prisoner came into the stable—(<hi rend="italic">Receipt read</hi>, "Received, July 9, 1844, of William Angerstein, Esq., 110 guineas, for two bay geldings, and a bay mare; all warranted sound, quiet to ride, and quiet in double or single harness, and if not approved of at the expiration of seven days, the whole or either to be returned, and the money refunded,—<hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE HENRY WARD</hi>.")—there being three horses, and having my servant with me, who was riding behind me, I was obliged to get somebody to help my servant in taking them up to the Veterinary College, and I employed the younger prisoner to do that—my servant took the horses to the Veterinary College, in company with the younger prisoner—before that he told me his name was George Glass—he also stated that as the horses were sold he should lose his situation, and I agreed to take him to assist my servant in taking the horses down to Blackheath, and I also said he should remain in my stable till I could get a permanent helper—he acquiesced in the arrange<lb/>ment of going down to Blackheath, but he said he could not stay, because, a relation of his had died at Doncaster, and had left him money which he must look after—I got a report from the Veterinary College, I should say between four and five o'clock, and in consequence of that report I told my servant to take the horses from the college, to take them back to the stables from whence they came, and leave them there, and I gave him a letter at the same time—next morning, about eleven o'clock, I went with my solicitor to the stables—neither of the prisoners were there—I cannot tell whether the horses were there—the stables were locked—this was on the 10th of July—on the 26th of Aug. I was taken by the police to a mews near Fitzroy-square, to identify the horses—they were all there—the prisoners were then in custody.</p>

On Saturday, the 6th of July, the prosecutor was admitted into the hospital as an in-door patient—I examined the wound—it was just on the right of the spine, and immediately above the loin—I probed it, and found a resisting body, but it was impossible at the time to say whether it was bone or the bullet—from time to time I endeavoured to find what the hard substance was; and ultimately I found it, on the 16th of Aug.—I first ex<lb/>tracted a small piece of bone, and then a bullet, which I produce; a piece of cloth with a seam in it also came away—it appeared like the cloth of a coat—the prosecutor remained under my care a considerable time—he went out on the 24th of Aug., and was re-admitted—he is now labouring severely under the effect of the wound—at first we considered the wound dangerous, and even now, with portions of the bone coming away, we do not consider him out of ultimate danger—he is out of immediate danger—he is not very likely to be fit for active business again.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner is my brother. He will be twenty-three years of age next Nov.—he is the third and youngest son of the late Lord Audley, who died on the 14th of January, 1837—shortly before his death a very protracted litigation commenced respecting his property, which has gone on ever since—it has practically been adverse to our family, and has left us in very embarrassed circumstances in point of pecuniary mat<lb/>ters—I consider that the prisoner has from his youth been very sensitive and reserved generally—I remember the loss of an associate of his, of the name of Weston—he was about sixteen then—Weston died at sea; his death seemed to make a very great impression on the mind of my brother, I think stronger than on persons generally under such circumstances—he was not educated for any profession—he became from time to time acquainted with the embarrassed situation of the family—those circumstances seemed to make a very great im<lb/>pression on his mind, and I think it depressed his mind to notice things which persons generally would not—we were not a very great deal together during the year 1842—we saw each other oftener than we had done some time pre<lb/>vious—I was in Ireland in the latter end of 1842—I had gone over in March, 1842, and, I believe, a third time—I was a good deal backwards and forwards—he was in Ireland at that time, and I saw him frequently, particularly to<lb/>wards the latter part of the year we were more together—he left Ireland, to come to London, in Jan., 1843, leaving me in Ireland—I did not see him during the whole of the year 1843, after he left in Jan.—I did not see him till last April, when I came over to England; and from that time down to this</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184410210018"/>
               <p>unfortunate occurrence we were living together constantly in the same apart<lb/>ments—as he became acquainted with the circumstances of difficulty in the family, he made them the subject of observation to me, and I thought he took a very depressed view of things; he showed great depression of spirits, more so than perhaps I felt myself; and I attribute this view entirely to the circumstances in which we were placed acting on his pecu<lb/>liar temperament—I have sat with him in the same room for many hours together—on those occasions he was very reserved; occasionally he would be not so much so, but rather cheerful—generally speaking he was very reserved—during the time I have been living with him, from April down to last July, he has very seldom spoken to me—when we have been sitting together in the same room, he has been doing nothing but sitting in a pensive manner—when I addressed him he very seldom did more than answer, "Yes" or "No," and sometimes he would not answer me at all—he generally seemed to avoid conversation—when he sat in this way without speaking I have ob<lb/>served that the expression of his countenance would sometimes alter, but generally it was a very settled expression of countenance—I remarked his countenance particularly, because I did not consider at that time that his bodily health was good—generally speaking, when he was sitting in this pen<lb/>sive way, his look was downcast—sometimes he had, I thought, a very fixed, severe expression, very great austerity of countenance, and sometimes rather the reverse—these changes were not produced by conversation but by what was passing in his own mind—his eyes were very suffused at times, he had a very dreamy expression of countenance, very melancholy and dejected—he was very sensitive of public observation, and complained that he was constantly the subject of observation—the house we lived in was in a street with houses fac<lb/>ing us—he said he thought the people in the houses opposite watched him, or us rather—I remember on one particular occasion his stating that they were then watching us—I did not consider that that was the fact—I was near the window at the time, but not before the window—I was between two windows—I think I was rather nearer the window than he was, and on his mentioning that there were people watching, I looked, and saw no one—I think the neighbours might have watched, just as neighbours will do, but I do not think we were the subject of any particular observation—I do not consider we were watched by them—he was not in the habit of dining at an eating-house while he was with me—we generally dined at home, except on Sunday—lie did not dine at any one particular place when he dined out—he was in the habit of frequenting certain places—mostly two, I believe—he said he was known by the people there, that they made observations respecting him—that struck me as very improbable at the time, and I went afterwards to take means to satisfy my<lb/>self of the fact—I found no foundation for it—they did not know him—he did not show any disinclination to go out into the public streets, but he had a great disinclination to be observed in the neighbourhood—the first thing that struck me when he walked in the streets was the heedless manner in which lie walked along—his head was generally raised—he appeared to be looking up and not heeding the passers-by—he seemed to feel his way by my shoulder, so much so that it was rather a subject of annoyance to me—he did not make way for people he met in the street—he walked with his face, generally speaking, upwards—although he walked generally wherever I chose to take him, he would show hesitation to go in particular directions—he would yield to me, but would rather that I would not go that way—he gave no reason for that except that he evidently did not like to go that way—I think it was in the direction of High-street that he disliked—when we used to take a walk we generally walked in the Park, or Regent-street, and sometimes I would go to Hyde-park—the nearest way was by High-street,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184410210019"/>
               <p>Marylebone—he appeared always to evince a disinclination to go by that particular way—I know no reason for that except that it was a more public direction, and he was very sensitive of observation by anybody—he did not wish that I should stop for a moment to look at anything, and objected pass<lb/>ing any shops—he was very restless, indeed, very impatient if I stopped to look into any shops—he would not look in himself, he would stand with his face down on the pavement, evidently wishing I should leave as soon as pos<lb/>sible—I thought he did not like anybody to come into the room suddenly—he did not appear to wish any one—he was very reserved—I could not exactly understand what his feeling was, but he did not like anything to disturb him—my mother was a daughter of Sir Ross Donelly—Sir Ross Donelly became insane before his death—I know the fact of my own knowledge—it did not occur so long ago—I am aware that there were proceedings taken by Admiral Sir Ross Donelly's family, and the result of the commission of lunacy which was issued was, that he was not of sound mind—he was a very old man—my brother often alluded to this circumstance when he was speaking to me in these times of depression—he alluded to it during the time that I was so much in England, 1841 and 1842—he was left very much alone, in 1841 particularly, and I have no doubt that at that time, from the observations he made to me, when I saw him after a long interval, his mind then first began to suffer, and in order to divert his attention from his affairs he said he used to walk about Dublin, and at those times he very often went into Mr. Sharp's literary rooms, there looking over books, and I have every reason to believe, from what he stated, he found matters there which fixed his attention and caused him to make them matters of reflection—he said he was very much annoyed indeed in taking up an old publication to see some allusion to an ancestor of his, a member of his family, and he expressed himself to the effect that he con-sidered he had unfortunate blood in his veins, and that there was unfortunate blood in the family—he spoke it generally—my impression is that he com<lb/>municated to me to the effect that he felt it himself—he said he considered there was unfortunate blood in the family, and that he sometimes felt it himself—he has several times complained of pains in the head, a long time back—he first complained of head-ache on the last occasion of my coming over to Eng<lb/>land—observing that his health appeared to be not good, I questioned him on the subject, and he stated to me that it was not very good—I said I hoped his last visit to England and seeing his family would have improved his health—he replied that was not the case, for nearly the last year, in fact ever since he came over, he was getting worse, particularly for the last four months—he said he had a constant noise in his head—he has occasionally complained of giddiness—he said that he passed many sleepless nights, and complained very much of his head, and of agony of mind at night—he said he could not turn his attention to anything apart from the subject of our affairs—I advised him to consult a physician—seeing that this feeling was increasing latterly, I spoke to him rather strongly—he seemed indifferent about it—he said to me one day, with I thought a peculiar air, that these things might go on sometimes too long—since this unfortunate event I have looked into a box of his which was at the same lodging where we lived together—it was locked up—I found in it a tin letter-box, and on opening that I found a bottle containing a few drops of laudanum, also a bottle nearly full of acetate of morphia, and a small paper containing a few grains, marked "A few grains of acetate of morphia "—it was not very long before this event that I spoke to him on the subject of con<lb/>sulting sulting a physician—I do not think he did consult any physician, but I pre<lb/>vaded on him to have a little prescription made up, which I furnished him with—from what he stated I believe he did have it made up, and took</p>

               <p>some of it—it appeared to me that his health was declining down to the day on which this occurred—I saw him on the morning this happened—he left home between eleven and twelve o'clock—he did not tell me for what purpose he was going out—I thought he might be going to my agents—I consider that he was formerly neat in his dress, and cleanly in his person—I have noticed an alteration in that respect latterly—he became indifferent—sometimes he did not shave, and allowed his hair to grow.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband keeps an upholsterer's shop, in Weymouth-street, Portland-place. The prisoner lodged at my house from January, 1843, till the 6th of July, when he was taken on this charge—he occupied two rooms on the second floor—Lord Audley came on a visit to him about four months since—I think it was in April—he had a bed-room in my house—he sat in the same sitting-room with his brother—the prisoner was a very regular, quiet person—I have thought that he looked very ill lately—he used to complain of a sensation of boiling on the top of the head—he appeared very much disconcerted if any persons came where he was—he appeared to desire to keep by himself—his demeanor was very unhappy, very gloomy—I have noticed that, I think, since Christmas last—I noticed it since the latter end of last year—this unhappiness appeared to increase very much since then—the week before he was apprehended he appeared to be worse—his habits were orig<lb/>inally inally very cleanly—he was in the habit of changing his linen as other gentle<lb/>men would do, and on this very week, which ended on the 6th of July, he never changed it all the whole week—he used to ask me if there was any<lb/>thing very gloomy in the morning, for he could not read—he was obliged to get up from his book and walk the room—he wanted to know if there was anything miserable in the morning, for it seemed to have a great effect—I told him I thought his stomach was out of order—he was a gentleman of particu<lb/>larly gentle and mild habits—he used to sit in the elbow chair, in a very strange way—he would sit himself down, and put his hand on the right elbow, put his head on his hand, and watch me about the room when I went in to him—I noticed latterly that he paid so little attention to himself, that he did not take his dressing-gown off the chair—I thought he was very uncomfort<lb/>able, and he paid no attention to himself—I have observed him sit in that manner repeatedly when I have been in the room, very much so latterly—he</p>

                  </hi>, M. D. I reside in Harley-street. I was called on by Lord Audley, on the 8th of July last, two days after this occurred, and visited the prisoner in Clerkenwell prison on that day—I saw him ten or twelve times in the course of July, and I have seen him since occasionally, in Newgate—I saw him yesterday—Dr. Warburton accompanied me, I think, on about five occasions, about three to Clerkenwell, and two latterly, to Newgate—I have had considerable experience in the treatment of persons of unsound mind—it has been my constant profession for more than thirty years—when I first saw the prisoner I was aware that he was the grandson of Sir Ross Donelly—I had attended Sir Ross Donelly for several weeks at his house in Harley-street, and gave evidence at the commission of lunacy which took place shortly after that, about five years ago—at that time Sir Ross Donelly was certainly in an unsound state of mind, not merely the result of old age and imbecility, but labouring under delusions—he was found of unsound mind by the Jury—I have every reason to believe that he remained so to his death—his affairs were in Chancery ever afterwards—I have heard the evi<lb/>dence of Lord Audley, Mrs. Lawledge, and her son, to-day, and have had submitted to me an account of the prisoner for some time past—I have made minute inquiry as to his whole history to enable me the better to ascertain the state of his mind on examining him—I first saw him on the 8th of July, at Clerkenwell—I was with him I think nearly an hour on that occasion—I–saw</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184410210022"/>
               <p>him in a small cell on the first occasion, and so I did on the second oc<lb/>casion, and I have seen him in the infirmary, and sometimes in the court-yard of the infirmary—from my examination of him on the 8th of July, I had no doubt in my own mind that he was of unsound mind—he told me that his sole object in this transaction was to get hanged, that he had no knowledge of Mr. Smith, and did not even know his name—he also told me that he had been brooding over suicide for years, that he had purchased laudanum at Savory and Moore's, in Regent—street, that he had purchased morphia at Dinneford's, in Bond-street, that he had taken on one occasion, about a week before this transaction occurred, about an ounce of laudanum, without any fatal effect; and he had also taken some small quantity of the morphia—he told me that he had no occupation, no friends, no companions, that he had been brooding over melancholy subjects for years, not only on his own family affairs, but every event that happened of a horrible description, occupied his attention, and worried his mind constantly; that he cut out of the papers all the dreadful events that occurred, particularly one that happened at Brighton, where a policeman was killed, I think, and that this event ran in his head for weeks, and it struck him if he were to do the same, he should attain his ob<lb/>ject, which was to get hanged—he told me that he was watched, not only by his own landlord, in Weymouth-street, but by the neighbours; and that the clock in the house kept saying to him all night, for several nights before this occurred, "Don't attempt it, don't attempt it!"—he told me also, on one occasion, especially, that he had the strongest inclination to repeat this thing, and that if he had a pistol at the moment he certainly should shoot anybody that was near him; that he could not trust himself—he told me that he had sought comfort in religion, but he had found none, that he had studied me<lb/>taphysics; that he could find comfort nowhere, that he had been driven to desperation; and in fact, not only in my judgment, to desperation, but to distinct mental derangement—I have not the slightest doubt that his conduct was genuine; his whole history gives the lie to any idea of simulation—he is in a state of downright melancholia, and not to be trusted for five minutes—if he were at liberty to-day, I should expect the same thing to occur—he is enveloped by strong feelings, which he is not able to resist—on one occasion, in Newgate, about a month since, when I saw him in the dining-room of the Governor, he was so extremely bewildered that he could not answer the com<lb/>monest question—if I asked him where he slept, what sort of bed he had, or what he had for dinner, he said he did not know what I meant—I saw him alone in that room—he was sent for from his cell to see me—he was in ex<lb/>treme confusion of mind—he seemed to be much worse on that occasion than I had ever seen him—I think he had that peculiar expression of eye which denoted that his head was affected by physical pain—melancholia is some-times times attended by delusion, and sometimes not—I do not think that this re<lb/>presentation presentation about the clock saying, "Don't attempt it," was a pure substan<lb/>tial delusion—I think that his extreme melancholy induced him to suppose that the clock said that—it proved that he had been brooding over some ter<lb/>rible affair—I believe that he perfectly understands what is going on now—I have no doubt of it, but he is in a state of apathy—lie has no compunction—he has repeatedly stated that he was without any feeling, that he felt quite indifferent, he could not understand how it all was, and he hoped the time might come when he should feel as he ought; but he had no compunction, and no feeling—he appeared to be very indifferent about the consequences—madness is notoriously hereditary—there are intervals in which there may be soundness in one member of a family direct from another member who has been</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184410210023"/>
               <p>unsound, and the subsequent member may be as unsound as the first—that is not at all unusually the case—it is quite in the common order of things.</p>

               <p>eight o'clock on Sunday morning, the 22nd of Sept.—I had never seen him before—the parties who were along with him told me it was George Benson—Dr. Waller was one, and a man named Chalk, who is not here—he was brought by ten or twelve men, and put into the stable—I got two trussels, fixed some boards on it, and saw the body placed on the boards—I went out of the stable, went inside of my bar, and said to the prisoners, who were all standing outside the bar, "This is a dreadful job you have been doing this morning"—they all said yes, it was—some of the prisoners pointed out Jones to me as the man that had been fighting—I asked them what they meant to do about it—one and all of them said, "The best thing we can do, master, is to go to the station-house, and give ourselves up to the police"—Jones said he did not wish to fight, but he had been struck at the Wellesley Arms, on the Saturday night previous, by Benson—I then saw Dr. Waller going from my house to his own residence, and asked him, if he saw a policeman, to send one down, and in about ten minutes Sergeant Coggins came with another constable—he sent for more men—the prisoners said, "You have no occasion to send for any more men, for we will go voluntarily along with you to the police."</p>

                  </hi>. I now work at Kingston. At the time this took place I was working in the brick-fields at Kensington—on Sunday morning, the 22nd of Sept., I was walking over the Lilly Arms bridge, between six and seven o'clock, and saw a few men going towards the Kensington canal-basin—I thought it was a fight, and followed—when I got there I saw two men tucking up their shirt sleeves—I did not know them then—I know them now—it was Jones and the deceased—they went to fighting, and kept on a little while, very near a quarter of an hour, I should think, or it might not have been so long—Jones then hit Benson on the breast, and then under the left ear—Benson then said, "I am done"—he fell on his hands, his arms spread out, and he fell on his face—Jones said to William Benson, "Is there any fear?"—all the prisoners were there—Foreman and Key were sitting on the bank—Hill picked up Jones, and Benson picked his brother up—Fore<lb/>man went and knocked the captain of the barge up to get a drop of water to wash the dead man's face—Jones and two more men ran after the doctor, and they carried the dead man away—I cannot say who carried him away—there were not a great many persons about at the time—there were two or three more than the prisoners—Hill picked up Jones, and Benson his brother, three or four times, whenever they fell—they rested—there were rounds—they rested on Hill and Benson's knees.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On Sunday morning, the 22nd of Sept., between seven and eight o'clock, I saw the body of the deceased, on the spot where he was killed, before it was conveyed to the Warwick Arms—life was perfectly extinct—the body was still warm at the trunk, but getting cold at the extremities—I examined the body, and perceived on the left collar<lb/>bone the mark of a bruise—on the lower lip there was the appearance of a cut, and on the bridge of the nose was the appearance of another severe contusion—behind the left ear there was a wound or cut in the skin, about an inch and a half in length—it is difficult to say what that might have been caused by—it might have been by pulling the ear forcibly forward—there was the ap<lb/>pearance of some blood coming from the inner right ear—those were the only traces of violence that I perceived—on the following day, by order of the Co<lb/>roner, I examined the body—I found no appearance of fracture of the cranium, but on taking off the skull, I perceived, on the right side of the brain, at the upper part, appearances of severe contusion, and a considerable quantity of blood effused in the cavity of the cranium, such as would he caused by the rupture of a blood-vessel—that was, in my opinion, the cause of death—in nine cases out of ten, I should say rupture of a blood-vessel would not be caused by such a blow as I saw under the ear—such a blow, combined with the excitement the man was in at the moment, would be sufficient to account for the rupture, but I should say a man might very frequently receive such a blow as that, unless he was of very weak constitution, as I found afterwards was the case, from my examination—I have no doubt that such a blow might cause the rupture of the blood-vessel, and that that was the cause of his death—apoplexy,</p>

On coming out, he asked us which way we were going home; I said to Seven-dials, as our lodging was closed, as the landlady locks the door at twelve o'clock, and we cannot get in after. He said, "Then you may as well come down to where I live." We went along, and when we came to the corner of this court, he said, "Wait just round the corner, I shan't be long." I said, "Very well;" we waited there, and did not know what he was after till the policeman came and tapped us on the shoulder, and took us to the station; he was a stranger to both of us.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon of Westminster-hospital. Hannah Edwards was admitted there as an in-patient on Monday, the 30th of Sept.—she had a wound on the back part of her head, on the left side—the face and scalp were affected with erysipelas—she died on the following Satur<lb/>day, at five o'clock, of the erysipelas—I think the erysipelas was caused by the wound in the scalp—that is a usual consequence of such a wound—I believe she was an out-patient of the hospital before the 30th.</p>

               <p>about a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes—when I returned, he was sit<lb/>ting by the fireside, eating some cold giblet pie—he called me a b—w—, or a b—, and said I had been out drinking—I said I had not—several words occurred—he asked me for a shilling, which he said I had got, belonging to him—I said I had only got sixpence—I put the sixpence on the table—with that he got up, and hit me on the right side of the head, and then on the left, with his hand—I made towards the other end of the room—he followed, and hit me on the back of the head with his hand, and I fell on my little girl's bed—I got up—a candlestick which he uses in his work was standing on the floor, and I took it up, and said if he hit me again I would mark him—I did not hit him—he took the candlestick out of my hand, and hit me on the top of the head with it—it bled profusely—I turned towards the door and said, "O, do pray let me out"—he said, "No, you shall not go out, for you look like a b—stuck pig, and you shall not go out"—he fastened the door—the room is on the first-floor—I opened the window, and screamed out for assistance—no one came for some time—I lost my recollection—I afterwards saw the room full of people, and have some confused recollection of giving my husband in charge—the blow was given wilfully—I believe I retained the top part of the candlestick in my hand—I did not strike or touch him with it—I lost all re<lb/>collection after he struck me the second time with the candlestick.</p>

On Friday afternoon, the 30th of Aug., there were several ladies and gentlemen at our shop, looking at a very handsome enamelled watch—the prisoner came in, and I went to attend on him—he expressed a wish to see some gold three-quarter-plate lever watches—some were taken from the window, and put on a glass case on the counter—he took up some of them, and asked the price—he said the first lot were too thick, he wished to see some flatter—he said he wished one similar to one purchased by his bro<lb/>ther, Captain Edwards, he believed, of us; that his brother had it stolen from him at the Italian Opera-house—I showed him some watches—my eye was off him while getting him goods—he did not think the second sufficiently flat—I showed him some Geneva watches, which were flatter—he said he did not like Geneva watches—he placed two watches aside, and requested us to keep them till four or half-past four o'clock, when he would see his brother on the subject, and let us know whether he would have one or not—before leaving, he asked if a gold dial could be placed on a Geneva watch—as he was about to leave the shop I proposed to show him the enamelled watch, and said the Queen and Prince Albert had seen it—he declined looking at it, and appeared very much excited, so that he went to open the door at the hinge side instead of the handle, and fumbled some time there—I directed one of our men to open it—he did so—I then went to arrange the watches he had seen, and one was gone which had been on the glass case—nobody but me and the prisoner had been near those watches—I missed it within five minutes of his leaving—no one else had entered the shop, or come near the spot—it is Mr. Stanbridge's house, Mr. Hart has merely the shop—Naphtali Hart is the sole proprietor—I have not the slightest doubt about the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Canal-street, Hoxton, and am a watch-finisher; I work in Mr. Hart's shop. On Friday afternoon, the 30th of Aug., I remem<lb/>ber a person coming there to look at a watch, between three and four o'clock—I have no doubt it was the prisoner—as I sat at work I heard him ask to see some gold watches—some were shown him, which were not sufficiently flat—he requested two to be laid aside till half-past four, when his brother would call and look at them—as he left he went to the hinge side of the door—I was ordered to open it for him, which I did, and let him out—he was very much excited before I opened the door, but not after he got out—I was sent out directly—on my return I heard of the loss of a gold watch—on the 17th of Sept. I saw the prisoner in the City-road with a female, who left him—I told a policeman, and gave him in charge—he was quite indignant, and said he had never seen me before, nor been in Mr. Hart's shop; he did not know the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am master of the Union Workhouse at Kensing<lb/>ton—my dwelling-house is in the workhouse—it is rented by the guardians of the poor of the Kensington Union—I and my family live there exclusively—provisions and other stores belonging to the guardians are kept there. On Saturday night, the 12th of Oct., at nine o'clock, I inspected the premises, and found everything perfectly safe—the things stated were kept in the cellars—there is a door which opens into an area—that door communicates with the interior of the house—that was shut, bolted, and barred with a cross—bar—I went to bed between eleven and twelve—next morning, about eight, in con<lb/>sequence of some information, I went down stairs—I was not the first person up—I found the door forced open, and missed from the cellar a large piece of beef and some cheese, which I know was perfectly safe the night before—I found a strong wooden bar had been forced away from the door so as to admit a man's arm to unbolt the top bolt, and lift the cross-bar up—the door was open—it opens into the area—they had forced some wooden palings away, and got down into the area from the back yard—the beef and cheese is the property of the guardians, and was in my care.</p>

               <p>(A)—Sir, The most desperate gang in the metropolis have resolved to obtain possession, by whatever means, of a certain portion of your property. It is composed of starving men, and no efforts will be spared in effecting their firm resolves. If any of their numbers fall in the requirement of sustenance from those they have marked out for prey, the remainder have sworn full revenge. Desperation is in their hearts. Not from design, but accident, I was led into their society. Curiosity (being desirous of contemplating human nature in all degrees of life) caused me to seek initiation into all their secrets; I now rue my act. I had previously to take a solemn oath (which nothing, however, will ever induce me to break) that I would preserve eternal secrecy concern<lb/>ing their names and places of abode. Learning their design upon you as one of the proscribed number, and having further a strong consideration for you, I made every effort to dissuade them, at the risk of personal suspicion and consequent danger, to abolish their intentions as respects yourself. Fur<lb/>ther than this I dared not go. But intense suffering closes the ear of mercy; to remove that suffering is the only way to give success unto its natural dictates. They, however, mutually agree that if I will give them one hundred pounds in solid gold they will relinquish their designs upon you; nothing less will satisfy. I communicate to you their demand. Personal safety will, I hope, induce compliance. It is hard that you should thus suffer, but I have done my utmost in vain to ward off the inevitable catastrophe. Had I this been an ordinary conspiracy it would have been sufficient for me merely to give you warning to cause you to be on your guard. But so resolute and determined are these men that no vigilance, however acute—no defences, how<lb/>ever strong, will shield from their hands. Fearing the inevitable results of their decisions in this case that I have been providentially made aware of, I have almost promised compliance with their demands, satisfied that could I but communicate with you, you would, for obvious reasons, consent. If they receive the sum in question I am firmly convinced you will never have any cause of fear from them, but if not, non-compliance will hereafter be repented of too late. My oath prevents me from detailing their plans, which also, if revealed, would subject me to most imminent danger. I have already stated that I am in no way an accomplice. Though poor, I am honest. If you comply with my recommendation you are safe. If you preserve secrecy, I am safe. But too often the innocent suffer for the guilty. Circumstantial evidence is too much honoured; purity of motive, however generous the deed enacted, uniformly denied. Therefore, as I have consented through the hope of securing good and averting wrong, to be a mediator, I require, to avoid</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184410210043"/>
               <p>treachery, that inviolable secrecy be preserved—that you take a solemn oath that you will make no attempt, through yourself or by others, directly or in<lb/>directly, to discover who I am, or cause me in any way to be molested; that on Friday night next, at half-past nine o'clock, you will cause a little boy to be stationed at the base of the Fire Monument (near Lower Thames-st.), who shall have in his possession the sum of one hundred pounds in solid gold, encased by boards, so that he shall not be aware of the contents, and deliver the same to the individual who asks for a parcel; that this boy be alone, and in no communication by sign or word with any other individual whatsoever; that on Friday morning next you cause the following advertisement to appear in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper,—'C. C. desires to inform T. T. that his request has been fully complied with.' If, notwithstanding this information and offer you should fail to comply with my recommendation, the consequences will be fearful. My oath prevents me from saying more.—Adieu. Yours, T. T."</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of the A division of police. I was sent for to the banking-house of Messrs. Coutts, on the 29th Aug., and shown the letter marked A—in consequence of what I was told I proposed to prepare a parcel according to the instructions in the letter—it contained two pieces of clay and half-a-crown in the centre—it was not incased in boards, but in stout paper—I believe it was given to the witness Millard—on the 6th of Sept. I was again at Messrs. Coutts' banking-house, and was shown the letters marked B and C—I arranged to make another parcel, which was given to Charles Stanley—I went with him to a place near Southwark-bridge—I stationed Stanley there, with instructions how to act—I went into a room opposite which commanded a view of where I had stationed him, about half-past nine o'clock, and while I was in the room, I saw the prisoner go up to Stanley—I was not near enough to hear what passed—he appeared to be speaking to Stanley, and I saw him turn round with a parcel in his hand—it appeared such as I had given Stanley—I went out and stopped the prisoner, told him I was an officer, and said, "Who are you? what is your name?"—he said, "I am so confused I don't know what you mean"—Haines, another inspector, came up at the time and took the parcel from the prisoner's pocket—it was the parcel I had given Stanley—the prisoner was taken into a house in the neighbourhood—I asked his name and address—his answer was again, "I feel so confused, I don't know what you mean"—I told him I should take him into custody for attempting to obtain a sum of money from Coutts and Co., bankers, Strand—he said he had been sent for the parcel—I asked him who by—he said by a man named Thornley—I asked if he could tell me who Thornley was, or where I could see or find him—he said he could not, and said, "He sent me for a parcel last week, and I fetched it"—I proceeded to search him, and discovered his lodging, by part of a letter found on him, to be No. 15, Windsor-place, Southwark-bridge-road—I went there that night—a room was pointed ont to me by the landlady as his room—I there found a parcel containing papers, and this American Almanac—there is written on it some names of individuals, and among others Miss Burdett Coutts—I found a seal at his lodgings, and have compared it with the impression on the letter—it appears to be such a seal as would make the impression on the letter C.</p>

On the 6th of September, I saw Inspector Pearce—I know Millard, who has been examined—in consequence of instructions I received, I accompanied Millard to the Monument—I kept my eye on him—he had a parcel—I saw him give it to the prisoner—he is the person—in consequence of instructions, on the 6th of Sept., about eight o'clock at night, I accompanied Inspector Pearce to Southwark-bridge—I received a parcel from him—he directed me what to do with it, and about half-past nine, I saw the prisoner about five minutes after I had been there—I observed him come past me and go towards Southwark-bridge—in a few minutes be came back again, and was coming up to me—a woman was crossing the road, he waited till she was gone, then came up to me and asked if that was Anchor-terrace—I said, I believed it was—he said, "Are you come from Mr. Coutts's, the bankers, in the Strand?"—I said, "Yes" he said, "I believe you have a parcel?"—I said, "Yes, sir, I have; I am to give it to some gentleman who asks me for it"—he said, "Yes, it is quite right; it is for me"—I then gave it to him, and he walked with me a little way in the same direction, and after a time was taken into custody by Pearce.</p>

               <p>("Important.)</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="smallCaps">SIR</hi>—At the commencement of last week, I wrote you a letter to the fol<lb/>lowing effect:—I recapitulate, under the belief, that the letter in question did not reach your hand, notwithstanding its importance. It contained information, that owing to circumstances which the writer could not control, not knowing previously their tendency, that the writer was associated for a period unexpectedly with a set of men who have failed in their efforts to sup<lb/>port port themselves by manual labour, and apparently driven half mad by despe<lb/>ration, have determined, with a fixedness of resolve that no fear can daunt, to possess themselves of a portion of the property of several individuals in afflu<lb/>ent circumstances: not that these persons have in any measure influenced their present wretched situation, as I understand; but that being amidst the largest possessors of wealth, they are held as the least liable to suffer from the contemplated depredation. These men, hoping, probably, that H----, imparted to me the above information, which I consented to learn in the secret hope that I might be enabled to dissuade them therefrom, or at least point out such a course as might remove the necessity of effecting their lawless purposes. Previously, I had taken a solemn oath, from which I can<lb/>not be absolved, that I would not betray them; that oath I now reverence. I have learnt further, that five individuals are marked out of this number. I regret, Sir, to say, that you are one, and that the plan, which involves pos<lb/>sible danger to yourself, as well as property, has been fully matured. By dint of strong argument and much hazard, I have brought these men to agree, that could they, without resorting to the intended measures, obtain five hundred pounds, so as to enable them to go to America, and there settle, so as to obtain support by honest labour, it would be far preferable. I am convinced of their sincerity; they have been honest men; starvation and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184410210045"/>
               <p>death are hurrying them to crime: in their despair they would hardly listen to my recommendation, considering it absolutely impossible that the sum could otherwise be obtained than by accomplishing their purposes, which, however, if once put into operation, will not stay with the above pittance. There is a restraining power and self-respect in honesty, which, if its moral limits be once overstepped, is for ever lost. Under my assurances that the sum might be obtained, they are now waiting. They firmly rely on my sincerity and earnestness to avert from them, crime. Unfortunately I have not myself the means of satisfying their demands, otherwise I should do so, considering that I would be conferring a general good: not in the belief that crime deserves a premium, but that it is the duty of all good citizens, if possible, to nip it in the bud by removing its cause. I undertake the cause of these people for two reasons: first, that I desire to remove impending ill from their victims, whom I respect; and second, that I have a firm conviction, that they will not further make their present dark designs a means of extorting money, but that, with the sum I have mentioned, will leave for ever this country.</p>
               <p>In my letter of last week I urged you, as you value your comfort and hap-piness, to comply with their demands, so far as one hundred pounds. It is a large sum to be lost; but nothing in comparison with the negative benefit that will ensue. From what I have seen of these men, I am convinced that when able, they will return the whole sum. In view of their present designs, this may hardly be credited, but it must be remembered that they have not yet passed the line of redemption: human hearts are every where nearly the same in their component elements; circumstances form actions. In the letter I refer to, I pointed out a spot to which you might send the money, enjoined secrecy, and further requested, if you agreed in the conditions of good faith, etc., for mine is in this case a delicate position, to signify so by a notice in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of Friday, which I dictated. The advertisement appeared, the spot specified was resorted to, a parcel was delivered by a little boy, on which he imme<lb/>diately diately ran away. About one hour afterwards, it was opened by the indivi<lb/>dual who went for it, from whose possession it had not passed since delivery, and was found to contain two rolls of damp clay, so placed as to give the out<lb/>ward form to the parcel of inclosed sovereigns. There was also half-a-crown. These were first wrapped in a sheet of police-paper, from which fact I con<lb/>cluded, that the parcel did not come from you, and that my letter having fallen into other hands, some party had engaged in frivolous play. This is deeply to be lamented, as it would have been far better not to have been sent at all, as the men in whose presence it was opened, and who from the adver<lb/>tisement in the morning were satisfied their demands would be complied with, were deeply enraged, believing that you had received my letter, and that this was the answer. It is possible you may have received the letter, and sent the money, and that the lad entrusted with it has proved a rogue; but there is no alternative, if it be not made good. The passions of these men are like a pent-up torrent, ready at any moment to burst forth. Starvation produces the deepest madness. Reason is forgotten, and stern necessity im<lb/>pels to crime. Whatever be the facts in this mysterious case, it is your interest to forward the sum. The hour will otherwise soon come when I shall not be able to make this offer. Delay will be dangerous; the individual who now writes will make known himself to you, when these men shall have left the country. But this I know will not be, unless, so far as you are con<lb/>cerned, you forward them the sum in question. If to this you agree, pledge your honour in an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of Tuesday next, that you will in no way attempt, directly or indirectly, to molest me, or in any manner seek to discover who I am, or enable others so to do; and lastly, that you</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184410210046"/>
               <p>will throw over this transaction a profound secrecy. The advertisement need merely signify your agreement to the above terms, without mentioning them; and on its appearance, I will despatch to you the direction of a house where the sum in question, so encased and sealed as not easily to proclaim its nature, may be left by a trustworthy individual.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Gray, a clerk in an attorney's office. On Friday night, the 31st of May, about eleven o'clock, I was at a place in Mile-end, between Jubilee-place and Henry-street—I was alone—I had been into Jubilee-place—I had not seen any person there then, but on my return I distinctly heard the cries of an infant; and on turning round the corner into Henry-street I saw something lying on the pavement—I went and looked at it, and an infant stretched its foot from under the rags in which it was enveloped—I told a young man who was passing to call the police, and three policemen came—I took the child home to my place, with two policemen, and warmed it by the fire—it was a male child—the policemen said I must go to the station with them, which I did—it was then near one o'clock—we took it to Mile-end workhouse, but could not make any one hear, and I took it home to sleep with me that night—I took the same rags that I found—they were, an old calico shirt, a body-flannel or baby's blanket, a roller, about a yard of calico, a flannel belly-band, an old calico bed-gown, and it was covered over with an old black merino rag—it was very meanly dressed indeed—sergeant Harrison called between seven and eight in the morning, and took it to the station just as I found it—it was a particularly fine healthy child—I saw nothing particu<lb/>lar about it, no injury or any deformity or mark—I should expect it had not been placed on the spot five minutes—it was no doubt put there for the ex<lb/>press press purpose of being found by some one—I afterwards went before the Jus<lb/>tice, and gave my deposition.</p>

               <p>a fortnight afterwards he called at our house again—I asked how the baby was—he said it had been very bad in the bowels—about a fortnight after that I saw him at the shop where he works, in Hare-street, Bethnal-green—I asked him how the baby was—he said it had been very bad in the bowels, but was better—I saw no more of him till he was in custody—the child and things produced at Worship-street were the child and things I had known before—when Lewis took the lodging he told me he came from Bristol, and his wife also—he told me nothing of their previous life—I saw Hayman about three weeks before she was taken into custody, and asked her how the baby was—she told me it was quite well, that his sister had got it—I saw her about a week after that, and asked her again after the baby—she said his sister had got it.</p>

I serve Major Palby with meat—on Saturday morning, the 28th of Sept., I sent a piece of beef weighing 121bs. there—I did not send the pri<lb/>soner to fetch it away, or to promise to bring a smaller piece in its place, or to take it to the floor-cloth manufactory—I have a customer there—I supply the two—I never saw the prisoner before this—I had no order for beef from the floor-cloth manufactory on the Saturday—if he used my name, it was wholly without my authority.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) On the 28th of Sept. Griffiths pointed out the prisoner to me—he was going down Kensington Gore, carrying a butcher's tray, with a piece of beef in it—Griffith stopped him in the park—on the way to the station the prisoner said he had better do that than starve.</p>

               <p>asked why he left his hat there—he said because he should look like a butcher going down—he had on blue apron—he told me that he stopped outside Mr. Hardy's door till he saw the little boy come out—he said it would not do to follow a butcher about that carried a large quantity of meat because he should not know what was left at gentlemen's houses; but the boy brought some mutton to leave at the floor-cloth manufactory, and also some beef at Major Palby's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stable-keeper, and live in White Bear-yard, Lisle-street, Leicester-square—I know the prisoner. On Tuesday evening, the 24th of Sept., about half-past six o'clock, I went with some friends to the Crown, in Cranbourne-passage—I went in the front of the house into a little bar where they serve from—the prisoner was not there then—I saw him about half an hour after I went in—I was sitting down on the seat, and he commenced bullying me, stating something about a quarrel which I had with a friend of his on the previous Saturday—he said if I served him as I had his friend he would <hi rend="italic">punch</hi> my head—I said, "In what way?"—he said, "By calling me the names you called him, or saying any words to insult me"—I laughed at him, and said, "What words would insult you?"—I called him some name, I cannot exactly say what it was, but it was something to try to irritate him, and he directly struck me—I got up, and struck him again—a scuffle ensued—I got him in the corner of the bar, and he put his finger and thumb into my mouth, and tried to <hi rend="italic">gouge</hi> my eye out—he tore my mouth—it bled very much—I said, "If you don't take your fingers out of my mouth I will bite them"—he kept them still in, and I believe I did bite them—after this</p>

               <p>scuffle we went into the parlour—I went in first, and the prisoner followed me—we took our seats in different parts of the parlour—we were sitting there an hour or an hour and a half after the scuffle—during that time the prisoner came over to me, and said why did I kick his hat—I said, "Don't let us annoy the company any more, don't let us bother, "and I moved to another part of the room, and he to the other part—no words ensued between us after that—about half an hour after, the prisoner quitted the room—before he left he said to a person sitting alongside of him, "You are not going to leave the room just yet, are you?"—he said "No"—he said, "Then you will give an eye to my coat"—he left his coat on the settle, and went out of the room—he returned in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, went and sat down in the seat he had left, and drank out of a glass of gin and water which he had left—he then picked up a bit of cigar, and walked to the fire-place, which was within six feet of me—he had been sitting seventeen or eighteen feet from me—when he came up to the fire I said to him, "Myers, don't let us bear any animosity, let us shake hands"—I was sitting in a chair at the time—he said something—whether I said, "With all my heart," or whether he did, I do not know, but the words were used—he walked towards me—I extended my right hand—he held it with his left, and shook hands with me with his left hand—he put his right hand behind him, and scuffled with his coat—I could not see what he was doing—presently he drew a large knife out, saying, "You b—, I will have your b—heart," and stabbed me just above my left breast, right in the collar-bone—I felt myself struck with the point of the knife, and got up out of the chair—he made a second thrust at my left side, but I screwed myself round from him, put out my hand, and caught the knife in my hand—it was done so momentarily that I can hardly tell whether it was a violent blow—he then drew back—the persons in the room halloed out, "Do you know what you have done? why you have murdered the man"—he said nothing, but walked backwards towards the door, and stood at the door about a minute with the knife in his hand—all the people ran after him—there were twelve or fourteen—I saw no more of him till he was in custody—the knife was picked up in the passage—my hand bled very much—I walked to Mr. Morgan's, the surgeon, and saw Mr. M'Greal, who dressed the wounds—I was under him about a fortnight—I have the use of the hand now—I cannot get it up properly—I can use it very well, but not quite the same as before.</p>

On Tuesday evening, the 24th of Sept., about eight or nine o'clock I was in the parlour, and saw the prisoner with a large butcher's knife in his hand—to the best of my belief this now produced is it—he was standing in the middle of the room looking at everybody about the rooms, after he had struck Mr. Clayard he stood there about half a minute—I went behind him, and was in the act of laying hold of him, when my master who was on the other side of the room shook his head at me not to touch him—the prisoner turned round and walked out of the room—I followed him, and going along the passage he dropped the knife—he walked as far as the beer engine in the bar, and then commenced running—at the bottom of the passage I threw him down, and gave him into custody—we had no such knife as this in our house—it does not belong to our premises—I had seen the prisoner leave about twenty-five minutes to nine, which was about ten minutes before this occurred—I saw him return—I was standing at the top of the court talking to a lad who lives opposite, and saw him coming down the court shuffling something in his left coat pocket with his right hand—I was not present when the blows were given—I heard the screaming and noise.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Crown, in Cranbourne-passage. On Tues<lb/>day evening the 24th, about seven o'clock I was in the bar parlour when Clayards came in—my attention was called by my daughter saying there was a fight with Clayards and Myers in front of the bar—I did not see who gave the first blow—Clayards afterwards went into the parlour, and Myers followed him some time after—I was in and out of the parlour several times—when I first saw them I think they were not far from each other, but Clayards left and went to the other end of the room, which was seventeen or eighteen feet from where Myers was sitting—that was at a subsequent part of the evening—I recollect Myers saying to a person, "Give an eye to my coat," and he went out of the house—on his return I was in the parlour—I should say it was half-past eight when he went out—it was an hour or better after the commencement—on his return he said, "I suppose there has been a good deal said about <hi rend="italic">Abey</hi> Myers"—he resumed his seat which was about seventeen feet from where Clayards was sitting—he drank and sat down—in a minute or so he went to the fire to light his cigar, and Clayards wished to make friends—I believe he said, "Let us be friendly again," or something of that sort—Clayards was at that time sitting in a chair—he held out his hand-Myers went to him to shake hands—I was sitting by the side—he put his hand behind him, and I really do not recollect seeing what he pulled from it, but in the course of a second or so Clayards was stabbed—he put hit right hand behind him, and that is all I recollect till Clayards rose and said, "I am stabbed"—I saw the knife in Myers's hand after he drew back—I hear that he struck at him twice, but it was so quick I did not see how the blow was averted at the second strike, I was so close to him—I saw him put his hand out, but I was so alarmed—I saw Clayards hand and thumb bleeding, and he was sent to the doctor's—when Myers put his hand behind him I was so frightened that I cannot say what was said—he drew himself backwards to the door, and stood—my boy came in, hearing the noise—he says I shook my head for him not to touch Myers, but I do not recollect it—I got on a seat—Myers turned round, and opened the door, and we then all ran after him—when we got to the end of the court the boy had overtaken him—I had been in the parlour about half an hour before Myers went away—during that half hour I do not think there were any words of irritation on the part of Clayards towards Myers—I think Myers was fresh in liquor, and everybody more avoided him than to enter into any debate particularly.</p>

I went there for that purpose about seven o'clock, on the evening of Saturday, the 5th of Oct., with William Payne, the engineer, who was employed with me—I concealed myself—the business of the day ceased about that time, and the men went away—the prisoner was employed there as a sort of foreman, and looked after the pre<lb/>mises—after the engineer had left the premises the prisoner went out, and remained out about ten minutes, between eight and nine o'clock—when he went out he locked the door, which locked me into the warehouse—he was not aware that I was there—he returned in about ten minutes alone—he unlocked the door and came in—the gas was burning in the warehouse—I could see him come in at the door perfectly clear—he took a yard measure from under the table close by the door<lb/>way—he went up stairs, and I could hear him rolling about some cloth, or something soft—he remained there about half an hour, to the best of my knowledge—he then came down stairs with two bundles, one in a red handkerchief, and one in a blue one—he had the yard measure with him, and placed it under the table, where he took it from—he then took a Mackintosh cape from behind a post in the ware-house, and threw it upon his shoulders, took both bundles off the table and placed one under each arm, reached the key from behind the door, opened the door, and was going out—I rushed out, and gave the alarm of fire—the prisoner said, "I thought it would come to this"—I asked what he had got—he said, "I have got some canvas"—I said, "I shall take you for steal<lb/>ing this from the premises of your employer"—he said, "I took it that I might be transported for life"—I took him to the station—he admitted that he took it in hopes that he should get fourteen years of it—I went back to the warehouse, and went up stairs, and found four pieces of canvas rolled up in the same way as that in the two bundles that I took from him—they appeared to have been cut from bolts of canvas and rolled up, and there were four pieces and one bale of goods at a considerable distance from where the can<lb/>vas was kept—I allowed that to remain on the premises till I got the foreman, and then I marked the goods—these are the pieces of goods that I took from the prisoner—it is new canvas, and such as is used for packing—I went to the station the following day with the engineer—the engineer said to the pri<lb/>soner,</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Copthall-terrace, St. John's-wood. About seven o'clock in the evening of the 24th of Dec, I was going up Park-road, towards my home, which leads from the top of Baker-street, towards St. John's-wood chapel—I was an out-patient of the hospital at the time—I was walking very lame—Smith came and asked me the way to Caroline-place—I did not recol<lb/>lect it for the moment—I had not been speaking to her for three minutes, when I heard a snap, and found my watch-guard was snapped in two, and my watch gone—I accused her of stealing ray watch—she ran away, and as well as I was able I pursued her, and cried out, "Police," and "Stop thief"—I got up with her when I had run forty or fifty yards—the instant that I got hold of her, she turned, and threw the watch away—I held her a minute or two, when Davis came across the road, took me by the shoulders, and asked me bow dared I insult a respectable woman, and he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me about with some violence, but I still kept hold of Smith, and then Davis struck me under the ear with his clenched fist—my leg gave way, and I fell down, but I still kept hold of Smith, and struggled very much with her—a shorter man came up, and kicked me in the side while I was down—I still kept Smith—a soldier came up, and he assisted the prisoners in getting away—I afterwards found I had lost a breast-pin, and from 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—after they got away, my watch was brought to me by some groom—there was about two inches of chain hanging to my watch—I am quite sure that Davis is the man—there are lamps on each side of the road—I went to the station next morning, and gave a description of them—on the 15th of Jan. I was returning from Bromp<lb/>ton—I met Smith with a man—they went down towards Piccadilly, and turned up to a street that leads to Curzon-street, and just as they got to the top of Brook-street—(I knew the man as belonging to the same party)—I went up to Smith, and saw her—I intended to have given her into custody, but could not see a policeman—I went into a public-house to see if I could see any one there that I knew—I treated Smith and the man with four penny worth of gin—I saw no one there—I came out—we parted, aad I went to Vine-street, and gave information—I did not take Smith that night, because I was lame, and I knew that the man who was with wier would not allow me to take her.</p>

I am one of the firm of De La Rue and Company—my father, Thomas De La Rue, is one of the firm—we are stationers, and it is part of our business to manufacture coloured cards—I have turned my attention to the manufacture of Chinese blue—there are a great number of blues, which are called Chinese, in which all the trade deal; but I have pro<lb/>duced one of a superior colour, and of a durable tint—one of the defects of other blues is that they do not stand—in the manufacture of this article I am obliged to use a variety of materials, and it is necessary it should be made in vats, in large quantities—it requires very large apparatus to manufacture it—it could not be made in a house in which any persons lived, by the process which we use—there is no person out of our firm, to my knowledge, who is acquainted with the means by which I prepare this colour—in Sept., I</p>

               <p>received information which induced me to send for the prisoner, who was an in<lb/>grinder and confidential storekeeper in our employ—he used to assist me in making the colour—I asked him if he had sold any blue to any person in the trade—he said, "No"—I asked him if he had sold any to Messrs. Dick<lb/>enson—he said, "No"—I asked him whether he had ever made any blue, and he denied it—I told him we had a person in the next counting-house who could prove that he had sold some blue—he then said he had sold some, and he had made it at home—I asked him to describe the process by which he had made it at home, and the quantity of materials that he had used; and he gave me wrong proportions, which I wrote down—he said, 71bs. of prussiate of potass, one-third of 14lbs. of copperas, one<lb/>fourth of 14Ibs. of sulphuric acid, and one-fourth of 11lbs. of nitrous acid—I asked him to describe the apparatus he made it in, and he described making use of an iron pot and a few tubs which he had by him—I asked him whether anybody in the house knew that he made it—he said, "No"—I asked him whether his wife knew it—he said no, he made it when she was in bed—as I knew that in one part of the processi a vast quantity of nitrous fumes are given out, so that any person in the house would be almost suffocated, we sent for the police and gave him into custody—we sent the officers down to King's-Langley, to see some goods that we understood he had sold to Dickensons—this is such a tub as we put our blue in, and I have not the slightest doubt that this blue is our manufacture—I am a member of the Chemical Society—blue could not have been produced by what the prisoner described—it would have turned to green.</p>

On the 26th of Sept., about seven o'clock at night, I was sitting at tea in his shop, and saw a person's hand round a coat, which was on a block between the shop door and the street door—the street door was open—I got up and went to the door—I saw a person taking part of the coat off the block—I did not see his face till he got the coat off the block—I saw his face then—it was the prisoner—he ran away, and dropped</p>

'Rum is a very strong thing;' Scorey said, 'It will do very well when beating down channel;' Doe said, 'Take a bucket;' Scorey went up and brought a bucket down; he said, 'The two of you go, and I will go on deck to keep a look-out;' we heard a tap, and blew the light out; Scorey then struck a lucifer, and held it down to us; Doe pierced the vent, and he held the bucket while I drew the gimlet out; Scorey met us, and took it from us; we did it between us.'

About a quarter past ten o'clock on the night of the 5th of Oct., I went to a public-house near Paddington-chapel, and called for a pint of beer—Lee came and asked how I did—I said, "Very well"—I asked her to drink, wnich she did, and we went out—she asked me to go home with her—I said I would, and then we went to another house, and had a quartern of gin, then I went to her house—she took me to an upper room, and bolted the door—then she asked me for money, and I gave ner half-a-crown—we then went to bed—I went to sleep—Collins, who was the landlady, came and awoke me, and told me to turn out—I missed three sovereigns, and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from my clothes—when I was jangling with Collins, I was sitting on the bed-side—her daughter, the prisoner Josephine Collins, came and took the boots and trowsers—I fol<lb/>lowed her to the next room, and took possession of them there—I had not paid for the room—I was not asked anything about money—I had paid Lee—Collins took the boots and trowsers before my face—I do not know whe<lb/>ther it was to keep until I had paid for the room—she did not speak a word to me—it was Collins's mother that spoke about my staying in the room.</p>

About a quarter past six o'clock, on the 18th of Oct., I was going along the Strand, I stopped at a shop window to look at a picture; two officers came to me, and asked if I had lost any thing—I felt, and said I had lost a silk handkerchief with white spots on it—I went to the station, and there the handkerchief was produced, which I believe to be mine—I have no mark on it, but I have lost one like it—I had seen my handkerchief safe about twenty minutes before—I have every reason to believe that it is my handkerchief—it was in the same condi<lb/>tion that it is in now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoemaker, and life in King-street, Hammersmith. On the evening of the 15th of Oct. I suspected the prisoner of stealing boots and shoes, and I gave him in charge on suspicion—I asked him for the key of his box—he gave the key, and his box was opened—I told him if he did not allow me to search his box, I should give him into custody—he gave up the key, and his box was searched—after I searched it I gave him into custody—I then searched his room, and found a quan<lb/>tity of leather concealed under his bed—the officer was with me all the time—I identified the leather as belonging to me—I had not authorized the pri<lb/>soner soner to take any leather, and he had no right to take any there for the pur<lb/>pose bf business—it was stolen out of my shop.</p>

I was walking down Norton-street—I had a black merino bag on my arm—the prisoner pulled the bag off my arm, and broke the string—he ran away a few steps—I turned round, and called "Stop thief"—he then threw the bag down, and ran towards the New Road—I picked up the hag—I saw the policeman stop the prisoner—I kept the bag till I got to the station—there the policeman asked me for it, and I gave it him—there was a handkerchief and a silver snuff-box in it—I had used the box about five minutes before it was taken—the things were in the bag when I picked it up—this is my box, handkerchief, and bag.</p>

"Where did you get it from?"—he said a man had put it into his wagon to leave at Mrs. Mew's, but who the man was he did not know—the bag contained sugar, and weighed 36lbs., bag and all—I compared the sugar in the bag with that in the hogsheads, and it corresponded in colour and quality—I looked into the wagon, and observed the tin over the drawing hole appeared to have been raised up, by, I should say, a similar thing to this small crow-bar, which I saw found in the wagon—the crow-bar appeared to be covered with the same sort of sugar—there was a leather apron spread</p>

                  </hi>. I live near Green Bank, Wapping, in the house of Henry Turner—I do not know the parish. I had a watch, chain, and seals in my room, which I put under my pillow when I went to bed on the 8th of Oct., about ten o'clock at night—next morning, at half-past six, I looked at it—it was safe then—I did not leave my room till seven o'clock—I returned at night, and my watch was then gone—the prisoner had slept with me that night—I took him in as he was shut out of the dock, and gave him a night's lodging—we both went out of the room together in the morning—I locked the door, and put the key into my pocket—I found it locked on my return—he must have taken it when I turned my back in getting out of bed—I did not look at it after half-past six o'clock, and did not leave the room till seven—there was time enough for him to have taken it—thit now produced is it.</p>

About six o'clock in the evening of last Monday month I was standing at my own door—Mrs. Mann was removing—I said, "You are going; it is a good job; have you got a feather pillow to sell?"—Mrs. Mann had a part of her bed<lb/>stead in her hand, and she made a run at me, and attempted to strike me—the prisoner was there—she had an iron bed-winch in her hand, and she struck me with it very severely on the temple—she struck me once, and would have struck me again, but a person stopped her hand—the blood flew from my head, and 1 was attended by a surgeon, who is here—I was very unwell from it, as of course I must be, losing so much blood—I did not keep my bed.</p>

On Friday night, the 11th of Oct., about half-past eleven o'clock, the prisoner was at my house with two friends, for three<lb/>quarters of an hour—I then cleared my house, and he went away with the other customers, peaceably and quietly—about half-past twelve I had occa<lb/>sion to open my door to let one of my lodgers in—the prisoner came across the street to me, and wanted a bed—I told him I had not a bed to spare—he said he insisted on a bed—I was in the act of going in and closing the door, when he caught me by the collar of my coat, and pulled me out of my door—he pulled me into the street, and in the scuffle we fell—when I disengaged myself from him I found my hand was cut—I did not feel him cut it—there were some slight marks in my cheek—there were two cuts in my trowsers, and one on my left sleeve of my coat—Mr. Gorratt, a medical man, saw me—my hand is very nearly well now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the Rev. Henry Gehle, a clergyman. In July, we occupied apartments in Oakwood-cottage, Highgate, and still do so—we rent them of Mr. William Howell. On the 31st of July I was sitting at work, in the right-hand parlour, on the ground floor, about twenty minutes to three o'clock, I heard my little boy cry—there is a window which opens from the parlour on to the front garden—I went up stairs, leaving my gold watch, and gold chain attached, in a rosewood case, on the mantel-piece—it was three o'clock when I came into the room again—I noticed that the flower<lb/>pots had been removed from the window—I looked on the mantel-piece, and found my watch and chain were gone—the watch was worth about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the chain about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should know them again.</p>

On the 31st of July, from twenty-five minutes to three o'clock till three o'clock, I was standing at my mother's window—the prisoner passed under my mother's window, close by it—I was up one story high—I remained at the window, and looked down upon the man as he passed, and he looked up at me again—I still remained at the window, and in about five minutes he returned on the opposite side of the way with a boy—the boy sat down on the step of the next gate, adjoining Oakwood-cottage—the prisoner went into the garden of Oakwood-cottage—there is a gate there—he was in about five or six minutes—he came out and spoke to the boy, as he sat on the steps of the gate—the boy then went into Oakwood-cottage garden, where the prisoner had been, and the prisoner walked up the hill about half a dozen houses from the house, not out of sight of the house—the boy was not in a minute and a half—he came out, and overtook the prisoner—I saw no more of them—they walked up the hill together—the prisoner had dark trowsers on, something of a pepper and salt coat, and a black hat, with the brim turned up on each side—I had sufficient opportunity to see his face, as I took particular notice of it as he passed down, and when he returned on the opposite side again.</p>

In Sept. last the prisoner was in his service as a traveller—it was his duty to collect orders and to receive money on account of his master, and when he received it to bring the money to Mr. Defries the day afterwards—that was the rule, except he went out of town, and then he accounted on his return—I know a customer named Dawkes—on the 20th of Sept. the prisoner came in, and said Mr. Dawkes wanted some cottons—Mr. Defries gave the prisoner one gross of soda cottons and one gross of other cottons to take to Mr. Dawkes—I booked them to George Forey—the next morning the prisoner came, and said he had left the two gross of cottons at Mr. Dawkes', in Shoreditch, and they were not paid for, and I booked them to Mr. Dawkes—the prisoner never paid me the money for them.</p>

               <p>for ten years—I have been solicitor to Mr. Defries for four or five years—Mr. Defries came to me, and produced an agreement between him and the prisoner—in consequence of that I wrote this letter—I did not know of the present case till after Aug.—I then requested Mr. Defries to allow me to apply to Forey for an explanation of these irregularities—I wrote Forey this letter, and he came to my office on the 10th or the 11th of Sept.—he said, "What has Mr. Defries got to complain against me"—I told him the first was Mrs. Juliers, and he took a memorandum of it—I then told him of one of which the bill was thrown out at Chelsea—I then said, "I suppose the next case you are aware of, when I tell you Mr. Defries has been to Brighton"—I then read to him Mr. Hayne's letter from Brighton, but I do not know that I read it <hi rend="italic">verbatim</hi>—I said it was respecting some goods which he said he had sold to Mr. Haynes, at Brighton, which had not been delivered—he requested an hour or two to consider of it—I gave him the time—he went out and came in again, and said he should give no explanation, he would meet Mr. Defries at the Old Bailey.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Ann Elizabeth Norton, widow, of Knight's-place, Belmont-wharf, Battersea—she is a coal-merchant. The horses are kept on the premises, and their provision in a loft over the stable—the corn and chaff was mixed on the floor of the loft—rn consequence of suspicion I entertained, I introduced some small pieces of brown paper into a mixture of chaff and oats in the loft and gave information to a policeman—the prisoners Banbury and Gillard were in my mistress's employ, Banbury as horsekeeper, and Gillard as coal-porter—Groves works with a horse and cart, but we never employ him—I afterwards saw at the Wandsworth station a sack of oats and chaff mixed, with pieces of paper among them, which I believe to be the same—Alfred Brown, the policeman, produced it to me.</p>

In consequence of information, I watched the premises of Mrs. Norton, at Nine Elms, and between nine and ten o'clock at night, on the 3rd of Oct., I saw Banbury and Gillard standing near the entrance of the wharf—Groves came up and entered into conversation with them—Gillard left them, went into the premises, and returned with a sack, which I saw Groves receive, and walk away from the premises—I jumped over the fence, and secured him with it—Gillard stopped there till I returned, and I secured him—Banbury went to the stable—I sent another con<lb/>stable to secure him—Groves had entered into conversation with them before the sack was given to him—Banbury stood about two yards from Groves at the time he received the sack; Groves then walked off towards his own stable, where his horses were standing—I stopped him about twelve yards from the prosecutrix's—he begged me not to take him into custody—the mixture had pieces of paper in it.</p>

On Friday night, Sept. 20th, between seven and eight o'clock, I was standing at the passage near my house, and saw a wagon with two horses standing in the street near me—the little boy, Michael Manning, and a good many children, were playing about the wagon—there were about ten or twelve of them—some</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Brundell, and, live at No. 24, Agnes-street, Waterloo-road, Lambeth. My husband is in the em<lb/>ploy of Mr. Patrick, a builder, in Belvedere-road, Lambeth, and has been so about ten or eleven months—on the 27th of Aug. last I was about a fort<lb/>night and two or three days after my confinement—Mrs. Cooper, my nurse, had not left me—between two and three o'clock that day a knock came to the street-door—the nurse answered it, and in consequence of a communication from her, I told her to ask the persons down stairs—the prisoner Weston came down into the kitchen, and said, "Are you aware where your husband is?"—I said I hoped he was at his work—he said no, he was not at his work, he was taken from his work into custody, concerning something that had been lost from Mr. Patrick's, his employer—he took a paper out of his pocket, with two large seals on it, and a deal of writing—he handed it to me—I did not take it into my hand—I was in such a fright I could not read it—he folded it up and put it into his pocket again—we went up stairs after that, into the lodger's room—he requested me to go—he looked round, and asked for the keys of the boxes—I said I had not the keys of the boxes—he said he was a police-officer in private clothes, that he had come in private clothes as he did not wish to frighten me, as I was in such ill health—as I was going up stairs I noticed Coopre standing at the door—he had his hand on the latch, and his foot against the door—Weston told me that he was a person from the em<lb/>ploy</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184410210154"/>
               <p>of Mr. Patrick, one of the firm—we went into two rooms up stairs—the boxes were locked—he said, "It is very strange, very strange indeed; what part of the house do you hold?"—I said, "Only the lower part, we let all the other part out"—we went down stairs again into the kitchen—as I went down I noticed Cooper still at the door, in the same position as when we had left him—we went down stairs into the bed-room, and he wished to see what papers and property I had—I opened a drawer—it contained only clothes—we opened another—there were only a few odds and ends—he took nothing from there—the next drawer was locked—he requested the key—I asked the nurse to bring them to me, which she did—I unlocked the drawer, and there was a little cash-box in there—he took it out—I told him there were no papers in there concerning Mr. Patrick, the money which was in the box we had put by to pay the rent and taxes—he desired me to unlock the box—I did so, and he took the money out of the box—it was in a green silk purse—there was twelve sovereigns and a half in it—he put it on the end of the drawers—he wished to know if I had any papers or property anywhere—I told him I had some papers in the cupboard—I took them out—he took them off the file, and laid them with the money—he said it was very strange, he did not know what to do; he could not find the property belong<lb/>ing to Mr. Patrick; he must write a letter for me to take to the station-house—he had a sheet of paper, which the nurse gave him out of the drawer—he turned on to the dresser in the front kitchen, and scribbled something on the paper, which I thought was a letter—he asked the nurse for a candle, and while she was getting it, he said, "Are you certain that you have no more property anywhere, jewellery, or anything concealed?"—I said, "I have a little box of jewellery, but nothing of consequence"—the nurse went and fetched it out of the bed-room, out of a little drawer—on that being brought, he said, "You ought to have brought this out before; did not I ask you for all your property? "—that box contained two brooches, a pair of coral drops, a little cross, a silver locket, and two wedding-rings—the box was placed in the end of the drawers, with the money—Weston also took half a dozen silver teaspoons out of my workbox in the front kitchen—it was open—I then prepared to go to the station-house—he sealed the letter with his own seal, which he took out of his pocket—when I was ready, I told him I did not think I was able to go to the station-house, the baby was crying—he said, "Don't be in a hurry, you can suckle the baby first"—I was in such a fright I could not, and I went up-stairs—he said, "The young man that is in the employ of Mr. Patrick will allow you to take his arm"—he called Cooper down, and whispered something to him—he was up at the street-door at the time—what Weston said to me was not in his hearing—he called him down directly after—I was then in the front kitchen, putting my boots on—I did not see him come down—as I was going up-stairs I came back again, and said to Weston, "I leave every<lb/>thing in your care"—he said, "They shall be all safe; you shall have everything returned to you quite safe"—I then went out with Cooper—we went up Agnes-street, and turned round Vine-street, by the Hero of Waterloo public-house—Vine-street runs along by the side of the Hero of Waterloo—the Waterloo-road faces the street—as we came near the Hero of Waterloo, Cooper said he was going in there for an officer, and we three would go down to the station-house together—I waited for him about three or four minutes, and felt so faint I hardly knew how to stand—I had not been out of the house before—finding he did not return, I went into the Hero of Waterloo and looked round—I could not see anything of him—I came out again, and stood in the Waterloo-road two or three minutes, considering what I should do, go to the station-house or return home—I felt so ill I returned home, and as I was going</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184410210156"/>
               <p>along I thought to myself they were thieves—I went home as fast as I could, but I was very ill, and could not go very fast—I found the street-door open—I ran down-stairs, and asked my nurse if the man was in the house that I had left there—she said, "I don't know; he was here just this minute, walk<lb/>ing in the passage"—I went into the bed-room—Weston was gone, and all the property I have mentioned, purse and everything—the bed-room is the back-kitchen—I gave the letter to Mrs. Courtney, who occupies the parlours, to take to the station-house—I never saw Jackson during any part of this transaction—he had lodged in the same house in which we had apartments, at No. 43, Agnes-street—I know him very well, and his father also—his mother nursed me with my second child—I have had three, but my first died—I saw Jackson the night Cooper was taken to the station, which was on the Monday after the robbery—he was standing in the yard—he was in custody with Cooper—Mrs. Courtney gave him in charge—he had a wedding<lb/>ring on his finger—Sergeant Langley tried to get it off, but did not.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Lewisham. I was Mrs. Brundell's nurse during her late confinement—on the 27th of Aug. last, between two and three o'clock in the day, nearly three o'clock, a knock came at the door—I answered it, and Weston and Cooper were there—they wished to speak to Mrs. Brundell—Weston spoke—I said I did not know that he could speak to her, but I would go and ask her—he said he must speak to her, for he had some very particular business—I went to ask her if she could speak to them, and they walked in after me, and shut the door after them—I spoke to Mrs. Brundell, and before I bad time to return Weston followed me down stairs into the front kitchen, to Mrs. Brundell—she was not keeping her bed, but sitting in the front kitchen, which was the sitting-room—I neard him say to Mrs. Brundell that he was come on very particular business—I went into the back kitchen on hearing that—I afterwards came into the front kitchen, and asked Mrs. Brundell what was the matter—she said she could hardly tell me what was the matter—Weston was there then—they went up stairs—I did not go up stairs with them—when they came down again they went into the back kitchen—I did not go in whilst they were there—I heard the money jink, but I did not know what the meaning of it was—when they came out of the bed-room, Weaton asked for a sheet of paper to write a letter—I gave him paper, pen, and ink, sealing-wax, and a candle—he wrote the letter, and sealed it—he got the seal from his waistcoat-pocket—I heard him ask about writings and other property—Mrs. Brundell said she had but very little of jewellery, or anything of that—he said why had she not told him what she had before, for everything must be brought to court—she told me to get the keys, and go and get the jewellery, which I did, and gave it to Weston—he gave it me back again—I went and put it on the corner of the drawers, with the money and other articles—he gave the letter to Mrs. Brundell—he then wanted to know if there were any more writings anywhere, and Mrs. Brundell recollected she had a few old letters in her work-box—she gave me the keys to unlock her work-box to get them out—there was half a dozen silver tea-spoons in the box—he gave them to me to take to the drawers and put with the other things—Mrs. Brundell then put on her things to go to the station—he asked her about going to the station with this letter—I said she was not able to go by herself, without somebody to assist her, and he said his friend, the gentleman who was up stairs, would assist her there—I asked if he would allow her to take hold of the gentleman's arm—he said, O yes, for he had come from the firm where her husband was at work, and he would assist her there—he called to the other party to come down—I did not hear what name he called, or what he said—he whispered something on the stairs—I think when he called him, he said, "Here," but I will not be sure what it was—Mrs. Brundell and Cooper then went off to go to the station—Weston did not remain in the kitchen many minutes after they were gone—he went into the bed-room—I had occasion to go out into the yard, and saw him picking up the money, and putting it into a green purse—he put it into his pocket—the silver spoons he put into his coat pocket, and the box of jewel<lb/>lery in his waistcoat—he afterwards came into the room where I was and sat down on the table—the eldest child was crying, and he talked to it, and tried to pacify it—he gave it a halfpenny, and said, "Do not cry, your mother will soon be back again"—he had not been there long when Mrs. Courtney came down into the kitchen, and he went out into the passage, but he walked as many as three times along the little passage, between the kitchen and stair<lb/>case, before he went up stairs. I do not know what became of him after<lb/>wards—he was gone when Mrs. Brundell returned.</p>

About the be<lb/>ginning of Sept., I was at work in the back-warehouse where this chest was placed—it was a common chest, standing in the warehouse—I wanted a work bench, and I had to move the chest—I took the lid up and found it was full—I could not move it—I asked the prisoner if he had got a board six feet long to lend me to make a squab on—he said he had one that he was not making use of—the lid of the chest was fast down, but not corded—I found I could not move it without the prisoner's assistance—he lent me a hand—it was a tremendous weight—I never saw the chest corded.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Smith, of Fore-street, Cripplegate. On the 12th of Aug. I returned from Tonbridge Wells—about six o'clock that evening I was walking along the Borough, and the prisoner walked by the side of me, and said, could I direct him to Covent-garden—he said he had not been in London before for five years—he asked me to have a glass of ale, and we went into a house and had it—an old man came in, and wished to take us to the play—I declined that—the prisoner and I then went back to a beer-shop near the Elephant and Castle—that was at the prisoner's suggestion—when we got there, the prisoner shook hands with Mr. Abinger, the landlord, and we went up stairs—the prisoner had previous to that told me that the landlord had had dealings with his father—after we had been in the room some time, an Irishman came in, and said his grandfather had left him a great deal of money, and he said he had been to a party last night and won half-a-crown, and the man had not got half-a-crown to give him, and he gave him a pack of cards—I said, "Let me look at them"—he showed me them, and be began to bet, and talked about play—I said I did not know how to play at cards—the prisoner then said he wished me to let him have some money for him to play with the other man—they played at "Cutting up"—I let the prisoner have altogether at different times 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I saw him play all the time with the other man—he was sometimes losing, and sometimes gaining—the money I let the prisoner have was four sovereigns, four half-sovereigns,</p>

               <p>and the rest in silver—he said lie would pay me again If I let him have the money, as he had money to receive—he did not say then from whom, but on the way he told me he had money to receive from Mr. Abinger, who keeps the beer-shop—he went away, and I did not see him again till he was in custody—I went for a policeman that night, after I found the prisoner did not come back—I went and asked Mr. Abinger if he knew him—he said, no, he had never seen him but once before.</p>

Stanton asked me to go and ask Mrs. Purdy to let me take the child out for a walk—Smith was there at the time—they said they would not be gone above a quarter of an hour, and told me to clean the room out—they said they would give me a shawl and some shoes after they returned—the prosecutor did not live above a minute's walk from our house—I got the child, and brought it home to Stanton, as she asked me for it—I gave it her—I remained in the house, and they went away im<lb/>mediately—I was taken to the station—I did not know Smith before, any more than by her coming to Mrs. Stanton's, a fortnight ago last Tuesday—I remained at the station till the child was brought home—I am sure it is the same baby.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher. On the evening of the 15th of Oct. I was opposite my master's shop, Mr. Terry's, at Clapham—I saw the prosecutor standing by my side, and I saw the prisoner with a stone in his right hand—I was not close enough to see whether it was a large stone or not—I heard him threaten the prosecutor—he said, "I will do for you to-night, you b—b—; I will split your b—head open "—Wheeler then ran after him, and I ran a short distance—I stopped, and I beard Wheeler say, "He has cut my eye out"—Wheeler groaned, and I ran and picked him up from the ground—I took him to the doctor's, and left him there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you Wheeler's friend? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not in particu<lb/>lar—I did not see him give this boy a <hi rend="italic">cuffing</hi>—it was dark—I saw other boys following Wheeler, but I did not notice them throwing stones—I cannot say that they did not throw them—some of those boys said, in my hearing, when</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoemaker, and live at Clapham. On the night of the 15th of Oct. I was sitting at work, and heard a noise outside about eight o'clock—I got up and went outside—I went towards the persons who were making the noise, but I did not go close—I saw the prisoner with something in his hand, and he said to Wheeler, "I will break your b—head this night before I leave you"—Wheeler said, "Don't you let me catch you, my lad," and they all ran off—I did not see any more—the prisoner ran be<lb/>fore fore Wheeler, and soon after they had ran I heard Wheeler groan—I was<lb/>going going to his assistance, but 1 saw plenty of people round him, and I did not<lb/>go any further.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see other boys running after Wheeler? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, there were other boys running up Clapham, and they said, "Give it to the b——, give it him"—I cannot tell how far those other boys were in the rear of Wheeler—I know the prisoner's parents as neighbours—I never knew anything against them or him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable V</hi> 95.) I apprehended the prisoner about half-past eight o'clock the same evening—I told him Wheeler charged him with throwing a stone at him—he said, "No, I know I had a stone in my hand, but I did not throw it at him"—he said, "I know who did do it"—I took him to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I attended Wheeler—he had a com<lb/>pound fracture of the bones of the nose, and a contusion of the left eye—there was a slight laceration of the angle of the eye—it was a bad hurt—it was such a one as would be inflicted by a stone' or by a fall—I have attended him since—his eye is still inflamed, and there' has been a great deal of blood in<lb/>fused—he could not open the eye for some days.</p>
