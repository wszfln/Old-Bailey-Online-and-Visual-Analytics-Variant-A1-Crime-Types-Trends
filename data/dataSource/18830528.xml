I live at 7, Prince of Wales's Road, Kentish Town, and am an agent—on 28th April, at 11.40 in the evening, I was walking along Oxford Street towards Tottenham Court Road with a friend, Charles Everett—when I got to the corner of New Oxford Street I saw five men standing at the corner—we took no notice of them, passed them, and they attempted to jostle against us as we went past—we got out of the way—about 40 yards farther on I heard footsteps behind and received a blow on my head, crushing my hat and partially stunning me—I did not see who struck it—I was thrown across the road by two or three of the men—my friend attempted to rescue me and the other men threw him down also, and I saw him knocked down—the men then ran away—I identify the prisoner as one of the three men who closed with me after I was struck and threw me across the road—after they had run away I found I had been robbed of four guineas, which had been in my left-hand trousers pocket—I had not felt anybody put his hand into my pocket, but I had felt an arm round me—I did not look on the ground to see if the sovereigns had fallen—I don't think the money could have fallen out of my pocket; I could not swear—I had moved a few yards and was talking to my friend a few minutes afterwards when two constables came up and the prisoner, and both of us recognised him at once.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Post-office receiver and stationer at 72, Mare Street, Hackney—on the morning of 10th May I was in my office; a man came in and purchased two postage-stamps and tendered a sove<lb/>reign—I gave him change from one of two money bags in the post-office till; I returned the bags to the till—in one bag was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and in the other, from which I had given the change, were 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in gold and silver coin—7 or 10 minutes after the prisoner came in and asked for two stamps; I believe he paid in coppers, I don't recollect giving him any change—he went towards the door and got out<lb/>side, and then pushed the door back again and said "Sir, there is a gentleman at the door wants to speak to you"—he went out; I did not notice which way he went—I went outside, leaving nobody in the shop—I saw outside at the far corner of the shop, sitting in a pony trap, the man who had previously been in and to whom I had given change for the sovereign—he beckoned me, and I went out to him—I was outside in conversation with the man in the trap two or three minutes—I did not see the prisoner then—in the meantime I had been back to the shop and fetched three books to show to the man in the trap—when I got back to the shop I saw the prisoner backing out of the shop door; his hands</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188305280007"/>
               <p>were in front of him—I pushed against the door and so edged him back into the shop again, because I had seen a third man at the door while I was standing in conversation with the man in the trap—he said "I wanted some marking ink, do you keep it?" I said "Yes, come along," and so edged him back into the shop—the door swung to, and I stood between the door and him; there was nobody else in the shop—he said "I came in for some marking ink, but never mind, some other time will do;" I made no reply, but stood against the door—he said "Why are you detaining me?" I said "I must detain you"—he said "What for? have I stolen anything?" I then tried to attract my wife's attention by knocking on the floor—seeing my little boy come in the shop parlour at the back I called out to him to run and tell his mother she was wanted, and she came—I asked her to bring me my keys, and I locked the shop door—the prisoner said "What have you locked me in for? Have I stolen anything?" I then said "I will let you know"—I walked from the shop door to the post-office, my wife following me, unlocked the till, and found the two bags of money gone—nobody had come in the shop from the time I had given the first man change for the sovereign till the prisoner came in—on finding the two bags gone I came out and said "There are two bags gone from my till, you have stolen them and you have got them;" he said "I have not got your money"—I told him I should charge him with the theft—my wife said "Go to Mr. Bierman," a neighbour; I went out by the side private entrance, through the shop parlour, leaving the front door locked—I came back in two or three minutes; the prisoner was still there—he said "You say I have stolen your money, look again and see if you have lost any<lb/>thing;" I looked in the till again, the bags were not there—I said "The bags are not here, you have got them;" he said "Look every<lb/>where, search everywhere"—looking up I saw the two bags deposited on an inkstand at the far extremity of the desk, about four feet from the till—if I am standing at the counter with the till just under me there is a screen six feet high in front of me with pigeon-holes through which customers would pay their money and take their stamps, one hole is for money-orders and the other for stamps—I said "Here are the bags, but you have stolen them from the till, and have replaced them where they are; I shall charge you all the same"—I gave him in charge—I never put my money bags at that end of the counter—a clergyman came in while the first man was buying his stamps, he was on the other side of the counter; he did not come on post-office business—there was nobody in the shop from that time till when the prisoner came in—I am satisfied I put the bag back in the till and turned the key; I left the key in the till.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I dare say 12 minutes elapsed between the first man coming in and the time I missed the bags—when I was standing talking to the man in the trap my face was towards the door of the shop—the trap was about six paces from the shop-door, not opposite the door, but at the other corner—it was a pony-cart—I never lost sight of the shop-door—I am positive nobody came into the shop while I was speaking to the man in the trap—I did not use force to edge the prisoner in the shop—I simply pushed him in; I cannot say he resisted—I am quite sure I put these bags back in the till—I had never left them out before—it is my practice to leave the key in the drawer</p>

               <p>daring business hours—I am constantly going to it—when I had edged the prisoner in the door swung to—he made no attempt to get past me—I only came into the shop once while serving the man in the trap—my eye was always on the shop except when I walked from the shop to the trap—I found the bags about two or three minutes after I had missed them—I did not search for them anywhere except in the till—my wife was in the room adjoining the shop when I went out to fetch my neigh<lb/>bour—she could not from there see behind the partition of the post-office—she could not see the spot where I found the bags when I returned—I saw nobody in the shop when I went out to the trap with the books.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—I was called into the shop on 10th May from the kitchen below—I found my husband endeavouring to keep the prisoner in—my husband called to me to bring him his keys, and he then locked the shop door—he walked into the post-office, opened the till, and we saw the two money bags were gone—the post-office department is separated from the shop by a partition at the end of the shop—I said "Fetch Mr. Bierman across"—my husband told the prisoner he should fetch a constable, and he left by the side door, through the shop parlour, and down the private passage, and into the street to fetch the neighbour—I shut a little door, and put down a mahogany flap, hooked up against the partition, and walked round into the parlour—I stood in the parlour, and could see the part of the shop directly in front of me, but not that part behind the post-office, where the pigeon-holes were—a person could have put anything through the pigeon-holes without my seeing him—the prisoner walked to and fro in the shop, so that at times he was behind the partition, and I could not see him—I could not see the spot at which the bags were found; it was right in the corner—my husband was away two or three minutes it seemed.</p>

I am single—I did live at 31, Gertrude Street—the deceased, Frances Croft, was the landlady and occupied the drawing-room floor—Jennie Lowry occupied the parlours—Minnie Clinton had a bedroom upstairs and I allowed her the use of my drawing-room—there was no man living in the house to my knowledge—I have known the prisoner between four and five years—I am an unfortunate girl and have had relations with the prisoner—he is a cabman—I don't know when the landlady slept, I suppose downstairs, I had only been at the house about four days—on the night of 2nd May I came home with a gentleman a little before 1—Jennie Lowry let us in—she was up and dressed but not prepared to go out—I did not see the landlady when I went in, I went straight up to the drawing-room with the gentleman—while there a single knock came to the door—the landlady opened it and the prisoner came up to the drawing-room—he said nothing, but he came in and struck me in the face, but not to hurt me—it was a blow on the cheek with his hand—he said nothing—he then went out of the room—I was a little intoxicated—after he had gone downstairs I came out of the drawing-room with the gentleman—an altercation took place in the hall between the prisoner and the landlady—I was then on the stairs with the gentleman—I could see what took place—the landlady called the prisoner some bad names—I did not hear what it was—she struck him and he struck her back, I could not say exactly where—there was a scuffle—the gentleman and I came downstairs together—the gentleman went out of the house first and ran across the road in Aubery Street, and I followed him—as I passed out I saw Jennie Lowry in the hall—the was intoxicated—I ran across after the gentleman, he did not take any notice of me, and then I followed the prisoner—he had come downstairs and got on to his cab and he drove round to the comer of Gertrude Street—I left the landlady on the steps as I left the house to cross the road—the prisoner was on his cab at the time I last saw the landlady on the steps—he went out first, and as I went out the landlady was still on the steps—as far as I can remember she was on the front door steps—when I went after the prisoner I told him I was very much annoyed with him through losing this gentleman friend—Minnie Clinton was there—he got off his cab and told me to be quiet and tried to pacify me—he took a fur tippet out of the cab and put it on me—it was not mine—I did not say anything about it—I gave it to the inspector—I went back to the house with the tippet on my shoulders—when I was talking to him at the cab Emily Jenner and Burton were there—I have told you all I said to the prisoner when they were there—I am perfectly sure of that—I never alluded to the landlady—I did not say to the prisoner in their presence "You know you struck the landlady and pushed her down the area"—I never said anything like it—I said nothing about the landlady or the area—I swear it—the prisoner did not say "She is like you, an old cow," nothing of the sort—I was sober enough to know what did happen—there was no conversation between the prisoner and me except my telling him that I was very much annoyed with him—he got off his cab and put the fur cape on me; he tried to pacify me—he told me to be</p>

               <p>and Water and he had a glass of ale—we then drove to Golden Lane, which is five or six minutes' drive from the haberdasher's shop—he got out there and closed the door, and I never saw any more of him—I was left with the bag, which turned out to contain silk—I gave it to the police—I was kept the whole day—I went back to the haberdasher's shop—on 8th March I received a communication, and went into a public-house in Hackney Road, and when I got inside I identified the prisoner as the man who hired my cab on 25th January—a day or two afterwards I saw the prisoner with a number of persons at Old Street Station—he did not give me time to pick him out, for he flew at me, and said "I know you; you have been to my house twice before, and I will make it hot for you"—he is the man; I wish I was as sure of having a thousand pounds.</p>

He did not speak to me in the public-house, nor I to him—he only just asked me what I would have—I went there to identify him—he was in his shirt-sleeves—two men stood there, and he made the remark "This is bad weather for cabbies"—I do not know whether the two men were cabmen—he afterwards said "We have not heard of any silk robberies lately"—it was in consequence of instructions that I said nothing.</p>

Sutton, at the receiving office, Golden Lane—on Thursday, 25th January, as near 11 a.m. as possible, I saw the prisoner get out of a four-wheeled cab, which I now know to be Yendall's—he shut the door of the cab, and went into the yard—I told the cabman to move on a step to allow one of our vans to come into the gateway—the prisoner came out, and I asked him if he came with the cab—he did not answer me—he came close, and I asked him again—he said "No, why do you ask me that question?"—I said "I beg your pardon if I have made a mistake," and walked out—he turned round and looked at me, and disappeared rather sharply—I knew he was the man who got out of the cab—the cab remained there, and I saw the two packages—I have no doubt whatever that the prisoner is the man—early in March, by the direction of the police, I went to a public-house in Hackney Road, and when I got inside I recognised the prisoner—I asked for drink, but I had no conversation with anybody—about a week afterwards I picked out the prisoner at the station from several others.</p>

I took away with the two canvas bags who came out of your shop"—the police asked me to describe him, and I said that he was a dark man, taller and stouter than the prisoner, and with dark bushy whiskers, and the cabman said that he was a dark man with dark bushy whiskers—I went with the police to the prisoner's house—they said that they were going to identify my lodger, and that they knew where the man was, because the cabman had identified him—they gave me a half-crown—when I came out I said that there was such a great difference between the prisoner and my lodger that if the cabman said he was the man he either had no eyes or he saw double—two days afterwards the police took me to the City to see another man—he was a great big dark man with bushy whiskers—he was not the man either—the prisoner told me that he knew I was speak<lb/>ing the truth, and that the right man was in the country—that is the man (<hi rend="italic">Pointing to a constable</hi>)—I never saw the prisoner in my life till the police entered his house—I have lived in first-class families, and my character will bear the strictest investigation, five years with a physician and three years with a lady, and I married from there.</p>

He stated that the evidence as to his saying, "Rough weather for cabbies," and "Any more silk robberies?" was false, and was only an attempt to hatch a case, and complained that the police having the description of a dark man had taken him, a fair man. He contended that his witnesses had established his innocence, and stated that it was by the advice of Mr. Frith that he did not call them before the Magistrate.</hi>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Sergeant E</hi>). On 21st April I went with Fordham and Thresher to 32, Everard Street, in consequence of inquiries I had made, about 9.30 in the evening—I saw Howard and Garcia's wife in the front room downstairs—I said to Howard "Is Mr. Garcia in?"—he said "He has just gone out; he will be back again shortly"—I was in plain clothes—I and the other officers sat down and waited till about 11 o'clock—Howard and Garcia's wife remained in the room all the time—I then said "There has been a quantity of bad money passed by persons coming from this house; the girl Street is in custody, and we are going to search"—one of us, I think Thresher, said "Which is the girl Street's room?"—Howard said "This is it"—it was a back room, close to where we were sitting; and Mrs. Garcia also said that was the girl's room—I and Thresher went in and commenced to search; we had been in a short time when Howard passed from the front room to the back, and was going through into the yard—I stopped him and asked him where he was going; he said the yard; I said "Not until I have searched you"—I took him into the front room, searched him, and found two florins and seven sixpences, and no bad money—he then went into the back yard, I went with him; as he got to the closet door he said "You are right, don't search any more; I am working for Mr. Abberline and Sergeant Thick"—I said "What do you mean?" he said "It is all right, don't search any more till he comes home, or you will lose him"—Abberline is an inspector of police—I went back and informed Thresher of what he said, and we waited—at about 12 o'clock at night Garcia came in—I said "We are police-officers; there has been a quantity of bad money passed by persons coming from this house; we are going to search, have you any here?"—he said "Not as I know of"—I then went into the back room where I had previously been; Howard passed by me and whispered loudly "In the box in the room upstairs"—I then went back to the front room, where Garcia was, and requested him to accompany me upstairs with Thresher—in the room upstairs I found an ordinary clothes box, which was locked, the room otherwise being empty—I said to Garcia "Whose box is this?"—he said "I don't know, I never saw</p>

               <p>it before"—he called out to his wife "Whose box is this?"—she answered "It is the young man's, he brought it here this afternoon with his brother"—there was only Howard downstairs with her—I then asked for the key of the box; it not being forthcoming, I opened it with one of my own keys, a common box key—in the box I found this paper bag, two pawn-tickets, one with the name of Howard, 3, Sherwood Place, Bethnal Green, which Howard gave as his address, this small box, and the paper parcel tied up with this piece of <hi rend="italic">flacking.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">The various articles were produced</hi>.) I took the little box downstairs and asked Howard for the key—he felt in his pockets and said "I have not got it"—there were counterfeit florins and 176 counterfeit shillings in the box—I said to Howard "How do you account for these? this was in the box in the room upstairs"—he said "It was not in when I brought it; it has been put in there since"—I said "You will both have to accompany me to the station"—Howard put his hand on Garcia's shoulder and said "Take him, he is the man you want; if I am convicted so shall he be"—Foraham took Howard, and Thresher took Garcia—I walked alongside of Howard going to the station—he turned to me and said "Go to the I mother's house in Boyd Street, or they will shift the traps"—I went, and not knowing the number kept observation—I saw Garcia's wife go to Boyd Street and knock at the door of Garcia's mother's house, and I followed her in and searched the house but found nothing—Garcia's mother and father, a soldier, and two prostitutes and others were in the house—I told her what I came for and that her son was in custody—on the 22nd I went to Boyd Street again and took Esther Garcia into custody and charged her—she was afterwards discharged—I was informed Howard was a basket maker.</p>

We went to the house in consequence of inquiries made by Thresher—Street being given into custody upset our plans—I had not obtained information from Thick—I had only received information from persons in the neighbourhood—when I asked Howard if Garcia was in, he showed no hesitation; he answered quite straight-forwardly—I searched Howard before he went into the yard and found no bad money on him, but good money—when the remark was made about the box, Garcia was in the front room, Street at the police-station, and King had not come in—I left Street, Howard, and Garcia in the custody of Fordham and Thresher while I went upstairs and found the box—the box had a common lock—it was not a skeleton key I used—I asked Howard if he had a key because I understood it was his box—I had only searched him for money before—Howard, Mrs. Garcia, I, and Thresher all waited together till Garcia came in in the front room, which opens directly on the street, down one step—Garcia could not have gone upstairs and come down without our knowing it—I am sure about Howard's expression "If I am to be convicted he shall be convicted too"—I told the clerk at the police-court I had omitted that from my evidence in consequence of the Magistrate's interruption, and it was put at the end—I said to Howard "Here are two pawntickets with your name on"—I don't remember that he made any reply.</p>

I was with Foster and Thresher when they visited this house in Everard Street—I remained downstairs when Foster and Thresher went up—I heard Foster call out "Whose box is this?"—Howard said in answer to that "It is my box; I and my brother brought it here this afternoon"—I took Howard to the station—when Foster left us on the way to the station Howard said "I am getting this case up for Sergeant Thick; I shall want yon to send for him. I shall say nothing till I see him"—the pawn tickets were in the box when I took it there, but the money was not there then—I heard Foster's evidence; as far as I know it is correct.</p>

I went with Foster and Fordham to Everard Street—I searched Garcia and found nothing on him—when I first went into the house before Garcia came in I said to Howard "Do you live here?"—he said "No, I am waiting for a young woman who lives here; she is a friend of mine"—I said "Do you know where she is now?"—he said "No, I don't know, but I expect her shortly"—after waiting about an hour, and Garcia not having come, Foster told him Street was in custody—when Foster said "We will search the place," I pointed to the back room and said "Is this the room Street occupied?"—Howard and Mrs. Garcia both said "Yes, it is"—I took Garcia to the station—on the way he said "You need not fear, I shall not run away; I have nothing to fear"—next day I went to 82, Hanbury Street, where King was living—it is about a mile down Everard Street—I went to the second floor landing and called "King"—her mother first came out, and I said "Is Lizzie here?"—she said "No, she is not"—the prisoner came out of the back room and said "What is it?"—her mother said "I thought she had gone out; I did not know she was in"—I said "Are you Lizzie King?"—she said "Yes"—I said "I am a police-officer and I shall take you into custody for passing bad money"—she said "I have not passed any"—I said "We have apprehended several persons at 32, Everard Street; you lived there?"—she said "Yes, I did; who have you got?"—I said "Howard, Garcia, and Evaline Street"—she said "What, you have got Evaline? Oh, I am sorry; she was such an innocent little thing!"—on the way to the station she made a state<lb/>ment, which I wrote down at the station and read in the presence of all the prisoners, and King said "That is right"—she said "I know bad money was being passed, and that it was brought to the house at Everard Street by Howard. I have not passed any that I know of; if I have it has been done innocently. I changed money for Howard and gave him the change, but did not know it was bad. Last Wednesday night Howard said to me 'I can put you away if I like.' I asked him what he meant, and said 'If you do anything to me I know quite enough to put you away, and will do it, too;' but I did not think he meant any<lb/>thing"—I did not hear any of the prisoners make any observation at this time; Howard made a Statement afterwards—when Garcia was charged he said with regard to the half-crown to Mr. Schutz "I deny it;</p>

               <p>it is an untruth. I admit I went into the Weavers' Arms and tendered a shilling, not knowing it was bad"—Howard said "I have nothing to say; what I have to say I will say to the Court"—when Esther Garcia was charged she said in the hearing of the prisoners "I was round at my son's, at 32, Everard Street, yesterday, when the prisoner gave me a shilling, which I afterwards paid to Mrs. Horan, who afterwards returned it to me, saying it was a bad one. Last Saturday week the prisoner King came into my house, took a half-crown out of her pocket, and said 'Mrs. Garcia, will you go round for the washing?' I went to 4, Boyd Street and paid the half-crown to Mrs. Taylor, who brought it back to me and said it was a bad one. King was there and said 'What! a bad one? I must keep it till he comes home or he will think I have been out <hi rend="italic">boozing,'</hi> and she (King) gave Mrs. Taylor 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—when Mrs. Garcia said that Howard exclaimed "It is all very well for you, Mrs. Garcia, what you are saying, but before it is finished you soon will be proved guilty"—King said "What? that is false"—Street and Garcia gave their address as 32, Everard Street; Howard gave 3, Sherwood Place, Bethnal Green, about a mile and a half away—there was no bad money found on any of the prisoners except Mrs. Garcia and Howard—I was present when these 176 bad shillings and six half-crowns were found—I also produce two shillings from Mrs. Grove, two florins from Mrs. Grove, a half-crown and florin from Mr. Schutz, a shilling from Mr. Cooper, and a half-crown from Mr. Morris—I have another half-crown from Mr. Cooper, but he cannot say who passed it.</p>

I am travelling clerk attached to the Missing Letter Department of the General Post Office—on 24th April, in conse<lb/>quence of instructions and information, I stopped the prisoner as he was leaving the Inland Office—I brought him to my room—I told him who I was, and said "On 13th February Julia Collins, of Bittiswell Hall, Lutterworth, posted a packet containing two pairs of stockings and a postal order for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., No. 651, issued on 9th February, addressed to Miss Carter, Crown Inn, Cootham, Pulborough, Sussex. That packet would, in due course, reach the inland branch on the following morning, and be sorted at the S.E. Division, where you were on duty. I have received a com<lb/>plaint stating that that packet never reached its destination. The postal order enclosed in that letter was presented and paid to the signature of 'C. D. Penning' at the Seething Lane branch office the same day, and on inquiry of the paying clerk he states that he remembers paying that order to you. Where did you get it from?" I took down his statement at the time and read it over to him—he said "I remember something coming to my house; it was a pair of stockings and a postal order for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. enclosed. It was made payable to some name at the Seething Lane Post Office. I signed the order 'C. D Penning' when I received the money. My mother remarked that it was a strange thing that stockings should come, but being Valentine's Day there would not be much notice taken of it. There were two pairs of stockings. I gave the stockings to my aunt for her little boy, Mrs. Phillimore, Winchester Road, Harrow Road." He afterwards said his aunt's name was Dixon, as she had married again—I said "Who sent you the packet?"—he said "I don't know"—I said "You understand what I say. This order has been stolen from a packet. Was the packet re-directed to your address?"—he said "No"—he was afterwards told that he would be given into custody for stealing the postal order and stockings—he said "The packet was re-directed to me by Farrow, a boy sorter in the same office. I told him when I came on duty in the evening what the packet contained, and that there was a bother about the order, and Farrow replied 'You had better destroy it. I did not tell Farrow that I had cashed the order"—I then asked him about his mother, and he said his mother did not know anything about the order, merely the stockings.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the potato office of the Great Northern Railway, at their yard at King's Cross—persons are appointed to book the numbers of the trucks which come in from the country and the time of arrival and the name of the consignees, and the particulars are forwarded to the office and entered in the train arrival book and in the market stock book, and an advice note is made out and sent to the consignee, who can bring it to the office and exchange it for a working order to the foreman of the yard or his representative to deliver the goods, and when they are delivered he goes back to the office and gets a lodge-gate pass, which he has to present to the officer in charge at one of the gates, who compares the goods in the van with the pass and permits him to go, retaining the pass for the purpose of being filed—about 12.30 a.m. on 21st February truck No. 6892 arrived from Eastwell containing sacks of potatoes consigned to Mr. Barth, of York Street, Borough Market—the details came to the office and were placed in the several books, which were open for any one's inspection—I sent out this advice note about 10.30 a.m.—the prisoner Edwin has been in the habit of coming to the yard for years, driving a van belonging to his father, who also comes to the yard; he is a potato merchant in Covent Garden—both father and son are well acquainted with the custom of the yard.</p>

There are three gates in a wall about 200 yards long—there are five gates in the potato market—demurrage is charged if the potatoes are not cleared in two days from the date of their arrival, which is not reckoned till the books are made up; they are kept in the potato market office, not in mine—they give a fair repre<lb/>sentation of the number of trucks coming in in 24 hours—the trucks are cast off by the train bringing them from the country, and after wards shunted by a different engine—hundreds of people know the way of business betides the male prisoner—it is upon the working order that potatoes are allowed to be removed—salesmen are not permitted to make their own working orders, they send a notice and we use that as a working order—I do not remember young Isaacs ever having had a working order; I should have known it if he had—if a working order was used, and our servants acted upon it in putting down the flap and letting the potatoes go, I should not have the order—no trucks are allowed to. be unloaded or touched unless the potato foreman or his substitute is present; his duty is to check what is taken from the truck—it is not unusual for salesmen to have potatoes delivered to them at early as 6 a.m.—there is a counterfoil in the book of the lodge-gate passes—carmen have not brought the lodge-gate passes on their return to the yard, saying that the man was not at the gate—I have never known the man not to be there at 6 a.m.—young Isaacs came to my office on 22nd February, about 10.30, and said that his van was engaged that morning by a stranger to remove a load of potatoes from the Great Northern Railway, that it had been loaded from a truck, and that he had to back across two lines of rails, and 24 sacks were put into his van—he did not say that the porters let down the flap—he said that the man told him to drive to the Lying-in Hospital, Gray's Inn, and wait for him there; that he went there expecting the man to come and give him directions where to take the potatoes, and waited for him, and not coming, he took the potatoes to East Road, City Road—he said "What had I better do about them?"

She told me to take the van and be there before 6 o'clock this morning; I went early to the stable and brought my van to the York Road, and there I met the man who ordered the van. He said 'Drive into the Northern yard.' I drove into the Northern yard; two other men dressed like porters joined us, and they led the way to a truck on the 10 o'clock road. The man I first met pointed out a truck and said 'Back up.' I saw there were two lines of railway; I said 'This is dangerous and difficult if they should shunt.' He said 'Back up; pass them and we shan't be two minutes.' I backed my van against the truck; the porters let the door down. I saw sacks of potatoes in the truck; I and the two porters took 24 sacks out. I loaded them in my van; the man I first met said 'Go and get potatoes for Isaacs's van in 24 bags.' I went to the office and got a pass; the man said 'Drive into Old Street and wait near the Lying-in Hospital till I come.' I drove to Old Street and waited on both sides of the road an hour and I half. The man did not come and I took the load home and carried the bags into the shop." I said "The gate pass has not been given up; what did you do with that?"—he said "I tore it up while going along Gray's Inn Road and threw it away"—I said "You have been accustomed to the yard for some time; did you get the working order to load your van?"—he said "Yes, I have been here five or six years and did not get the order"—I said "You were in the yard yesterday?"—he said "Yes, I fetched three sacks of potatoes from Lewis's warehouse and took them to the stable in Covent Garden"—I directed that he should be detained—I sent Toplin to 116, East Road; he went and returned and made a communication to me, and I went there in the evening and saw Mrs. Isaacs—I said "I am a police officer from the Great Northern Railway; I am making inquiries about 24 sacks of potatoes stolen this morning"—she said that a strange man ordered the van the previous evening—I said "Do you know the man?"—she said "No"—I said "Did you book his name?"—she said "No, I can't write"—I stood in the shop 10 minutes or so, and a little girl came in carrying a piece of paper with writing on it, which she handed to Mrs. Isaacs, who read aloud what was on it and went to the back of the shop, opened a book on a desk, and copied from the paper into the book, and the girl went away—I distinctly saw her write; I said "You told me you could not write, Mrs. Isaacs; now show me the entry, please, you made last night"—she closed the book and put it in the desk without saying anything.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 94, Canonbury Road, Islington—I have a relative, Schaefer, who was convicted at this Court of robbing Mr. Bockett, a solicitor; he is now a prisoner at Cold bath Fields—prior to 21st April the prisoner was a stranger to me—on that day he called at my house and produced a piece of paper, which I returned to him—it was in Schaefer's handwriting—he said "I am a warder, and I can improve the condition of Schaefer; I have appointed him to assist me, he cooks for me, and he overlooks the books, labels them, and attends to them generally, and has an opportunity of seeing the news<lb/>paper on the Sunday, runs errands, and does the general work of a lackey"—he said that Schaefer was suffering from cold, and my wife gave him two flannel shirts, and I went with him to purchase a pair of drawers—I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to purchase better victuals for Schaefer—the prisoner was dressed in a frock coat, and I believed the story he told me—two days afterwards, the 23rd, on returning home I found a drawer in my bed-room had been broken open, and missed a silver watch, a quantity of</p>

Bocketts and Sons, solicitors, in Lincolns' Inn, and there were some papers—he went upstairs and partly searched the house, and then said—"I am a detective, a policeman"—on the Saturday he had said he was a warder—I unlocked my drawers, except one which my husband had the key of—the prisoner took a file from my son's bedroom, tried to force the drawer, and the file broke, and then afterwards he got a large file from the kitchen drawer and forced open the drawer—out of the different drawers he took away a lot of the papers produced here to-day by the police, and the watch, two rinks, and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money—he said he was a detective and must do his duty, and was going to take them to Scot<lb/>land Yard, and I should have them all returned—I did not see him again until he was in custody—I afterwards received this letter by post—it is addressed Mrs. Crew, dated 8th May, and marked private.</p>

I am sergeant-major, Commissariart and Transport Corps—I received this bag from Bevan on Sunday morning, 29th April—I examined it; I identify these contents—some of the things are marked with the regimental number and Government marks, and I saw some of them in the stores on the day previous, some in the morning and some in the afternoon—the store is in the basement under the barracks—there was only one pair of boots in the bag on the Sunday morning—these other boots I identify as similar to those in the stores; they have Government marks on them—I issue boots to the men; before doing so I mark every man's regimental number on them and the date of issue—no boots go out of the store to the men without them—I have charge of the store—I took stock about 16th March previous to going to Brighton, and the number of the boots in the store was then all right—Law and Maslin went to Brighton, I believe; Earl remained behind in barracks—we came back on 29th or 30th March—when these articles were shown me I looked over the stores and found several things were missing, boots, and overalls, and drawers—if any boots were sold to the men, Goodley, the storeman, would put the man's number on them.</p>

I took stock on 16th March—if I said 16th April at the police court I made a mistake—my evidence was read over to me; I did not discover the mistake—there was an unusually large number of boots in store in March and April, and the room apportioned to those things was overstocked for the time of year—I had the proper number of boots and they were all packed away—only old boots were left on the landing for about a week in November because there was no place for them—that did not also take place in March—I generally took stock once a month—I took it on 16th March because we were proceeding to Brighton and it was the end of the financial year—I took it next on 26th or 27th April—I then found a few boots deficient.</p>

I never missed any articles—I get the things out for Reigate, he makes up the parcels, the boy takes them out of barracks, I don't know what becomes of them—I saw him receive the money for three or four pairs of drawers—I was a prisoner at the time the preliminary investigation was held—I did not make a statement against Maslin or against anybody—after I was released I swore against Reigate that goods were sold and the money handed over to him—the investigation was held to consider whether there should be a court-martial—they were not brought to a court-martial.</p>

After the men turned out of stable at five p.m., Private Flood came down with the key of the ball alley and unlocked it and went in. I was standing at No. 2 company stable and he called me across.

I saw Corporal Hardy come out of the ball court as I was in No. 2 stable. He came to the stable in his shirt bulged out in front. I asked him what he had, and he said a few things and gave me a sponge, and he had some gloves and sponges in his shirt at the time, but I cannot say how many. He then went to hide them, but I cannot say where, and then returned to the ball court again. About the beginning of March he (Hardy) was on picket duty, and</p>

               <p>when I came into stables in the morning at 5.30 a.m. he told me that he had made a raid in the night, and the way he got in was by the win<lb/>dow, as the storeman never locked the inside door. On Saturday, 31st March, Private Earl asked me if I could sell him three pairs of boots, not giving it a thought at the time that they were stolen out of the company's stores. After I had sold them he told me he (Earl) could get me what he liked out of the basement store, as he had the key, and he had been taking these boots to one of the barrack rooms of the Cold-stream Guards in the passage at the opposite side to the street—I gave him 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of the 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

               <p>the two I recognised kicking him were Crawley and Murphy—I attempted to get to Middleton's assistance, but some one ran a costermonger's barrow behind me and knocked me down—a man named Woods then kicked me on the left jaw—they threw the barrow and the boards a-top of me, and I had some difficulty in getting out of them—I saw the prisoner escape from Middleton's custody and run into 27, Charles Street—I did not see him again till 1st of May this year—I found the door at 27, Charles Street bolted—I tried to get in—in consequence of the injuries I received I was 14 days off duty—I endeavoured to find the prisoner a great many times, but was not able to do so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the Linoleum Com<lb/>pany and head of the selling department, 44, Queen Victoria Street—when goods are sold an invoice is made in the counting-house—Wright was in my office; he had nothing to do with making out invoices if he sold any goods it was his duty to enter them in the waste-book and have it taken up into the counting-house and given to one of the clerks to make out, and another one would receive the money in the counting-house—these five papers are on our invoice forms in Clark's writing—there is no record of the sale in any of our books or of the receipt of the money for any goods sold to Tubb on 7th May—we generally close at 5.30 or a little after—on 8th May, in the morning, Jeffery spoke to me and gave me this piece of paper, in consequence of which I obtained the services of Detective Langley and went to Tubb's premises in Hoxton Street—I knew him, as I had sold him goods—he addressed me first, and asked me if I had any remnants for him; I said "No, I have come down to see what remnants you purchased last night;" he pointed to two or three lengths in the shop—I asked if that was all; he pointed out two or three more, and they were placed together—I asked if he could show me the invoices for those goods; he said "Yes," and I and Langley went up into his bedroom—he then produced these five invoices—I said "Where is the invoice of the goods you got last night?" after a little hesitation he said "I have not got one"—I asked him to produce the receipt; he had not got one, but he said that he paid Wright 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them, and he could not give him a receipt because he had not got a stamp—I went downstairs, examined the cloth, and found that the tickets had been taken off, but there were two chalk marks on two pieces and a stencil mark on another, indicating that they</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188305280068"/>
               <p>were piece goods—I said "Are they in the same state as you purchased them?" he said "No, I have cut them up ready for sale"—I said "Then you must have had pure goods;" he said "Yes, I took them out of the warehouse myself and put them on my cart"—I said "You must know that these goods are not sold at remnant prices, also taking them out of the warehouse after business hours you must have known they were stolen, and I gave him in custody—he said "Do not lock me up for the sake of my children, if there is anything wrong let me know what the difference is and I will pay you"—the value of the goods is about 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is a small shop for the sale of cloth, ropes, and matting—Wright had no authority to sell the goods, and there is no record of the transaction.</p>

He stated that when Andrews gave the said order he, O'Connor, wrote, "Don't send this order till he pays the first account" but in spite of that they sent the goods, and therefore he was not to blame. Although the prosecutors, not having made inquiries, sought to throw the blame on him, had they asked him "Is Andrews safe for </hi>50<hi rend="italic">l.?" he should have said "No" and that the other prisoners, they being his mother and sitter, had acted entirely under his instructions, and when they signed for the boots they did not know what was in the parcel.

               <p>Street, Marylebone—on Friday, 18th May, I was in the Champion public-house from 10 to 10.30 p.m.; the prisoner was there—I first saw him in the compartment on the left-hand side of me; I was in the corner compartment—I remained there two or three minutes, and the prisoner came round to me and said "If you don't pay me 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I shall pay you with a punch on the b—nose;" I made no answer, the prisoner seized me by the wrists, swung me round on to the floor, and then he put his knees on my chest and laid on me, and commenced beating me on the cheek and lip—I was confused after that, and I hardly know what happened for a minute or two, and then I found him outside the public-house when I next saw him—I followed to a house in Little Carlisle Street—I saw a police-constable and told him; he said he could not take him then—I went to the hospital and the wound on my lip was sewn up with four stitches—on the following day I took a warrant out against the prisoner—I did not strike him before he attacked me; if I struck him it must have been in self-defence afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known him about nine years—I had a quarrel with him about four or five years ago—I have met him in the street twice since then, but have not spoken to him—I owed him 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Wood, the prisoner's father-in-law, came in the bar with him from the other bar—the prisoner did not say to me "Good evening," nor did I say "Good evening," and the prisoner did not say "What are you going to do about that little affair?"—I was perfectly sober—I will swear he did not say so—did not say "As before if you like"—I might have buttoned up my coat—I could not swear whether I struck him in the face, if I did it was in self-defence—we grappled together and fell down, he on the top of me—I was not cursing and swearing, he was—his mouth was level with my face; he had hold of my wrist—there was very little struggling; was endeavouring to defend myself, but I was powerless—I would not swear if I was kicking—I heard the landlord say in the Court that he heard quarrelling between us—I don't know whether he means words or fighting by quarrelling—I could not say who pulled the prisoner off me, I was confused—I had been out since 7.30, and had walked from Harrow, about eight miles—I went to the doctor's within a quarter of an hour of the time I was wounded—the doctor said he could not see any teeth marks because it was a jagged wound—I did not see any barrel or puncheon in the compartment.</p>

                  </hi>.I keep the Champion public-house in Earl Street—on Tuesday, 8th May, I saw Matthews and the prisoner in my house at 10.30—they were in the same compartment talking rather loudly, apparently discussing some subject on which they differed—almost immediately the prisoner made a rush at Matthews and both of them fell on the ground together—I did not hear anything said—when I held them up, the prisoner said "7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a punch on the nose"—the prisoner was on the top and had his head close down on the top of the prose<lb/>cutor's head—I and my barman pulled them up and put them outside, and I then noticed the prosecutor's face was bleeding very much from a wound about a little moustache he had then, and within earshot of the prisoner he said that the prisoner had bitten him—I believe the prisoner said nothing, but walked away and the prosecutor followed him.</p>

                  </hi>.I am house surgeon at St. Mary's Hospital—on the night of 18th May the prosecutor came to me at the hospital between 10 and 11—I examined him, he had a wound on the upper lip which had been bleeding but the bleeding had stopped—the wound was incised and obliquely down the lip, and at the bottom so deep as to be almost through the thickness of the lip—it might have been caused by a bite—it was not so absolutely clean cut as it would have been by a knife, but it was what I should call an incised wound as contrasted with a contused and lacerated wound—I put in sutures to draw the parts together and afterwards put on lint and strapping to help to keep the parts together—it is a wound which will leave a scar for some consider<lb/>able time—I think some slight operation will be required before it heals perfectly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer, residing at Windmill Lane, Dept<lb/>ford—on Saturday night, 5th May, shortly after 11, I was in the White<lb/>chapel Road, opposite the station—I had just arrived by train, and was waiting for a tramcar to Bow—I saw the prisoner cross from the hospital side towards me with two females, one of whom passed me as I stood on the kerb, and the other one passed at the back of me—I walked towards the car, and got on—it started—I was looking inside to see if there was room—there was no room—I stepped back—the prisoner stepped on the other side of the car, the off side, and ran towards me with his head down, and struck me in the breast, and knocked me off the car backwards—it was at the back end of the car, on the near side—he fell with me in the road, and got up first—I felt for my chain, and found it was gone—the bar was left in, and part was left on the watch in my waistcoat—I was not hurt in falling; it has not incapacitated me for work at all—he ran between the two females he had been with, and ran among the people, and I lost sight of bin—my watch was worth seven guineas—I saw him two minutes after it happened—a young man had stopped him—I identified him—I am quite certain he is the man—the females were with him at the time he was apprehended, and threatened to gouge the man who stopped him.</p>

I live at 50, Norland Square, Netting Hill—in the beginning of November, 1882, this circular (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with the names of Duncan and McLaren was left at our house, and the next day the prisoner called and showed some samples of towels, stockings, socks, long cloths, and things of that kind—they were all very cheap, much under their value—I asked why they were so cheap, and he said it was due to the failure of a bank in Scotland—I gave him an order for some towels, stockings, and servants' aprons—they were to be delivered on the Saturday following I think—the prisoner went out and came back immediately with another man, and said he had some dress materials he should like to show me—he showed us several lengths of cloth for dresses, and some cloth for gentlemen also—he said they were all wool, but that the great inducement to buy them was the "arrangement that we have made with Swan and Edgar to make them up with trimmings for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—when I asked why, he said they had large contracts with the firm—that was what induced me to buy the cloth—I think he offered that as an inducement—he did not use the word inducement—I bought one close on seven yards for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., because it was not a bad-looking dress, and the chief inducement was the having it made up for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. with the trimmings—he did not come on the following Saturday with the other things I had ordered, and I never saw him again—after a week or two I wrote to Swan and Edgar's.</p>

I have been 16 years foreman of the Salvage Corps, western district, before which I was nine years in the Fire Brigade—it has been part of my special duty to examine and try to find out the causes of fires—I received information of this fire on 29th December, 1877, about 9.45—it was not out when I got there 10 minutes afterwards—the place was full of smoke and the engines were at work, and the firemen had the branch down the back basement—before the smoke cleared my attention was called to a lighted gas jet under a shelf in the trimming room—I sent one of my men to let a pail of water and extinguished it, and I had the gas pulled out, which was burning—some small boxes and trimmings were on the shelf I believe—I saw in the back basement, rubbish and a quantity of sawdust and waste-paper, and remains of boxes and a lot of lumber burning or burnt—there had been considerable burning there chiefly on the right side as you go down the stairs from the shop—the front basement floor was concrete, but it was timber behind—there was no connection between the fire in the basement and the fire under the shelf made by the gas, one could not have created the other—there was an appearance of cloth having been</p>

               <p>set fire to—there was on the first floor above the shop a glass door and a cupboard, and on opening the glass door I found that though the cup<lb/>board had been burnt out there was no sign of fire outside—the door was shut—the bottom of the cupboard was burnt through, and the whole of the interior was well charred, and a hole burnt through the top—it was burnt from the inside—that fire had no connection with the other two—I did not feel it, but it had been on fire recently, for it was steaming—that cupboard being closed, it would take perhaps an hour before it burnt through—I can suggest no way by which it could have been lighted from the outside, or how with the door closed a spark could get inside to set it alight, and the outside was quite clear from any flue or warming apparatus—it was something like a wardrobe, you can hardly call it a fixture—the drawers on either side were not touched, and the ceiling underneath was intact—there is a staircase there which leads down to the back basement, and that was clean, so that the fire could not have come up there—I believe there was a partition between this piece of furniture and the stairs—I saw Kino about 11, or it might be earlier—I asked him if he was insured—he said "Yes, in the Commercial Union and the Northern"—I drew his attention to the three separate fires, showed him where they were, and asked him if he could account for them—he said that he could not—Davis was there when I drew attention to the gas bracket, but neither he nor Kino could account for it—Kino said in Davis's presence that he left Davis with the keys, to lock up—on the Monday or Tuesday afterwards I went down to the back base<lb/>ment and found a hole cut through the back wall in the rear, not in the part where the fire had been, but in the opposite side of the basement, about 11 inches or a foot square, and filled up with lumber and dirt; there had been no fire there, and that lumber could not have been ar<lb/>ranged from the outside—it appeared as if somebody had put the lum<lb/>ber there to prevent anybody getting in—the fire had not reached any of the stock unless there was any in the cupboard—we turned over the <hi rend="italic">debris</hi> in the cupboard and found one or two old shoes shrivelled up; we turned over the atoms to see if the fire could have got in from the bottom—we found no <hi rend="italic">debris</hi> such as we are accustomed to find.</p>

Broadley, one of our men, was in charge of the premises from Saturday till Monday or Tuesday—no stranger went into the premises during that time, only Kino—I con<lb/>cluded that the hole was not large enough for a person to get through—I looked through it, but it was eight feet from where I stood—it was a brick wall, and there were excavations going on—building operations were going on, and I believe there was a hoarding outside—I heard that Kino had said that somebody had got in and set fire to the place and stolen the goods—the rubbish was not under the shop at all, it was in the back basement to the left of the trimming room; the hole was here, under the trimming room. (<hi rend="italic">Pointing out the different situations on the model</hi>.)—the gas jet was just behind the partition, which had silvered glass on it—the fire was between the back of the building and the staircase—the hole was about a foot square by 11 inches—I thought it was not large enough for anybody to get through and paid no more attention to it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Clarke and Brassey, builders, and am acquainted with surveying and making models—in January, 1878, I surveyed Kino's premises in Holborn and made a model, which was used on the trial before Lord Coleridge, and which has, I understand, been destroyed, and I cannot find the dimensions—this small model gives a good idea of the place—I think the stairs are in the right place—I looked at the plan in the first week in January, and found traces of fire in the basement—I agree with Mr. Puckett that there were three distinct fires—there was a hole in a wall at the back which was partly pulled down, through it I could see the building operations at the Blue Posts.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MATTHEWS</hi>. All the smoke and heat must have come from the basement up the stairs to the second floor—it went along the basement, and came up the stairs, not across the shop, because there was a partition shutting off the stairs at the back—that is marked here as a counting-house—the smoke got upstairs through the other flight, the back stairs—the under side of the joist was burnt—the concrete floor shuts off the stairs from the shop—there was a considerable draught up the back staircase, which would probably carry fragments of the burning brown paper with it—no smoke worth speaking of would get into the shop; it only went up the stairs—that is where the damage to the building was done—the rest of the building was very little damaged.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKE</hi>. The fire was prevented from getting into the shop because of the concrete floor—it had burnt the under side of the wooden joists immediately below, and might hare burnt through them.</p>

I am 68 years old, and a retired police constable—I was just—on 15 years in the force—at the end of that time I was disabled, and received a gratuity of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on retirement—since then I have been employed as a watchman on different buildings, amongst others by Messrs. Assheton and Lathy, Crisp Street, Poplar, who were rebuilding the Blue Posts in Southampton Buildings—I was watchman there for the five months before the job was finished—a good part of that was before the fire—I had seen Mr. Kino several times during that time, and knew him by sight—there was a hoarding about six feet high all round the premises, which opened on Southampton Buildings—there was a door is the hoarding in Southampton Buildings, locked with a padlock, by which you could go in and out of the excavation—I kept the key—that was the only way in or out of the place—the door was locked about 5.30, when the men went off work, and as soon as they went I had the keys—day and night there was always some one there, either the workmen or me—Kino's party wall was altogether down, and his place was boarded up at the back of the excavation—I never saw the hole they talked about; I never went in—on the Saturday night of the fire I was in</p>

               <p>Southampton Buildings about 9.30, outside the hoardings—the gate was looked; I had the key—I looked up to the top of the hoarding, and saw smoke coming over it—I was standing right opposite the hoarding, on the other side of the way, in front of Bond's public-house—it is a very narrow turning; there is only room for one vehicle to go up or down—the smoke was coming over the hoarding next to the street—I went and undid the door, and looked in over the excavation, and saw smoke and flame coming from Kino's back shop—I immediately came out and locked the door, and went round to the front in Holborn to tell them what had happened—Kino's shop is four doors from the corner—I had turned to the right into Holborn, towards the City, and when I got to the third shop I noticed a man come out of Kino's shop towards Southampton Buildings—I met him face to face—he passed me, and went down the buildings, and I followed close on him—he stopped right opposite the hoarding in Southampton Buildings—I went behind him—I could easily have touched him—I heard him say "I hope the house will be burnt down"—two or three people were looking, standing about the same place where he was—he took no heed of me, he was taking so much notice of the smoke that he paid no attention to anybody that I could see—he stood looking at the smoke four or five minutes—his hair was rather light, and his complexion fair, his age about 32 or 33, and his height 5 feet 7 or 8 inches—he was dressed in dark clothing, with a tall hat—I heard him say nothing else, but he was muttering to himself as he walked along—he went towards the bottom of Southampton Buildings, nearest to Chancery Lane—he met another man two or three doors from Bond's public-house, opposite our hoarding, and 200 or 800 yards from Chancery Lane—that was a dark, shortish man, with black hair and dark clothes and a tall hat, but I only saw his back—they went down Southampton Buildings and into Chancery Lane—I watched them nearly to the bottom—the dark man turned, and I believe it was Kino; I came to that conclusion at the time—I did not meet a policeman, but if I had I should have followed him further—I made a statement to a police<lb/>man on duty the same night—I do not know his name—I believe he is dead—on the Monday morning I went to King's Cross Road, and made a statement of what had happened on Saturday night—I left a message for Mr. Ruffell, the foreman of the works, at the Blue Posts—I saw a statement in the paper this year which caused me to go to Scotland Yard, and on Thursday, 12th April, Inspector Boots took me to the House of Detention, and I was taken along in front of some open cells to see if I could recognise some prisoners—there were eight cells in a row—each cell door was open—I passed by with the deputy governor and two warders, and recognised Davis in the second cell the second time I walked down the row, as the man I saw saw coming out of Kino's shop on the night of the fire—Davis is the man.</p>

It is two months since I was in any occupation—I left the police in 1857 on perfectly good terms with my superiors and with a gratuity, not a pension—I am not in the same employ as I was in 1877; I have been delivering circulars since—I was at Hoxton when J was in the police—I had been five months on duty at this hoarding and for two months afterwards—I went on duty again on the Monday, but I was relieved to go to King's Cross Road; I did not go to work on another job—during those months I saw Mr. Kino</p>

               <p>two or three times, and if I see a man once I recognise him for some time to come—I have given evidence here many times—I used Bond's public-house occasionally; Kino's men did not use it that I am aware of—I know that there is a fixed point at the top of Chancery Lane—I wanted the constable there to assist me in keeping people down from the hoarding, but I could not find him; no doubt he was at the front when the fire was burning—I don't know his name or his number—I was told on 12th April at the police-court that the other policeman is dead; I don't know his name or his number—the man pulled the gate behind him when he left; he put on no padlock I am quite sure—he passed me too quick for me to tell him that the house was burning, but I followed him; he continued to walk sharp and so did I—I stood beside him four or five minutes while he was standing still—I can't say why I did not inform him that there was a fire at the back of the house—I did not shout out "Fire;" I spoke to Harrison, and also to one of his men, and said "There is a fire at Kino's "—the dark man came towards me and I saw his face, and firmly believe it was Kino—I had come to the con<lb/>clusion then that the man who went down Southampton Buildings and said that he hoped the house would be burnt down had caused the fire—I am satisfied that immediately after causing the fire he met Kino in Southampton Buildings, and if I had met a policeman I should have told him—I know where Scotland Yard is, but I made no communication to the police till 22nd March this year, except to the night policeman on the beat—I did not write to Scotland Yard, it was no business of mine.</p>

The men leave work at 12 o'clock on Saturdays to be paid—I went to the premises about 6 p.m., but did not go in; I was walking up and down in front of the hoarding—if the man had stopped in the street to padlock the door I must have seen him—I saw him push the gate to behind him—I am sure he had on a tall hat, not a <hi rend="italic">billycock</hi>—he wore black clothes, and was dressed like a gentleman—I took particular notice of him, so that I might know him again—I cannot say whether he had a beard or not, but I think I should have noticed if he had one—the people at the hoarding looking at the smoke were not so close to him as I was; I was within a step of him—I did not say anything to him; he was very intent with the smoke, and I was very intent watching him—it was 9.30 p.m. in December, and I believe I had never seen him before and I did not see him again till he was at the House of Detention—I had read two or three accounts in the paper before I went to the House of Detention—I had read the evidence, but not the ages; <hi rend="italic">Lloyd's</hi> never report that. (<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition stated:</hi> "I saw in the paper the ages of the two prisoners.") I signed that, but I don't remember saying it—I recognised Davis as I passed his cell, but I went on farther, as I had a curiosity to see the other prisoners—I knew the two men I had to identify were among the eight—I saw Kino's cell first, Davis's was the next—there were two lads of 18 and a man of past 60—I had been there three months before the fire—there were people living near the premises in Holborn when I first began the job—I believe they did not go away for a fortnight or three weeks.</p>

Assherton and Lathy, who were rebuilding the Blue Posts in Southampton Buildings—on 29th December the old house had been pulled down, and we were excavating for the foundations—there was a hoarding about six feet high between the street and the front of the house—the gate was locked at night, and Prior the watchman kept the key—there was another wooden hoarding farther back against Kino's shop—after we had taken down the upper part of the party wall between the Blue Posts and Mr. Kino's, a hole about 18 inches square was made into Mr. Kino's premises through the wall, to get the timbers through for shoring, as it was necessary to shore up part of Kino's premises from the inside. (<hi rend="italic">The witness here pointed out the positions of the wall and of the hole, on the model</hi>.) The hole was covered with beards at night and sometimes with an old door which anybody could remove and get in if they thought proper—they would have to remove the struts, but there was a watchman all night; the place was never left—I never heard of the hole being blocked up on the other side—I saw a great quantity of paper inside at the back part of the basement several times when I was there, up to a week before the fire—it was a very large heap; I should think two van-loads—it looked like used waste paper—on the Monday morning after the fire, about 10 o'clock, Kino came round from Southampton Buildings by the gate and said to me, "The old man has set fire to my place," meaning the watchman—I contradicted it; I did not believe it; I had employed Prior on other work and always found him honest, and I did not believe he was guilty of such an action—I do not remember Kino's suggesting then or at any time that any person had got in through the hole between the excavation and his premises—Prior had made a statement relating to the fire to me about 8.30 that morning, when I was engaged on a job at King's Cross—I went over the premises with the builder the day after the fire, but I cannot say what damage was done—I remember that there were some cases very much scorched on the ground-floor.</p>

Prior said "There has been a fire at Mr. Kino's"—I said "What time?"—he said "About 10 o'clock," that he was standing outside, and saw flames and smoke issuing from the shop—I asked him if he saw any one near there—he said he looked his door, which was the door leading to the excavation, and went round to the front of Mr. Kino's shop, and when he got to the front door he saw tome one come out and go down Southampton Buildings, and meet several people standing at the bottom of Southampton Buildings, and apparently enter into conversation with them—I understood him to say that he saw the same party meet a gentleman after he left the men he had been pre<lb/>viously speaking to, but that he could not recognise him—I am not clear as to Mr. Kino's words; it was that the old man had set fire, or might have set fire to the premises—I told him I did not believe it—I did not tell him what Prior had said to me—I believed what Prior had said, that a man had been seen to come out at the front of Mr. Kino's shop just at the time the fire broke out, and to go round and join other people in Southamp<lb/>ton Buildings, but it was not my business to say that to Mr. Kino—I had no</p>

               <p>we never knew where he was or when we might see him—if he did not send for me in the evening I should not see him before he left—the books were never locked in the safe that I know of—Mr. Kino used to keep his things there, but the paying-in book and the cheque-book were always kept in the drawer of the desk—I mean to say that on this Saturday evenings the paying-in book and the cheque-book were left out, but on the night of the fire the bought ledger was looked up with them, but no others that I know of—I cannot recollect whether I had used the bought ledger that night—I saw it after the tire at Newington Causeway; all the books were taken there after the fire—nobody signed cheques but Kino—I did not look for his private cheque-book, but I saw it when looking for other things; it was in an unlocked drawer—I did not see the books put in the safe, but I saw Mr. Kino take them out on the Monday after the fire—he took out the private ledger at the same time—I am not aware whether he was there on the Sunday—Mr. Kino called out the tickets for some time on the Saturday, and I put them down in a book, and when he wanted to go away, Davis finished—it was the custom to send goods from Holborn to the other shops, and the regular course would be to put them first into the entering-out book, which would record the date, the quantity, the destination, and the value—these trouserings were entered in that book, and this invoice was made out and addressed with the goods to the manager of the Regent Circus business—the entering-out book remained in my room—taking all Mr. Kino's books together, there is evidence that these things were not at Holborn on Saturday night—I have seen 14 sealskins at Holborn—I know the number from the stock-sheet which is here—this is the entry—the stock-sheets are not in my writing—I put down the numbers as Mr. Kino called them out: he was in the showroom because they are put down as ready-made—I had seen the sealskins there several days before—I do not know whether I knew at the time he called them out that they were not there, but I knew it afterwards—if I had known they were not there when he called them out I should not have asked a question—I think they had been sent away—they were used for dressing the window principally, but when they were not in the window I generally saw them on a shelf in the showroom; they were never kept in a show<lb/>case—I worked at Regent Circus for about 12 months—I was last there 18 months or two years before the fire—I was about two and a hall years in Kino's employ—the one lot of sealskins were passed from shop to shop, invoices were given, and they would be returned—they were generally all at Holborn.</p>

               <p>had finished I took away the sheets that had been written to carry out the amounts, and I should have done so, and completed it on the Monday—I did not expect to see Mr. Kino again till Monday—at that time I was living in Philpot Street, Commercial Road—Sinclair lived at Pad<lb/>dington, Lowe at Camberwell or Walworth, Day at Dalston, and Coupland at Chelsea—there was no usual time for our stopping at Hennekey's; we stopped there on this night till the alarm of fire was given—in consequence of that Mr. Kino met me that evening and asked me for the sheets, and I gave them back to him—it was on the Tuesday, I think, that Mr. Rouch was there—that was before I had taken down from Irving's dic<lb/>tation the account of the stock—I saw Mr. Rouch measuring pieces—at that time the paper tickets were on the pieces—Mr. Rouch compared the actual length of the pieces measured, with the lengths that appeared on the tickets, and he then said there was a deficiency in length—it was the fact that there was that deficiency—he asked Mr. Kino in my presence to account for it; Mr. Kino said that some must have been cut off—Mr. Rouch said they could not have been cut off, because the fixtures were full, and if they had been longer they could not have gone in—I ex<lb/>plained to Mr. Rouch that the large pieces had been cut off in order to go into the fixtures—Mr. Rouch asked where the pieces were—I told him there had been a pile of pieces of that kind in the showroom—that was the fact at one time, but that pile was removed to Regent Circus on the afternoon before the fire—that was not the trousering, that had gone to Regent Circus and been included in the invoice—the goods in the pile were included in the invoice—they were cut off and put there after the stocktaking, to be sent away to Regent Circus—of course if you cut 10 yards off three pieces you could put another piece in—that was the excuse given to Mr. Rouch by me—that was true so far that Mr. Kino said those pieces were in the shop at the time of the fire—he wanted to make out that they were either burnt or stolen—Mr. Rouch asked where the pile was—I did not say anything to that—I knew that they had gone to Regent Circus, and that the entering-out book and the invoice that had been sent there contained the numbers of the pieces and the quantity so sent—I did not tell Mr. Rouch that; I was not asked—if Mr. Kino had wanted to tell him he could have told him himself; it was not my place to tell him—I was asked where they were, and I said "In the showroom in a pile "—I did not tell him where they were—Mr. Kino knew, why did he not tell him? in fact Mr. Kino told me to fetch Coupland to say they were in the showroom on the night of the fire, and they were not—I and Mr. Kino and Mr. Rouch were at that time together—I cannot tell you the words Mr. Kino used, but I was to tell Coupland that he was to say there was a pile of goods in the showroom when he left on Saturday night—Mr. Rouch could not hear Mr. Kino say that;—he came on one side to me to tell me—I have stated this before to-day—I have stated before "Mr. Kino said the bales had been cut short to make them fit into the fixtures; none had been cut since the stocktaking"—I have told the truth to-day—I tell you now that they were not cut, but I might have told Mr. Rouch in Mr. Kino's presence that they were cut, in answer to a question of his—they were cut at the time of the stocktaking—the stocktaking was not finished till between 6 and 7 at night, and the pieces were at Reagent Circus that same afternoon—I had not seen the sealskins on the day on which the fire took place; I am</p>

               <p>certain about that—at the time Mr. Lovering, the trustee, was bringing an action with regard to this matter, I saw Mr. Rooke, his solicitor, or one of his clerks—I did not give him a statement in my writing of what I knew—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my writing—I don't recollect giving that to Mr. Rooke or his clerk; I don't recollect who I gave it to; I gave it to somebody some time shortly after the fire; it was in January—at that time all these matters were fresh in my memory. (<hi rend="italic">The state<lb/>ment was read to the witness</hi>.) Part of it is true, some is not; not that part which states that some of the pieces were without tickets—I don't think there were any without tickets; all the rolls had tickets on them; I swear that—none of them had any tickets on them on the second stock-taking—I said there were, to please Mr. Kino, in front of Mr. Rouch—he did not see them, and if you did not want him to see them you could easily pull the tickets off—I said "I went to Regent Circus for Coupland the stocktaker, and we tried to find one of the pieces, but could not"—that is true—we made a pretence to try and find what was not there; I mean one of the six quarter pieces, one of those that Mr. Rouch measured as haying been invoiced to Regent Circus—it is not true that on the afternoon of the fire I saw the box containing some sealskins in the cupboard in the show-room—they were never kept there—it was suggested to Mr. Rouch that they were burnt in the cupboard—I then said that I had seen them in the cupboard in the show-room on the day of the fire, and I got a piece of burnt glove and swore that was one—I told Mr. Rouch that that was part of <hi rend="italic">the debris</hi>, but he would not have it—I don't think any one else was present at that time—I saw Mr. Rouch searching among the <hi rend="italic">debris</hi>, and I went to help him, to see if I could not find the sealskin—I took down the account of the stock from Irving's dictation—at that time the original sheets which I had pre<lb/>pared were fastened together in the form of a book—business was not resumed in Holborn—I remained at Newington Causeway, not in a similar capacity; I was backwards and forwards to Holborn, and doing the Holborn books—I don't know what became of the book containing the sheets I had prepared, Mr. Kino had it—I never saw it afterwards in the form of a book—Mr. Kino afterwards gave me two sheets to add on to the second stocktaking, as an addition to the stock, leaving out the numbers—he did that at Newington Causeway—I don't know the date when the second claim was prepared—I don't know what became of the original sheets; I believe they are in Court—after I copied them I kept them in a drawer at Newington Causeway, in a private office that I was using—I believe eventually I gave them to Mr. Rouch—I can't say the date; I think it was in March—I can't say how soon it was after I was dismissed by Mr. Kino—it was about the same time—I was charged with drunkenness, and Mr. Kino had me locked up—I was bailed out by a pub<lb/>lican there—at that time these two sheets were in my possession, in my pocket—I know a man named Apsy—I very likely told him that if Mr. Rouch had known I was locked up he would have bailed me out—I think 1 was fined 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—after the case was disposed of I don't think I went back to Mr. Kino and asked for a reference—he did not refuse to have any<lb/>thing more to do with me—I don't think he paid me—a man came up to me and said that I was not discharged, but Coupland was—I think I did go back, I am almost sure I went back to Mr. Kino's employment after that—I was not discharged at that time—I might have been discharged</p>

At one time Davis lived on the premises at Holborn—the tradespeople who supplied the family while he was living there had to pass through the shop—I never heard that Mr. Kino objected to that, and I don't know that that was the reason Davis ceased to live there; I don't know what the reason was—he then went to live at Peckham; that was about nine months before the fire—I don't know how long he lived at Holborn, it was only a short time—he did not stop long at Hennekey's on this night, only a few minutes—I very likely told the Magistrate that he stayed half an hour—it was about half-past 9 that we heard the alarm of fire—his manner was agitated, he was in a hurry, and I noticed a particular difference about his hands, and I remarked it to the others—he was flurried; I can't explain it, but you notice a thing in a man's manner without being able to explain it—his hands were wet and clammy, and he was agitated—this letter (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>) is in Davis's writing, I believe—I have seen him write lots of times—I don't know his wife's writing—I don't know whose writing this is (<hi rend="italic">another letter</hi>)—this is not his handwriting, but I believe it is, by the signature; it is six years ago since I saw him write, and a man's writing may have materially altered in that time.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The witness referred to several other like instances</hi>.)

I saw Baines several times, but everything was obtained from the books—I did not go by what he told me—I got the number of yards from the invoices which Kino had retained—he was entitled to draw against his profits—the first half-year was about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the second 136<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not think there was con<lb/>siderable expenditure for furniture, I think that was all charged to the building account: 117<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was charged to the profit of his account in respect of the alterations in the half-year ending 30th December, 1877—I believe all the alterations were made that year, which is borne out by 717<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being due to the builders—I did not charge that; he charged it himself-here is "By branch establishment, Cheapside, 86<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there was an account with each of the three branch establishments, and goods were sent backwards and forwards, and that is the balance of goods sent to Cheapside over those received during 1877—on taking the accounts between Holborn on the one side and the three branch establish<lb/>ments on the other, more goods had been sent from Holborn than had been received to the amount of 2,758<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but it does not follow that the</p>

                  </hi>. I was stock-keeper to Kino before the fire at Holborn—I was engaged in taking stock in December, 1877—my duty was to receive goods from the manufacturer, enter them in the stock-book, send them to the shrinkers, and receive them back—I remember 14 seal<lb/>skins which were used to dress the window—I was at the stock-taking when they were called out and put in the claim, but they were not there—Day, the window dresser, inquired of me for them the day before the fire—I searched for them and could not find them—they were kept on a board in the show-room on the first floor; each was marked in ink on the back of the skin with separate identifying numbers in my writing—when they were called out at the stock-taking no identifying numbers were called out—I heard Day ask Davis where they were—he did not say at first, but afterwards he said that they were taken away by Mr. Kino in a cab to Newington Causeway—I saw them there a fortnight afterwards, 14 of them, and recognised them by my own writing on the backs—I made a statement to Mr. Hollams, the solicitor, in 1878—on the day of the fire, at about 6 p.m., I saw some rolls of cloth taken to Regent Circus from Holborn—invoices were sent with them—it was the custom to date the invoice on the day the goods were sent out—30 or 40 pieces</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MATTHEWS</hi>. Sealskins have gone from one establishment to another, been entered in the books, and come back—there would be nothing wrong in sealskins going from Holborn to Newington in a cab, if they were properly invoiced; I should call them out to Baines to make an invoice, and when he had done so he would enter them in his day-book—they would be put in the stock-book at the next firm they went to—the sealskins which Davis told me Kino had taken away were in the store-room the day before—his time to come to Holborn was between 11 and 12 o'clock, and he left between six and seven—the business was not opened after the fire; not in Mr. Kino's name—the order to take off the labels came from Mr. Beecroft originally—he gave no reason for that to my knowledge—he spoke to Mr. Eino and we went by Mr. Kino's instructions, who said, "Tear all the labels off"—the goods had labels on them with the first measurements, which turned out to be inaccurate—the paper labels of the first stock-taking were still on the pieces when I went downstairs on the night of the fire—Davis was on the ground-floor, close to the counting-house, waiting for us to come down; he followed us out and locked the door while we were standing on the pavement—he did not go into the trimming-room to my knowledge, but it was only a few yards away, and my back was turned—I could not see whether there was any light in the trimming-room—the lights were left burning when we went out; they used to burn all night to enable the policeman on the beat to see into the shop—there is only one door from the shop to the trimming-room, but you cannot see it from the shop, a projecting shelf hides it—you would not, from the outer door see a light in the trimming-room, unless it was close to the window; if the gas was alight in the shop, but if it was out of course you would—</p>

               <p>there is a window looking into the shop at the side of the counting-house, it has ordinary glass—the trimming-room has not another window looking on to the stairs, but there is a pigeon-hole where the work<lb/>people pass their work through—a man coming downstairs could see a light in the trimming-room through that pigeon-hole.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> A person in the street looking through the grating towards the back of the shop could not see any one go in or out of the trimming-room or see a light there—one of the lamps which was left burning was over the fixtures, and the other was on the wall; neither of them could have set the house on fire—the box containing the sealskins was taken away from Holborn, but I did not see it at Newington—I am quite sure that after the fire, some piece-goods went to Newington, not a very large quantity; the entering-out book will show—the largest quantity went to Reagent Circus.</p>

               <p>ground floor—having gone through these pieces I said to Kino "We have been going through these pieces and such and such results have ensued, can you explain it?"—he seemed very much disconcerted—he re<lb/>plied "I know they were all right on Saturday night"—I said "What has become of the deficiency, then?"—he replied "They must have been stolen"—I said "By whom?"—he said "By your firemen"—I said that was absurd, and pointed out that the pieces fitted accurately into the fixtures, and of course if anything had Seen taken out there would have been a space—he then said "Oh, I now recollect that some pieces were cut off, some 10 yards lengths were cut off and were placed in a heap in the show-room"—I said "What has become of the heap?"—he replied "They must have been burnt"—I said "Where are the remains?" and he appealed to two of his men, Baynes and Coupland, and they confirmed his statement—I then said that the matter had assumed a different aspect altogether, and I should not go on with the list that day—at Mr. Beecroft's request I met him at the Cathedral Hotel, St. Paul's Churchyard, next day, Thursday, the 3rd, with Mr. Dix, and we had a long conversation—later in the day, after I returned to my office, one of the salvage men from Holborn came to me, and in consequence of what he told me I called at Starbuck's, the packers and sworn measurers in Knightrider Street, and got two men from there, who accom<lb/>panied me to Holborn, where I saw Mr. Beecroft with Kino surrounded by his men, pulling down the pieces of cloth from the fittings and cutting off the parchment labels that were fastened on with string—I expostu<lb/>lated with Mr. Kino and pointed out that by so doing he would render it impossible for me to check the claim by the stock, because the identity of the pieces was destroyed, and that such a course would practically render the adjustment of the loss an impossibility—he replied "I shall do what I like with my own property"—Mr. Beecroft said "Mr. Kino is acting under my instructions"—I told Mr. Kino that by taking off the tickets he would certainly get himself into trouble—I also asked him what object there could be in measuring the cloth when it had been so recently measured as the preceding Saturday—be said he would take care that it was now measured to an inch—I told him I had brought two sworn measurers, and suggested that they should be permitted to measure the cloth in our presence, and that he might select if he liked 50 or 60 pieces himself taken haphazard—he said that the men I had brought should not touch it, and he gave instructions to his men to throw them out if they interfered, and I believe there was some further talk of breaking of necks—upon that, I and the men went away—I think Davis was there at the time this was going on—I should not like to swear that he was, but I believe he was—I know Mr. Kino's writing—this is his signature to the claim of 8th January (<hi rend="italic">b b</hi>)—it was sent,. I believe, to the Commercial Union, and they sent it to me—towards the end of January I and some other gentlemen went through the whole of the stock, and examined every piece; I think Mr. Dix was there, and Mr. Brown, of the firm of Brown and Collumber, and a man named Milnes—the result of our ex<lb/>amination was that there was but little damage—a very large portion of the cloth was undamaged by either fire or water, in fact there was not a particle of cloth in the place burnt at all; a comparatively small quantity was slightly damp; that has reference to the piece goods—some of the ready-made goods had been wet and had shrunk—the various estimates of</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Hoare and Son, tailors, in Holborn—in October, 1877, I was in Kino's employment at Regent Circus as clerk, and had been since July, 1876—I recollect the fire at Regent Circus in October, 1877—it arose through gunpowder—I never saw it—I heard an account of it—Franklin and Lea were there at the time—it was in the basement, of which the cutting and trimming. room is part—I went downstairs and found the door shut, and Lea and Sullivan holding the door outside; I could not go inside because the smoke was too dense—I said, "What is all this about?"—from the smell of the smoke I judged that it rose from brown paper—the smell made its way up through a window above, and a crowd collected—Kino was not on the premises—I said, "Send for him"—this was about four or five p.m.—I recollect hearing of the fire in Holborn—on that day a quantity of trouserings were sent to Regent Circus from Holborn—it was my duty to take possession of them—this alteration from 29th December, 1882, to January, 1878, is in my writing—I made it because we were stock-taking on 29th December, and the goods arriving on that day would not be included in that stock-taking, and the invoice would go into the books for the January account—if the goods came in that night they would not be stocked that night, it would be postponed till the Monday or Tuesday—Mr. Kino came to the shop on 29th December about 7.30 p.m., his usual time, to the best of my belief, and left about 7.45 or 7.50, his usual time, before we closed—since he has been brought from America on this charge I have had no opportunity of speaking to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw this invoice with the alteration this morning in Court—I have not seen it from the time I made it till then—my attention was not called to it at the time of the trial when Kino was plaintiff—I was not called; I was at Colchester—I have no memory of altering it—I can swear it is my writing—Mr. Morris asked me three or four days ago if Mr. Kino was there on the night of the 29th—I remember that night particularly, because on the Monday morning when X arrived at the warehouse I heard of the fire—there was no conversation about what time Mr. Kino had been there on the Saturday night—McKenzie, the manager, made the remark that Kino had passed down Regent Street—that was the way he always went—I said "Mr. Kino could not have been at the fire, because he went down Regent Street"—I was not at the Lord Mayor's Court at the trial about the insurance after the Regent Circus fire, nor in the neighbourhood waiting to be called—I had no subpoena—I was not aware it was going to be tried—I was in the court-yard for a very short time—I was not going to prove anything—I had never been in the basement before, and did not know what was there—I did not know of any stock being kept there, and I do not suggest that there was any—I swear that after the fire I and others did not drag some of the stock through water to make it appear that it had been injured, nor did others in my presence—I saw a heap of vests and trousers which</p>

               <p>they said had been damaged by water tying in the corner, but I did not see the water poured on—it was not poured on in my presence—I cannot remember when I saw this heap; it might have been the next day—I could not see what was damaged that night because of the smoke, and it was getting dusk when the firemen were there—the fire was confined to this place alongside the basement; the door was shut—the cutting-room is at the back—I was in the cutting-room every day—I was never in the place where the fire was in my life—I told them to open the door because I wanted to see what was the matter—I flung a bucket of water down, and it went over one of the salesmen who was below at the door—he had opened the door after I told him to; he was afraid at first—I was obliged to run away—I did nothing else to put out the fire—after the claim was settled Mr. Kino said that we had been put to some trouble and upset, and as he had the sum of 104<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and did not want to make any profit, over it, with regard to the money over the even money, he said "Take this money, McKenzie, and give them something each—I was at Regent Circus some little time after this, I cannot say how long, till the place was transferred to A. M. Kino, I believe—I was in Mr. Kino's service at the time of his liquidation—I left in November, 1878—I cannot remember how long after that the trial was—I saw the trial of Mr. Kino's action against the Insurance Companies in the papers—I may have seen an account of that alteration in the invoice in the newspapers, I believe I did, but nOt particularly—I was not asked to come forward and say how and why I had done it; I knew there was nothing wrong in the matter—I was at home at the time at Colchester attending to my father's place—I will swear I don't remember whether I was in communication with Kino's solicitor at the time—I don't remember going before a solicitor for him to take my proof—I don't think I was in communication with anybody on the subject—at the other action before the Recorder at the Lord Mayor's Court I went out of curiosity, because the other men were there—I believe it was after I left—I spoke to Kino in the yard when he came out from that trial—I believe I saw him about a day after at the Cause-way, he said he was going away to Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle, or some of those places, I don't know which he said; he did not tell me, and I did not ask him why—he did not tell me he was going abroad.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I knew afterwards that Mr. Kino did go to Birmingham; he wrote to me from there—McKenzie is dead—Franklin and Lea were employed thereat that time—after the claim was settled by the insurance company, Kino said the odd money, about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., might be divided—I think I had 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—in preparing the claim Lea called out the things, I think, and I wrote them down—after I left the Regent's Circus shop I went to the other shop, Newington Causeway, and remained in his employment there till November, 1878, and then went home to my father, a farmer at Colchester, and have been there until the last two months, when I have been in the employment I am now in—since November, 1878,1 have not seen Mr. Kino or any of his family—I was communicated with about this by Mr. Morris about three weeks ago—the engines did not come to the fire at Regent Circus; the firemen put it out with buckets—immediately the door was opened smoke filled tae cutting-room—I ran back upstairs—some water was being brought by one of the men, and I took it and said "Look out, Franklyn," and threw it over the cutting board, and it went over him—Kino paid the hands at Regent</p>

                  </hi>. I am a salesman at Birch Brothers', tailors, 52, King William Street—I was in Mr. Kino's employ at the Regent Circus shop at the time the fire broke out—Sullivan set light to some gunpowder in a vault under the street—the moment it exploded the door leading from the basement into the vault was closed, and we went to tea—while we were at tea a message came that the shop was filled with smoke—we immediately went back, and at that time the firemen had come—I did not see any fire—I saw Franklyn use water—two or three others and, I think, Branch, used some—Kino was not there at the time; we tele<lb/>graphed for him—there is telegraphic communication between the different shops.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think it was Sullivan suggested we should make the experiment to show the effect of gunpowder—Wilson, a trimmer, got it—it was put into an old ink-bottle, and then a train was laid from the bottle to the door, and Sullivan fired the train and closed the door, and there was a slight explosion—I heard it—I don't think any one outside could have heard it—it was only two or three pennyworth—we were slack—there was nothing doing, and we got up to some tricks—there had been a talk of playing off a joke on one of the clerks and putting some gunpowder under his chair and blowing him up—there was no chair in the vault—this was a preliminary experiment—there was old rubbish in the vault and sawdust and paper, and there might have been some broken wood—I think we used to throw the broken boarding down there at times—it was dark—there was a place in the ceiling where they used to put coals down, I think—there was no stock in it—I don't know what was alleged in the claim—I know there was a claim made for stock—I know stock was injured by water; I don't know how—I had to collect it together from the floor of the cutting and trimming room—the water would have to be conveyed from one end to the other—the experiment was between 4 and 5 o'clock—we had our tea about 5 o'clock—when I came back a lot of water was being thrown about by the staff and the firemen—the place was so thick with smoke you could not see what was what—I did not see anybody throw water over any stock.</p>

I am assistant to Fisher and Son, tailors, Fen-church Street—in 1877 I was in Kino's employ at Regent Circus—I remember the fire—a party, I think Wilson, brought some powder one morning—we did not exactly know what to do with it—we opened the door of the cellar under the pavement in the front of the shop, and set light to it there—I then went to tea, and while in the coffee-house some one came round and said the place was on fire, and we went back to the shop and found the place was full of smoke—the door of the cellar had been opened—there were no firemen there then—I tried to put the fire out</p>

               <p>with water which we got from the basement in a line with the door of the cellar, and threw it into the cellar—the cellar and cutting and trimming rooms were on the same level—I went for the firemen, and they came and threw more water—the water saturated the whole of the basement—there were a lot of cloths hanging up there—I could not say if any goods were wetted—I telegraphed for Kino and he came about half an hour afterwards—I did not tell him about the gunpowder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was perhaps a week ago that I first told anybody about the gunpowder—I don't know to this day that Mr. Kino knows about it—Sullivan set the gunpowder alight, I believe, with a wax taper—there was about an ounce—the bottle, which was a threepenny or four-penny ink bottle, broke—nothing was burning to my knowledge when I left the cellar; it was merely old brown paper and shavings and saw-dust—the bottle was laid on its side, and the gunpowder came up to the mouth—it was a long bottle—the mouth was in the centre of it—I should think the train was about four feet—this paper is Branch, the clerk's, writing, as nearly as I can recollect.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor—in December, 1877, on the Satur<lb/>day of the fire, I went to Kino's shop for some work—about 10 yards before I got there I saw Mr. Davis lock the outside gate, and saw several gentlemen, five yards off, crossing the road—I asked Davis whether I was too late, or whether he had got any trade for me; he said I was too late, but told me to wait a few minutes till he came out of the public-house—I saw him go in, and he came out in six or seven minutes, and said "It is very slack to-night; I have not a coat to give you to be made; I am going down to Newington Causeway, and if you like to come with me I will see if I can find you a job there"—that was in Holborn, right opposite Mr. Kino's shop—we went just a little bit higher up, and then we crossed the road and took an omnibus at the corner of a street I can't tell the name of; we got out at the Elephant and Castle and went to Kino's shop in Newington Causeway—he left me in the shop and went a little higher up, to the governor, I think, and came back and said "You will just go out again; round the corner you will find a little court; go to the first door and you will find a little room and a lot of 'hands' sitting"—I went there, and Davis came and spoke through a little window, and two coats were passed by another man through a pigeon-hole to me, to make by Monday morning, and I made them and gave them to the cutter at the same place at 10 o'clock—some of the Hands then said that there was a fire, and the Holborn place was burnt down; that was the first I heard of the fire—I asked the man who gave me the coats if it was true; he said "Yes, you have no occa<lb/>sion to go there, we will find you a job here"—I worked there about</p>

               <p>three months after that Saturday—since then I have been working for Mr. Groves in the New Cut—on 27th May this year I heard that this trial was going to happen, when I was at a benefit for a poor man, of which this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the circular, and of my own accord I sought out the solicitor for the defence—I have had no communication with Davis since I left.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had had work before from Mr. Kino, first at Cheapside, then at Holborn, and then at Newington Causeway—I never worked at Newington Causeway till I went in the omnibus with Davis, but I did afterwards, and the work was given to me through the little hole—no paper of this sort (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was given to me to sign—I never saw a paper of that sort used—there was always a paper, but not like this—the workman's name was not on it; I swear that—I cannot tell whether the date was on it, because I cannot read or write—I mean to swear that; I wish I could—work was given out every day in the week, including Saturday, but not on Sunday—I was always employed on coats, and made them at home and took them back—I went into Kino's house on this night and saw him there—Davis spoke to him and then told me to go round the corner—a lot of boys, girls, and men were there, but no one who I can name; they might have seen me—I might know the man who gave me the work through the hole, if I saw him again—I was there three months, but I was not six times in the place—I understand that it was Mr. Maynard or Monard who gave me the work—I don't know how he was able to know to whom he had given the work—I did not see him make any entry—he gave me a paper partly written and partly printed, with the coat—I took part of it back, which was the check, and kept a little piece with the price I was to be paid for it—I had to have it read for me—the check named the price of that coat, but it did not always—I can't recollect what I was paid because it is so long ago—he is the Mr. Maynard who spoke to me on Monday morning about the fire; he was the only man I heard it from—I had been in the habit of going to Holborn to get jobs before the fire, for several months, and I kept a girl who I sent regularly; I cannot tell you her name now—I have been in London 14 years, and know Holborn very well, but I could not tell you which is Chancery Lane—I have not been in that neighbourhood for years, only once or twice since I left Holborn—I have been working for Mr. Groves, of the New Cut, for nine years—I do not know my exact height, I never measured.</p>

I am a coach painter, and an American by birth; my age is 22—in August last I was living in Birgin Street, Brooklyn, and was working for Meritts, of Bedford Avenue, Brooklyn—Daniel O'Connor asked me if I would join a society of which he was a member—he did not tell me the object of the society then; he told me afterwards, when I was initiated a member—that was about the 15th of the month—he said the object of the society was "the freedom of Ireland by force alone"—it was the Emeraid Club Branch of the Fenian Brother<lb/>hood—I was taken to Second Street, Bowery, to the Oddfellows' Hall—I went into an ante-room, and found no one but O'Connor there—he took me into the meeting-room, and there I found about 30 men, who were strangers to me—those men were known by numbers and not by their</p>

               <p>names—I was taken to the presiding officer, whose name was Thomas Burns—I was "given" an oath, some of which I recollect—it was that I should stand by the watchword, obey my superior officers, and preserve the funds of the "Brotherhood"—I kissed the book after I had taken the oath—the presiding officer repeated the words to me, and I followed them after him—I paid two dollars as an entrance fee, and subsequently 10 cents a week for dues—the meetings were weekly, and I attended them about twice a month—a treasurer received the money; I don't know his name; his number was "82"—I did not see other persons take the oath, but I saw some men pay money—members were proposed at times, and they were elected by ballot; this and the payment of money was all the business I saw done—the watchword was "Providence," and the word you had to repeat before you could enter the room—the word was changed once or twice—I was informed of the change of word at one of the meetings—my name and address were taken down—I knew Burns's, name by conversation with my friend who took me there—he was a porter in a house in New York, and his number was 10—my number was 113—there were a vice-president, a secretary, and a recording secretary—two men named Sullivan were there, but I was not very well acquainted with them, only by seeing them at the meetings—the number of the recording secretary was 13—I heard the name mentioned as "the Old Man"—he was supposed to be O'Donovan Rossa—a friend said to me, "You were not not here last week?"—I said "No"—he said "Well, the 'Old Man' was here"—I did not know who he meant, and I inquired, when he replied, "Why, don't you know; it is Rossa"—there were several otherclubs—there were the Esperanza, the Sarsfield, the Thomas Davis, the Michael Davitt, the Tom Moore, the Emmett, and others—'there were members of the Emerald Club who were known as district members—we, the ordinary members, were to go by their orders if any were given by them—no district members were known to us—I continued a member until the begin<lb/>ning of March, following my trade all the time—on 6th March I received directions from Burns—he gave me a letter, and told me to take it to Dr. Gallagher, of Green Point, Brooklyn—I took the letter the next evening to the address given in Brooklyn—his name was over the door as a medical man, "Dr. Thomas Gallagher"—Gallagher himself opened the door—I asked him if the doctor was in, and he said "Yes; come inside"—I entered the parlour, and Gallagher read the letter—he asked me if I was working, and I said "Yes"—he asked my name—I told him William J. Lynch—he said "You are wanted to go to London"—I asked what for, and he replied, smiling, "You'll know when you get there"—I said "I would rather he excused, as I have my mother and sister to maintain"—he observed "You'll be back in two months, and your mother will be seen to whilst you are away"—he told me to stop work the next day, and to come and see him on the Friday (March 9th)—he told me not to tell any one, not even my mother, that I was going away—I saw him again on the Friday, at nine o'clock in the morning, and told him what I had done, quitted work—he gave me 50 dollars, and told me to purchase a ticket for Liverpool; that I was to go in another name, and so I selected "Norman"—he told me to call again after I had purchased my ticket—I bought a ticket for the steam-ship Spain, at the office of the steamboat company, the same afternoon—the same evening I met Burns, the presiding officer—he asked me if I went to Gallagher's, and I said</p>

               <p>"Yes"—he added "The 'Old Man' will see you righted"—I knew of no one to whom that referred except O'Donovan Rossa—I went to Gallagher's house again, and showed him my ticket filled in with the name "William J. Norman"—he gave me 100 dollars, and told me when I got to London I was to inquire for the American Exchange, and leave a letter then for him with my address on it—he gave me a box wrapped up in paper—I did not return home that night, but slept at an hotel—on the morning of Saturday I went on board the Spain, and reached Liverpool on Tues<lb/>day the 20 th—I opened the box on the voyage the first day—I found a coil spring in it, with a piece of lead at the bottom—I do net know whether the spring was of steel or iron—the box wan about six or seven inches in length, and two or three inches wide, with a sliding cover on it—I broke it up, and threw it and the spring overboard—I remained at Liverpool until the 22nd—I stayed at the Temperance Hotel, kept by Mr. Cooper—I gave the name of Norman there—I had no luggage and nothing but the clothes I was wearing—I purchased a suit in Liverpool from a Mr. Fitzgerald, a tailor—a hat I bought from Mr. Jackson—on the 22nd I came to London and arrived at Euston—I stayed at Edwards's Hotel, Euston Square—on the 24th I wrote a letter and left it for Thomas Gallagher at the American Exchange—in the letter was my address, "William J. Norman, Edwards' Hotel, Euston Square"—I called at the Exchange nearly every day and read the newspapers there—in the afternoon of the 26th or 27th I saw Thomas Gallagher there—we went out for a walk, and he took me down Whitehall—I had never been in London before—on reaching the place where the explosion was (I had seen the place before, on the Good Friday) I said "This is where the explosion was"—he replied, "It is a bad job for us"—I said "Is that what we are going to do?"—he said, "Yes; and it will not be child's play"—we passed over Westminster Bridge, half-way, and on passing the House of Commons he said "This will make a great' crash when it comes down"—we returned the same way, and passed again up White-hall, on the Scotland Yard side of it—Gallagher said "This is Scotland Yard, the headquarters of the detectives of London; that will come down too"—he told me he was staying at the Charing Cross Hotel, and asked me if I wanted some money—I said "Yes, a little," and he gave me between 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in English money, and said "Do not let yourself run short; the Old Man will see you all right"—I gave him a card of Edwards's Hotel, where I was stopping, similar to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—for a day or two after that I did not see him again—it was the morning after the 27th that I saw him—I was in bed at my hotel, and after I got up I went out with him—he told me he was going out of the city, and merely dropped in to see me—he told me to remain where I was—I did not see him again until Monday, 2nd April, about nine in the morn<lb/>ing, at my hotel—we went out together, but I cannot mention the names of the streets we visited—he said, "I want you to go to Bir<lb/>mingham this morning, to 128, Ledsam Street, and inquire for Albert Whitehead, and tell him I have sent you for the material"—he gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and told me to get a respectable-looking trunk and to put the staff in—this was the first time I had heard Whitehead's name—I left London between eleven and twelve in the forenoon—before going I saw the proprietor of Edwards's Hotel, and arranged that I should keep the room, and send a telegram whether I should return that night—I</p>

               <p>requested the boots to. meet me at the station—I went to Bimingham and found 128, Ledsam Street, with "A. G. Whitehead" over the door—it was a small shop fronting the street, and in the window were paper and paints—I did not see much stock in the shop-at first I saw a lad named Crowder, and I asked him if Mr. Whitehead was about—White-head came from a room behind—I said to him "Dr. Gallagher has seat me from London for the material"—he said "What are you going to take it in?"—I said "He told me to buy a respectable-looking trunk"—he; said "Why you can't take it in a trunk, you want rubber bags," and he told me to go to Harris's, in the Bull-ring, where I could buy one, if not he thought I could not purchase rubber bags of the kind anywhere else in Birmingham—I went to Harris's, he had no rubber bag, but the clerk told me they had some rubber bottles, and he gave me this book of prices (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I returned and showed the prices to Whitehead—he said "You will have to return without it and tell him you want rubber bags"—I telegraphed to Edwards's "I will not be at home to-night," and remained at Birmingham—on Tuesday morning, the 3rd April, I left Birmingham by the 2 o'clock train—on arriving in London I went to the American Exchange, wrote a letter and left it for Dr. Gallagher, and a second. letter I left for him at the Charing Cross Hotel—I found that he had called at my hotel and was handed a telegram that was sent by him (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was as follows: "Fletcher to W. J. Norman. Call at Charing Cross Hotel and ask for me"—I did not know he had passed by the name of Fletcher, only when he called on me—I went to the Charing Cross Hotel and saw him in room 312—I told him what had occurred the night before between me and Whitehead—he gave me a rubber bag wrapped in paper, and said "The chap he sent there that morning did not nave a bag; go to Birmingham again the first thing in the morning. Take the bag to Whitehead's"—the next morning I went to Birmingham accordingly—I told Mr. Crowe, the proprietor of Edwarda's Hotel, that I was not coming back and was going to leave—Gallagher had told me I had better leave the place and he would take a room for me as a medical student, the same as the other—I was to send him a telegram stating what time I should reach London on returning, and he would meet me at the depot—I left my portmonteau at Edwards's—I took nothing with me to Birmingham except the bag—I saw Whitehead at his shop, about middle day—I gave him the rubber bag—he took me into the balk room; he had a funnel, and I held the funnel whilst he poured the stuff in the bag—he took it out of some carboys that were there—it looked like buttermilk—I asked him what it was, and he said "You'll very soon know; a chap was here this morning and he took away about 20lb of it in some rubber stockings or leggings"—my bag was pretty nearly full—he told me I had better go to Snow Hill and get a trunk, and I did so—I bought a wooden box with a partition in it—the partition was taken out and left at Whitehead's—this is the trunk (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) the bag con<lb/>taining the nitro-glycerine was. placed in the box, and I locked it and drove with it to the railway station, at Birmingham—I telegraphed to Gallagher on my arrival there, "I leave in the six, will be at Euston nine"—the six meant the 6 o'clock train.—the box was labelled and left in the charge of the porter to go up as ordinary luggage—the bag pretty well fitted the trunk, pretty tight.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKE</hi>. I first appeared as a prisoner in the police-court on 6th or 7th April—I had been there twice before I wrote the letter—Gallagher, Ansburgh, and Wilson were in custody with me—I knew that Whitehead was in custody—I wrote this note to Langrish: "Friend Langrish, I would like to see you this afternoon, something of importance. W. T. Norman, April 10," and I believe Langrish came next day and I made the statement—Superintendent Williamson was with him—I then wrote this letter: "Millbank, April 14. Mr. Langrish. Come and see me at once, come alone"—he came alone and I told him a little more—on the first occasion I told him everything that had occurred in England and New York except the names of the clubs—before I was called as a witness on the 19th I made a statement of what I could prove, and signed it in Mr. Pollard's presence—nobody told me that the information I gave to Langrish was not sufficient—I am 23 years old—I was never in Ireland—I have not interested myself much in politics, nor read a great deal about Irish politics—I do not know whether the population has diminished—I never heard of an Irish Parliament or that Ireland had a Parliament in the last century under the authority of the Crown of this country—I have heard addresses in New York on the condition and government of Ireland, but not at the clubs—I learnt from those addresses that there was a movement to obtain a Parliament for Ireland such as the Land League wish to have, which was to meet on St. Stephen's Green—I was informed when I entered the Fenian Brotherhood that their object was the freedom of Ireland by force alone, and to have a republican brotherhood there—the presiding officer told me that, and it was part of the oath—I have on three different occasions been asked to give the terms of that oath—I have not till to-day said a syllable about the republic being mentioned in the oath—I cannot remember all that was told me in the oath—I gave all the in<lb/>formation that I thought of at the police-court, but I have <hi rend="italic">minded</hi> that since—Thomas Burns was the president of the club—O'Connor lived is Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn—I can't give you the number—I never saw any one sworn in or go through what I did—the meetings occupied one hour—they were weekly, no refreshments were served—the members were proposed by name, but I cannot remember any but those of Burn and the two Sullivans—they were known by numbers—I had never belonged to any secret society before—I cannot say when the fenian</p>

               <p>Brotherhood was founded—I only belonged to the Emerald Club—when I left New York I had no knowledge of the purpose for which I was coming to this country—I have never entertained any designs against the life of the Queen—I have never been associated with any plot for an insurrection in Ireland or England—I do not want anything in the way of alteration in the government of Ireland—I should be as well satisfied with an Irish Parliament on St. Stephen's Green as with a republic—I don't mind whether it is the one or the other, it's no odds to me; it would not benefit me if Ireland was free to-morrow—that is the view I hold about it.</p>

I am one of the firm of Judson and Sons, manu<lb/>facturing chemists, of Liverpool Street, Birmingham—on 22nd or 23rd February, Whitehead called and asked the price of nitric and sulphuric acids—I told him 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for nitric and 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for sulphuric—I <hi rend="italic">axed</hi> him what he wanted it for; he said that he was opening a shop for selling small quantities—I showed him a sample of nitric acid—he asked if I could make it stronger; I told him the strongest was 78 to 80 by the hydro<lb/>meter,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188305280126"/>
               <p>and tested it in his presence—he asked if we could make it stronger—I told him that was the strength I usually sent out, and I would not make it stronger for any one—he gave me an order for, I believe, two carboys of nitric acid, which is 120lb. to 130lb., and three of sulphuric, which is 170lb. to 200lb,—he agreed to pay cash, gave his name, Whitehead; 178, Ledsam Street, and I sent the goods next day, and my clerk, Mr. Heath, went to receive the money; and brought it back to me—on 6th March another order was given for two more carboys of nitric and four of sulphuric, and Mr. Heath attended to the delivery—on 14th March another order was given for two carboys of nitrio and four of sulphuric, and Mr. Heath attended to the delivery—Whitehead came, I believe, the next day and complained of the colour of the nitric acid, and said that it was not of the strength he bought it for—I told him it was perfectly correct, for I. had tested it myself, and suggested that I should send a man to the shop to test it—he agreed to that, and I sent Mr. Glynn with him with the hydrometer to test it—they returned together and Whitehead said that it was quite correct—on 28th March there was a further delivery of two carboys of nitric and four of sulphuric, and Mr. Heath attended as usual—on 4th April there was another delivery of three carboys of nitric, and, I think, three of sulphuric, and Mr. Heath attended to that—the total was 11 carboys of nitric, or 1,543lb., and 16 of sulphuric, making about 3,006lb., all paid for by cash on delivery, and the money brought back by my clerk.</p>

I am clerk at the American Exchange, 449, Strand—I know Thomas Gallagher—he is the farthest from the Jury box—he first registered at the Exchange on 8th November last year—I have the register—he entered his name and address in it, "Dr. Thomas Gallaher, Brooklyn, staying at the Midland Grand Hotel"—on 24th November he called again and took a ticket of membership for one month, for which he paid in advance—during that period I saw him on several occasions at the Exchange—I can't exactly remember the last time I saw him, but I think it was some time in December—I saw him again on 27th March this year—on that occasion he signed the register, u Thomas Gallaher, New York, Charing Cross Hotel"—he spelt the name without the "g" on both occasions—on this occasion I gave him a ticket of membership for one month—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the ticket I gave him (<hi rend="italic">This was dated March</hi> 27<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1883, <hi rend="italic">and signed "Thomas Gallaher"</hi>—the member signs the ticket for identification of signature—I do not remember whether he stated on that occasion where he had come from—I would not be positive whether he mentioned any vessel, but I know that I got to know in some way, whether from him or not, that he came in the Parthia—after that, 27th March, he came to the Exchange frequently—about 30th March a telegram came—he did not speak to me about that one—I took one in not addressed to him, but in another name—to the best of my belief Ansburgh came to the Exchange two or three times—I had no conversation with him.</p>

I have been in the force 17 years—I got to know about nitro-glycerine in this way: I have been very fond of electricity, and I used to attend the science schools on electricity—nitro-glycerine was not a part of the lectures, but sulphuric acid and nitric and was, and it came up one evening that those two acids and glycerine would make nitro-glycerine—that was not the reason why I entered the shop, but after what I was told had gone there it roused my suspicion—it is a very uncommon thing for those engaged in painting to wear two pairs of trousers and two waistcoats; it is very seldom that painters or drysalters wear anything but a green baize apron—I never saw them wear two pairs of trousers, only overalls—I never lived in a mining district—I nave heard that a great deal of dynamite is used in England made of nitro-glycerine in stone quarries where they explode—I replaced the stick against the door when I came out—to do so I put my arm through a large hole in the door that was cut for a letter box—I have no knowledge of the strength of sulphuric or nitric acid necessary for making nitro-glycerine—there was one dirty shirt in the cupboard, but no clean things—there was one brush in the cupboard—I never said that there was no brush.</p>

Wilson" each written twice—it also contained the railway time-table from Euston to Liverpool—on the last page but one is "A.S. 12," "6 A.N."—I found the letter produced, signed Henry J. Wilson, and dated from 17, Nelson Square, Blackfriars, April 2, 1883:—"Dear Friend,—"If you are not otherwise engaged, I would like to have the pleasure of your company at one of the theatres this evening. I will be at the place decided upon to meet on any such occasion at 6.30." Signed "H.J. Wilson"—I also found a grocer's card at Ledsam Street, and it has "Thos. G., Charing Cross," written in red ink on the back of it—there was a piece of paper with "G" written on it three or four times, followed by "Charing †," and then "dun" written after the cross—on another piece of paper are the figures "420," and then "Manh.," the beginning of Manhattan—just underneath is "G," and the rest torn off—I also found a list of some shirts purchased of Lewis, of 6, Ranelagh Street, Liverpool, and this envelope (<hi rend="italic">an American one</hi>); this receipt for sulphuric and nitric acid supplied by Judson, and another for the salters' scales and tin funnel—I showed some of the jars I found to Mr. Truro—I also found the partitions of a box which had been produced and a portmanteau which Norman has spoken of—I find in this pocket-book something in cypher which has not been deciphered.</p>

               <p>table—Wilson said, "You bad totter look and see"—I drew it out—the key was in the lock—I opened it, and found on one side of it what seemed to be two bags, but they turned oat to be indiarubber fishing stockings full of some liquid—I said "At this appears to be an explosive substance, you will be detained until some more specific charge is pre<lb/>ferred against you"—Wilson made no reply, but Gallagher said, "what am I to be detained for? I know nothing about this; I only met this young man for the first time this morning"—I asked Wilson his name, be said "Henry Hay ward Wilson"—the other gave his name as Dr. Thomas Gallagher, room 312, Charing Cross Hotel—I found on Wilson between 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi> and 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money—there were three empty clean india rubber bags in the room, and in the pocket of a pair of Wilson's trousers was this small spring (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—an under waistcoat of Wil<lb/>ton's was found saturated with something—it was wet in portions at from some oily matter, and was taken to Mr. Hake, the assistant to Dr. Dupre at Westminster Hospital—I searched Gallagher and found on him 115<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Bank of England notes—most of them were stamped "Colgate and Son, New York"—I also found upon him 2,345 dollars in American notes—I afterwards found a letter of credit at the hotel for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in the roan I saw found two indiarubber bags and a' pair of fishing stockings, a glare thermometer, a bill of Lewis's, Liverpool, for a suit supplied to Wilson, some of the American Exchange tickets signed by himself 27th March, cards of Edwards's, Sevage's, and Delamotte's Hotels, a business card of Cow, Hill, and Co. an envelope and letter ad<lb/>dressed to Thomas Gallagher, American Exchange, London, and bearing the Glasgow post mark, April 4th, and a draft advertisement, "Wanted, Furnished Apartments, with stable for two hones and carriage, &amp;c., apply to J. G., American Exchange"—I arrested Curtin on 7th April, in Euston Square, about 11 a.m., whilst walking towards the station from Woburn Place—I called him by the name of Curtin—he turned, and I said that we were officers of the police, and must take him to the police station—he said "What am I arrested for?"—I said "At present I cannot say you are arrested, but I wish you to go with me"—I put him in a cab, and took him to Scotland Yard, where he was seen by Superinten<lb/>dent Williamson, who asked his name and address—he said "John Curtin, Upper Woburn Place," and that he came from New York on 6th February on board the Egypt, landed at Queenstown, went to Fermoy, his native place, to see his parents, and then went to Glasgow, where he worked in the Clyde Shipbuilding Yard, and lived at 36, West Milton Street—he was asked his address in New York—he said "301, East Fifty-Ninth street"—he was asked to account for his connection with Dr. Gallagher, of Charing Cross Hotel—he said, "I don't know such a person"—he was then asked why he Wrote to him, and he replied that he never had—he was shown the letter which I bad got from Charing Cross Hotel—he opened and looked at it, and said he never wrote it—I have seen Curtin write his name and address since he has been in custody, and I believe the letter to have been written by him: (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>) "Dear Sir,—I arrived here yesterday and am stopping at 12, Woburn Place, till I hear from you. Let me hear as soon you can. Yours truly, John Curtin." This post-office order signature is also in Curtin's writing—I took him to Bow Street and he was charged.</p>

Colgate and Co., New York, March 10, 1883—twelve out of the seventeen are stamped in that way—I produce the letter of credit and the printed cards "Thomas Gallagher, 420, Manhattan Avenue, Brooklyn"—then are two orders for the House of Commons, one dated 16th November, no year, and the other 17th November, 1882; also a map of Bimingham and one of London—I don't observe any marks on the map of London—on taking Curtin into custody I found on him a pawn-ticket for a watch and Albert, pledged at Vaughan's in the Strand for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 7th April this year—I was at Bow Street when Whitehead was brought up from Birmingham—after his examination before the Magistrate Whitehead and the other prisoners were in the passage of the Court, Curtin recognised Whitehead and shook hands with him—on Sunday, 8th April, I went with other officers to Savage's Hotel, 38, Blackfriars Road, about 12 o'clock, I saw there Ansburgh—I told him that we were officers of police, and requested him to accompany me to Scotland Yard—he said "What am I arrested for?"—I said "At present I cannot say that you are arrested"—I took him to Scotland Yard with his luggage, * both these and at Savage's Hotel there was some conversation between him and Inspector Williamson—I asked him to say what he was doing in this country—he said "Why should I give any explanation of what I am doing here?"—he was told by Superintendent Williamson that anything that might happen to him would be his own fault if he did not give some explanation of himself—he said he came from America—he gave me, is that, no explanation of where he came from—I showed him this photo<lb/>graph (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) of Thomas Gallagher at the hotel—he said "Who is that?"—I said "Your friend Dr. Gallagher"—he said "I don't know it"—he was detained in custody and searched, and a small sum of money was found on him—when I first saw Gallagher he was shaven all but a small moustache and slight side-whisker—Wilson wrote the whole of this document in my presence except the "M 36" at the top, and signed it—I find the name "Henry Wilson" written on the first page and several times in this book (<hi rend="italic">this was the book produced by Black, which was found with the pencil and telegram on Whitehead</hi>), in the handwriting of Wilson to the best of my belief—there is also some writing in pencil which appears to be in Wilson's handwriting—the pencil letter of 2nd April is also in his writing, and so is the telegram No. 183, "Harry Wilson to Gallagher, Charing Cross Hotel, April 3rd, 1883, 5.45—sorry cannot see you to-day, have to call on Alfred, will see you to-morrow evening"—on this ticket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) there is part of a "W," and red pencilling—Wilson's portmanteau was brought to Scotland Yard from Woolwich after the stuff had been taken out of it—I directed the officer Melntyre to take the labels off—I did not actually see him do it, but afterwards he handed it back to me, and I told him to paste it on separate pieces of paper—it was the portmanteau I had seized at 17, Nelson Square—Dowell took it to Woolwich.</p>

I reside in Milton Street, Glasgow, and am by trade an iron dresser—I know Thomas Gallagher; I saw him in the autumn of last year in my house—I think he was born in Scotland—I have known him about twenty years—he went to America about fifteen or sixteen years ago—when I saw him in November he said he had come from America on a pleasure trip to see his friends—I know John Curtin; I saw him first in February last—he came to me where I was working, the Sun Foundry, and brought a note with him—it purported to come from Thomas Gallagher—I understood from Curtin that he had come from America—I asked him how Thomas Gallagher was getting on, but he seemed to know very little about him—I tried to get him employment in the Clyde Shipbuilding Yard, and I succeeded in doing so—on the 2nd of March he went to see his sister at Blackburn, and on the 7th he returned to Glasgow and continued to work until Saturday the 12th—he left on Saturday 17th—he said he was going back to his employer to see if he would start him again—be stayed at my house until 4th April—he left in the evening and took a ticket for Blackburn—the carriage into which he got was marked for Liverpool—he told me he had written to his father and mother in Ireland for money on Monday, and had got some from them on Wednesday—he did not tell me how much, but he told my wife—I was not present—she is not here—she goes by her maiden name, Johnson—he left on that Wed<lb/>nesday night, taking two bags with him, and I did not see him again till he was in custody—Bernard Gallagher came twice to my house and saw Curtin—he was there between 6 and 7 o'clock on the day he left, but they did not know each other till I introduced them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The note was to get employment for Curtin—he went out several times to look for employment and spent several hours some days in doing so—he told me he was disappointed that he could not get employment, and had tried very hard to induce some one to take him on again—he told me he had a sister living at Blackburn—he stopped at my house all the time he was at Glasgow, and behaved well and steadily.</p>

We stayed one night in Liverpool; from there we went to London to see somebody, but did not see anybody. We left there and came to Glasgow by boat, after staying two days in London. We remained in Glasgow two days, and sailed from Liverpool in the Germania, White Star Line, from Liverpool. I was only two days in New York, and my brother the doctor brought me back and sent me to Glasgow to tell James Curtin to go to London. I know all of them; my brother told me about them. I don't belong to any of the two schools in New York or here either, or any school having any connection with dynamite. I heard talk of Whitehead and Oxford, or a name like that. A young man came over in the boat on the last occasion; he belonged to the school, and he went to London; I don't know his name. I don't believe the gas work was done with this school, but an Irish lot; I heard my brother say so.

There are a lot of rich men in the school in New York; I have nothing to do with them, and all I had to do was to tell Curtin to go to London. If taken to London I will identify them and tell all I know"—I read it to him, and he said that it was correct—on 13th April I received a further letter from him—I cautioned him again and he said, "I know Murphy in the case and Normack, or a name like that; those are the only two I know more than I told you of before; I might know more of them if I saw them"—I took that down—he said at another time that O'Donovan Rossa was the head of one of of the schools in America—he referred to his brother in America, who had told him some part of the statement.</p>

               <p>in the chemical department I saw a portmanteau containing these two large fishing-stockings, waterproof—I opened them, took samples of their contents, and gave the bottles to Dr. Dupre's assistant—they contained nitro-glycerine; a thick, comparatively colourless, liquid—there was also some liquid floating upon it of rather a pink colour; it probably came from the colouring matter in the stockings—there were about 40lb. in each stocking—indiarubber stockings would greatly facilitate the carriage and increase the safety—Mr. Brown handed me another sample, it was nitro-glycerine, and was given to Donnegan—I saw the waterproof bag a few days after at the Home Office Magazine, Woolwich—it was empty, but it would contain about 300lb. of nitro-glycerine—on the 6th I went to Birmingham with Dr. Dupre to 128, Ledsam Street; the name of Whitehead was over the door—we examined what we found on the premises on the 6th, 7th, and 10th—the manufacture of nitro-glycerine had undoubtedly been carried on at those premises—it was in progress—it is formed by the action of nitric and sulphuric acids and glycerine—nitric acid is the important agent—the sulphuric acid acts as concentrator of the nitric acid—the proportions are broadly, four of sulphuric by weight, two of nitric, and something less than one of glycerine; four of sulphuric, two of nitric, and one of glycerine would make 2lb. of nitro-glycerine—the sulphuric acid acts in taking up the water, and is after<lb/>wards washed out as well as the excess of nitric—the explosive power is produced by the combination of the nitrogen with carbon—we found on the premises a quantity of nitric and sulphuric acid and glycerine, and two lots of nitro-glycerine completely manufactured, which I estimated at 160 or 170lb.—one lot was in a carboy, and there was about 30lb. of it floating on the acids in a pan in course of manufacture—all I found of manufactured nitro-glycerine was about 200lb., nitric acid over 600lb., sulphuric 700lb., and glycerine 112lb.—there was a place for a furnace, a domestic copper, and carboys, and everything necessary for the manufac<lb/>ture—except for the purpose of destruction, the only object I know for which nitro-glycerine is used, is as a medicine in very minute doses—it is used for mining purposes, but not by itself—it is only used in this country when mixed with an inert base, and it is my duty to see that the statute is carried into effect—persons would not be allowed to have any quantity in their possession without a licence, nor would they be licensed—I think almost any known building would be destroyed with a less quantity than 200lb. if applied properly, and many lives—I inspected the Local Government Board after the explosion of 15th March, and have no doubt that it was caused by a nitro-compound, and I believe nitro-glycerine—I believe 20lb. would do it—it was massive stone-work and very strongly built.</p>

I am professor of chemistry at Westminster Hospital—I give advice to the Home Office about explosive sub<lb/>stances—on 5th April I received a bottle labelled "A" and a bottle or bag labelled "B"—one contained nitro-glycerine of the strongest kind, but not washed sufficiently pure—it was an explosive, it was as strong as it could be—the other bottle contained a very dilute solution of nitric and sulphuric acid—I agree with the statement of Colonel Majendie as to what was found in the house, Ledsam Street, Birmingham—I went there with him—nitro-glycerine is the most powerful explosive which can be practically used—there are others more powerful, but they are so dangerous you cannot handle them—here is an entry in this book (<hi rend="italic">found at Whitehead's</hi>): "A. S. 12"—I hold that to mean "acid sulphuric 12," and this "6 A. N." I read "acid nitric," "Gr. = 2" I read "gravity equals 2," "C. P. 3" I cannot make out, "1 A. 1.47" I take to be "nitric acid of the specific gravity of 1.47," the next is "3 S. A.," that is "sulphuric acid 1.66," that would be rather weak—temperature 450 would be the temperature to which you could carry the nitro-glycerine in manufacture, the utmost limit—I do not know what "soak 5" means—I agree with Colonel Majendie as to the powerful effects that nitro-glycerine would have in destroying property—200lb. would destroy almost any building—the proportions given here are those given in some manuals—I do not know whether this is "G. V." or "G. 2," but "Gly. 2." would be the exact proportion.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">not at all doubt that there must be something that comes within the fair con<lb/>struction, of the words 'levying of war.' To make out this indictment against the prisoners at the bar, they must be proved to have been guilty of something which, without violence of language, would come within the words 'levying of war.' The words 'levying of war' are words general and descriptive. It is obvious that war may be levied in very different ways, and by very different means, in different ages of the world. And the judges have never attempted to say that there could not be a 'levying of war' in any other way than in the way brought before them in earlier times. They have never professed or attempted to give any exhaustive definition, or to say that there were certain modes in which the words of the statute should be interpreted, or that those were the only fashions of making war. I am of opinion that it is enough to say, in this case, if the Jury should be of opinion that the prisoners, or any of item have agreed among themselves that some one, of them should destroy the property of the Crown, and destroy or endanger the lives of the Queen's sub<lb/>jects by explosive materials, such as it is suggested lives been made use of; and if they should be further of opinion that such acts have been made out then the prisoners are guilty of treason-felony within the meaning of this Act. I agree that we are thrown back to the words of the earlier statute; but they must receive a reasonable interpretation. As I suggested in the course of the argument, if three men with these explosive materials did the same acts with the same objects as it required</hi> 3,000 <hi rend="italic">men to do in an earlier period, when it was a 'levying of war,' it seems to me that the acts of the three men to-day are equally a</hi> '<hi rend="italic">levying of war.'"</hi>

I hold that the evidence against me does not in any way support the charge of treason-felony or conspiracy. Take all the evidence, both true and false, and I hold there is no particle in all of it combined, to prove that I in<lb/>tended to compass, imagine, invent, devise, or intend to depose the Queen from her Royal authority as Queen of Great Britain. I hold there is no particle of evidence to prove the charge that I intended to levy war against on 8th February I rented the premises, 128, Ledsam Street, that I paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in advance according to usual custom, and the remainder of the rent at the expiration of the month. The second witness states that in the beginning of last February I purchased some oil, acid, colours, glycerine, brushes and various other articles, and that I paid for them. The next states that I purchased some acids from Judson and Son, and that they were paid for and delivered. The next that I bought some pottery ware in Birmingham, and that was also paid for by me. The next, that I purchased oil, glycerine, turpentine, and other stuff, which was delivered, and I paid for it. The boy who stated that he attended my shop has told you that one day he heard a noise, he thought that it sounded something like a gun or a pistol; it was in the back premises, and that he went there, but saw no gun or pistol; and on another occasion he said that he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188305280152"/>
               <p>saw a man come into my shop, and go into the back shop, and he did not see him come out again. He saw that he had a valise, and that was all. The next witness said that he bought a brush of me, and paid me for it, and that when he did so he saw that my finger nails were discoloured; that I wore two suits of clothes. The next witness states that the copy of a telegram was found in a telegraph office in London, addressed to White-head. That is not treason-felony. The next witness states that there was an explosive substance found in Ledsam Street; but they do not suppose—that I intended to destroy any public buildings, or to take away the lives of any people by the explosion of this substance. They say they did not know what it was going to be used for. It was not going to be used for any illegal purpose; there is not a particle of evidence to show it; there are hundreds of tons of nitro-glycerine made every year in Europe, and there is no particle of evidence that it was intended to be used for illegal purposes. The carman who drove the men with the boxes to the station did not know what those boxes contained. With regard to that man Norman's evidence, he states that he never saw me in his life before until he met me in Ledsam Street; that he never heard tell of me; he received from me a quantity of stuff that looked like butter-milk, he never saw anything like it. That is the only evidence against me to sup<lb/>port the charge of treason-felony. I challenge any one to come here and show that I compassed, invented, devised, or intended to depose the Queen, to levy war against her, or to induce her to change her councils or measures. No, gentlemen, there is not a particle of evidence to prove that. No treasonable documents were found in my possession; no, not one. There are hundreds of tons of nitro-glycerine and dynamite used every year in this and other countries for mining purposes. Dynamite is made from nitro-glycerine. There is no evidence to prove that the stuff found in my possession was not to be used for mining purposes. There wan not one particle, one syllable, or one letter to support such a charge. The public press have exaggerated my case in every point. It has stated there were men in existence who were mad, which, undoubtedly, they would be if they intended to do what the press represented. But there is not one particle of evidence to prove that I intended to destroy life or property, or to levy war in this country. So I ask you, as gentlemen of honour, as gentlemen of dignity, and gentlemen of respectability, to give me a fair and impartial trial.</p>

He distinctly states that there were three prisoners in the dock when he identified me at Bow Street; now he says six. He also says that he gave telegrams and letters to a young man who he could not swear to. But I happened to be the nearest in resemblance to him among the prisoners in the dock, so he swore to me. He also says that I was pointed out to him by a man named John Glanville, but I was not. There is no proof that I was con<lb/>nected with a treasonable conspiracy in England, America, or any other country. The only evidence is that I crossed in the same ship as Dr. Galla<lb/>gher.

I was on board the steamship. I had a pair of opera-glasses, and I lent them, to several fellow-passengers, and I said to Dr. Gallagher, "Would you like to have a look, sir?" He said, "Thank you," and I lent him the glasses. I had lent them four or five times altogether. Dr. Gallagher told me he was going to London. I said I was also going to London. He said he was going to the Charing Cross Hotel, and that if I went by that way I was to call upon him. I said, "Yes, sir, I will." I saw no more of him until one evening I was in the Strand, looking in a shop window. I was touched on the shoulder by some one, and I saw it was Gallagher. He said, "Ain't you the young man that lent me the glasses on board the Parthia?" I said, "Yes." He asked me where I was going. I told him to the Gaiety Theatre. He said, "I am going that way." We went and had some drink. He asked me where I was living. I told him Savage's Hotel, Blackfriars Road. I gave him the card, saying, "I hope you will call and see me." He said, "I will call and see you sometime when passing by that way." He called a day or two after and told me he was a medical doctor, and had come to London for the purpose of visiting the hospitals. We talked of the City of London and so forth. He went away, and I never saw him again until I saw him in Bow Street Police-court. If that is treason-felony I am ready to suffer for it. I was taken to Scot<lb/>land Yard, and asked where I came from. I said I came from America. They entered into conversation, but when they found that I said nothing that would convict me they threw the statement overboard and can-not remember it. I told Sergeant Williamson, in the presence of Inspector Littlechild, that I left America under unpleasant circumstances, and that I had come to England to try to make a living. They do not remember that statement, but Superintendent Williamson admits that had I said anything to criminate me he would have remembered it. There is no evidence against me, barring that of the clerk of the American Exchange. All the rest I have admitted. I think that is all I have got to say. My Lord, I do not know that I need say anything more.</p>

The witness says I look like the man he saw there. Is that any evidence to convict me on? The other says he gave letters to a young man he cannot swear to, and I resemblance him most of those in the dock. The Counsel on behalf of the Treasury tried to make out that Wilson and I were in connection. There was evidence of the cabdriver, but the Treasury do not wish to call him, that he drove to a certain place in London, and looked at a house and he said he did not like it, and then the cabman drove him to the rooms in Nelson Square, which he took, but this does not show Wilson's connection with me. I never saw or heard of him till I saw him in the dock. There is that additional evidence which might be called.</p>

I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—the deceased was admitted there on Whit-Monday, 14th May, in the afternoon, between 6 and 7 o'clock—I found he had a fracture of the shin bone—I took him into the ward and put him into splints—I noticed nothing further at that time—that night he was very restless and next day he was worse, he was delirious, and he died late on Wednesday night or early on Thursday morning—the cause of death was exhaustion from the delirium caused by the injury—I made a post-mortem examination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said at the police-court the fracture could not have been caused by the fall simply, his leg must have come in contact with some substance—it must have been caused by direct violence—the death would have resulted from the push if that had broken the leg—in my judgment a man could not fall backwards in such a way as to break his shin bone.</p>

I know her better than you, I will get her out"—he went to get Mrs. Dennis away, the barman made a push against the prisoner with his shoulder, and he then pushed Mrs. Dennis a gain—the prisoner said, "If you push her again I shall push you," and he then pushed Mrs. Dennis again, and her son-in-law pushed the barman and he fell against the bar in the corner—I cannot say if there was anything against which his leg could have fallen—the barman got up without assistance and walked through the bar into the bar parlour—I cannot say he walked straight, he took hold of the cheffonier.</p>

I am a gardener, and was living at Leyton Park on 5th May—about 9 o'clock that evening I saw the prisoners standing at the door of 4, Commercial Place—I went to a baker's named Smith in the Leyton Road, and at 10.15 as I returned I saw the prisoners leaving No. 4—I saw them come out of the door and go in the direction of the Leyton Station—I passed No. 4 about two or three minutes after, and saw smoke coming from the shutters, which were a little from the ground—I and Newling went and pushed the shutter up, and I saw the counter all alight—the flames appeared to come from underneath the counter—I remained until the men burst the front door open, and ran into the shop—the door leading into the parlour was shut—Anderson burst it open—I did not go into the house—I saw no furniture there—there were flames in the parlour, about the middle of the floor—the house was burnt to the ground.</p>

I saw two policemen outside when we left; I also spoke to a policeman to keep an eye on the shop, and he said, 'All right, we know all about it, sir;' I gave him a cigar. Me and my friend went to Leyton Railway-station. I asked for a ticket for Tottenham, and was told the 10.16 train for Tottenham was gone. I then left Mr. Goldring and went to Stratford, and caught the 10.30 train for Tottenham. I got home before the public-houses closed, so that must have been about a quarter to 11. The shop was all right when I left it; I cannot in any way account for it getting on fire; Mr. Goldring did certainly drop some matches in the shop during the evening, but we remarked they were safety matches, and would not ignite"—we then took him to 68, St. George's Road, Leyton, close by where Goldring lives—we all three got out of the cab and went to the door—Webster asked a female who answered the door for Mr. Goldring—she said he was not at home and would not be at home all the evening—he said "It will be necessary that he should come with me, as we were the last two</p>

Mr. Goldring, in the shop during the evening"—Goldring replied "I don't remember dropping any, and you must be mistaken"—Webster said "Now, be candid, Mr. Goldring; you must remember dropping the matches"—Goldring replied "I don't remember dropping any; you must be mistaken"—when I took Webster into custody, after I had shown him the fire, he said "You had better be careful what you are about, as I am a respectable man and will make you suffer for what you do"—we took them to the station and they were charged and detained—this policy, these two receipts, and this insurance paper were then handed to me by Webster in this pocket-book.

I am an assistant to Mr. Vincent—I was at the fire about 10 p.m. on the night of 5th May—I lifted up the shutter and could not see any names at all in the shop, only smoke—I cannot say for cer<lb/>tain as to the time—smoke was coming between the shutters at the top, but I could not see any flames coming out of the front—the day before the fire I passed Webster's shop in the afternoon taking goods out, and repassed in the evening on my way home about 9.45—Webster was standing against the door—I had some conversation with him till about 10.10, and then I saw him throw the candle behind the counter after giving it a blow, he meant to put it out; directly he turned his back I saw a light under there, behind myself—I told Webster and he trod on it—the light was directly where the fire broke out, behind the counter—I was only standing against the door.</p>

Palfreman and Foster, of New Bond Street, were creditors for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—there would be a form of proof with the notice, similar to document "A," in fact that document was posted—no resolution was filed or registered, it fell through—I also pro<lb/>duce the file of proceedings in Woodcock's bankruptcy—it is signed February 28th—Joseph Hickmot was a creditor trading as "Hickmot and Son"—on 9th March, the prisoner being an accountant, was appoin<lb/>ted receiver, and on 13th March the order adjudging Woodcock a bank<lb/>rupt was made—the first meeting was held on 3<hi rend="italic">rd</hi> April at 12 o'clock—I was chairman—the defendant was present, and among other proofs he handed in the, document marked "A"—I examined it and saw an altera<lb/>tion he had made in the heading—the date of its being sworn was ante<lb/>cedent to the filing of the bankruptcy petition, and the words "proced<lb/>ing liquidation" were struck out, and "Bankruptcy" was inserted in a different coloured ink, and the initials of the Commissioner were perfectly fresh as if that had recently been done—I spoke to the prisoner about it—he said that probably the alterations were made by a creditor in ignor<lb/>ance, but subsequently admitted that they were made by his clerk—he said he wrote to the firm asking for their proxy—I registered the proof—I suggested that Leeming should be sworn, he objected to that—he asked if he might see me the next day to give me an explanation—I said I did not see that any explanation was possible, but I should be in Court all day, and if he liked to come he could do so—Mr. Jennings was there, a solicitor; he said to me in the prisoner's presence that he had come down to appoint the prisoner as trustee, he had already appointed him in 10 or a dozen cases, but after what had occurred, he asked me to adjourn the meeting—the meeting was adjourned to 10th April—on 10th April the</p>

               <p>meeting was held—the prisoner was not present—another person was appointed trustee, and I communicated with the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Goatley was Woodcock's solicitor—the person liquidating has to file a list of creditors and every creditor has to receive a copy of the notice—the Registrar files a sworn copy and I find a copy on the file—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the copy sent to Messrs. Palfreman; here is the Greenwich post-mark on it, February 15th; it is addressed to Messrs. Pal<lb/>freman and Foster, 9, New Broad Street—it says, "Form of proof and proxy will be found on the other side of this notice"—the meeting was on the 19th—this was not done by any one in my office, it was brought in by the debtor—they are sent out in blank to the creditors, who fill them up—they never could have been used in liquidation, unless there was an adjournment of the first meeting—the file would not necessarily show that—no proof could have been handed in on 19th February, because it was not made till the 23rd—if it was an adjourned meeting it would not necessarily have the chairman's signature—there are no proofs on the file of the liquidation proceedings—the meeting of the 19th col<lb/>lapsed, and there is no trace of any resolution—Mr. Hickmot petitioned for this man to be made bankrupt on 2nd March—Mr. Jennings was Mr. Hickmot's solicitor—Mr. Hickmot's proxies were Mr. Jennings and Mr. McCown; Mr. Jennings told me he was a proxy in the case and was going to vote for Mr. Leeming as trustee, and he had the proxy ready filled up—we occasionally allow proofs which have been used in liquidation to be used in bankruptcy, but an order must be applied for and obtained for the same proof to be used, but fresh proxies must be obtained—it often happens that the same document is found on the bankruptcy file, the same form filled up differently—we set out the 125th and 126th sections only—this document could not have been used without permission, and per<lb/>mission could not have been given that day—I could not have given per<lb/>mission, because it would be necessary to have a fresh proxy, and he did not ask for it—if I had been asked I should say the affidavit could be sworn and then it could be used.</p>
