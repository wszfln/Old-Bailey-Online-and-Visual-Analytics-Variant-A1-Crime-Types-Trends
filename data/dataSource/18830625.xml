I live near Hounslow Barracks, and am a labourer—the prisoner is my wife—on 2nd June, about 10 minutes to 2 o'clock, I had been to have my dinner beer and was returning to work—my wife had been away from me for a month, I don't know where—she met me in the road, pulled the cap off my head, tore it to pieces, and kicked at my private parts—she had a Knife in her right-hand pocket, handle upwards; she snatched it out in an instant and struck me close by the eye, and then on the head and face—she attempted to do it scores of times—it has hardly got well yet—I bled very much—while she was doing it she said she would do for me—I was standing up—she then caught hold of my collar and threw me into a ditch, and she was going to draw the knife across my throat when a soldier came to my assistance and pulled the knife away, and she was taken to the guardroom.</p>

I said "There is a man in custody by that name, but he is not here, he is at Seething Lane"—he said "I want to leave some money for some food for him"—I said "What is your name?" he said" My name is Lawson"—I went with him to Seething Lane Police-station—I said to the inspector "This gentleman wants to leave some money for Sandle"—the inspector said "Yes, do you know Sandle?" he said "Yes"—the inspector had Sandle fetched out, and he said to Sandle in Steinbaur's presence "Do you know this man?" he said "Yes, sir, that is the man that brought the goods to my house, and we are working the matter together"—he made no reply to that—the inspector said "I did not ask you that, I only asked you if you knew him"—Steinbaur left the station—I followed him and said I should arrest him, and he would be charged with being concerned with Sandle in stealing and receiving a large quantity of goods from Messrs. Outram and Co. on 19th May—he said "Well, I have been fairly trapped this time, that is doing a <hi rend="italic">pal</hi> good"—on the way to the station he said "I hope you won't take me to the <hi rend="italic">shop"</hi> (meaning the station); "if you don't I can tell you where there is hundreds of pounds' worth of property"—I said he would have to go and be charged—he said "If I am charged you will get no further information from me"—at the station he gave his address 118, Backchurch Lane, Whitechapel—I afterwards went there with Detectives Latter and Kenniston, and on the dressing-table in the bedroom, in the presence of the landlord, I found these 11 cotton pocket-handkerchiefs—I took them to the station and showed them to Steinbaur and said "I found these pocket handkerchiefs in your bed-room, which have been identified as a portion of the property stolen from Messrs.

I live at 41, Sandringham Road—on Friday night, 25th May, about 10 o'clock, I was in Pond Lane Fields, some men came up to me—I recognize the three prisoners—Ilott asked me for some tobacco—I told him I had none, he then asked me for some money for beer, which I refused, upon which he snatched at my chain and the watch came out in his hand—he broke it from the chain and ran away, I followed—one of them struck me and gave me a black eye—we were fighting for some little time, and I fell to the ground—my stick fell out of my hand and another man not in custody hit me over the arm with my stick and broke it—they all ran away, and we lost them in a brick<lb/>field—I am certain the prisoners are three out of the four who attacked me—on the morning of 27th May I saw the two Archers at the police station amongst others and picked them out—I saw Ilott on the Friday following at the station—he was placed with fifteen others and I picked him out—this is my watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

I could not find an owner, so in the evening I showed it to Ackerman; he said he knew a man that wanted to buy a watch, and I left it with him to show him. I met him afterwards and he gave me a portion of the money. The next night I was taken to the station, and the prosecutor picked out my brother but did not identify me; he said "I only think I recognize Ernest Archer."</p>

I live at 66, Jutt's Road, and am a packing-case maker—I was living there with the prisoner as man and wife for two or three months—the deceased Alice Ethel was my child by another woman—she was two years and nine months old—I was taking cure of her, and the prisoner was living with me and also took care of her—she has no children of her own—I had been living with her since last September—ou Saturday, 26th May, I went out to work at half-past 5, leaving the prisoner in bed, and the child in a chair with her; it bad some bruises on it, but was perfectly well in health—I returned at 8 to breakfast—the prisoner then had the child on her lap—she told me it had the skin off its bottom, that she had put too much soda in the water; I saw that it was so—I said I must go and get some ointment for it—I went and got some at the chemist's—I did not examine all the child's body—I left the house about half-past 8—I returned about 9 and went out again—I returned about 11, the child seemed easier then—I put on the oinment myself—I saw that it was scalded—at 1 o'clock I got some lotion for it—I stayed at home the rest of the day—about 6 that evening the child died</p>

I am married—I live at 66, Jutt's Road, next door to the prisoner—on Saturday, 26th May, about 5 in the morning, I heard the child crying very slow—about 11 I saw the prisoner, who I knew at Mrs. Laurence, and asked her where Alice was; she said she was lying down, she was not well—about 12 I asked her again if she was still lying down, she said "Yes"—I asked her if she had a cold, she said "Yes"—I said perhaps it was through her crying so much on Thursday, that it put her in a fever—she said "Very likely"—I did not hear the child cry at that time—about half-past 5 I heard it cry, but not very loud—Laurence opened the window and asked me to come in—I went in and saw the child on his lap, it had a dreadful black eye—I asked Laurence who did it—the prisoner was not there then—I saw that the child was very bad—I took it up—I was in the room when it died, about 6, that was before the doctor came—I had seen the child out once before the Saturday, and I had seen it up at the window frequently.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner, at 560, Mile End Road—about 7 on the evening of 26th May the prisoner came to my house and said the child was very bad, she was afraid it would die, it was suffering from a scald, and to go and see it at once—I went at once with her—on the way she spoke about having given it a bath in the morning, and that in consequence of that it was scalded—she said she had put a little soda into the bath, the child being dirty and rather delicate—when we got to the house I found the child lying in bed partly dressed and quite dead—I think it had been dead about an hour, the extremities were quite cold, the body was covered with bruises—the man Laurence was there—I mentioned the blackness about the eyes, and he said something to the prisoner about telling the truth who did it—she admitted having struck the child in the eye for some little dirty act, and that it fell and hurt itself in that way—I afterwards made a post-mortem examination—I found a great many bruises—the scald was a very extensive one, extending from just below the ribs on the back to very near the knees on both sides, measuring 10 3/4 inches from above down<lb/>wards, and over 13 inches from side to side—the thick skin on the right heel was removed by the scald, and the parts just above were quite blistered—to have scalded it in that way I should say the water must have been boiling, or very nearly so—the cause of death was the shock to the system from the scalding—when a large portion of the skin is injured in this way it is dangerous, especially with children; it ought to have been noticed immediately; practically nothing was done, the ointment was of no use—the prisoner said something about the child falling about, giving it a blow and falling against the mantelpiece—I asked her when the scalding occurred—she said in the bath, and the first thing that attracted her attention to the child was the skin peeling off—I asked her "Was not the water boiling?" she said not, that she had added some cold water to it, and that she had tested the temperature with her hands—I said a careful woman would have tested it with her elbow, or some more sensitive part.</p>

After a few minutes it cried more, and I saw the skin coming off, and I took her out and put a cloth round her. I did not cause the bruises; it fell about very much. When I took her to the doctor he said she was dropsical. I took her to the children's hospital at Shadwell for two or three months, till I could not carry her, she was so fat. The doctor said she might die at any moment, at she was dropsical.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lieutenant in the 1st Battalion of the King's Shropshire Light Infantry—on Thursday night, 7th June, I was passing by the public-house in King Street—I saw two men on the pavement—I did not notice the last witness—the prisoner was one of the men, the other was a cabman—they were standing facing each other—I saw the prisoner come round and go towards the other man—he put out his stick in a sort of a drunken way, a drunken sort of a stagger, and thrust it at the other man, who seemed to me to be advancing too—they came together, and the stick went into his eye—I saw the man fall—I went up to see if I could be of any use—I saw that he was being well looked after by two or three persons, and a constable was there—he asked me to go for another constable, which I did—I saw the man put into a cab and taken to the hospital—I had not seen the earlier part of it—I was coming towards them—when the blow was struck I was about eight paces from them.</p>

               <p>them, coming nearer—I did not notice any slanging taking place; I did not see the hat fall or any push or blow—I saw them after that; I saw them standing before the deceased had been injured at all—I have described it in this way: "It seemed to me that the deceased came on to the stick as much as the stick was pushed on him"—it was a little of both—what I meant was, that the stick was pushed out, and he then delivered the lunge; the pass of the stick was delivered first, and then, after that, the stick came into collision with his eye; they seemed advancing towards each other; the prisoner was staggering; he was dead drunk—I should certainly think he did not know what he was about.</p>

I was physician at the Westminster Hospital when the deceased was brought there between 11.30 and 12 o'clock—he was quite unconscious—there were two wounds, one very slight; one about three-quarters of an inch below the left eyelid, the other was on the eyelid itself—he did on the 9th—I made a post-mortem examination—the wound must have been inflicted by a blunt instrument going under the eyeball through the skull, between 4 and 5 inches into the substance of the brain—the wound was the cause of death—considerable force must have been used.</p>

Lucas, now building on an estate in Sandy Lane—he said no, it was not that one—he took a Dock order for a portion of the timber which he is charged with obtaining on the 9th April—on 11th April he took away some, and also on the 12th—his van came on the 12th—I sold him the whole of the timber which is comprised in the 61<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the 9th April, but it was not delivered, because it had to be cut—he told me about the horses on the morning of the 9th April, when I wanted to know who was going to cart his battens from the dock, and he said "I am; I have my own horses"—I saw him again on the 23rd April, when he came to fetch away some stuff which he had in the first transaction—the second</p>

               <p>and he hung, and it was a minute before he could release his coat—the <hi rend="italic">lady</hi> came out with the copper stick, and offered to knock his brains out if he came down into her yard—he got away from the hook and dropped on to the tiles below—before he got on to the wall he threw two things, one was a piece of brick, and something black, which I think was my purse—he got over the walls and came down into a chandler's shop in Lever Street—a man on the tiles called out "He is getting into Lever Street," and I ran round into Lever Street and caught him coining out of the chandler's shop—he dragged me over to a public-house and got under a brewer's dray—some men came up and caught hold of me and called me filthy names, and asked me why I did not let him go, and pushed him under the dray and said "Now make the best use of your time," and I ran round and caught him and brought him back—I picked up my purse in the yard; it was empty—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is like what the prisoner threw—I had left it just inside the drawers on the first-floor front room, on the landing where the prisoner threw Mrs. Courtney down—there was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it then, or I won't be positive whether it was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were no pence—the brick did not strike any one; it was meant for me or the woman who was daring him to come down—I found the purse after he had been taken to the station—he was taken back to the house and given in charge to a policeman—I did not examine the room while the policeman was there—I missed the purse when at the station—I put my hand into my pocket, thinking I had put my purse there, and after I remembered I had not put it in my pocket; I remembered leaving it on the drawers, and I went back to the house to see what was lost and to look expressly for the purse, and then I missed it—I went into the yard, as I thought some of the money might have been dropped if he had taken it—I did not find it—my son has since been on the tiles; there was not any dropped there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first saw him going over the wall—I went for a constable—I did not know when I went to the station that I had lost any<lb/>thing—I said to the inspector I locked him up for knocking a person downstairs and for being in the house for an unlawful purpose—I don't know whether I was asked if I had lost anything—I put my hand in my pocket to see if I had lost anything, because I was accosted by some women coming down the street—they begged me not to press the charge—the officer went back to try and find them—I said "I have lost my purse;" I did not say "in the crowd"—I went to my room and found the purse gone, before I found it in the garden—I had put it in the drawer the night before—I gave a little description of the women who accosted me—I told the inspector there was near about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the purse—I had not got it in my pocket when I was chasing the prisoner into the yard—I did not miss anything else—to the best of my knowledge the door of the room was locked, and the key taken away—I did not look for any marks about the door—we make it a rule to lock the door.</p>

               <p>—I put the purse in my right-hand trousers pocket—this is the purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—when I took my trousers off I rolled them up and put them under my head on the pillow—the female prisoner came to bed some time afterwards and put the light out—I went to sleep about 1.30 as nearly as I could judge, and at 1.45 I woke up—I sat up in bed and put my hand behind me to feel whether my trousers were there and they were gone—I then heard a heavy footstep in the room; I jumped out of bed and exclaimed to the female prisoner "I have been brought here to be robbed, and you have robbed me"—she said "I did not do it"—I struck a light and saw my trousers across a chest of drawers, about two steps from the bed—I am positive I had put them under my head—I could not reach to the drawers from the bed—I caught hold of my trousers and felt if there was any money there; there was nothing in the pocket—I put my trousers on and Stewart jumped out of bed; her dress was lying across a chair; she was in her nightdress—I caught hold of her dress and tore the pocket out, feeling for some money at the same time in the pocket—there was no money there—I caught her by the hair and said "If you don't tell me where my money is you will be sorry for it"—she screamed—I let her go—I turned round and saw the door open—it must have been open before; it was not closed when we went to bed—I ran out into the yard and said "Some one is here that has got my money, and if I don't get it I will upset the house"—I saw nobody—I looked: round the yard, and was going to the door again, when I saw Williams standing about five or six paces from the door I had come out of, No. 6, crouching under the shadow of the wall as if to get out of the way—I went over to him and said "Give me my money"—he said "I have not got your money; I am landlord of this house; what are you doing here?"—I said "You are not landlord of this house"—he had on a dark coat, which wag open—I caught hold of him by the throat and said "If you don't give me my money I will knock you down"—he pushed me, and I struck him in the face with my hand—we closed together, and I put my hand into his coat pocket and felt a purse and a pocket book; the purse felt like mine, which was a small one with a steel top—I had no pocket book—he then struck me in the face with his fist and knocked me down—I got up and struck him back, in the chest—we struggled for a little while together, when he threw me off on one side, ran in the house, and I ran in too—I picked up my serge and silk handkerchief, which were lying on the floor; I had been in ray flannel and trousers all the time—I saw Williams stoop and pick something bright from a drawer which had been taken from a chest of drawers on which my trousers were thrown and was lying on the floor—I then ran out into the yard, and ran round, and tried to find my way out, when Williams followed me—I turned back and ran up to him and said "Give me my money and let me go," or I would knock him down—he said "I will settle you," and raised his right hand—I saw his hand in the air with the knife in it—I exclaimed "Don't stab me, you villain, but let me go"—he tried to put the knife into my breast—my breast was bare, my flannel was open, and I had no serge on—I hit him with my fist and knocked him on one side—he came up to me and tried to put it into my breast again—I went to dodge and get under his arm and he cut me about the throat, and put the knife into my neck, drawing it across my neck—it was a long knife, that is it. (<hi rend="italic">A table knife was produced</hi>)</p>

               <p>—I staggered against the wall with the force of the blow, and Williams stood for a moment and looked at me—I gathered myself together and hit him with my fist and knocked him into the middle of the yard—he got up—I ran round the yard—the blood was coming from the wound, and it was very painful—my flannel was covered with blood, and I thought I should drop if he followed me much longer—I turned on him again—he went to strike me with the knife; I stepped on one side, and hit him in the face with my fist—he fell in the middle of the yard, and I ran round the yard again, trying to find the way out, but could not, there being a high wall, about 8 or 9 feet high—I went to step back to see if I could jump it, and turned my head and saw the prisoner behind me with the knife raised as if to put it into my back—I took a jump, and came on my knees on the wall, and fell into the court running down by the yard, and there was a man there that recognised me—he picked me up and I fainted away, and when I came to, this man had me in his arms at the same place—he took me to Westminster Hospital—I had my wounds dressed by Dr. Butler—we came away, and met a policeman in the middle of the road, and then went on till we came to the Rifleman public-house—there were some women in the middle of the road, and the female prisoner was standing amongst them—this was about 2 o'clock or 2.30—I caught her by the throat, and said "This is the one that robbed, me"—the policeman took her in charge, and told me to come to the station—we went there; the inspector asked me to tell him all that occurred, and I told him—she said "It was not me; I don't know the man"—I am certain she is the woman—about an hour or an hour and a half afterwards Williams was brought in—they asked me if I knew him—I said yes, that was the man—I waited there till daylight, and then went with the constable to 6, Bull's Head Court, about five minutes' walk from Rochester Row—the policeman went in the room and brought out my boots, knife, lanyard, socks, and cap—I put my things on and went home—I did not see the owners of the place—I am certain Williams is the man—I was present when the constables found this knife in the drawers in the room—I went to the hospital at 9 o'clock in the morning and had my wound dressed again, and then I went to Rochester Row Police-station and prosecuted both prisoners before the Magistrate.</p>

From information received, about 5.15 on the morning of the 2nd I took Williams into custody, and took him to Rochester Row Station, where Kiely identified him when I brought him in—I apprehended him in Romney Street, Westminster, and said I should take him into custody for robbing and stabbing a sailor—he said "You have got the wrong man this time"—I searched him at the station, and found on him two half-crowns, one two-shilling piece, seven shillings, two sixpences, and sixpence in coppers, and this bottle of rum (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the right-hand breast pocket of his coat—afterwards I went down with Kiely to 6, Bull's Head Court, and entered the room by the window—it is only a short distance from the pavement of Hans Court—I found Kiely's boots and socks under the window on the floor, standing as if he had just pulled them off—I searched the drawers, and found his hat and lanyard, and also this knife, with blood-stains on it—that was in a drawer in the set of drawers; it was not pulled out on the floor—the knife had slight blood-stains on the point; it looked as if some one after using it had wiped it with a cloth—there was another knife besides, with a blade of about two inches—Kiely showed me the wall at the back of the house where he jumped over—there was blood at the foot of it, as if some one had been bleeding.</p>

No. 15397—I said to him "Do you know anything about these?"—he replied "I believe Clements has had these orders, but I have not"—I said "What makes you believe that?"—he said "I saw him with the orders in Paddington Street, the only conversation he had with me about it was that he won it over St. Blaise. I was with him when he changed them. I went to both post-offices, Devon<lb/>shire Street and Edgware Road, with him. The money was paid, I believe, in gold, with one 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note. I received 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it because we generally go 'Co.' if we win or lose anything"—I told him all the orders had been obtained by fraudulent means—I then saw Clements in the presence of Hurst and Stevens—he said "I do not know a betting man named Webster.

I do not know that Lane or Clements have had any communications with him"—this was in answer to questions by me—" I remember the conversation at the Albany. Clements and Lane had won 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Webster; they said they wrote over and Webster sent it back to them"—I then produced the same four orders and asked him if he knew anything about them—he replied "I have never seen these.

I asked him to write the endorsements on each of the four money-orders. I told Lane of this before we cashed them"—Lane said "I did not know who signed the money-orders till Clements told me to-day"—Smith said "I do not wish to say anything."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Wellesley Street, Commercial Road, and am river foreman to the Union Lighterage Company, who do the lighter<lb/>ing work for the General Steamship Navigation Company—on Wednes<lb/>day, 14th June, I received from the Hamburg boat Kestrel 63 packages to be conveyed to Southampton <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Nine Elms—I lodged the papers on board the ship, and gave instructions to Baldock, who is a lighterman in our employment, with respect to this cargo—I put him in charge of the Pegu, a lug boat, on board which this cargo of 63 packages was loading, and told him to come ashore for his orders at order time, from 6 to 8 p.m.—the only order was to take her up at the morning tide, and deliver at Nine Elms—he could hare started on the tide between 4 and 5 a.m.—the goods were in bond, and therefore in accordance with the usual practice a Custom House officer was put on board—I saw several officers there—I cannot say I saw any particular one—the last time I saw the Pegu was about 4 p.m.—Baldock came about 7 or 8 in the evening for his receiving notes, and I gave them to him—I saw no more of him or of the barge till he was in custody—I did not have anything to do with the bond notes myself—the Kestrel was at Horselydown—it would take Baldock about half an hour to get from there to All hallows.</p>

                  </hi>. I am night watchman for the Thames Conservancy—on the 14th of June I was on Allhallows Pier, and I saw the Pegu lug boat come there about 9 p.m., with Baldock, Vass, and another inn whom I don't know—about 10 o'clock I saw them dodging about the lower end of the pier, and I heard Baldock call out and I walked to the lower end of the pier—I was expecting the Hampton boat down, I said "What is the matter with you? It seems very strange your going on like this"—he said "I am calling <hi rend="italic">Fred</hi>, I am not speaking to you"—about 8 or 9 o'clock I saw one of the prisoners holding the case to steady it and the other breaking it open—they took it in turns to hold and break—the third man was there then, and at 10 o'clock, when I spoke to them—they were dodging about, and they went ashore three times—about 11 o'clock they nailed the cases up—I did not see where they went to when they went ashore, I could not leave the pier—Whitmarsh, the watchman of Dowgate Wharf, came round about 11 o'clock and spoke to me, and we went together, and the officer and the lighterman were nailing up the cases, the third man had gone then—I went to the police-station—when I got back David Richards was at the gate—he went with me on board the Pegu about 11.30 or 12—Baldock had gone—I as watchman had unlocked the gate and let him go—Richards was standing there at the time, but I did not know he was a constable, he was in plain clothes—when we went on board the barge after that Vass was in the stern with three shirts under his feet, lying down apparently drunk, but he could not have been drunk—a tar<lb/>paulin was over his legs and feet—I said to Richards "Here is the other man"—these are the three shirts (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), they are marked "C D S 83" with red cotton—at that time Littleboy was on board too, he had been aboard, by the side, and he jumped over and found a tin with port wine in and drunk it—Littleboy and Vass were taken to the station.</p>

On night of 14th June, in consequence of some information, I went to Allhallows Pier in plain clothes about ten minutes to 12—the gate was locked, and a man standing inside, and in a few minutes Baldock came up from the pier to the gate—Tyndall had been up the pier, he came up and unlocked the gate and let Baldock and another man out—Baldock asked Tyndall to come and have a drink—he asked somebody what the time was, and I told him—I have not the slightest doubt he is the man—Tyndall had nothing to drink—after Baldock had gone away I went on the pier to Tyndall—Sanders the detective came on to the pier to me a few minute afterwards—in consequence of what Tyndall said I went on board the Pegu and found Vass lying on the bottom of the barge fast asleep—there was a tarpaulin covering some cases, I pulled it on one side and found these three shirts all marked C D S 83. under his feet—I raised him up, his coat was unbuttoned, I buttoned it and said to Sanders "This is the Customs House officer—Churchill, another plain clothes officer, came on board the Pegu, and he and Sanders took Vass to the police-station—I said nothing to Vass about the shirts then, he appeared as if he had not come to his senses—after Vass had been taken away I examined the cargo and found three cases had been tampered with—I did not make an examination then—Littleboy was on the lug boat at the time—he was also taken to the station and was afterwards discharged by the Lord Mayor—I remained on the barge for the rest of the night—next morning about 7.12 or 7.15 Baldock came on board the Pegu—I said "Are you the lighterman?"—he said "Yes"—I said "Is this your barge?"—he said "Yes"—I said "Who did you leave in charge of her?"—he said "The Customs House officer"—I said "What time did you leave last night?"—he said "About 7 o'clock, and I have not been here since"—I said that Vass was in custody, and that being a police officer I should take him in custody, and said "There are three cases which have been plundered here"—he asked me to show them to him—I pointed them out—he said "They are the same as I received them"—I told him I should take him to the station and that he would be charged with</p>

I keep the Duke of Cambridge, Cannon Row, Woolwich—on Saturday night, 27th January, I closed my house—I heard a noise in the direction of the Prince of Wales, some yards up the road—I looked out of window and saw the prisoner, Goggin, and John Cane—I afterwards saw a man named McCarthy at the door of his house—I saw Goggin drag him in the middle of the road, and they fought—a soldier picked McCarthy up once or twice and removed him—after the fight was over they moved farther down the road below my house—Alexander was standing at the door of one of the houses—a fight was begun there by these three men, and they got Alexander down—Reilly came up and said he would not see a man murdered like that, and he took Alexander's part—he beat off the three assailants, and then a fourth came up—the prisoner said "Hold on a minute, I will find something that will do for him"—he ran up to a house and fetched something, which appeared like a soldier's belt—the fight was renewed, but I was not near enough to see all that took place—after the fight was over they remained some time drinking beer—Reilly was carried away smothered in blood and taken into one of the houses, and bathed by the neighbours—I knew the prisoner before, and am sure he was the man.</p>

About midnight I was called to the house by the witness Jones—I found Mrs. Hughes lying on the bed, bleeding from the left side of her head, just behind the ear—I saw this hammer on the table; it was covered with blood on the top—there were several knives and forks also on the table—when I picked up the hammer the prisoner said "That is what I did it with; do you wish to smell it?"—I told him I might want it for something else—I put it in my pocket—the blood was wet upon it—the prisoner said" I suppose it will be murder; I will put on my boots and go with you"—I told him he had better wait, as I had sent for the doctor—lie said "Look here, master, I will tell you how it was. I had been hard at work all day, and carried 50 sacks of coal, and had given her money to get my supper, and she had not got it. Then I hit her with the hammer, and I hope she will die and the old man too, as they are no use, and ought to have been dead long ago." The woman was hysterical, and kept shaking—I</p>

On 17th June, about 3.80 a.m., I met the prisoner in Mornington Street—he was sober, coming towards me, with his feet bleeding, and no boots or socks on—I was about to question him, when he' ran away—I gave chase, and tried to trip him up, and we had a severe struggle—George Buck land, the prosecutor's son, came up, and identified his hat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which the prisoner had been wearing—another constable came up—I charged the prisoner, and took him to Avenue Road—I met Knight, F 448, who stated that he was the man he had been chasing for an hour and a half—at the station I found this key (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the prisoner, which he said belonged to his door—I went to his lodgings, but could not open the door, on account of the small latch being up—the woman he lived with came down—we searched his lodgings.</p>
