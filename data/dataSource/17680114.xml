On the 28th of last month being my watch night, I was at the watch-house in the parish of St. Giles's; about half an hour after twelve at night, Mr. Creswell that keeps the Noah's Ark alehouse in Dyot-street came to me, and told me there were several people at his house disputing about the reckoning; I told him that did not concern me; he said there were fire-arms amongst them; then I went; I went into a back room behind the bar, there were the two prisoners standing by the side of each other; Crawley's breast was open; I saw this horse-whip in Swinney's left hand; I took it from him; I had been told that a pistol had been taken from Crawley, and was then in the landlord's custody; I took them both in custody, and in searching Swinney, I found a silver watch in his coat-pocket; I found also some paper with gunpowder, and some small pieces of lead, and a turnpike ticket, (produced in court,) the contents W. Midd. Essex 28.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I had a ticket in my hat, which I had at Rumford turnpike; this is one of the same fort, I believe it the very same that carries through Mile-end turnpike; the figures 28 is for the day this fact was done.</p>

That watch I found then, was not the watch that belongs to the prosecutor; then I went to search Crawley, and found a silver watch in his sob, and another silver one in his pocket on the other side; then I took them and confined them in the round-house till the next day; then I took them before Justice Welch, and there I laid the watches down, and the prosecutor swore to his watch and whip; then he said he had lost his hat also; then I went to Clerkenwell Bridewell, and took the hat from Swinney's head; I had seen it upon Crawley's head in the round-house.</p>

I am headborough; I was at the Noah's Ark on the 28th of last month, at past twelve at night, the prisoners were wrangling about the reckoning; the landlady of the house said she wished she could get rid of them; Swinney struck with his heel at me, and wanted to get away; I laid hold of him; the landlord hearing a bustle came to my assistance; he said, the other man had fire-arms; I immediately seized him, and took a pistol from under the inside of his coat; then assistance was sent for to the watch-house, and Mr. Burnet came; I saw him take a horsewhip out of Swinney's hand, and a watch out of his coat-pocket; some powder, some little pieces of lead, and a turnpike ticket; and I saw him take two watches out of Crawley's breeches-pocket; the pistol had a charge of powder, but nothing else; (a horse-pistol, three silver watches, and a horsewhip produced in court.)</p>
               <p>The prosecutor deposed to one of the watches found upon Crawley, and the whip.</p>

            . My husband keeps the Noah's Ark. The two prisoners came to our house on the 28th of December, a little before ten at night, very much in liquor; I ordered my servant not to let them have any liquor without their paying for it; they called for a pint of twopenny, they ordered it to be made hot; after that they had another; they paid for them; they had a third, but would not pay for that; Mr. Stevens being in the house, went into the room with me; Crawley began to struggle with a young man, and Swinney fell upon Stevens; then I called my husband; they took the pistol from Crawley.</p>

I sold some, and what I sold I had a shop price for them; some at seven shillings, some at nine shillings, and some at half a guinea a pair; I paid 6 l. 17 s. 6 d. with my own hand, to a gentleman that was with Mr. Eltington, for he would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176801140007"/> not take it himself; he seemed much confused, to think the prisoner had robbed him.</p>

            . I am daughter to the prosecutor; my mother stood wringing her hands, saying she had been robbed of two tubs of butter; I was told by a neighbour that the prisoner had fell down with two tubs; we enquired, and found he lived in an alley in Whitechapel. I with others went down the alley to the bottom, a child shewed me his house; I heard his wife run up, and say they are coming, they are coming; I said you wicked creature, how could you rob my mother, and desired a girl to run for a proper officer, but before one came, the prisoner jumped out of a window and ran away; after that his wife came, and said he was killed; she said do not make a noise, come up, and I will give you the butter; I said then bring it down; some of the neighbours went up with me, she opened a closet, there was the butter, one was in the tub, the other out of the tub, all dirty. I took it and brought it home; there were the letters M O scratched on the tub.</p>

            . I was coming home three nights before Christmas, I met the prisoner next door to Mordecai's; he fell down, I helped him up with his tubs; he went about four doors farther, and fell down again; he had two tubs, one full of butter, the other about half full. When the woman complained of being robbed, I told her of Daniel.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>A man came running past and fell down, and left the butter; I said I should be glad to know who it belongs to; this man said it would be the best way for him to help it on my head, and I to carry it home, and see about who owned it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. to S. Mordecai. Did these tubs stand in your house or at the door?</p>
               <p>S. Mordecai. They stood behind my counter, there were two doors to open before he could get to them.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Markas Garrick. I was at work the same night, at the prisoner's mother's house, she is a baker; she sent me to call him to work; I went to him to the Blackmoor's-head, he was drinking a pint of beer; I asked him if he would come to work; he said he would come and tell his mother he was not able to come to work; he seemed to be a little in liquor; then when the woman came and said she had lost a tub of butter, he said he was coming along to his mother's and found it.</p>
               <p>Marks Marks. The same night this affair happened about a bit of butter, I was sitting in a public-house in Duke's-place; the prisoner came in between seven and eight o'clock; he staid a little while, and asked me if I would be three farthings to his penny; we staid and drank it; then came in Cowen. The prisoner called Garrick, and asked him if he would come to work at his mother's; he went out with him, and came in again, and called to me; I said, what do you want; he said here is a man in Shoemaker-row with a firkin of butter, that wants to sell it; I said, why do not you stop him; presently after there came word, that the prisoner was taken up with a firkin of butter; he follows the baking business, in selling cakes about Duke's place.</p>

During that time I had him in my sight, till I came pretty near the place where he was taken; I then saw two or three more people moving: I cannot say I did distinguish him clearly from them, but presently I lost sight of them all; I continued my run, till I came to the corner of the first turning on the right hand side of Artillery-lane, that is called Petticoat-lane; I said to myself, but I suppose a little loud, I believe I have lost him; there was a young man a little way off said there he is, I believe they have stopt him; then I turned my head towards the other side of the way, on the left hand side, there I saw four, five, or six persons together standing; I went towards them and looked at the prisoner, who was one of them, and knew him to be the man; I said, you are the man that have taken my hat from my head; he said he knew nothing of it; I charged him with it again, he still denied it; I then said, I was sure he was the man, and would charge an officer with him; he said he had no hat besides that on his head about him, and unbuttoned his coat in order to be searched; he had none; I said no matter for that, he was the man, and desired the people to get an officer; there was none to be got; they hustled him back into Artillery-lane, the croud still increasing; during this time the prisoner intreated very earnestly that I would let him go, saying, I beg you would let me go, kneeling on the ground; by the assistance of those about him he was taken to Bishopsgate watch-house, to the care of the officer of the night, in order to appear before my Lord-Mayor the next day; while this was carrying on, I was told by some of the croud that my hat had been picked up by some person in Artillery-lane, and taken into a house; as I was returning home I called at the house (as directed,) of one Mrs. Smith, and asked her if she had taken up a hat; she said she had, and produced it; it was my hat; (produced in court and deposed to.)</p>

I am a coal porter, I was going down the Paved Alley at the time this happened; there was a neighbour or two with a candle; I turned up the ditch side, there were five men standing all together, just turning the steps of that side near the market; I went to go by them, said the prisoner what do you want; I said I am only going home with my wife; he struck me three or four times with his left hand; I never saw him before, but I am positive to the man, the other four stood over me helping him; I was struck by one or two of them; the prisoner went from me for about two or three minutes, and came again with a stick about four feet-long, and struck at me twice; I cannot say he hurt me, for I fell down to escape the blows; I catched hold of the middle of the stick with my two hands; they kept haling me backwards and forwards a minute or two, d - ing me, and bidding me let the stick go; I said I would, if you will not use me ill; one of them said, d - m his blood, do not hit him no more, you have given him enough, do not strike him; then they went away towards Fleet-street, and I went home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Catlin strike you?</p>
               <p>Thompson. He stood over me, but he never struck me.</p>

Hannah! my head! as soon as he was in bed, he called upon the Lord and said, O! my head, my head, I am afraid I have got my fatal stroke; he called upon his poor children and said, O! was I but sit to die! and I never heard him speak after, he never opened his eyes after that, this was about one in the morning; he had cried out of his head prodigiously; he died on the Saturday morning the 12th of December, about half an hour after nine; he was sent to the hospital senseless; when the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176801140015"/> surgeon opened his head, he did not seem to feel it.</p>

             the surgeon, whom I am pupil to, he examined his head; I was present when he opened the sclap, but did not immediately find a fracture, therefore he gave me orders to blend him, and do what was necessary; the next morning upon visiting him, I found him upon the point of death; upon representing the case to me, Mr. Young desired I would open the head in case he died, and examine it; I did so, and upon examining it, I found a large fracture from the hind part of the head, to the orbit of the eye, on the right side, with a large depression of the bone, which I really believe was the cause of his death.</p>

On the 26th of December between the hours of eight and nine at night, I was standing in my mother-in-law's shop, Mrs. Chalkhill; I was talking to some people; I heard a cry, there goes the thief; we having been frequently robbed, we had taken this method of tying the fowls all to a string, the string broke; I missing the two geese, went out and followed the prisoner, and saw the two geese on his back; he turned down a court and dropt them; I still followed him; when I came up to him, he took up a brick, and put himself against the wall in a posture of defence, to strike at me; he seeing me resolved to take him ran away; I pursued and took him; he was never out of my sight, or above three arms length from me; we got him to a public-house while I got an officer; we tied his hands, he got loose and knocked down several people that assisted the constable; he vowed revenge when he got his liberty; the geese were taken up and carried back.</p>

             was there, he was made to write, his name, and he was another, one Cornish; Capt. Smith at first insisted he had paid all the money contained in that bill; Glading was called in, and this receipt produced to him; he denied ever having received the money standing against his name, and that the name was not his hand-writing ; I am only speaking of the first meeting, when the arbitrator made Glading write his name; after that Capt. Smith said; he believed he had not paid Glading.</p>

               <p>Crossley. It was in a few minutes talking; I suppose in about five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the Captain account for how Glading's name came to be there?</p>
               <p>Crossley. No, I did not; the man had said he had received no money, and when we saw the receipt, it was judged that was wrong; Glading swore before the arbitrator it was not his handwriting, and he had not received any money; then in about five or six minutes the Captain said, I believe I have not paid Glading; I remember one circumstance when we brought is these people, Mr. Reynolds said to Capt. Smith in my hearing, strike it out of the account; Capt. Smith said no, I will not; but it was afterwards agreed to have it struck out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember there was a letter produced?</p>
               <p>Crossley. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before or after the production of that letter, that he said he believed he had not paid Glading?</p>
               <p>Crossley. It was after the production of the letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember these words paid in part?</p>
               <p>Crossley. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Crossley. I believe this was in October; I was present only at two meetings, the last was when the bag was ran away with; I attended as a friend of Mr. Trinder's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how much the ship had earned?</p>
               <p>Crossley. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>William Green. I am partner with Mr. Trinder in the brewery, not in this; I was present at all the meetings; I was there when there was a dispute about Glading's receipt.</p>
               <p>Q. What meeting was that?</p>
               <p>Green. I believe it was the 30th of September, we challenged the Captain with that as being a forgery, that he never had paid Glading that money; we mentioned it to the arbitrator and Capt. Smith's attorney, that was the portage bill; Capt. Smith insisted upon it he had paid Glading and one Cornish, that he had paid the money himself to these two men, on which we called in Glading and Cornish; Glading insisted upon it that Capt. Smith had never paid him a shilling, and that he never gave him a receipt, and this receipt was shewed to Glading, and he denied that this name was his hand-writing; he had first been sworn, he said that name was spelt differently from his name; he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176801140023"/> ordered to write his name, to compare it to see if it was his or not; after they had compared the hand-writing, the arbitrator insisted upon it it was his hand-writing; Mr. Smith at first said he had paid it, but after that Mr. Reynolds insisted upon it that it should be struck out; afterwards Capt. Smith said, upon my producing a letter which I had in my pocket of Capt. Smith's to Mr. Trinder, desiring Mr. Trinder to pay the money, then Capt. Smith said, he believed it was not paid; in the letter he requested Mr. Trinder to pay the money, as he had been threatened to be sued for it by a proctor; till I produced that letter, the Captain did not express the last doubt about it.</p>
               <p>The letter read to this purport.</p>
               <p>"I have made Glading the sailor the account,</p>

               <p>Q. Was you there when the portage-bill was first produced?</p>
               <p>Green. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. On whose account was you there?</p>
               <p>Green. I was there at the desire of Mr. Trinder, to examine the accounts; I was at all the meetings.</p>
               <p>Q. Take the bill in your hand, is this the same bill?</p>
               <p>Green. This is the same bill, (holding it in his hand.)</p>
               <p>Q. Were the words paid in part there then, as now on that paper, to Glading's name?</p>
               <p>Green. I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you have not spoke of these words having been wrote there when it was produced?</p>
               <p>Green. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear the words were not there at that time?</p>
               <p>Green. No, I will not swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. What words passed between Capt. Smith and Glading, about some slops that Glading had?</p>
               <p>Green. I do not recollect any thing of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon you to say there was no such thing mentioned?</p>
               <p>Green. I will not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at the meetings in order to point out the errors?</p>
               <p>Green. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. As you was there for this purpose, will you take upon you to say, there was not mention made of money being allowed for slops?</p>
               <p>Green. I will not take upon me to say there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there a charge about Cornish of the same sort?</p>
               <p>Green. There was.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it there was not an indictment upon that?</p>
               <p>Green. You know he was discharged at Guild-hall.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the portage-bill was produced, that mention was made of this letter?</p>
               <p>Green. But a few minutes; then it convinced every body that he had not been paid, because Mr. Trinder has paid the money; the balance that was settled was paid by Mr. Trinder long before that.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did Mr. Trinder pay to Glading?</p>
               <p>Green. He paid him 18 l. 2 s. and a penny sterling.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you tell what was allowed for slops?</p>
               <p>Green. No, I cannot; this money was paid in consequence of the letter to Mr. Trinder.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you remember any thing about slops that Glading had?</p>
               <p>Green. No, I cannot; I do of Cornish, because he had not received his money of Capt. Smith, nor of Mr. Tinder neither.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether it is not customary for sailors to put their names to these things, before they receive their money, so trusting to the merchants?</p>
               <p>Green. I do not know that it ever was done; I have paid several ships myself; I have three in my pocket now.</p>

            . I was a mariner on board the Charming Nelly, under Capt. Smith ten months, at 1 l. 16 s. by the month sterling.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was due to you for wages in that ship?</p>
               <p>Glading. I cannot say directly, but I had 18 l. 2 s. and a penny of Mr. Trinder.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Capt. Smith pay you any money?</p>
               <p>Glading. I never received any money of him in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever set your name in the portage-bill?</p>
               <p>Glading. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176801140024"/>Q. Look upon this bill, whether you ever set your name to this?</p>
               <p>Glading. (He takes it in his hand) No, that never was my hand, I never signed it: there was a paper produced to me, in which it was insisted my name was, but that was not my hand-writing, it was not spelt as I spell mine; I shell it Glading, that was Gleading; I never put there in my name; I am sure I never signed no paper only the shipping paper; here is my name that I wrote before the arbitrator on the back of this.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of the difference of the spelling before the arbitrator?</p>
               <p>Glading. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever give any body the authority to write your name on this paper?</p>
               <p>Glading. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been at sea before you went in that ship?</p>
               <p>Glading. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever sign any portage-bill before you received your money?</p>
               <p>Glading. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose 30 l. was due to a sailor, and the Captain to pay him 10 l. in part, is it customary for a sailor to put his name to it, and trust to the Captain for the rest?</p>
               <p>Glading. I never knew any one do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know any one paid in part?</p>
               <p>Glading. No, I do not remember any.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been at sea?</p>

               <p>Glading. I have been at sea fourteen or fifteen years.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this is this your name?</p>
               <p>Glading. (He takes the paper in his hand). This is the way I spell my name, it is my hand-writing; (this is on the back of the bill.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any slops of the Captain, and to what account?</p>
               <p>Glading. I received some slops to the amount of 5 l. and upwards, that was settled with my wages.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you fix the exact sum?</p>
               <p>Glading. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you receive the slops?</p>
               <p>Glading. I received them at Tobago.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you never any conversation with Capt. Smith about settling your wages?</p>
               <p>Glading. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not leave the ships?</p>
               <p>Glading. I did, in the Granades; I went to the main in a trading sloop, my voyage was finished in the Granades; I staid about a fortnight in the town, and asked Capt. Smith for my clothes, and he would not give them to me, he would not pay any body, nor discharge them.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you say your voyage was out?</p>
               <p>Glading. The voyage was to be about three-months, and I was kept about ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Captain go any other voyage besides that?</p>
               <p>Glading. He did not.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you spell Glading?</p>
               <p>J. Glading. We spell it Glading, we do not put the letter in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this bill, the name here, whose writing do you think it is?</p>
               <p>J. Glading. I do not believe this name is my brother's hand-writing, this is Gladi, and a sort of a g; I believe none of these letters are his handwriting.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>In the first place, I never insisted upon any man's hand-writing. I never saw this Glading write; it is very common with me to let my mate and officers settle these accounts; this Glading shipped at the Granades to perform that voyage, when we came to Tobago he ran away, and left the ship, and was two or three months in the woods; after that he solicited me to bring him back; when I settled the portage-bill in figures, I never knew half the people's writing in it; when I came to settle Glading's wages, he would not take his money, and said if I did not allow him the time he was absent from the ship, he knew where to get it; I had only advanced him 5 or 6 l. in part in slops; when he came home, the first news that I had of him, was a letter from the Commons about his money; I immediately sent to Mr. Trinder, and said I was liable to be arrested, and desired he would pay him, and settle the accounts, slops and all; our complement of men were forty-seven; it was some months before this arbitration, that I had sent to Mr. Trinder about this account, and I did not just at first recollect it.</p>

            . I was one of the special jury that was to have tried the cause in which Capt. Smith was plaintiff, and Mr. Trinder the defendant, before Lord Mansfield at Guildhall; when it was gone into a little it was agreed to be referred; it was referred to me, I did not like to undertake it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why so?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176801140025"/>Hodgson. Because I knew Mr. Trinder was a contentious man, and chuses a great deal of law; my Lord Mansfield strongly recommended me, and said I should be indemnified; after my Lord had said so much, I did consent to take it upon me with assistance; Mr. Lee, another special juryman, consented to give me assistance: this cause was in July, and our first meeting was on the 16th of September; there were Mr. Trinder, Mr. Green, Mr. Dalby, and Mr. Macbean; they attended on the part of Mr. Trinder; I gave every body an opportunity, because I wished that every body should be satisfied; there was a charge brought in by Capt. Smith in a book, I went through that charge first, the papers were brought by Mr. Reynolds and Lem; there was a book in which were all the particulars, and they brought vouchers and laid them before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Captain insist that these were real vouchers, or in what way did he bring them?</p>
               <p>Hodgson, I was continually in doubt about it; I had various accounts from various people, people that were thorough masters of these sort of transactions; I took great pains in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the demand on the one side?</p>
               <p>Hodgson. The demand amounted to 2600 l. or thereabouts for provision, for wages, and various other things; money he had paid, commissions for getting the ship supplied, and expences on shore, and many things that constitutes the Captain's demand; I desired the two attornies to both attend; there were a great many vouchers brought; I took the book and crossed what I thought material, and went through the whole on one side the first meeting, but I made no judgment of them then, but laid them by; this was held in Mr. Lee's presence, from about eight in the morning, till between two or three in the afternoon; then I desired they would agree whether that was right cast on one side; Capt. Smith was a stranger to me at this time; I found he was a very bad writer, and did not understand much of figures; after some altercations, and seemingly a good deal of ill-nature from Mr. Trinder, Mr. Lem did come and enter into it on the account of Capt. Smith. I was told there was a set-off which extinguished every article, but no talk of forgeries; then they insinuated that the Captain was a very bad man, and abused him very much; I understood there was something very bad, that I was very much shocked in being concerned in the business; but as Mr. Lee said he would attend me, I did call another meeting; the second meeting was the 23d of September, there was an account produced by Mr. Green in behalf of Mr. Trinder, the attornies were there, and their clerks; I examined the set-off, I believe it was about 2300 l. they have the account; my Lord Mansfield told me I had nothing to do but with that one particular voyage; Mr. Dunbar was the owner, and he had signed his interest to Mr. Trinder; I examined the set-off, and found it amounted to mere nothing, either in one way or the other; it did not amount to I think an hundred pounds; in short, it was generally given up by Mr. Trinder and his friends to about an hundred pounds, that regarded that voyage; the other had been settled and agreed before with Mr. Dunbar; however, there was a disputed article between Mr. Trinder and Mr. Green, which amounted to about 200 l. the Captain said he had paid great part of it; there were words arose upon that, so I recommended that they would settle that between themselves; Green and Trinder would not settle it; this set-off failing so extraordinarily alarmed me very much, I could not conceive the meaning of it, it was only amusing of me, Mr. Dunbar and Mr. Trinder's accounts were so very intricate; Mr. Green behaved very well, in that he said he was sorry that had been produced, but he did not know that they were settled in other accounts, that was 2308 l. there were hints thrown out of forgeries after this set-off; I think there were some insinuations of that sort, but they began to blaze gradually; I begged of Mr. Trinder, and said here is a large sum of money due to the Captain, and said I would do it by an average; I consulted Captains, and took their opinions on it, and gave Mr. Smith no more than a man in such circumstances should have in such a voyage; I said to the others if they did not bring better accounts than these, I should be obliged to give the Captain 2600 l.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the portage-bill first looked over?</p>
               <p>Hodgson. I believe it was looked over at the first meeting.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember this against Glading's own name, these words paid in part?</p>
               <p>Hodgson. I remember it clear and well, it is wrote against the wages per month, 3 l. 6 s. per month.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it produced as evidence that there was wages to be paid by somebody?</p>
               <p>Hodgson. I am sure those words were then, there is a blot upon the name now.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the Captain produced this portage-bill, and insisted upon it as a real voucher?</p>
               <p>Hodgson. I cannot particularly say that the Captain produced it as a voucher, he said he could not remember the names, he could not fix them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176801140026"/> as any body's names, he did not insist upon them; he had some doubts I should give him but very little; Mr. Reynolds told him to go on, and said Mr. Hodgson will not go on without the advice of other people, and he will do you justice if you deserve it: in regard to Glading, Mr. Green retired from this business and he brought in Mr. Crossley; there was a day that Mr. Lee left me, when Glading came in, he gave something the same account he has now. I believe the Captain was extreamly uneasy; they asked about the portage-bill, he said he did not pay Glading, he only paid him in part, he was paid the rest by Mr. Trinder; I believe the Captain did not know who had signed or who not: I then examined Glading, he gave the same account he has now before the Court; I took off a great sum of money. If that trial had gone on at Guildhall, and if Mr. Trinder had not made a better defence than he did before me, I should have given 500 l. more than I have, but I found Mr. Trinder was very much confused with Mr. Dunbar; I gave the Captain 2100 l. I now say Mr. Lee did put the damages himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the letter Mr. Green has mentioned?</p>
               <p>Hodgson. Upon my word I do not, Mr. Green was backwards and forwards, but was particularly ordered to withdraw when this matter of the examition of the witnesses was.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether there was not an attempt made upon you not to make an award?</p>
               <p>Hodgson. Mr. Trinder had spoke to me once or twice to desire some private conversation with me; I did at first say I should be glad to see him at any time; the second time he repeated it; I then told him he did not speak what I could understand, he wanted some private conversation with me; I said I will hear none of you but in public, come there and say all you can; at first he was very angry, and would not come to dine with us; I told them if they would examine how all affairs stood, and see if they had effects to pay in the main, and drop all suits, I would endeavour to get the tradesmen of the ship to take their money in five years, by installments of 20 per cent. per annum. Mr. Trinder said if I would undertake to be arbitrator he would consent to it; I said I would have nothing more to do with arbitration, this one being sufficient for me, Mr. Trinder's people would do nothing towards the set-off; I gave them copies of all the bills; afterwards we had nothing but ill language, words arose to a prodigious pitch, they were very riotous and very troublesome at the last meeting; as Mr. Trinder had been exceeding remiss in going on, I said that morning I would make an end of it; Mr. Macbean, the attorney for Mr. Trinder, behaved exceeding genteel till that very day; he said Mr. Hodgson, this affair grows very serious, here is a vast many forgeries, I desire you will send for Mr. Lee; Mr. Lee was sent for; we sat down, Mr. Macbean then said we can prove forgeries at Portsmouth, and have certificates to prove them; I said bring the people before me, and I will examine them; I told him I determined to make an award; he said I must be cautious what I did, and that it was recommended to me by an eminent counsel to be cautious of what I did, saying he was my friend and countryman; I said I will wait on no counsel, but if the counsel comes to me I was ready to hear what he had to say; Mr. Lee and I agreed at the meeting, Mr. Crossley objected to several articles; we set from ten till one o'clock, when I ordered every body to withdraw but Mr. Crossley and the attornies; they came and broke into the room, I thought the house was coming down, they seized on Mr. Reynolds's bag; I think Mr. Green was the man that seized it.</p>
               <p>Green. The reason that I took the bag was, Mr. Hodgson said there were things of a serious nature, and he would not foul his fingers with them; he would not examine an evidence I brought, but he would examine the Captain; Mr. Crossley told me the Captain said he believed some of them, and I might the rest; the Captain was going away, and as Mr. Hodgson seemed to think he had forgeries in his hands, I was afraid the Captain would run off.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your reason to think so, when here was a balance of 2100 l. due to him?</p>
               <p>Green. The reason was, because the first account he delivered to Mr. Trinder amounted to no more than 1752 l. and 8 d. and the other to 3560 l. and it was declared that Mr. Hodgson would burn his minutes, and I feared all would be destroyed.</p>
               <p>Hodgson. There I blame Mr. Macbean, he knew of this attempt being made; had I known of it, I should not have let the bag be taken; they got the Captain and bag away; the Captain was carried before my Lord-Mayor, there he was set at liberty; I made the award and published it; I was by when Mr. Macbean said, if you will let us have another trial they will give up all these charges; there was my Lord-Mayor, Sir

               <p>Q. At which meeting was it that it was said the Captain had not paid the money?</p>
               <p>Hodgson. That was blazed about I think at the third meeting.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember you did threaten you would burn your minutes?</p>
               <p>Hodgson. I did declare before them all that I would burn them, but Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Lee begged I would keep them.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, were there any hints, or any thing said by Mr. Trinder, more than a private conversation?</p>
               <p>Hodgson. No, he did not explain it. I say now publickly in this court, I would advise every gentleman that is arbitrator, never to take into their hands the papers of any man, for I believe they would have broke into my house as much as they did into the room in the tavern; it was told me several times by some of Mr. Trinder's party, the moment you make your award we shall have the papers; I believe they did intend to prefer bills upon them: when I came to make this award, I had the opinion of several Captains that had known and seen the behaviour of Capt. Smith, who had a very good opinion of him, and Mr. Dunbar gave him a very good character; he said Capt. Smith had been a lucky man to him, that he had taken prizes to the amount of 40,000 l. but he was not then in a situation to pay him a compliment; the Melvil's account was very near two fifths more than this; I had such a character of the Captain by gentlemen, that I had no doubt of his character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lee. I have been present during the examination of Mr. Hodgson, at his request I assisted him; he has given a very just and true account to the Court of what passed; I do not remember during the whole, that Mr. Smith insisted upon any particular hand-writing of any one person; he did not bring them as any particular persons handwriting, but to ascertain his accounts.</p>

Smith delivered to me before the trial; he applied to me, and said I am in great distress, and you have often settled my accounts, I should be glad if you would look over them; I said Captain, from the melancholy tale you tell me, I will do all I can; this article was in the book, then opposite the name of

Smith got up and said, when Glading's name was mentioned, that man ought not to be charged, for he has not received all his wages, and I gave an order to Mr. Trinder to pay the remainder; the portage-bill was then produced, and there was upon that to Glading's name, paid in part; the charge I made was no single charge, but the whole portage; I have known instances that sailors have signed the portage-bill before the account was settled, when it has been in part paid they have signed; mine was not an account closed, mine was the last account that was delivered to the arbitrators; I was in the room with the arbitrators the whole time; upon my oath, I do not believe the Captain said that was Glading's own hand-writing; I know he did say

I put down a guinea on the counter, he gave me a 5 s. 3 d. piece; we went to a public-house and I changed it, and gave him his change; then I went to a pawnbroker in Fleet-street, and pawned them for 14 s. when I went to take them out, he said they belonged to the prosecutor, and told me where he lived; I went to him, he took me to Tothill-fields Bridewell; there I picked the prisoner out, and swore to him that I bought them of him.</p>

            ; our house was made fast on the 26th of November at night, and on Thursday the 27th about half an hour after three in the morning, the watchman alarmed us, and told us our door was open; I desired him to go for the constable and come in, and come up to my door; when they came we went all over the house; we found the dining-room window-shutter, which had been barred over night was thrown open, and the bar taken down; I missed out of that room a tea-kettle, a large table-spoon, and napkin; the constable informed me he had seen several persons about in the morning, and had taken a man into custody on suspicion, and carried him to the Compter, and he was to be examined before my Lord-Mayor at eleven o'clock; he desired me to attend; he made no confession; my Lord advised me to advertise my things, I did; on the Thursday morning the man was discharged, his name is Trusler; on the 14th of December I received word from Justice Fielding, that the persons that got into our house were in custody, and desired me to attend him at eleven o'clock; there I found Trusler and

            , they are both here to give evidence; I never found any of our goods; I went to see Davis in prison, he is our apprentice, he confessed the whole to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he to serve?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. He would have been out of his time next April, he has been gone from us from the 31st of July; I asked him in what manner he got in; he said he took a shutter down in the front of our shop and got in at the window, and after that put the shutter in again; our shutters are rather too short for the groove.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any promise?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. No, I did not; he heard Trusler tell the whole before the Justice, and therefore he did not scrup le acknowledging it to me; the woman Mitchel acknowledged selling the tea kettle for 18 d.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Mitchiner say?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. I do not remember he said any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine your shutters to see if they could be taken down?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. No, I did not; we apprehended they had concealed themselves over night in our cellar, as Davis knew every part of the house, he might have done it without the knowledge of any of our family.</p>

            . I have known Mitchiner about three months, and Davis about two; we went to Mr. Wilkinson's one night with intent to get a stock and bit, that is a carpenter's tool, and we found we could take the window shutter down, so we went from the window till such time that we could take it down; when we came there again, I went and talked to the watchman while Davis took it down, then Mitchiner and he went in; when I came there the door was shut; then I stood at a corner, the constable came and took me to the watch-house, so I know no farther than what the prisoners told me of what they took from the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there of you?</p>

            . I sell fish; I did live with Mitchiner about six years ago, but lately with Davis; one Friday morning, it might be in November, they came home in the New-way Westminster to me; Davis pulled out a tea-spoon to stir his tea, after that he pulled out the other two; then he took out a large table-spoon; then Mitchiner said to him, you may as well show her the other thing, that was a cream-pot; one of them brought a tea-chest and set it on the drawers, there was some tea in it; one of them said it must be sold; there was a tea-kettle that I sold for 18 d. a table-cloth, two napkins, and a piece of sugar, all these they brought between them; I was in bed when they brought them in; they said they had been at a house and got them, but did not tell me where.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Trusler?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. I have known him a great while, he was a companion of the prisoners; they all three went out of my room together that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did they go from your room?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. I parted with them when I went out with my oysters that night; Trusler not coming home with them, they told me they supposed he was taken up; I went the next day to the Compter, and found him there, and carried him some money.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the things?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. A Jew came by; he was called in, and the spoons were sold to him for 12 s. the tea-chest for 2 s. the cream-pot for 7 s. 6 d. I sold the tea-kettle for 8 d. I was ordered to get what I could for them; the sugar and table-cloths were sold to another person, I do not know who, nor what the things were sold for; I think I sold the table-cloths and two-napkins for 2 s. there was a cloth coat that was pawned for half a guinea, and taken out again; I never saw it at all but upon Davis's back; it was a blue one.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you carry to Trusler?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. I carried him two shillings; the two prisoners sent me with it to him at the Poultry Compter.</p>

            . About the middle of November, I was at home in my counting-house in New-street-square, the prisoner came to me, and said he had some oak laths to sell; I knowing it was an uncommon thing in our trade for people to have such smull parcels of laths to dispose of, I imagined he must not come honestly by them; I desired to look at them, and asked where they were; he went away, and in about half an hour he returned, and brought two bundles; then I said I really believed he had stole them; he said they were sent him from a tenant out of the country, I could not give credit to it; then he said if I went to his lodgings, they would give me an account of his character; I went to the house where he said he lodged, the person of the house came to the door; I said do you know this man; yes, said he, he lodges with me; I said I believed he has stole some laths, upon which the prisoner began to move; I said you must not go away; then he went into the house and up stairs, and in about a minute the man of the house cried out there is something broke; we ran into the back yard, the prisoner was got out of the window, and got up upon the top of the house, I saw him running on the ridge; I got a constable and he was taken; I went with him to Justice Girdler, he was committed for farther examination; then there appeared an advertisement in the paper, that a person had stopt some laths in the same way.</p>

            . On the 17th of November the prisoner brought four hundred of laths, and offered me them, and a large chimney-pot, and some Dutch tiles; I asked who they belonged to; he told me they belonged to the widow Young, who lived at, or near the White Swan, Fetter-lane; I sent one of my men to enquire after this widow Young, there was no such person to be found. I advertised the things on the 24th of November, and I received a letter from Justice Girdler to attend him on the 30th; I went, and there I found the prisoner.</p>
