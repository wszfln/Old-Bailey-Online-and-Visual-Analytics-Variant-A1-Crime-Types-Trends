I am a cheesemonger and butterman, at 8, Lower Belgrave Street, Pimlico—the prisoners were in my employment, Siggins for about three years as clerk, and Carpenter as a porter for about four years—Siggins' wages were 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and Carpenter's 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Thomas Hampton is my manager—in his absence it would be Siggins' duty to prepare the things to be taken out by Carpenter—he would book all the things in the day-book which would remain on the desk—Carpenter bad a. book provided for him in which to enter all the things he left at the different customers—Carpenter was away from my employment for two or three months, from January to March, 1874—a man named Brighty was with me as groom for four or five years—he left in the early part of October last, year—Hampton went for his holiday in August last, and Siggins then per<lb/>formed his duties, and had the whole management of the books—on 26th August I missed 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—about the first week in December I met Brighty at Aldridge's—he made a statement to me, in consequence of which I com<lb/>municated with the police, and afterwards gave the prisoners into custody.</p>

I live at 14, Whitaker Street, Pimlico—during 1874 I was groom to Mr. Perks, and used to drive about with him—when I got married I had to leave—while I was there the prisoners were in the employ—Carpenter was away for about three months at the commencement of 1874—one day while he was away I saw him and Siggins together at breakfast in a coffee-shop in Buckingham Palace Road—they were sitting together conversing; I sat at the same table—Carpenter said he was going to write to the governor to see whether he would take him back, as it would be fortunate or a fortune to him to get back, as he knew more about James (meaning Siggins) than ever he did—he did come back to the employ shortly after—in August, when Hampton was away for his holiday, Siggins had to do his work—I remember something taking place about a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—Siggins asked me to take a piece of paper to his land<lb/>lady, to admit me to his room to take his bank-book and purse and bring them back to him—I took the key of his door and the key of a box, and went to his lodging; I was shown his room; I opened a box with the key and took from it a bank-book and a purse—I looked in the book, it was open, and the amount was 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took the book and the puree to Siggins—he told me there was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note lost, and he did not want the governor to go and ransack his place—this is like the book—I left the employ soon after—I afterwards saw Mr. Perks at Aldridge's, and told him in substance what I have now stated.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter, living at 4, Cross Keys Square, Little Britain—on the evening of 8th January I was walking along Long Lane with a friend, about 10 o'clock or 10.15—I was set upon by a gang of about a dozen men, who hustled me—they turned me completely round and hustled against me, making a noise with their mouths—they did not say anything—my watch was in my pocket at that time—I had a great</p>

Friday, the 22nd January, she was confined in the punishment cell, which is on a corridor where there are a number of other cells—a number of pri<lb/>soners were in these cells—the punishment cell has a place about 6 or 7 feet from the ground for letting the warm air in from the corridor—the other cells in the corridor have similar places opening on to the corridor, and there are also apertures level with the floor for taking the bad air off—the punish<lb/>ment cell is part brick and part stone, and the door is wood lined with iron—there is a sort of closet in the cell with a pan to it—the seat is made of wood, and is fixed to the building—there is a gas light also in the cell—on Friday morning, 22nd January, I went to the prisoner's cell about 8 o'clock—I lighted her gas—I gave her her bedding, which consisted of a straw mattress, two blankets, and a rug—the mattress goes on the floor—I left her, leaving the gas alight—I went on to other cells—I was about about two minutes, and then went back to her cell—I did not go in—I put her gas out by turning a tap on the outside of the cell—there is a trap to the door, which is made of wood—I opened the trap and asked her if she was all right, and if she was in bed, and she said "Yes, she was"—I shut the trap and proceeded downstairs to, another landing.—the other prisoners in the corridor had had their beds—I went on to the next prison and put the gas out,. and on coming back again I heard ringing of bells and cries of "Fire!"—that was in about ten minutes—I first went into the prison to inquire where the alarm was, and from there I went up to the corridor where the prisoner's cell was—I noticed very dense smoke coming from the ventilator of her cell—I opened the door—I heard her crying out, and I was obliged to rush back, the smoke was so dense—sub-warder Wilson was with me and she pulled the prisoner out—she was in a fainting state—I noticed fire in the cell and a dense smoke—as soon as I opened the door the fire blazed up from the bedding on the floor—the prisoner was lying with her head on the seat of the closet when I first saw her—I got her some water; she was very sick and faint—Fuller one of the male warders came with assistance after I had reported to the matron—the fire was ultimately put out—the prisoner was taken to another cell in a different part of the prison—I asked her how she had done it—she said "I lighted my pocket-handkerchief and hid it white you passed downstairs and then flared it up to make it blaze, then threw it on my bed; when I found that it did not burn quick enough I undressed and took off my underclothing to make it burn better, and I only wish I had burnt the b—prison down"—I examined the cell afterwards—the bed and the blankets were burnt, and the clothing belonging to the prisoner—I found her clothing was deficient</p>

I am one of the sub-warders at the House of Correction at Westminster—on Friday evening, 22nd January, I heard the alarm of fire and went to the prisoner's cell with the last witness—the corridor was smoky, and I saw smoke issuing from the door and the ventilator of the prisoner's cell—the door was opened—the cell was full of smoke—very dense—the prisoner was on her knees at the aperture where the closet is; I pulled her out by the arm—she was suffocating, and vomited when she was outside—after some little time she said if she had been there many minutes longer she should have been suffocated—I asked her why she did it, and she said "I did it for a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>, I wanted to see my bed on fire"—she was afterwards taken to another part of the prison, and nine other prisoners were taken out of their cells and removed because of the smoke—I went into their cells, they were smelling very much of smoke, in fact the corridor was full of smoke—the windows had to be taken out so as to let in as much air as possible—the window of the prisoner's cell was broken to let the air in there—this corridor was the top tier of the building.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SEBJEANT SLEIGH</hi>. I was introduced to McCorkell by Beardsell—I had no office at that time, I was in negotiations for a partnership with Beardsell, and my introduction to McCorkell was not in reference to the concession—my business was as a mercantile man, an agent in procuring capital, and financing things, and so forth—my introduction to McCorkell was not in reference to the Port Royal matter or to the Hun<lb/>garian mines, it was merely as a friend; I had known him all my life, he had been at school with my brother and I frequently heard of him—I undertook to endeavour to procure capital for working the Hungarian mines for McCorkell—he brought Mr. McEwen there specially to see me, and represented that the mines were McEwen's, and that capital was necessary to carry on the operations—I was spoken to to assist in carrying the project out—Bearilsell's office was at 7, Ironmonger Lane—that was not the office on which "McCorkell &amp; Co." was painted, it was six months later, at Lady Day, that that office was taken—I went to the landlord of the rooms is Victoria Street about taking them and a lease was granted to me—I do not know that it was at my request that McCorkell's name was painted up, but I told him that I could not have my own name painted up; I was not going to trade—I do not call these mercantile matters, I call them</p>

Third floor in September—I do not remember that McCorkell expressed himself in very strong and indignant terms about Beardsell obtaining the chocolate, or that he said that he would not allow his name to remain on the doorpost any longer, but I will not undertake to swear that he did not—I do not remember anything of the kind, but to the best of my belief it did not occur—I believe Mr. Scalski was present at the interview, and I wish I knew where to find him—my furniture was seized eventually for Scalski's rent—I transferred it to him when I left the place, and he did not pay me—he was accepted as tenant in my place by the Insurance Company—I sold the chocolate as soon as I could, two or three days after I became, possessed of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 43, Commercial Road, Peckham, and am ship<lb/>ping agent for Elliott, Hinchliffe, &amp; Sons, of Leeds—in June and July last I also represented another firm at Brampton Mills—I have known Beardsell several years—I saw him in May last and he said "I am buyer to McCorkell &amp; <hi rend="italic">Co.</hi>" and that that firm was established to do shipping business, especially to Hungary, that Mr. McEwen was a large land owner in Hungary, that his property consisted of mines of chrome ore, lying on the surface, which had been surveyed at a cost of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and were estimated to be worth 110,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and that he would pay 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the concern, but he could not do so till the 1st of October, as it would be realised on the chrome ore, which had to be brought to England for sale—I asked him who McEwen was—he said that he lately had an office in Lombard Street, and said "You know, that financial man"—I said "I don't know him"—he said "The fact is the Hungary business is only a snail slice of what his means are," and he gave me references—those statements cover three or four interviews, and McCorkell was present at one of them—Beardsell told me at one interview that McCorkell had been a Justice of the Peace at Jamaica and had a concession from the. Govern<lb/>ment there with reference to digging up Port Royal—he gave me this</p>

               <p>prospectus about it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said that McCorkell was a partner in the firm for the purposes of the concession, but McCorkell was not present—I mentioned the firm of Elliott., Hinchliffe &amp; Co., of Leeds, and Beardsell said that if I could get him a couple of sets of patterns he would send them to his agent at Pesth, in Hungary, but he would not order until he had the patterns—that was in May, I think—I gave him some samples about 5 in. by 3 in., which could easily be sent to Hungary by post—he said that McEwen was very well known at Pesth, which would very much influence the business—an order was sent to Leeds by letter, and on the 18th of August I saw Beardsell and McEwen together at their office, which was then moved up to the third floor—I went to them on purpose to get McEwen's responsibility with regard to payment, and I said that we could not execute the order till we had made McEwen personally responsible—this memorandum was drawn out at my suggestion, and I saw McEwen sign it—the substance of it is Beardsell's writing—I was constantly there deciding whether the references were satisfactory—McCorkell was the head of the firm—a partnership agreement was completed—it was not shown to me, but they spoke of it and said that 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was mentioned in it—on the 8th of September I wrote to my principals, and I know that one parcel of goods was delivered at Turner's, the packers in Barge Yard—this is the invoice. (<hi rend="italic">This referred to nine, pieces of cloth, amounting to</hi> 86<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.) Beardsell instructed me in September to forward other parcels from the same samples—Mr. Corkell was present—they said nothing about the partnership being cancelled on 1st September, I never knew it till. 15th November after they were in custody—a third parcel of goods was sent about 18th September, and this is the invoice. (<hi rend="italic">This was for</hi> 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., <hi rend="italic">for three pieces of cloth.</hi>) I received the order from Beardsell, in McCorkell's presence—I do not think we received any other orders—I called several times in October and saw Beardsell—he said that he was not ready to pay me, and in fact it was not due till November, because the goods were de<lb/>livered late—I reminded him that we had a special arrangement for payment in October and I could not make' any alteration in it, he must write direct to the firm. (<hi rend="italic">A letter from Beardsell to Hincheliffe &amp; Sons was here put in, stating that the amount would not be due till November, as explained to Mr. Page.</hi>) From the middle to the end of October I called constantly at the office, till one day at the end of October I found it closed, and on another day I went and the name of McCorkell was taken out and Alexander McEwen put up—I found no one there connected with the firm—I afterwards met Beardsell in the street and requested him to come to my office with McEwen, which he did—I wanted a settlement of the account and to know what arrangement they were going to make—Beardsell said that it should be settled in a few days, that McEwen's money would be realised shortly and we need not have any fear-two days after that I discovered that the goods had been pawned—they both called again at my office on 5th or 6th November, and Beardsell told Mr. Crier and myself, that McEwen would be prepared to meet the amount in a few days, and that Hinchcliffe &amp; Smith, of Manchester, had agreed to accept a first charge, upon the matter coming into a solicitor's hands, for payment of their account—I told him that that would not suit, and that we had discovered that the goods had been pawned—Beardsell said "I am astonished, you have sprung a mine-upon me, I sold the goods in the ordinary course of business and if you saw our books you would find them invoiced to Crevey &amp; Co., of Friday Street"—I did not name any particular parcel of goods that had been</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187502010036"/>
               <p>pawned—Bcardsell said "They were sold very much against my wish to Crevey &amp; Co. by McCorkell, I am afraid we shall never get our money and McEwen will be the loser; if you wait you will get your money, but it is not possible to get blood out of a stone. Mr. McEwen's papers are in the hands of Morgan &amp; Alsop, of Cannon Street, and they would not detain them for four or five months unless there was something in them. Mr. McEwen is so much vexed with the delay that he has withdrawn them and put them into somebody else's hands"—that was on 3rd November—on 11th November I met Beardsell in Gutter Lane and told him that warrants would be applied for if we found out any more about the goods—he said that no manufacturer with any sense in his head would go to the expense of prose<lb/>cuting a man after having lost 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went to the solicitors several times to see the agreement, and asked to see Mr. Godfrey, but never saw him—Beardsell took me there, but he did not show me any agreement—Beardsell asked if there was an agreement, and they said that there was, and told me the terms of it, and about the 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had not on 3rd November ascertained as a fact where the goods were, but at the end of the same week I ascertained that they were at Attenborough's, after which I applied for warrants at the Mansion House—I never held out to any of the prisoners that proceedings would not be taken, on the contrary, they were told distinctly before I knew that the goods were at Attenborough's that if once the warrants were applied for nothing could stop it—neither Mr. Crier, or I suggested that they should pay any money—the Mansion House was first mentioned on 1st November by Mr. Crier—previous to November 2nd I met Beardsell in Walbrook and asked him how it occurred that McCorkell's name was taken down and McEwen's put up—he said that McCorkell's name was very little use to him, that it had been a drag upon him was his expression—this is the statement of our firm—it contains all the three deliveries. (<hi rend="italic">The total of the three was</hi> 168<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.) I saw McEwen sign this letter, "Elliott Hinchcliffie &amp; Co. Gentlemen,—I beg to confirm any transactions you may enter into with Messrs. McCorkell &amp; Co., of which firm I am a partner—I should have written to this effect before, but have been absent on the Continent, Alexander McEwen"—this pencil memorandum is one of those which were left in my office by Beardsell about November 5th. (<hi rend="italic">This stated "I have seen Mr. McCorkell who will bring C. &amp; Co. to anchor</hi>") I did not then know of my own knowledge where the goods were pawned—at the end of July or the beginning of August I borrowed 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Beardsell—I don't suppose the others know anything about it—I gave six references for McCorkell &amp; Co., but the only goods supplied on my reference were to Hinchcliffe &amp; Smith of Manchester—some were sent to Robinson &amp; Clay, but not in my reference—I asked for patterns to send to Hungary, I did not see them again—there is nothing unusual about that—the Bampton Company did not supply any goods.</p>

The order for Hungary was sent to Hinchcliffe's, but part of it was not executed—I have known Beardsell a very long time, but not twenty years—during all that time he has borne an exceedingly good character, and I still say that of him—he was in business before as Naldre, Beardsell &amp; Jackson, and failed—I knew that at the time I was dealing with him—his bankruptcy was five years before—I did not know that he had taken upon himself the obligations of his partners, nor do I know it now, I have no means of knowing it—he bore a high commercial character as to knowledge of business—I made enquiries about McEwen and McCorkell</p>

               <p>and went with Beardsell to Mr. Godfrey's office and saw a clerk about McEwen bringing 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the firm—that representation was confirmed as far as was possible but nothing was shown to me—I could not get to see any docu<lb/>ment—I have not since seen the agreement and the documents about McEwen's property—I not only supplied goods but gave references to other people, and I should not have done that unless I believed the representations thoroughly—the last time I saw any of the prisoners was on 11th November, when I saw Beardsell, and on the 12th he was taken in custody—I had been with the attorney's clerk on the 2nd or 3rd to the Mansion House to apply for a warrant—and I subsequently went again and obtained it—I did not tell Beardsell I had applied for a warrant—he had told me a week or ten days previously that no Magistrate would grant a warrant, and when I met him in the street I said that we had applied for the warrant and it appeared to me that it would be granted—it had been granted at that time, but it is not likely that I was going to tell him that—he only missed the second appoint<lb/>ment, he came on the 3rd and again on the 4th, and McEwen with him—I think I saw him again on the 10th—he came to me twice with McEwen about settling the matter—Mr. Crier was with me on two occasions, but it was not in my office, it was in the street, it was on the 3rd and 4th—after I had been to the Mansion House on the 3rd, I asked him on the 6th to settle the account, but I did not ask him to do so after the warrant was granted—I cannot say whether if he had settled it on the 4th nothing more would have been heard of this, but my impression is that we should not have pressed the matter further, and if he had paid the money he could have done what he liked with the goods—Beardsell told me that he could not pay till October 1st, because the money was coming in then or shortly afterwards—he told me after that and up to the middle of October that the money had not come in yet, but that they were expecting it every day—before the first parcel of goods was sent he said that they were not ready in time and he would cancel the order—the value of that parcel was about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he might have had them if he had not cancelled it, in a week or ten days—it was that which made the impression on my mind as to the respectability of the firm—I was a fortnight before I obtained an actual order for the goods—I asked for an order before that, I did not know how long it would take for the order to come from Hungary—Beardsell said that the order would be over directly and that they should then go on with orders every week—he did not say that he did not wish to give me an order till October, had he received the goods in May I should have allowed the payment to be made in October, provided my principals were willing—if he had given the order a fortnight before, I should have executed it, subject to my principals—I had sent an order to the North in August from McCorkell &amp; Co. which was not executed—I asked for the order two or three days before I got it—he gave me a reference to the Mexican Consul.</p>

Mr. McCorkell said this McEwen was worth property abroad to several thousands and a very rich man. I said ho had better do it himself. He said he would feel obliged if I would do it, and he would pay me for my trouble 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent. on the amount advanced. I said if the goods were his own and it was all straightforward I would do it. I assented. He went with me to the packers in Barge Yard. He asked Mr. Turner to give the goods over to this gentleman. I fetched the cart from Maggs on Dowgate Hill. I went back alone with the cart and the goods were put into the cart. McCorkell told me to pawn them at Attenborough's. I told the boy to drive to Temple Bar. I met him there. I told him to drive to Catherine Street, Strand. I asked the pawnbroker, Sayers, to make a loan on them. They would not take them in. I then told the boy to drive to Attenborough's, in Charlotte Street. The goods were taken out of the cart-; about nine pieces.

                  </hi>. I am shipping agent to Messrs. Robinson and Clay, woollen merchants of Leeds—I have an office at 10, Ironmonger Lane—I got this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on September 1st from my traveller. (Mr. <hi rend="italic">Cumming staled that he believed this to be in Beardsell's tenting, but would not say for certain; it wasfrom McCorkell &amp; Co. to the witness, ordering four pieces of cloth, asking the price of black unions and giving references.</hi>) I called at Queen Victoria Street next day and saw Beardsell, who said that he was the buyer for McCorkell &amp; Co., and that the goods were bought for shipment to Hungary, and would probably lead to a large business—that was on the 2nd September—he said that Mr. McEwen had long been resident at Pesth and was a man of large property there, and he was engaged in this country to work some mines, and that he was to bring 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the busiuess on 1st October—I accepted the order conditionally on the references being satisfactory—the references were marked on the order—I afterwards wrote to my principals, giving them the substance of the conversation, and left them to inquire into the references—I heard from them, and in consequence of that I called again at Queen Victoria Street on the 4th September—I saw Beardsell and McEwen there together, seated at the same table, one on each side—Beardbell repeated what he had said on the previous occasion as to their being engaged in the Hungarian trade, and also as to McEwen's mines</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187502010043"/>
               <p>and his bringing money into the business on 1st October, and they showed me some prospectuses and reports connected with Mr. McEwen's business in Hungary—McEwen did not exactly join in the conversation, but he assented to the statements that were made—I saw amongst their papers some invoices of goods in a drawer in the office table—I saw an invoice from Elliott, Hinchliff &amp; Sons, of Leeds, and Beardsell showed me the copy in their letter book of a letter which they had written to Elliott Hinchliffe &amp; Sons—I asked him to give us a similar letter, and they said that they should have no ob<lb/>jection, and gave me this letter of guarantee. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 17th September</hi>, 1874, <hi rend="italic">to Robinson &amp; Clay, Leeds. "Gentlemen, beg to confirm any transactions you may enter into with McCorkell &amp; Co. of which I have been a partner since 12th June last. Yours respectfully, Alex. McEwen</hi>") I was induced to accept the order on the representation that McEwen was to bring 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the business on 1st October, it being confirmed by that guarantee—this other order was afterwards sent to my office. (<hi rend="italic">This was an order for eighteen pieces more of the unions—signed "W. McCoriell &amp; Co.</hi>") Thai reached us on 19th September, and I went the same day to see Beardsell at 8, Queen Victoria Street, to ask whether they would pay promptly for the goods—he said that they could not do so because McEwen's money was not at present in the business—I told him that I would submit the order, and I sent it down—I called again on 23rd September, and saw Beardsell and McCorkell—I again urged prompt payment, and finding I could not get it I told them that we could not produce the order earlier than 16th November—I asked whether they would like to have the goods under those circumstances, they said "Yes," and that they would get other goods to go on with for their immediate wants, and these would come in at that date—the Samples were to go to Hungary, and I presumed that the goods were going there—those goods were never supplied—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) represents the four sample pieces of black union cloth, it is in the writing of one of our clerks—the amount is 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was sent to Barge Yard, and if the order had been executed it would have amounted to 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Beardsell afterwards brought me a pattern and said "We can take a large quantity of these goods, and can pay cash in fourteen days for them"—I understood that the order was for Hungary—nothing came of that, because we could not match the goods, and they were hot our manufacture—I called several times in October about the goods they wanted to match, but could find no one in, and I afterwards found that the name of the firm was taken off the door, and after a day or two the name of Alexander McEwen was substituted—I afterwards saw McEwen and McCorkell in Walbrook and asked them how it was that the office was shut up—McEwen was the spokesman principally, but McCorkell was stand<lb/>ing by—they said that they were still carrying on the business there, and if I called on Monday I should see Mr. Beardsell—I said nothing about the account because it was not due—I called on the Monday, but nobody was there—I met McEwen in Gresham Street on 31st October, his name also had then been taken off the door—I asked him how it was that the place was shut up, and what was to be done about our account which was due to<lb/>morrow—he promised to call at my office with Beardsell and explain every<lb/>thing—as to the name being taken off the door, McEwen said that there had been some difficulty and he had taken the affair into his own name—they came to my office on the 2nd, in my absence, and left a message under the door saying that they would come next day, and on 3rd November Beardsell and McEwen came, and Beardsell said that there had been diffi<lb/>culty</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187502010044"/>
               <p>between them and there was going to be a dissolution of partnership between McCorkell and McEwen, or that there had been, which had arisen from McCorkell endeavouring to make McEwen responsible fur debts con<lb/>tracted before their connection; that there were many demands made on Mr. McEwen and he should require some little time to satisfy them, and they would take other offices and Mr. McEwen would see us properly paid-nothing has been paid—Mr. Boddington and Mr. Page were the referees—I knew that he had been bankrupt, I saw it in the paper—he told me that he had been in difficulties, he did not say that he had failed—he said, with reference to the second order, that he would not pay till McEwen's money was brought into the concern—on 3rd November, with reference to the order that was standing over, Beardsell said "Postpone it until we are in clear water"—he also said that McEwen's property was not in, there had been some mismanagement in realising it—I never applied to them for orders, and never heard of them till a man in my employment brought the first order in—I did not solicit them for orders, but my travellers may have done so—I did not solicit them for further orders, and I know that my man did not—Beardsell said that McEwen's property consisted of mines—they showed me a prospectus and a report, but I did not read it through—it ap<lb/>peared to be a genuine document—I only sent the parcel of goods value 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I believed that the firm was established for the purpose of shipping goods to Hungary, and that belief continued after the first parcel of goods were sold, and while I was negociating the second parcel.</p>

Beardsell himself told me he had been bankrupt—I am certain that four pieces were bought for Hungary—no mention was made of home trade—the order was taken by our traveller—I was not present, but I saw Beardsell on the receipt of it, and he said that we had better delay it till they were in clear water.</p>

I was induced to take the order on the representation of the 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. coming from Hungary—two photographs of the Hungarian mines were in the office, and also some samples of chrome ore—I do not remember being told that McEwen's solicitor resided in the same street, and that I might make any enquiries I pleased of him about the Hungarian mines—we had the two references who have been referred to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> McEwen told me that he had a large connection at Pesth, and that they were going to ship goods there, which induced me to allow the first order to be executed—the prospect of payment was the main thing—if we had supposed that the goods were for this country we should not have let them go there, from the appearance of the house, because it did not look like a house doing a home trade.</p>

                  </hi>. I am agent for Hinchliffe &amp; Smith, of Manchester, manufacturers—my office was at 3, Carey Lane—in the first week in August I met Beardsell, whom I had known for some time, in Cheapside—he asked me what business I was in—I said that I represented one or two manufac<lb/>turers—he asked me what class of goods, I told him and he said that he thought he could do business with me—he said I am buying for a very, re<lb/>spectable house in the city, William McCorkell &amp; Co.—he afterwards gave me a call and asked my terms, I told him, and he said "One of our firm, Mr. McEwen, is a very wealthy man, and in October he will be placing 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the firm, but till then they have not much means at command, but I will give you satisfactory references"—he spoke of mines in Hungary worth some<lb/>thing like 80,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which was shortly to he realised—he gave me a verbal order for some patterns, and on the next day Mr. Hinchliffe happening to be in London he went with me to see the references—we went first, I think, to Mr. Page, who told us that his foreman had made enquiries about them, and we were both satisfied—this is the first order given to us (<hi rend="italic">dated September</hi> ll<hi rend="italic">th</hi>) it amounts to 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I forwarded those goods to Turner, the packer, to the order of McCorkell &amp; Co.—they gave me a second order which amounted to 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. one portion was sent from my place and the other portion from Manchester, and the two formed the one order for 81<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but my goods went to Swan's the packers, not to Turner's—as the money coming into the firm was not to arrive till October, the terms arranged were for payment to be made, I think, somewhere about 14th October—the next order was for 115 pieces of drill, value 127<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is the invoice, it is dated September 11th—they were sent to Swann also—I also had other dealings with the defendants and was a purchaser of goods from them—I purchased three pieces of Melton from them on 23rd September and four pieces of deerskin on 6th September, which came to 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., this is the invoice—I also bought of them 115 pieces of drill on 18th September, which came to 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., of which this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the invoice—that last parcel were the goods of my principals, Hinchliffe &amp; Smith—the patterns were submitted to me and I said that I had a customer who I thought would buy them—I submitted them to him and he bought them—his name is Judd—he was then in-business and I knew nothing against his character then—the goods arrived on the 12th and I purchased them on the 18th—he agreed to buy them on a certain con<lb/>dition which I accepted—when Beardsell offered me the first parcel of goods he said "I want to go down to Manchester and I shall want you to lend me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" I agreed to do so, that was part and parcel of my contract—those were not the goods of my principals—Beardsell represented that the drills were for shipping and that McCorkell was going to take them to Jamaica with him, in fact they were not fit for the home trade—I paid for the goods with these cheques. (<hi rend="italic">One of these was for</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">l., another for</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">l., two for</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and there was an I O U to Beardsell for</hi> 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187502010046"/>
               <p>bought them, but he did not ask me to get my principals to take them back; he said "Can't you take them yourself and find a customer," and he may have said "or I shall have to send them back"—I bought them at a profit of 2 1/2 per cent. and in selling them I made a profit on them—I sold the greater part of them to Emdell subsequently; originally I sold them to Judd, but he did not carry out the arrangement—I only took one parcel of goods that came from Hinchliffe &amp; Smith's, about 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—I was to pay him 135<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or more—I owe them about 129<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. now—I am charging these men criminally with obtaining these goods and owing them in respect of these very goods—I saw the agreement at Mr. Godfrey's office and satisfied myself that it was genuine—I believe that that property is in existence belonging to McEwen, I have made inquiries since and have no doubt of it—I have seen the documents—I also went to Mr. Boddington—I have had very little conversation with McEwen.</p>

Cole, of Essex, Street, but I know nothing of them—I do not know Mr. Brown, of Finsbury Place, I have not made inquiries about him or about Bell &amp; Crowder—the prisoners sold the goods to me at a profit beyond what they were to pay to my principals and I sold them again at a profit to myself—I am not now agent to Messrs. Hinchliffe, I was so at the time of the last trial—I received a letter last week by which I was dismissed—I have known Beardsell many years, but never heard anything against him—I knew that he had had the misfortune to fail, but I do not know that it was in consequence of taking upon himself the liabilities of his former firm.</p>

Some of our stock was in Lyde's hands; but very little—he did not dispose of it, I was in London and sold it myself—there might have been stock remaining in his hands for a few days after this matter—I cannot say positively whether he sold it or whether I did—we have not settled up yet—I gave him a formal notice—my attorney did not suggest that—I heard Lyde swear here last Session that he was our agent—I did not contradict that—I said that he was our formal agent—he has acted as agent for us six or seven months now—he has never advanced us money in any shape or form—I did not see the deeds or the prospectus of the Hungarian property; but there were a lot of papers on the table in the office when I went in—Mr. Sheerer was there—they were mentioned to me, and no doubt I might have seen them—they were simply lying about—the contents were mentioned to me possibly—I do not remember them being held up—Beardsell at some time gave me a prospectus of some mine of which I took no notice—I did not take it away, it must, have been left in Lyde's office—I did not see on it the name of Mr. James Bell, solicitor, of Victoria Buildings—I did not look to see who the directors were—I did not read it over—I believe I have heard Mr. Bell's name mentioned—I did not hear him referred to as Registrar of the King<lb/>ston County Court, or as a partner in the firm of Bell &amp; Crowder—I did not hear the name of Cole, Cole, &amp; Jackson, of Essex Street, attornies, mentioned as negotiating the sale of this property—I do not remember Beardsell mentioning it, or the name of Mr. Brown, an attorney, of Fins-bury Square—he mentioned Morgan &amp; Allsopp as gentlemen who had the papers in their possession—I heard Mr. Allsopp examined on the last occa<lb/>sion; if he said that the matter was put into his hands by Mr. Beardsell I have forgotten it—I have not enquired of Mr. Bell, or of Messrs. Cole, or of Mr. Brown, or of Morgan &amp; Allsopp—I have made no enquiry about the property—I have seen in the letter-book a large quantity of letters between McCorkell and other gentlemen about property, in Jamaica—I have not made enquiries about them; I did not consider that the question—I heard the letters read in Court, and heard it stated that McCorkell was in com<lb/>munication with the Colonial Secretary on the subject.</p>

I have not had many trans<lb/>actions with Lyde since he-became my agent—he never made any advance of money to me—he has not given me his acceptance for the value of goods he had of mine, nor have I drawn on him—he termed himself a warehouseman, and acted as our agent as well, and on two or three occasions he has written and offered to buy certain goods, and he has bought them and given his acceptance instead of paying cash—I believe he has dis-counted one or two of our bills in London—he has not bought goods of us on his own account to the value of so much as 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he has never procured money for us upon goods consigned to him before the purchase was concluded by the buyer—I know Mr. Coral.</p>

The papers were left with Mr. Lyde for my perusal—I did not go to Lyde's place of business to meet these people, but to transact business—I was not shown specimens of the ore—I unfortunately trusted too much to Mr. Lyde—the papers were left there, I believe, to satisfy him and thereby satisfy me—I undoubtedly had the opportunity of looking at them—Morgan &amp; Allsopp had been mentioned to me as financial agents once or twice on previous occasions—the matter was discussed more than once—I may have heard a conversation as to a com<lb/>mission to Lyde if he could find a financier to deal with the property, but I cannot speak definitely to that—I made no enquiries of Morgan &amp; Allsopp or of anybody whose name was mentioned, we trusted to our agent.</p>

I am clerk to Mr. Plunkett, solicitor to Elliott, Hinchliffe &amp; Sons, and to Hinchliffe &amp; Smith—I have had charge of the case since it has been at the Mansion House—this letter-book has been principally in my possession—I have examined it and find a number of letters ordering goods, and after communicating by letter I received certain letters. back from the country. (<hi rend="italic">The first of these was from McCorkell &amp; Go. to Macfie &amp; Co., of Birmingham, ordering two tons of bottling ware, in Beardsell's writing as proved by Mr. Cumming, another in McEwen's writing was to Brady &amp; Co. of Birmingham, stating that they had not yet received quotations, and that. their client would not be in town till Tuesday.

(<hi rend="italic">Mr. Cumming stated that these five letters were in Beardell's writing.</hi>) Here is also one from Captain Chapman, and another from Beardsell to Messrs. Hainsworth.

McGill &amp; Co., of Leeds, three to Hinchliffie &amp; Son, of Leeds, three to Hinchlifife, of Manchester, and one to Robinson &amp; Clay—the stock-book is the entry of goods brought into the firm; the first entry in it is Beardsell's and the rest mine—I copied the entries from the invoices—I saw Martyn there on an average three times a week—I heard McEwen tell McCorkell to tell Beardsell that he would have nothing to do with the cloth business as it was not his business—that was about a week before the close of the office—in the beginning of October, the last week I was there, I lent Beardsell some money—I asked McEwen if I should lend it to Beardsell, and he said that I might trust him up to 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Beardsell sent me to Turner, the packer, to ask if any goods had come from Manchester or Leeds—I came back and told him that there was a sale of goods, but he did not know whether it was for him or not, and he went out shortly after<lb/>wards—McCorkell was there nearly every day—the office was closed nearly two weeks before I left, during which time I saw the defendants at Deacon's public-house, in the smoking-room—I told Beardsell I did not like to see them there it was hardly respectable—he did nothing there but smoke that I could see—he said that the office would no doubt be open by that time, would I go up and see; and that a distress was put in—I went and</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Morgan, Allsopp &amp; Co., commission agents—I have seen McCorkell several times—he said "I want to dispose of some chrome ore which is at Pesth"—I said "How are you going to get it here?<hi rend="italic"/>"—he gave me an analysis of it, which I think was made by a man in Dublin, and left a small sample, which I returned to him—he valued it at from 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per ton—it was not crushed, and there was a considerable difficulty about selling it—my partner said that an engineer should go to Hungary to examine the property and verify the statement before any advance could be made, which would cost 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was at the end of May or the beginning of June—I last saw him on the subject at the end of October—I never made him believe that I would lend him any money, it is not our business—if the matter had turned out pro<lb/>perly and there was &amp; market for the ore I should have thought twice about advancing any money—we had two pages of Professor Hull's report copied and sent it to a friend, and I believe the analysis was satisfactory, it was a large analysis and it appeared to be <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi>—a proposal was made to bring out a company to sell the ore, but I declined that as the company had been brought out before—it was Mr. Boddington who introduced McCorkell—I did not see Mr. Rock at all—the matter came into my office about the end of May, and at the end of October I finally declined to have anything to do with it—I advanced no money—no money was forthcoming to go to Hun<lb/>gary with—I was not asked to supply it—I did not endeavour to raise 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. interest—it was a commission—this is the letter and this is our reply. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated June</hi> 27<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1874, <hi rend="italic">proposing payment of a lump sum of</hi> 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">in lieu of commission, and</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">l. per cent, if an agency was after<lb/>wards required.</hi>) Boddington wanted 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for introducing the business, but we cannot read those letters from our letter-book, they are Boddington's—no terms were mentioned for a loan, it never went so far as offering terms—no contract was made—I believe Boddington has an office in the City—I saw him in my office—I saw him last about the month of October.</p>

Cole or any attorney connected with the matter—I forwarded the analysis to Mr. Reynolds, a friend of mine, to have it tested, because we could have sold the chrome.</p>

We did not make full enquiries about the property in Hungary because the time had not come for that—I was furnished by McCorkell with full information in reference to the extent of the property and the mineral resources—I saw him a good many times—he furnished me with two specimens of ore, and told me that the property consisted of about 50,000 acres on the banks of the Danube, which contained not merely chrome but coal and iron—that was the information Mr. Bod<lb/>dington</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman R</hi> 475). On Saturday evening, 26th December, about 7.30 I was on duty in Brockley Road, near Rokeby Road—I saw three men loitering outside 6, St. David's Terrace—the prisoner was one of them—I have no doubt whatever about that—I saw one of them come from the garden of 6, St. David's Terrace, Brockley Road—I went and knocked at the door and asked the people if anybody had knocked there—I then spoke to two females who passed, and in consequence of what they said I followed the men—when passing 40, Rokeby Road I heard a noise like the breaking of glass—I went to No. 40 and turned my bull's-eye on and saw the prisoner coming from under the doorway—the two others were standing outside—I spoke to them and said "What are you doing here?"—the tallest man said "We are not drunk, you are mistaken"—the prisoner was coming from under the doorway at the time—there was a recess—he came from the recess and came out of the gate, and was in the act of shaking hands with the men—he said "Good bye, old fellows, I will see you one day next week"—I said "Before you go I want to know what you were doing in the door<lb/>way"—the prisoner attempted to go away—I seized hold of him by the left arm—I tried to <hi rend="italic">get</hi> hold of the tall man but I lost him—the prisoner attempted to close with me and I threw him down—the landlord of No. 39 came out and we took the prisoner to the station—when I went to the house I found the glass panel of the door broken, and there were marks of an in<lb/>strument having been used near the lock, and the stop of the door was nearly broken away from the frame—they looked like the marks of a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>—I found 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., an eye-glass, and a pen-knife on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was about 100 yards from 40, Rokeby Road when I saw the three men first—the gate opens on to the road, there is about 5 or 6 yards of garden in front of the door, and there is a recess to the door—I was looking after the men when I heard the glass breaking—I lost sight of them for a few minutes in the bend of Rokeby Road, and I heard the noise as I was turning the corner—I lost sight of the whole three for about half a minute as they turned the corner, and when I saw them again two of</p>

               <p>them were outside the gate of No. 40 and the prisoner was coming from under the doorway—there was a shutter up inside the window—no one was with me—I could not swear that it was the breaking of glass that I heard, it sounded like it—the prisoner did not say he lived in the house, but he wanted to make out that he did, they all appeared to come out of the house—I saw Mr. Taylor—he was not in the house then—it was empty—the door was shut and locked inside—the other men soon <hi rend="italic">bolted</hi>—I had spoken to two women in Brockley Lane, some distance off—I don't know who they were—I asked them if they heard any remarks by the men they passed, and they said the man that came out of the garden of No. 6 said there was a light in the window—there were no other people about—the landlord of No. 39 is not here—he was at the Police Court, but he was not requited—his son went down to the station with me—I met the two women about 100 yards from No. 40—I will swear there were not two other men there besides the three, I wish there had been; I dare say I should have got assistance then—it was about 7.30 or 7.35 in the evening.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was a hand-bill offering a reward of</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">l. for the dead body of his missing wife, with a N.B. stating that no reward would be paid if she was brought home alive.</hi>) On 29th December, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came in, I was at tea with my son Thomas, a lad of 15—he came in from the Southwark Police Court and said "She (meaning my daughter) has not had it all her own way"—I said "I am glad of it"—I knew he had been to the Police Court—he said "She had a neighbour with her," and made use of bad language about the neighbour—I said "Don't make that remark, you have a bad toe yourself, and you would not like a remark of that kind made about you"—he said "My toe is very likely to be bad for twenty years"—he seemed very angry—I asked if he would have some tea—he said "I don't want none of your tea, I want to know when I am to bring back my bed"—I said "I can't say, it is my father's house now, once it was mine and yours, then I could say what I liked"—he said "I want to know whether I am to bring back my bed to-night or not"—I said "I can't tell you"—he said "Well, if you can't decide it I will"—he then went out into the yard—we keep the knives that we use in the business on a table there—he was there a very few minutes—during that time my son and I went on with our tea—the prisoner returned from the yard and shut the door, and came into the kitchen where I was sitting, and in a moment of time I received a stab in my neck—I was in the act of getting up to put some water in the teapot and had the teapot in my hand; I did not perceive for the moment that I was stabbed—my son got up and ran out—I received another stab while he was gone—I turned round and my husband came again, holding the knife over me—I saw the knife, it was one that we used for trimming the eels—my boy had only gone a very short time when be returned and threw a basin at his father—the first stab was in the side of my neck and the second was in the throat, near the same place—I am suffering from the throat now and cannot speak very loud, I think the first stab nearly stunned me—the prisoner bowed his head when my son threw the basin at him to escape it, and then he ran after the boy with the knife still in his hand—I ran into the shop and pushed by him and got out into the street</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187502010067"/>
               <p>as he was standing on the step with the knife in his hand—there were two or three persons outside the door, a policeman came across the road and I gave him in charge—I was taken to the hospital and was under treatment there a fortnight and two days—I am not well now, the wounds are a good deal better—I do not go to have them dressed now, I dress them myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was aware that my husband had been to the Southwark Police Court that day in consequence of a summons of my daughter's—when he said she had not got it all her own way I replied "I am glad of it"—I was glad of it because I wished him well, he was my husband and I did not wish that a daughter should have any control over him—I was not a party to her taking him to the Police Court, I had nothing to do with it, it was not with my consent—I meant what I said, I was glad; it was not said in a. jeering manner by way of irritating him, I said it meaningly—if I had seen any reform in him from his drunkenness I should have been willing to live with him again—I had no dread of him at that time, although he has ill-used me many years—I had forgiven him many times—we had led a very unhappy life; there had been a great many disputes between us—I had no fear of personal violence from him at this time, although I had for years past when he lived with me, I used to hide knives and many things out of his way—at the time he had these bills printed he had two pros<lb/>titutes in the house after I left the shop—I can't tell you what I supposed he meant by the bill, I suppose he did want my dead body, by the bill; I thought it was to annoy me, I thought it was a very wrong thing—I had often asked him to have a cup of tea, I could not see the father of my children come in and out without asking him such a thing—he was a very few minutes in the yard, I could not say how many—he was not in a very nice temper when he refused the cup of tea and went into the yard—I did not hear him say anything when he came in and I received the stab—im<lb/>mediately after I received the stab my son left the room and he made a stab at the boy as he left the room—I remember the boy falling, I heard the noise—I received the second stab while my son was gone, because I had time to get up and face my husband and he had the knife over me and then the boy returned—he did not strike me a third time, he was in the act of doing it when the boy returned and threw the basin, he got the basin from the shop where the basins are kept.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> My husband was aware that the house belonged to my father after the business was transferred—he has asked me several times to receive him back and I told him as I saw no reform in him I could not—I said very nearly the same words on the 29th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of the last witness and the prisoner—I am fifteen years old—I was living with my mother at 49, Snow's Fields, on the 29th December—I was at home between 4 and 5 o'clock when my father came in—he began talking about my sister, that she had not had all her own way with him and then began talking about a neighbour who went with my sister and began swearing about her—my mother said "Hold your row, Thomas, you have got a bad toe yourself, you would not like anybody to call you names"—he said "I might have a bad toe for twenty years"—he then asked mother to go upstairs—she said "No, speak to me down here, the two children will go out into the shop while you speak to me"—so I and my little sister went out into the shop and stopped two or three minutes—when I came in again he said "I am going to bring my bed in here to-night"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187502010068"/>
               <p>—she said "No, you must not"—he said "I will if I get thrown out of the top-room window"—mother then said something to him, I can't recollect what it was, and he said "I did not say I would bring my bed in"—afterwards he said "When shall I come home?"—she said "I can't decide, Thomas, it is not my house, it is father's house"—on her saying she could not decide, she would have to ask grandfather first, he said he would decide and he went out into the yard, we kept our knives there on a table—while he was in the yard my mother and I went on with our tea—the kitchen looks into the yard—I did not hear anything in the yard—he came out of the yard and shut the door after him and stood beside the door, and I heard like knives tingling against each other, as if he was sharpening a knife on a steel or something; I heard that seven or eight times—he stood inside the kitchen all the time—I asked mother to give me some more tea, and as she was getting up to put some more water in the teapot and turned halfway round my father took two steps towards her and stabbed her with a knife, at least I don't know what it was—mother called out "Don't Thomas, you have stabbed me, look at the blood"—I went to run to him and he held his hand up as if to make" a stab at me, I nearly fell down and ran out of the shop into a neighbour's house—I could not see what was in his hand, I saw a blade or something glitter, but could not say what it was—I returned with a friend, I saw my father with the knife up in his hand, I could not see where my mother was—I took a basin off the counter and aimed it at him, he bobbed down and came to run out after me—the young man I brought in with me took me by the back and pushed me out of the shop and I ran away—I did not hear him say anything during all this time—I have seen him ill-treat my mother on other occasions—a fortnight before this he came in drunk and was going to knock her about with a poker and he threatened to knock her brains out—I don't remember any other occasion shortly before this, but all last summer there were several occasions—after I was pushed out of the shop by my friend I stepped across the road—I saw my mother out in the street and saw her speaking to a policeman—my father was in the shop at that time—I saw him go away with the policeman and my mother taken to the hospital.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were frequent disagreements between my father and mother—when he threatened my mother with the poker he went to make a strike at her, but I got hold of it—there was a good deal of bad language used occasionally, not on both sides—on this evening my father used some foul language—he became angry when my mother said he could not come there that evening—she said he had got a bad toe of his own—she did not say that in a provoking tone, she said it very quietly—he has got a bad toe, he has had the gout—he had spoken about the woman my sister went with as a fat woman with the small-pox, and it was then that my mother said "You have got a bad toe yourself"—that did not seem to aggravate him—I saw him when he was in the yard at the table—I did not hear or see any knives until he came back into the kitchen, I then heard what I thought was the sharpening of knives; I did not see any knives, he had his hands behind him and there was a steel behind him—it might be a minute or two from the time he came in from the yard till my mother called out.</p>

                  </hi>, I live at 41, Grove Road, Denmark Hill—I am a surgeon—on 29th December I was house-surgeon at Guy's Hospital—I was called by the dresser to see Mrs. Lucas, I found she had two wounds, one on the side of the neck the other more behind—the one nearest the front. was an incised and punctured wound, that is the tissues had been cut at the: same time they had been pierced by an instrument—it was about an inch long—it was a dangerous wound under certain circumstances, and in a dangerous part—the force required to cause such a wound would not be considerable, still it required a certain amount of force—it would depend in a great measure on the sharpness of the instrument used—the second wound was cleanly cut—a sharp pointed knife would be very likely to have caused the wound in front, the other wound might be caused by any knife, without a sharp point—if the instrument had gone perpendicularly down it would have gone through the large blood-vessels of the neck instead of going beneath the skin only—a small artery was divided—she was under my treat<lb/>ment till the end of my house-surgeoncy, that was to the end of the year; it was then taken up by my successor—I saw her afterwards at the Police Court and examined her—the scars of the wounds were remaining on her neck, they were not completely healed, a process of healing was taking place called scab<lb/>bing—there will be a loss of sensation over a part of the neck.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> If the carotid artery had been divided it would have been very dangerous—these wounds were not dangerous under proper treatment, as she had at the hospital—the wound dipped for about an inch beneath the skin—I did regard it as a dangerous wound, because the artery that was cut was at the bottom of the puncture and there was a very great difficulty in finding it, until we found it there was danger from bleeding; when we found it and stopped it the danger ceased; we <hi rend="italic">torsed</hi> it, twisted it with peculiar forceps.</p>
