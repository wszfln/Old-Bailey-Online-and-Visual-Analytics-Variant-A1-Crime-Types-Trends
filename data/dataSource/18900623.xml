I am manager of the Harrogate branch of the Bradford Bank, Limited—William Dove was a customer of ours, but no funds were standing to his credit on December 11th—I have a copy of his account here, but it is not the prisoner's account—it was paid off in January by Mr. Wm. Dove's guarantor—we allow overdrafts if the bank have a guarantee—on December 5th I received a letter from Mr. Wm. Dove's solicitor about his account, in consequence of which the bank was unable to honour any further cheques on Mr. Dove's account—a cheque, of Mr. Wm. Dove, for £5 had been returned on 18th November, and one for £2 2s. 6d. on 21st November, and on 80th November one</p>

I am a broker, and live at Shepherd's Bush—on this afternoon I was going along Acton Lane towards the Green—I heard a noise of carts behind, and looked round and saw two vans coming in the direction of Acton Green—they passed me, and shortly after I heard a similar noise, and saw the little girl standing in the middle of the road and the van about five yards off—the child was knocked down by the near side of the horse, and the two near side wheels went over her—there was a distance of sixty or seventy yards between the second van and this one—it was going at a rapid pace—I shouted out—I did not hear the driver shout—I ran after him, and said, Hallo! Stop! You have run over a child"—he stopped in about sixty yards, and said, "What child?"—he got down, and I sent for a policeman and a doctor.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 479, East India Road, and keep a fruiterer's shop—I have known the prisoner since last summer—I have occasionally bought German lottery tickets from him—I had bought one just shortly before 27th April, for which I was to pay a guinea a month for thirty-six months, I believe—I suppose the lottery was to be drawn after it was over; I never knew when—on Sunday, 27th April, the prisoner called and said, "I have got some very good news for you"—he opened a newspaper, and spread it out as if he were going to read something, and then he said he wanted to see my cheque-book; he did not say what for—I suppose he knew I had one, by having seen it when I was locking up the lottery tickets in my box—the box contained my cheque-book—I had money in the London Commercial Bank, which had failed—he said nothing on that day about that bank or the West London Bank—he said if I gave it into his hands to get it he would get it all for me—I did not ask what he wanted to see my cheque-book for, but I unlocked the box, and gave it him—it was on the London and South-Western Bank, Earl's Court branch—I had obtained the cheque-book, which contained twenty-five cheques to bearer, in May, 1889; I had only drawn one out of it—I am positive there was only that one cheque out of it when I showed it to the prisoner—when he had it I had to keep leaving him and going away to serve customers in the front of the shop—it is an open shop—he must have been in my room about a quarter of an hour, I going backwards and forwards in the meantime—he returned the cheque-book to me, and I locked it up without looking at it—it had been in no hands but mine and the prisoner's—I had never shown it to anyone else—when he left he was in his usual health; he seemed quite well—on the following day, 28th, I got a letter from my bank, in consequence of</p>

               <p>which I looked at the cheque-book, and found a cheque form was gone; the counterfoil was left in the book; there is nothing on the counterfoil—I. went and saw the bank manager next day, and got certain information from him—on 30th April the prisoner came and asked for Moritz Hertz, a jeweller, who rents the front part of the shop—the prisoner knew him; I have seen them talking together—as soon as he was in the shop I asked a lady, who was buying vegetables, to mind the shop (the prisoner heard me), and I went for a constable, and gave him into custody—I said, "I shall give you in charge for stealing a cheque out of my cheque-book on Sunday morning last"—he said nothing—I never drew a cheque for £32 18s. in favour of Hertz; I authorised no one to do it—Hertz never had my cheque-book; J don't think he knows I have one; he never saw it to my knowledge; there is no internal communication between Hertz's shop and mine.</p>

Wontner and Sons, solicitors, here proved having served on the prisoner', on 19th May, a notice to produce the cheque</hi>)—the cheque was dated 25th April, 1890, for £32 18s., and purported to be drawn by Elizabeth Baker, payable to Mr. Hertz—it was endorsed "Hertz"—I compared the cheque with the signature-book—I had doubts, and showed it to my manager, Mr. Lee—I then took it back to the prisoner—Mr. Lee asked him from whom he had received the cheque; he said, "From Mrs. Baker"—Mr. Lee asked him to describe Mrs. Baker; he said she was a small woman, very stout—I marked the cheque, "Signature differs"—I believe Mr. Lee looked at the number of the cheque—I believe Mrs. Baker had a cheque-book delivered to her in May last year—by an error the date it was sent was not entered in our book—we have a record of the numbers of the cheques sent to her—up to 28th April only one cheque had come to us from that book, and that was drawn on 2nd July, and was No. A 000651; it was the first cheque out of the book—the last was 000675.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the Earl's Court branch of the London and South-Western Bank—on Monday, 28th April, this cheque for £32 18s. was brought to me by Mr. Monaghan—I compared it with the signature-book, and saw it differed from Mrs. Baker's signature, and I went with Mr. Monaghan to the counter, where I found the prisoner—I said, "From whom did you receive this cheque?"—he said, "From Mr. Hertz"—he went on to say Mrs. Baker was a greengrocer, and kept a shop in the East India Dock Road, and that Hertz was her lodger—I asked how he became possessed of the cheque, and there was more conversation, which I do not recollect—the cheque was numbered A 000652, and was the second in the book issued to Mrs. Baker—the first cheque number A 000651 had been presented in July last.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am not sure if the prisoner mentioned receiving the cheque from Mrs. Baker or from Mr. Hertz; he said Mrs. Baker gave it to Hertz—I said at the Court below he received it from Hertz; I think he said he received it from Mrs. Baker—I don't recollect which it was—this was half-past eleven or a quarter to one—I know that because one clerk goes out at half-past eleven, and another at a quarter to one—I have a note of the date on which the cheque-book was given out.</p>

On 30th April Mrs. Baker called me to her shop, where I saw the prisoner—by her directions I took him into custody—she said she wished to charge him with stealing a cheque out of her book on the previous Sunday, the 27th, filling it up, taking it to the bank at Kensington, and trying to cash it—he made no answer, and I asked him if he understood what she said—he said, "Yes; all right"—at the station he was placed among a number of others on the same day, and Mr. Lee picked him out and said, "That is the man that came into the bank"—when the charge was read at the station the prisoner said, "I know nothing about the cheque'—Mr. Monaghan was not brought to identify him.</p>

I have been in the employment of the Great Western Railway Company for nineteen years—I have pleaded guilty—I plead guilty to picking the things up, not knowing them to be stolen—Keeley was out of employment; I heard he had done nothing for some weeks, and about seven o'clock on the 28th I asked him to come out for a walk—he came to see me about seven o'clock, and I brought down a bag with these things, and asked him to help me carry them—we walked as far as Roscoe Street; I had the bag—he asked me what I had in the bag—I said, "Some old things, and if</p>

               <p>"March 27th, 1890.—To my own precious darling, pretty one. It is with the fondest possible feeling towards you that I write these words to you, to tell you how madly, passionately, and jealously I love you. I feel, <hi rend="italic">Flo</hi>, that in having your love I have everything to make me happy, but when I offend you, and you are so distant towards me, I feel most wretched, and to lose your love, dolly, would be to break my heart; in fact, without you I feel that I cannot exist. Now, I will go further, and tell you that I will not, and neither shall you. I admit it, my darling, situated as you are, and having had so much trouble, that I am greatly to blame, as I should give way to you more than I do; in future I will endeavour to do so, and by that means give you more happiness. Florence, there is another thing that makes me feel you are so much to me, and it is hardly necessary to remind you what it is; but I am afraid you do not think so much of that as I do. To me it seems all and everything—you should—a love and tie which should be hard to break. I will never, never break that tie through being false to you; it is impossible, I could not. I want you, when you have read this expression of my feelings about you, to seriously think of our relations, and try with me in future to avoid quarrels, and I am sure we shall both be rewarded by more happiness and trust in each other. <hi rend="italic">Flo</hi>, it cut me to the heart to-day when you told me you could treat me different to the way you have in the past. Do not let this thought get into your heart; but if you do treat me differently, let it be on the right side, and that you will never regret. My darling, my pet, I daresay you will think it very funny for me to write all this, but as I have never told you so in black and white I feel I should do so, and as time goes on you shall prove by my actions that the contents are true. Do not put this aside with a thought that it is mere rubbish, but think and think, and you will be able to come to only one conclusion, and that is, that no woman was loved by any man in the world more than you are by me; and in return for that love I ask you for yours, and with that I shall always be true as steel—<hi rend="italic">Flo.</hi> I must now finish this statement, and I ask you to believe me to be your own true and fond loving Tom. From R. Harding, 20, Haverstock Hill. "I suppose R. Harding is the prisoner's father—the prisoner told me he wasinbusiness as a builder at that address.</p>

               <p>district of the Maldon Union—in that capacity and in my private practice I have had to consider questions of mental disease, and to give certificates of lunacy as to persons under my charge—in January, 1887, I succeeded to the practice of Dr. Pearce—later in 1887, and also in 1888, I was frequently consulted by the prisoner for a continuation of that disease, and for more nervous disorders in 1888—the disease was in its secondary stage—he was very nervous for the first three months of 1888—he would come with some trifling little pimple, and want to know if that was not his malady coming back again, and when I told him it was nothing of the sort, he would dwell upon it, and insist upon it that it must be—then he had pains in his head, and restlessness, and sleeplessness—they were undoubtedly <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> statements—I thought he was the most out-of-the-way curious tradesman I had ever met, because it was impossible to get him to pay attention when you wanted him to do anything; he came to my house to take orders for certain decorations, and instead of taking them he would talk about nothing but himself; at last one would apparently drive it into him, and a week afterwards you would meet him, and he had forgotten all about it—he would come again, and go over the same thing, and I had to take an extraordinary amount of trouble to get anything done; whenever he saw me be would talk about himself instead of my business—he had not a retentive memory, quite the reverse; he was most decidedly not a man of well-balanced mind; I should describe him as a most excitable, easily-upset man, a man who would greatly exaggerate any little ailment—I may give an instance: one of his children had an accident, and his state of distress was very pitiable; he would not be satisfied that the child was doing perfectly well, he would come worrying me three or four times about it, and was obviously distressed—where there is a latent hereditary mental taint, I have known marked cases of syphilis develop it—I have attended the prisoner's younger brother Richard; he is also very excitable, very wanting in self-control.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I would not say he was violent-tempered; he was 28 in January, 1888—I left the neighbourhood at the end of 1888—syphilis is a terrible disease in its results, especially to a married man, but the advice I gave the prisoner was not to be anxious about the pimple, I told him it would go away in due course, but not rapidly—I told him it had nothing to do with the malady—if a person is worried in business, sleeplessness often follows, and the nervous system becomes affected, pains in the head and such symptoms are common in many maladies.</p>

I live at 8, Orchard Road, Highgate, and am a commercial traveller—I have known the prisoner fifteen or eighteen months—I met him often, and have asked him what was the matter; his appearance struck me as extraordinary—on the 19th May, two days before this occurrence, he accused me of a breach of contract in not taking a house of him, which I had promised to do, but owing to circumstances I had declined it—I endeavoured to explain the reason to him, but he appeared to take no heed to what I was saying, and he suddenly said, "I posted the letter myself"—I said, "I have had no letter"—he continued talking in aloud tone, and suddenly seized me by the collar and said, "If you did not show me that letter, who did?"—I flung him off, and said, "I don't know what you mean"—he looked at me in a curious manner, and said, "I was not talking to you, I thought I was talking to somebody else"—I was astonished when I heard of the murder—I saw the report in the paper, and I sat down and wrote to Mr. Harding, sen., at twelve o'clock that night, and in that way the defendant's solicitor came to see me, and took my evidence—the prisoner was talking as if there was a third person present—I had no knowledge of his affairs, and the conversation did not relate to anything I knew of—his conduct attracted the attention of passers-by, and people stopped and watched us—he asked me to come to the corner; having</p>

I am a retired tradesman, and live at 42, Adelaide Road—I have known the prisoner between three and four years-his manner is generally very excitable, that was my impression from the first time I had business transactions with him—the first remarkable thing that attracted my attention was that he was always being taken for a detective; he told me so—about twelve months ago I had a tenant who left, shutting up the house and taking the key with him; I appointed the' prisoner to meet me there, to pick the lock—he said, "I will show you how to get into the house," and he went into the forecourt, and dashed his fist through the window of the breakfast parlour, and cut his hand severely, then he drew the catch back, threw up the window, and ultimately let me in, and said, "You will have to pay for this"—on another occasion, some few months afterwards, I was having some repairs done to the roof of a house in Manchester Square, and he said, "Would you like to go up and see what they are doing to the roof?"—I said, "No"—he said, "I will show you how to do it"—there was a ladder there, reaching from the ground to the roof, about forty feet, and he ran up the ladder, and sat on the parapet, swinging his legs for two or three minutes, and then came down again, and said, "It's all right; won't you come up and have a look?"—I said, "Certainly not"—on the Monday before the 21st May he came to my house, which he was decorating; the next door was empty, and he said, "I want to go next door, and take the blossom off those trees, or they will only rot;" he jumped to the top of a small fowl-house, and went through it—I said, "For goodness sake, take care what you are doing!"—he said, "I am only seventeen stone"—he asked me for a knife; I lent him my small pocket-knife, and he said, "I am going to cut off some of these, and take them home to my dad"—instead of cutting off the blossoms, he pulled them off recklessly, and never used the knife at all—my wife was there, and she shouted out, "If Mr. Harding is not a madman I never saw one before"; he was. acting like a madman.</p>

               <p>the whole of the evidence—I have also had the opportunity of seeing the prisoner in the prison; I have come to the opinion that he was of unsound mind at the time of his commission of this deed—I have heard the evidence as to the taint in his family on both sides—it accords with my experience and knowledge that diseases of the brain show themselves in the family pedigree intermittently—in some cases something has occurred to develop it in a particular person, which has not applied to other members of the family—I think that in a person with that hereditary taint syphilis is more likely to affect the brain than in a person not so predisposed; my experience justifies that opinion—the grounds upon which I formed my judgment as to the prisoner's mental condition are the pains in the head which he complained of to me, and which have been mentioned by various witnesses, and his forgetfulness; he told me that he remembered nothing at all of the occurrence; that he knew of nothing till he found himself in or near the Regent's Park; the various acts which I have heard related have also caused me to come to the same opinion—when I saw him there was a considerable tremor about the eyelids, and the pupils of the eyes reacted very sluggishly to light—it is in accordance with my experience that men mentally afflicted are still able to transact business and conduct business affairs to a certain extent, it depends on the amount of mental unsoundness, and the extent of the business, unless there are particular delusions which interfere with the business—taking all the circumstances into consideration, I have a strong opinion, such as I have expressed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was with the prisoner about half an hour hero in Newgate—there was nothing irrational in what he said—I did not discover any delusion; I did not expect to find it—I questioned him as to the circumstances of the death of this woman—he told me he remembered nothing at all of the occurrence; that his mind was a blank as to it—he said he remembered going to the Victory that morning, but he remembered nothing more till he found himself in the Regent's Park—he said that he had been to Albany Street Station; that was after ho found himself in the Regent's Park—I had seen the evidence given before the Magistrate, and the statement he made, that he had shot the woman, and that it was an accident—I don't remember that I questioned him about that—I don't know that we went into that matter—I do not remember whether we asked him about it or not; I was accompanied by Dr. Savage—I assume that ho knew he had shot somebody, but he did not remember the occurrence—I asked him how he came to go to the station, so far from his own home—he said he knew the station, because he had been in the habit of going there before—I did not question him as to the reason why he had made the statement that it was an accident—I don't know that I should say that his making such a statement was strong evidence of an acute mind and of a sane man—I don't know that there would be any evidence in that to show insanity or sanity; I don't think I went into that question with him—it would not make me think him insane—I don't think it would have any effect one way or the other, because insane people often give themselves up afterwards, and make statements to exonerate themselves; that is a thing which insane people do every day, when they have committed an act they try to excuse themselves in some way or other, which is not true—I should not consider that evidence one way or the other; ho talked coherently to me,</p>

               <p>whilst I was with him; he replied slowly and cautiously to the questions I put to him—I asked him about the occurrence, which he said he knew nothing about—he expressed no regret for what he had done—he must have known that we were doctors—Dr. Savage and Dr. Gilbert were with me—I think we said something about his taking too much drink at times; he did not say that he drank heavily—I don't think he said that he was frequently in the habit of taking more than was good for him—I think he said he had had some whisky that morning at the Victory—he did not say he was in the habit of taking too much liquor; we talked to him about what he drank, and he said what he drank was beer; I found that he had been sleeping and eating well while in prison—it is frequently the case that a man being placed under control in an asylum or prison is very much improved in his mental condition by the quiet and restraint—beyond complaining of his head, I do not think he made any complaint of physical inconvenience—there was no tenderness of the spinal cord, or anything of that kind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I agree in the opinion "that insanity does not destroy the reactive powers, but occasionally suspends them"—it is common experience that persons admittedly suffering from dementia are cunning, and invent excuses; that agrees with my own experience—he told me his mind was a blank until he found himself in the Regent's Park; he did not give me to understand that he could or could not since then recall what had occurred at the Victory—this is not a case of delusion in the ordinary sense of the word; this might be called a case of insane impulse more than anything else, impulse beyond his control—the fact of his sleeping well does not in any way affect my judgment as to his mental condition—I am familiar with cases in which an insane man, after committing an act, recovers the balance of reason some time after; very often the act itself acts in such a way as to clear the mind, it gives a shook to the whole system—tracing the course of the spine is not in the least a test I think—I looked at the whole aspect of the man—I thought he would very likely become a paralytic by the action of the disease in his brain; in my opinion that was largely developed by the syphilitic taint in the system.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. The general history of the case made me think he might become paralytic, the pains in the head and the condition of the eyes—if the act itself clears the mind, he does not necessarily go back on the particular subject, at all events not for a time; if he does not go back he might not be conscious of the act itself; if he was informed of it afterwards he would probably remember it; if he got sufficiently conscious to remember it, he might or might not forget it again, according to the condition of the brain; if he did not go back he would remember from what he was told—my opinion was founded on the history of the syphilis and the alteration in his manner, that was what I was told; the pains in the head he told me of himself; I thought that was a grave symptom in connection with the constitutional syphilis; he told me himself that he had syphilis—supposing he did know about the act, but would not tell me, I don't think that would alter my opinion, because lunatics can tell untruths as well as anybody else—that was a very small part of what went to make up my mind, I did not look upon that statement as necessarily genuine.</p>

               <p>of Bethlehem Hospital, and lecturer on insanity at Guy's, and I have written a standard book on the subject—I have also written especially of the connection between brain disease and the action of syphilis on the brain—I have been in Court and heard the evidence in this case; I have also visited the prisoner in Newgate in company with Dr. Gilbert and Dr. Blandford—I have formed an opinion on the case founded on all those materials—my opinion is that the prisoner is of a nervous stock, that, having suffered from constitutional syphilis, he is still more likely to be nervously unstable; that the evidence of his having lost memory, and that he is excitable and impulsive, is consistent with the history given; the interview led me to think that he is dull, and to a certain extent stupid; it was with great difficulty that we could get any answers from him, though he appeared willing to answer what we asked—we examined him as to the occurrence, when he at once said he could not recollect what happened between going into the Victory and finding himself at Albany Street Police-station—physically, one noticed the tremulousness of the tongue and of the muscles about his face, and the sluggishness of the pupil; those are common symptoms in brain syphilis, so that altogether I came to the conclusion that he was probably suffering from degeneration of the brain, depending upon bad nervous inheritance and syphilis, nervous inheritance being in the family, in which there was this hereditary taint—he would be extremely liable to be easily affected either by emotion or alcohol—the appearance of hereditary mental disease is intermittent in the double sense, that some members of a family will escape, and also that it is not perpetually recurring in the same person; that agrees with my experience—this is not a case of delusions—it is in accordance with my experience that persons like this show sometimes a great amount of cunning—the presence of pain along the lumbar region might be due to physical causes which did not affect the brain; it would be no certain indication one way or the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> One would take one course or the other; I adopted the more recent method of tapping the knee, but he was too stupid to enable me to effect the test properly—I went with the idea that possibly his stupidity might be intentional, but I was rather impressed that he was more than that—I don't think it would account for the matter—there was no indication of any kind of delusion in him—he would be perfectly able to understand the nature and character of firing at a woman and killing her, so far as any delusion is concerned—I should say his going, within a few minutes, to the station and stating he had fired at the woman, and that it was accidental, might be a sign of sanity, and might not—I could not suggest anything more indicative of sanity, but any one symptom apart would not operate on a judgment" that is formed of many parts—I made yesterday a very full and careful examination of the prisoner at Newgate with Dr. Blandford and Dr. Gilbert, and discussed a long list of things, that led me to think he was insane. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you find anything indicative of his being a sane man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If he were insane I don't see how I can answer that; I should be very willing if I could; mere ability to answer questions may be a sane thing—I should say his sleeping well and eating well in prison was evidence of progressive mental nervousness, dementia—ordinary natural sleep and regular meals would be compatible with progressive brain wasting, such as one suggests, possibly—sound sleep</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189006230055"/>
               <p>under such a charge as this would make me think it was rather more an unnatural thing than the reverse—we spoke to him as to the circumstance we had read in the evidence given before the Magistrate, his firing twice, and then at himself—he said, "I don't remember really what did take place," and therefore any further questions were almost stopped—I don't think we asked about his statement that he had fired the pistol accidentally, and that was why he tried to take away his own life—we conducted our examination independently; Dr. Blandford put his questions, and I mine without consultation with Dr. Blandford.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> People without brain power are often among those who eat and sleep best—his showing no nervous disturbance, indicated by sleeplessness and loss of appetite, would indicate that he was deficient—I think it is likely there is paralysis in the incipient stage; there are no symptoms of it now, but, speaking prophetically, there will be—with syphiletic brain disease headache is almost always present; it is a known symptom of it—being an authority on these questions, and considering it, I see no reason to modify the opinion I have expressed as to the man's mental condition.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. I think the prisoner did not know what he was doing at the time he was doing the act—that is assuming he does not remember—I think as in nearly all these cases of progressive weak mindedness there are outbursts of uncontrollable excitement, so that slight emotional and other causes will produce in weakminded people excitement out of all relation to the outward cause—a weakminded man with very slight cause for emotional disturbance might become suddenly passionate and beyond his own control; not that he would not know what he was doing, but that he could not control himself, then he would do something beyond any previous intention formed in his own mind—I do not connect it with anything anterior—it would alter my opinion if there were proved to be a preconceived idea—a man may have an idea which he does control for some time, and then from the effect of physical weakness or alcohol or other cause, the idea may become all-powerful, and a man who is used to carry firearms would be likely to use them, just as another man would be likely to use a razor; it is the passion of the moment—I should not have the same opinion to the same extent if it were the carrying out of a preconceived idea—in syphilis there is first the acute disease, which after a time possibly is cured (some say it is never cured), then there is the secondary or more constitutional symptoms, and in many cases these only show themselves under certain conditions; in many men predisposed to nervous disease by inheritance and disease and drink syphilis might reappear, though apparently cured for twenty years—as to the hereditary taint, one has seen marked recurrence in great-grandchildren; grandchildren frequently—there was nothing up to Stephen Brazier, four generations back—it is the grandson of the great, great-grandfather; but if you have one fairly strong taint on one side, and ever so slight a taint on the other, it becomes accentuated out of all proportion.</p>

               <p>him a morose and sullen man; there was not much to be elicited from him, but the questions he answered he answered coherently—he said he had been living rather a fast life—I asked him whether he was in the habit of taking alcoholic drinks, and he said, "No, very, sparingly," but he admitted that he occasionally had a glass of whisky—I don't think he said what effect it produced on him—from my whole conversation with him I did not discover any indication of his being of unsound mind; I thought he was of sound mind—I examined his eyes and spinal cord, but found no indications—I tapped down the spine from top to bottom, and asked him if it gave him any pain, and he said, "No; not the least"—I thumped him rather hard with my fist; there was no violence about it—his pupils were quite natural, sensitive to light—he presented no symptoms to me of general paralysis; I saw no symptoms threatening paralysis—I asked him if he recollected what had occurred on 21st May, and to give me some account of it, if he did it—he said he had very little recollection of it, but it must be true because it had been sworn against him—that was all I could get from him—I repeated the question at my second visit in the same way, and had the same answer—he was evidently dull and stupid, and unwilling to communicate—I did not tell him who I was before I spoke to him.</p>

               <p>of the act and a desire to avoid discovery—that is not inconsistent, and my reading and experience corroborate it—in forming my judgment on the whole of the circumstances and history of the case, the family history, if there were hereditary taint, would be a factor unquestionably to be taken into account—assuming hereditary taint to exist, it is consistent with my views and experience that the presence of syphilitic disease might develop that latent mental weakness; it is a recognised mode.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, at Ilford Road, Drayton Park—at the end of December, 1885, the prisoner called on me, and said he was an agent, and that he had seen a house, 14, Corinne Road, Tufnell Park, and that he wished to introduce a lady of independent means, Mrs. Turton, to take it—he said he should want the usual commission of five per cent, on the first year's rent—I said if he got me a good tenant I was willing to pay it—he introduced Mrs. Turton, who gave two satisfactory references—I paid him thirty-five shillings, I believe as far as I remember he said Mrs. Turton was residing at Bromley, Kent, but was staying at the time with a friend in Camden Square; he mentioned the house, I think it was No. 1—before Mrs. Turton moved in I went and knocked at the door of the house there, but could get no reply, and I inquired in the neighbourhood, and got information, in consequence of which I fastened my house up to prevent anyone getting in—a few days afterwards the prisoner came to me, and said Mrs. Turton had her things packed up to move, and unless I</p>

               <p>gave immediate possession he threatened me with legal proceedings—at that time he had an agreement from me, and the street door key—I understood from him that Mrs. Turton was a widow—on one occasion he brought a Bluecoat schoolboy, and said he washer son—I let him have possession—when the first rent became due I tried to get it; I did not succeed—I got no rent from Mrs. Turton—I believe she lived in the house, and that the prisoner lived with her—I saw her there once—I never saw the prisoner there—I think the last time I saw him was when he came to me and threatened proceedings—I lost a quarter's rent—the mortgagee took possession—the property was damaged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I cannot recollect the names of the references; one was described as a solicitor—I don't recollect that the prisoner told me they were Mrs. Turton's trustees—I said I would call on the references; I called at the addresses; one was a solicitor in Coleman or Fore Street; he told me he had known Mrs. Turton some time before, but that he knew very little of her—the address of the reference was genuine—the other was a commercial office in Tower Street, if I remember rightly, and they knew the name Turton as that of a clerk who had been there some time previously—I heard nothing to his discredit; I had no opportunity of further inquiry—it was after that I let them go into possession—those premises and other of my houses were mortgaged at the time; Miss Lilian Crossman, at Huddersfield, I think, was mortgagee—I was not at all in arrears with my mortgage-money; I only owed the Christmas quarter—I never heard from Mrs. Turton that she had received a printed notice from Miss Crossman's solicitor directing her to pay no rent to me, but to pay it to her solicitors—she received a notice in due course, because the mortgage was called in, not on account of arrears, but it was some family matter perhaps—Mrs. Turton should have paid the March rent to me—I don't know when she received the notice, or whether the solicitor applied for that' quarter's rent—I did not hear that—before she left the premises, or while she was there, the mortgagee took possession—Mrs. Turton was not my tenant when she left—the mortgagee came to me on several occasions, and said they could get nothing—I demanded nothing from them in respect of that quarter's rent—I did not hear Miss Crossman had made an offer to Mrs. Turton to put her into another house; I heard nothing of the relations between them—Mrs. Turton was in the house six or nine months after the mortgagee took possession, I should think—I took no interest in the premises after that—I was never inside the house—I know nothing of Mrs. Turton's means or position.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> As far as I know, Mrs. Turton paid no rent to anybody—I gave up possession because I could not find money enough to pay the mortgage when the prisoner came and threatened legal proceedings.</p>

Kemp, house agents, Albany Street—I learned that Mr. George Garland required the house—he was described as an artist, of 41, Tollington Road, Holloway—he referred to Mr. Smith, of Caledonian Road—the rent was £63 a year—</p>

               <p>the agreement was signed "George Garland"—he took possession on 24th June, 1889—the first quarter's rent was due on 29th September, and I went there, but could not find him—the house was full of prostitutes—the prisoner came down the yard to me as Mr. Garland—I saw a middle-aged woman there, whom I know as Mrs. Suter—I have seen her with the prisoner at the house, but they had no furniture, and did not live there—a man who gave his name as Roberts was in the kitchen; he described himself as a builder—I asked for Mr. Garland's address, and a person named Frazer, who has been sentenced, gave it me; in the Hampstead Road—I sent my foreman there, who came back and said there was no such person known there—I received this letter from Garland from 30, Lily Bridge Road, and went there half an hour afterwards, and found it was a tobacconist's shop—Garland kept possession till about the middle of the second quarter—he owed half a year's rent; I got none, and the house was damaged—I next saw Garland at Marylebone Police-court, when he was charged as Denning—I recognise the prisoner, but he has grown whiskers since, which makes a little alteration—I saw Mrs. Turton at the door with her crutch.</p>

On 19th May, about 3.40 p.m., I was in Cree Church Lane, and saw the prisoner, who was dressed in dark clothes, and another man, run through the lane towards Leadenhall Street—after they passed, I heard a cry of "Stop him," but they had got out of sight—on 29th May I picked the prisoner out at Bow Street from six or seven others.</p>

I am cook to Ann Pidwell, of 52, Addison Road, Kensington—on Saturday night, June 14th, I locked all the windows except one on the ground floor, which was protected by iron bare, and went to bed at 9.50—about twelve o'clock I heard something fall downstairs outside the area which sounded like a flower-pot—I went out on the landing and listened—I heard no more, and got so cold that I went back to bed, but did not go to sleep, and about three o'clock I heard picking going on in the dining-room—I stood on the landing, and then sat on my bed and heard a bedroom door opening—that was about four o'clock—I went out on the landing, stood there a few minutes, and heard another door open, and the cat came up to me, and I knew there was a man in the house then—I banged my door, locked it, threw up the window, and clapped my hands and called "Police!"—the police came in ten minutes, and I saw the prisoner go up the garden—he threw a dark blue skirt in a corner of the garden, jumped over the wall, and I saw no more of him for ten minutes, when he was brought to the front—this is the skirt—these other articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were in my mistress's house—this writing-desk had been moved from a back shelf in the dining-room, and put in the front of the window and forced open—a smaller desk was safe when I went to bed—this case, with a fish knife and fork, was in the dining-room—the constable knocked, and I went down, and found the doors had all been unfastened—this iron bar had been wrenched from the window and left in the area—the value of the things is £7, and three single shillings and</p>

I was a fireman on board the ss. <hi rend="italic">MacGarel</hi>, which sailed from London to Belize, Central America, and then came to Norfolk for provisions and coals, and then started for London—the prisoner was also a fireman on board—we took it in turns to be fireman and trimmer—I was fireman from Belize to Norfolk, and trimmer from Norfolk—at 8.30 p.m. on 29th May we were on the high seas—I and the prisoner were in the stoke-hole—the prisoner had had a little drop to drink—he told me I should see that the fires wanted slicing, and when he looked at the fires he found they were all burnt to the bars, and he said he would have vengeance upon me—I had not spoken about the fires—I said, "What do you want vengeance on me for?"—he said, "You will know pretty well"—I got off my seat, and attempted to get out, and he let the fire-shovel fly, and cut me on the temple and the back of the ear—the shovel weighs about 13 or 14 lb., I dare say—I looked at him again, wondering what I should do, and he lifted the shovel to attempt to strike me again, and I went to the captain, who strapped up my head—about half an hour after, when the skipper told me to go forward and rest, and I was lying in my bunk, the prisoner threw an iron kettle at me, and said he would hang for me—he was about six feet off—the boatswain, who was there, caught the kettle—I crawled out, and told the skipper what he had done—I was not hurt by the kettle—the <hi rend="italic">MacGarel</hi>, which is a British ship, arrived in England last Monday week—I was at the Police-station the day after—</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant divisional surgeon to the H Division—on 18th June I examined the prosecutor, and found he had a lacerated wound on his left temple, about two inches long, extending downwards and forwards; I did not try the depth—there was slight oozing from it; it had taken place nearly three weeks before—it was a serious wound at the time it was inflicted—a sharp fire shovel would be such an instrument as would cause the injury I found—I put a compress on it, and bandaged him again—he is going on all right now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The wound had somewhat the appearance of not being properly attended to—although it might have been caused by a shovel it could have been caused by falling against any sharp substance, such as the corner of an anvil—it is nearly healed now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Deputy-Inspector of Stamps at Somerset House—I have the actual dies here from which these two transfer forms marked A and C (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were impressed; we have two £10 dies, and these impressions represent them, one is marked B and the other E—there are also £10 dies at Manchester, Edinburgh, and Dublin, they are distinguishable from the London dies—the dates of the dies are moveable, and altered to indicate the day, the month, and the year.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The printed matter on these two documents is not printed at Somerset House, but at the Stationery Office—the stamps are impressed after the printing—the paper is counted before it is given out to the stamper, and after it is stamped—I cannot tell whether we have missed any paper—through the day, when the dies are in use, a great many persons have the custody of them; there are some eighty stampers at different times, among whom two £10 dies would be worked, but the ordinary number of persons responsible would be four; I am not one of them—the third class superintendent is responsible for collecting the various impressions, and handing then in the stock—he was not called at the Police-court; the responsible person was called on the part of the prosecution—there are two third-class superintendents in the room, exercising a strict supervision—there is a general overseer, he was not called at the Police-court—the dies which are not in use are only locked up at night; they are kept in boxes in the daytime open; a great many persons have keys to the boxes—the dies which can make a piece of paper worth £10 are left with the stampers; there are ten or twelve stampers there—no one in the stamping department has been suspended.</p>

               <p>the documents which have been stamped, but I should see them lying about—both the third-class superintendents are in the room, very near to the presses—on some days we stamp, and on other days a great many are required, but we are very busy all day—other stamps besides £10 ones are produced in that room, the £10 stamp would not be in constant use—I keep no record—one of the superintendents alters the dates of the stamps—it is next to impossible that a stamp of yesterday's date would be issued to-day, as the date stamps are kept regularly in wooden receptacles, with holes perforated in them; about 200 of them—they are arranged in cupboards in the store-room, and the receptacle of the day is brought out every morning; the change is made very deliberately, and it is quite inconceivable that a mistake should be made—on one occasion a mistake did occur, some years ago, when an addition had been made to the number of the plugs, some new ones having been made, and, being similar to each other when reversed, a wrong one was put into the receptacle, and used for two or three days, when it was discovered and corrected—that was five years ago, I think.</p>

                  </hi>. I am principal bookkeeper in the Accountant-General's Department, Inland Revenue, and am perfectly familiar with the details of the arrangements for obtaining stamps—there are different warrants for the affixing of stamps—there is a cancel warrant when stamps have been cancelled, and there is a transfer warrant, and when the public want stamps they fill up a cash warrant, and pay the money to the clerk of the Receiver-General, and the warrant and the document to be stamped go down into the stamping department—it is entered before it goes down, both by the clerk to the Accountant-General and the clerk to the Receiver-General—it then goes into the stamping department to the teller, in whose duty it is to see that he has a document corresponding to the warrant, and marks the kind of stamp required, and it goes to the stamper without any knowledge of what is on the warrant, simply with a pencil mark; if a £10 stamp is required, "£10" would be marked in pencil in the corner, and then it would go into the stamping office to be stamped, and come out into the hands of the teller-out, who examines the stamp to see that it is a perfect and good impression—he then enters the amount on a slip of paper called a docket, which is sent to an official who has previously come into possession of the warrant; he compares them, and if they agree it is passed on to the delivering-out room, and delivered out to whoever applies for it—the docket remains in my office, and is part of the record—this warrant (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) covers March 5th—this "Worked 26th February" means that it was issued on that day, and completed on 6th March—the only £10 stamps included in that are the hundred S. E. transfers H. C. B. forms—this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) contains the record of the £10 stamps, which were affixed on March 5th—the 104 includes all the £10 stamps which could be legitimately printed on 5th March; two of those are Manet's, one Waterlow's, one Abraham's, and one Milner's—the two H. C. B. forms put in first, purport to be 5th March, 1890—there were three £10 stamps on March 4th, and this is the warrant and receipt in respect of them.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GEOGHEGAN</hi>. This warrant shows the number of £10 stamps between February 26th to March 6th on these forms; this represents 100 £10 stamps which were kept in stock; four more were issued—there is no book to show the number of stamps issued that day, but we have the separate warrants—the dockets are a check on the warrants; if a docket is employed there would be a stamp to match; the warrant and the docket are to check each other—there are ninety-three or ninety-four clerks in my department, and I think four of them have the charge of dockets, six is the outside number—they are not writers—it is the duty of four of them to file the dockets and check them with the warrants—an entry is made of the number of stamps issued in one day; a book is kept in the Accountant General's Department, and another in the Receiver-General's Department—T. W. Garrett is the clerk who issues these; the stamp is not on them—the receiving officer ticks off all the entries—there is nothing suspicious on the face of the stamps—the number would depend upon the accuracy of the person making the record—I have personally examined all the dockets, books, and papers.</p>

I am manager to Mr. Vaughan, pawnbroker, of 39, Strand—on March 20th, between 6 and 7 p.m., Falvey came and asked if I would make him an advance on some papers he produced, as it was too late to get a cheque cashed at his bank—I advanced him £3; he gave his name Knight, Cork Street—he called next day about eleven o'clock, and produced four pieces of paper, stamped with N. D. B. in the corner, similar to these, and wanted £20 or £30 on the four, but I declined.</p>

I am manager of the Earl's Court branch of the London and South-Western Bank—on, I believe, April 2nd Falvey called and opened an account with £160—£150 was drawn out the same day, which left £10, less 2s. 1d. for a cheque-book—on the 8th a cheque for £9 10s. was drawn, leaving 7s. lid.—Falvey called on the 10th, and said he had drawn a cheque for £5, and found he had not sufficient to meet it, and asked if I would allow him to overdraw his account—I said I did not feel disposed to do so so soon after it had been opened—he said he expected to receive a large sum of money from his brokers for some stock which had been sold, but the transaction was not complete, and he had bought a £10 stamp for the purpose, which he produced, and offered to leave it with me if I would pay the cheque—he left it; it was similar to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and we honoured the £5 cheque, it was dated April 9th, to E. Foskett, Esq.—on 11th April we honoured a cheque to, E. Foskett, Esq., for £2 10s., which left the account £9 10s. 1d. in debt, but we held the £10 stamp.</p>

               <p>I was in Finsbury Pavement, when the prisoner came up and said, "Has it gone five?"—I said I thought it had—he said, "What have you got in your parcel?"—I said, "Eight silk shirts"—he said, "Where are you going with them?"—I said, "To Mr. Wiltshire's in Fore Street"—he said, "I am a traveller for Mr. Wiltshire," and he pulled out a pocket-book, and seemed to be writing in it—he said, "Give me the parcel, and let me take it"—I said, "No; as I am very near Mr. Wiltshire's, I will take it myself"—he said, "I have just been down to Mrs. Chapman's," and he asked if I had a note in the parcel—I said, "No"—he said, "You had better run back and get one; Mr. Wiltshire has got an order for fifty silk shirts; I have got to go—," to some street; I don't know what the name was that he said, and then he left—I took the parcel to Mr. Wiltshire, who gave me another parcel of shirts for me to take to Mrs. Chapman—I told him that some person had met me—as I was going back to Mrs. Chapman I saw the prisoner at the corner of Blomfield Street; he came towards me, and I ran to the policeman, and said, "That is the man," and the policeman took him in charge—this is the pocket-book that the prisoner had, and in which he seemed to write—he is the man—I went back with the prisoner and policeman to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I never saw you before that day—I did not give you the shirts, because I knew you were not a traveller, and was not the person to whom they should be delivered—when I told Mr. Wiltshire what had happened he went with me to the police-station, and we gave information and sent the policeman in plain clothes, to whom I afterwards gave the prisoner into charge; he left the station with me—he was standing by my side when I saw you in Blomfield Street—he said something to you about some shirts, and you said, "I don't exactly know what you are speaking about; what is your authority? If there is any misunderstanding we will go to the police-station"; and we all went to the station—the Inspector asked what I recognised you by, and I said, "By his moustache and his height"—you only had a little moustache, not so much as you have now—when I went to Guildhall I talked to the constable and the clerk of the Court about the case before the Court sat—they did not tell mo what to say; they asked what I was going to say—I am quite sure you are the man who accosted me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not speak to the boy after I left Mr. Wiltshire's till he came and pointed you out—when I told you the charge you merely asked my authority—you had been employed by Messrs.

I am doing my work, am I not?"—I said, "I won't be spoken to in that manner, and I am not going to have the oil wasted"—Farren, who was in a sitting position, got up on his legs, and lifted the hammer to strike me—I grasped his arm to avoid the blow coming on my head—I struggled with him to get the hammer—I could not say this was the hammer, but it was one similar—while struggling with horn I saw Mahina come down the ladder, and as he came down Farren said something; I don't understand the language sufficiently to know what it was—Mahina then picked up a shovel like this from the stoke-hole, and struck me on the fore part of my head with it deliberately—this shovel was afterwards brought up from the stoke-hole—I was stunned, and was semi-unconscious—I don't recollect anymore blows, but</p>

               <p>I afterwards found I had received others on the head—I leant against the side of the stoke-hole, and I was conscious of Farren trying to pull me, and Mahina trying to pull my legs away—they tried to throw me into the bilge; the plates were open—I remember a crowd coming" in, but I don't remember any more; I was prostrate—I threw one of the prisoners off when they tried to throw me into the bilge, but I was semiconscious—I was attended by a doctor, and I am still in the doctor's hands—I am partially fit for duty, but not for my whole duty—I had previously spoken to both the men about their work, carelessness, and laziness—Farren is a Zanzibar man, and Mahina is a Somali—I think I was hit on the back of the head with the hammer—I have marks there.</p>

I am a clerk, and live at Canning Town—on May 21st, at 8.45 p.m., I was in Freemasons' Road, and the prisoner came in front of me and said, "How are you, old boy?"—I said, "How is your-self?"—he said, "Come and have a glass"—I said, "No, I do not require it, but if you want a glass I will give you one," putting my hand in my pocket—he then took my watch, and the chain gave way and hung down—he ran, and I gave chase very rapidly, although I am nearly seventy years of age—I collared him, and in two minutes I should have throttled him—I felt my watch fall into my pocket, and he said, "I have not got your watch"—I found it in my breast-pocket—I gave him in custody—I was sober.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I saw you snatch the watch from my pocket—you showed me two half-crowns and four penny pieces, which you took out of your pocket—I found my watch immediately I collared you, not after I got to the station—I did not see you put it into my pocket, but I felt the weight.</p>

I am a dock labourer, and live at 51, Freemasons' Road, in the same house with the prosecutor—on 21st May, about 8.45 p.m., I was near home, and turned a corner, and heard the prisoner say to the prosecutor, "Go to b—"; he ran away, and I ran and caught him—the prosecutor said, "That scoundrel has got my watch"—I made for him, and said, "You have that gentleman's watch, and if you will return it all will go well"—he seized the prosecutor, and I saw the watch come out of his right-hand pocket—he said, "Hold on for a moment," and put it into the prosecutor's left breast pocket, and said, "Feel in your pocket, and see if you have not got the watch"—I gave him in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> You were searched at the station, but the purse was not found till next morning—I had not gone out before it was found; the policeman found it before I was up—you are a stranger to me—I put some narcotic in my teeth to stop the toothache, and dozed off to sleep.</p>

I am stationed at Forest Gate—on 1st June, about 12.10 a.m., I was on duty in Pashet Lane, and was called to a field, and saw the prisoner, the prosecutor, and three young men—Baker gave the prisoner in custody for stealing his purse—I took him to the station; he made no answer to the charge—I then went to the field, and found this purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) where I took him in custody—that might be an hour afterwards—when I took him he wanted me to leave go of him, and allow him to speak to Baker, and call him on one side—I said I could not allow that, but what he had to say he must say in my presence—he said, "Well, never mind, it does not matter; I see I have made a mistake; I took the prosecutor for someone else."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The prosecutor was lying on the bridge; I went to lift him up; he used some words to me, and I let go of him—I heard three or four persons ahead singing, and ran towards them to tell them that I thought the man was in a fit, and he called, "Stop him!" and said</p>

                  </hi>. I am a leather manufacturer, carrying on business with my brother at 48, Tanner Street, Bermondsey, as Tebbitt Brothers—in January this year I required additional capital in the business, and inserted an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—in reply to that I received this card, with an address on it, "Mr. Bowerman, Belmont House, Peckham Eye," and on the back of it was written, "Personal service not essential. I shall be glad of some particulars of advertisement £15,000"—upon that I wrote to the defendant, and afterwards, in consequence of a letter from him, I went to see him at Belmont House about the end of January—he said he had exceptional facilities for lending us the capital we required; that he was a money broker, or money lender, or bill discounter—he said he could lend £5,000 to commence with—at that time he said it would be on bills of exchange—on 11th February I received this letter from him (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>), "Dear Sirs,—The fact is I got filled up over a matter I had in hand before I had the pleasure of seeing you; at the same time, if it would convenience you, I might arrange what you require through a banker at a moderate rate, and continue the accommodation as required—I am, yours, <hi rend="smallCaps">BOWERMAN</hi>"—ultimately, on 25th February, I went and saw him, and made an arrangement, which was reduced into writing—these two documents, marked B and C, were drawn up, and signed respectively by me and the defendant—he settled the form of them, and on the one I signed I put this postscript, "We have accepted for you five bills to the amount of £1,886," and I initialed that postscript—at the same time I handed to the defendant five acceptances for the amount stated—I accepted them there and then, at his request—the drawer's name was not filled in at the time I handed them to him—the document which he signed begins, "In accordance with our conversation I hereby agree to enter into the arrangement in connection with bills of exchange, by drawing on you at four months gradually," and on that understanding it was that he was the person who was to draw—on the document which he signed he wrote the words, "Received, in pursuance of this agreement, the following acceptances" (naming the five), and on the back he wrote, "In the event of my not discounting the said bills I agree to return them to you, cancelled, within three days"—the discounting was left entirely to him—on the following day, the 26th, I received from him this telegram, "Put the matter forward; hope to see you to-morrow"—I replied to that with this letter marked D, "In receipt of your telegram, and thank you for your promptness in the matter"—next day the 27th, I received this telegram from him, "Reports disappointing, which creates delay"—on the 28th I received this letter (E), dated, "Dear Sir,—The answer which the bank manager gave was of an admittedly negative character, and thoroughly disappointing; after our conversation a friend he told me might be disposed to take £2,000 in fourteen days if no renewing clause; I will see you in a day or two, increase your balance at the bank, that might probably exist"—I had no conversation with him why he should suggest that; he knew the bank; it was no, secret; he had the necessary power to refer to them if he liked—I wrote to him,</p>

               <p>stating that I would call on him the following evening, Saturday, 1st March—I did so, and saw him, and he suggested that I need not put myself out, that it would be all right; I asked him to let me have the bills, I wanted no further transaction, I wanted the bills—he evaded that in every shape and form; I could get no definite answer—I called at his house again on another occasion—in answer to a telegram I sent I received this letter (G), dated 4th March: "Dear Sir,—Your telegram received in my absence; having regard, however, to the fact that our mutual agreement extends over three years, I must say it is extremely arbitrary on your part; however, I have got up already about £1,200, which will be forwarded tomorrow in a registered envelope"—on the following morning I received from him a letter enclosing three of the acceptances for £400, £400, and £398 16s. 8d., which he said he returned in pursuance of the agreement, and without prejudice to the same—I also received on the same date this other letter: "I have heard of the conversation you have had with my wife; pray don't make yourself Unhappy, we will regulate this matter entre nous, bit of a bother, but will cover you at once, and hope to our mutual advantage"—I had had a conversation with his wife—I replied to his letters on 7th March, in which I returned him the three bills, with the signature cancelled, stating that I could not accept a part—I then received this letter from him, dated 8th March, in which he proposed to send me acceptances of an old and respected firm for an amount equal to mine—on 19th March I received this letter (K)—there was a previous letter of the 12th, saying, "I regret to say I cannot report progress; under these circumstances would you mind postponing your call until the end of the week?"—on the 19th he enclosed an acceptance for £417 odd, and a cheque on the Imperial Bank for £121—there is a note at the foot of the letter, showing the way in which he had made out the account in these words: "Met by your three acceptances, £690 17s. 6d.; 80 per cent, on the amount, £562 14s.; four months' discount at 7 1/2 per cent., £13 16s. 4d.; acceptance for £417 and cheque for £121"—upon that I consulted my solicitors, and by their instructions I returned those two documents to the defendant after inquiries—I have never received from him the other two bills for £490 and £217, or any proceeds of them—I learnt that they had been discounted, some time after this correspondence had been going on, through my solicitor; until then I knew nothing at all about them, neither could I get any information—I asked the defendant persistently on many occasions what had become of them, so that I could deal with them—he replied, "Oh, it's all right; don't be afraid; I will see it all right," and those kind of answers—on one occasion he offered me a selection of bills, which did not look to me the right sort of thing, and I did not accept them—I have heard of Mr. Louis Berg, but never had transactions with him; he had nothing to do with my bills.</p>

Principals only, address A. J., care of Pratt and Norton, 9, Old Jewry"—they are charted accountants who keep our books—I had not tried to get the money at my bankers, or at any bill broker's in the City, or any financial houses—this is the defendant's card; it is a private card with a name and address, no description of his business—I have been in business about twenty-five years—this</p>

               <p>was not a joint transaction; he was not to have 20 per cent, of the money for himself; he was to hold it, not to keep 20 per cent., to hold it for a certain period as a guarantee—we were to have 80 per cent., 7 1/2 was to be the maximum discount—when the arrangement was made he produced the five stamped bill forms in blank, and I then crossed them, "Accepted, payable at the London Joint Stock Bank, Tebbitt Brothers"—the bills were drawn first; I did not write my acceptance on the blank forms, they were drawn in the way they are now—the drawer's name was not signed; they were dated at the time, for his convenience, for discount, at various dates—I can't be positive whether the address was on the face of them—I can't carry my recollection back at the moment; I should not like to state an untruth in the matter—the amounts were in all of them; I did not understand from the defendant that he could get any drawer's name put on them; we thought we were dealing with an honest man, we did not question hid dealing, I did not think about it—I have accepted bills before on many occasions, not in blank altogether, sometimes sent by firms to us, without their signature—the only part of these two bills in my writing are the acceptances—the defendant was to try and get the bills discounted—he was to put his own name, or get some other person to put his name to them, and convert them into bills of exchange, and then get them discounted—if I got the 80 per cent., less the 7 1/2, I should have been satisfied—I intended to carry out the terms of the agreement—three of the bills were returned to me after pressure—I think they had no drawer's name on them when they were returned to me—I cancelled my signature—I declined to take the bill for £417 which he sent me on 19th March; I think it had on it the name of Marsh and Mackington, of Sheffield—I gave instructions to have it sent back the same day—I don't think I made any note of the original conversation with the defendant—he led me to believe he was a bill broker—he said he was a bill broker—I did not care about his having an office, he could conduct his business privately—in his first letter he said he had a banker and he could do the whole; then it fell through and went to a Liverpool firm—I had never seen him before that day, and I wish I had not seen him then, I knew nothing whatever of him then, I know enough now; of course we were anxious to get the full amount of £15,000.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He spoke as if his business was financing, that was always what he led me to believe—he did not suggest that he was doing it for amusement, he led me to believe that he was doing it as a matter of business—I can swear that the words "Messrs. Tebbitt Brothers" were on the bills when they were filled up, the only blank on them was the drawer's name; the body, of the bills was filled up at his dictation—it. was not understood that he was to retain the 80 per cent, as well as the 20, or that he was to retain the whole of the 20 per cent, on the £5,000 before we pot anything; the 20 per cent, was to be on the amount that was handed over to us—the acceptance and cheque he sent were handed over to our solicitor to make inquiries, and on the result of those inquiries they were returned—I am now being used on the two bills by the bank; I have never had a penny piece from them.</p>

Tebbitt Brothers in this prosecution—they brought me these acceptances and the cheque sent to them, for the purpose of my advising them—I made inquiries with reference to the acceptances and the cheque, and in consequence of those inquiries I returned them to the defendant, with a letter on 21st March, informing him that unless the whole outstanding acceptances were handed to me by Monday morning, I should take proceedings.</p>

I live at 239, Tabard Street—on 8th June, 1884, I was married to the prisoner at St. Stephen's Church, Westminster—this is the certificate (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—I lived with the prisoner six years up to this year; I found out about five months ago that he is a married man, and went with his wife to the police—she came to our house with two children, who she said were his—I have had three children by him, but only two are living—he treated me very cruelly; he got drunk and turned me and the children out into the street—he was pretty fair when sober—I brought no money to him, but I have earned it in the business since—he is a confectioner.</p>

I am a confectioner and a mechanical dentist, of 66, Marsham Street, Westminster—the prisoner was a tenant of mine—I went to Yorkshire with him last year, and he saw his wife in my presence, and said to her, "Did you obtain the divorce against me?"—she said, "No, I applied for it, but had not the means to carry it through, so it fell to the ground"—after he found out she was still his wife he gave her two daughters by him £20 each, and either £10 or £20 to his wife, but I did not see that, and also a diamond ring off his finger—we stopped there, and were entertained by his father-in-law at his table, and came back to London in the evening—he told them straightforward and honest that ho had been married again—we took the deed of separation from the second wife with us—it was signed by the prisoner, and the second wife had a copy—he read it to his wife and her father.</p>

I live at Morley's Hotel, Blackfriars Road, a lodging-house; I am an ironworker—on Thursday, 29th May, I was with Barry and De Rome—I went to Measure Bros, to get my wages, 17s. 3d., at half-past ten or eleven a.m.—I had no other money before I went there—they paid me a half-sovereign, two half-crowns, two shillings, and threepence, and then we went to the Two Brewers in Red Cross Street—we each had a pot of fourpenny ale there; I paid for it with the half-sovereign, which I took from my right-hand trousers pocket; it was loose, I had no purse—I put the change in my right-hand trousers pocket, where I then had 14 s., and I had some money in the other pocket—we left that public-house and went to the Catherine Wheel in the same street—we had two pots of fourpenny ale and some cigars there; we all paid—we went to the Prince of Wales public-house, and had a pot of ale, which Barry paid for—Kelly, whom I and Barry knew before, joined us there—he was invited to join us—a woman joined the party—Barry said, "Pay for a pot, you owe me fourpence"—I said, "I do not owe you fourpence"—I would not pay—I was sitting on a seat opposite the bar—when I would not pay for a pot or give him fourpence, Barry came for my pocket, and Kelly as well—Kelly crossed his arms and put his two hands against my throat, and held me tight against the wall—Barry tried to get at my pocket, but could not, because I had my belt over it, and I held my belt</p>

I know nothing about it"—he was taken to the station—De Rome picked him out from ten others, and Rae was afterwards fetched—he looked at Kelly and said, "No; I don't think he was there, or else I 'should have known him"—I said, "Have another look"—he said, "Yes," pointing to Kelly, "I did not want to pick him out; I wanted to get him out of it; I have known him some years"—when the charge was read to Kelly he said, "I was not in the Prince of Wales beer-house"—before the Magistrate he said, "I only went in to have a pint of beer"—I told Barry the charge at the Police-court—he said, "Nothing of the kind."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a son of the prisoner and Edward Charles Dove—on 27th May I was living with my parents at 2, New Cottage Room, Parish Street, Bermondsey—on that night my father came home, not sober, and went upstairs—he called down to me, and I went and said to my mother, "Father says run and tell mother will she give you three halfpence to get half a pint of stout"—my mother was middling sober—I got the three halfpence, and I got the stout in a can, and took it to my mother in the washhouse—she drank a glass herself, and poured the rest into the same glass—she went out of the washhouse, taking the glass with her; I remained there for a quarter of an hour, and then came to my mother, who was sitting at the table in the parlour—I then for the first time saw the stout on the drawers—I did not see my mother put it there—my father was upstairs in the bedroom—mother said, "Willie, tell father I left a glass of stout for him"—she then went out—she and father were not on good terms that night, they had had blows—before I went for the stout he hit mother—no bottle was thrown—I was in when my father came downstairs—the stout was still on the drawers—I said, "Father, mother says there is a glass of stout for you"—I am quite sure I told him that—I remember saying at the Police-court, "I did not speak to him, or give him mother's message"—it was untrue; I could hardly understand what they were saying to me—it was a mistake; I did not mean to say what was untrue—my brother Alfred is six—I did not see whether my father drank the stout or not; he sent me to take his club money—when I went back home Alfred told me something, and I went to the Police-station, and saw father there—I don't know who carried the glass to the station; I saw my father there with it in his hand; I did not do it—my mother poured the stout into the same glass she drank out of—it seemed clean—I have an elder brother, Edward Charles Dove, a soldier—he was a tinker before he was a soldier; he mended some kettles at 3, Angel Court, where we lived before we moved—he had a bottle with some stuff in for putting on solder—I have not seen the bottle since we have been at the house we now live in—father and mother were quarrelling about his not going to Hounslow to see his son.</p>

I am a currier; I live at 2, New Cottage Room; the prisoner is my wife—on 27th May I had a little drink; I was about half sober—I called downstairs to my son, to ask my wife for money for stout—I laid down, and then came downstairs—I found a glass of stout standing on a chest of drawers, and I drank two-thirds of it—my son spoke to me about it—after I drank it there was a burning sensation in my throat, and I felt sick—I vomited—I went to the Police-station—I took the glass with me, and about a third of the stout in it—I was attended by the doctor at the station, then I went to the hospital and the stomach pump was applied—I was sick, once going along and twice at the station—I was very bad in my inside after the stomach pump—I and my wife had had a quarrel about my son at Hounslow; she had been there—we renewed the quarrel the next day, that on which I took the stout—I should not like to say if I hit my wife that night, I did not that I remember—I threw no radishes nor saucepan nor bottle at her, to the best of my belief—I remember my son having a medicine bottle of stuff to mend kettles with—I tried to mend a bath a week or a few days before—when I had done with the bottle I put it, to the best of my belief, where we always kept it, on a shelf in the kitchen or washhouse—the liquid in the bottle was rather yellow, almost like whisky in appearance, and there was about a quarter of a gill, I should think—I do not remember putting anything into the glass of stout before I drank it—I could not say I did not put anything in that I thought was gin; I am sure I did not myself—after this affair I looked for the bottle—I don't remember finding it—I had had a little to drink when I looked for it.</p>
