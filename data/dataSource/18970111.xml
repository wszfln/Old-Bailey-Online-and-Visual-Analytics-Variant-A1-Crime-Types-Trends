I am a clerk in the Consular department of the Foreign Office—I produce the original register of marriages which took place at the British Legation at Brussels, in 1878—I find an entry on October 24th, 1878, of a marriage between Thomas Haydon, bachelor, a native of Romford, and Marie Hoyez, spinster, solemnised by the Rev.

I am in the Solicitors' Department of the Treasury, and had charge of this case—after the Jury were discharged last Session, the statement given by the prisoner to Nairn was put into my hands, and in consequence of an undertaking that inquiries should be made, I went to Belgium and made inquiries with reference to the matters contained in the statement, with a view of discovering whether there had been a marriage between the prisoner and Therese Hoyez at the place mentioned by the prisoner, and as to the date of Therese Hoyez's death—I procured this certificate of her death; she died on April 11th, 1878—I received it from Mr. Adams, the Charge d'Affaires at the British Legation at Brussels; he has certified it on the back, in consequence of my request.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I ascertained where she was buried—I found nothing at the Legation to show that you and she were married—I believe banns of marriage between you and she were published twice, on December 30th, 1877, and on January 6th. 1878, but they were never completed, and she died in the hospital on April 11th, 1878; six months before your marriage with her sister—Therese Hoyez was buried in her maiden name, which I take to be her proper name—you gave the names of a number of people you alleged to be present at the wedding, but it was twenty years ago, and I could not get the informa<lb/>tion—I did not make inquiries of all the people you gave me; it was im<lb/>possible; I could not hear anything of the marriage having taken place—I did not see your father-in-law, but he has made a statement with re<lb/>ference to the matter—the banns were published in Mons, not at Rom<lb/>ford, so far as I can gather—the police have made inquiries at Romford, and they cannot find that they were published there—I heard a good many things at the Legation about you—you applied there from time to time for assistance; on one occasion assistance was refused, as some years before another woman who claimed to be your wife had been assisted by the Legation, and sent back to this country while you were living with another woman, Bennett, whom you claimed to be your first wife.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The statement made by the prisoner to Inspector Nairn was read.

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner, and one of the house surgeons at Bartholomew's Hospital—on Monday night, December 14th, when the injured woman was brought to the hospital, I received her—she was living, but died twenty minutes after—I appeared at the Police-court on two occasions, and between the two occasions I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I found a lacerated wound over the left eye, three fractured ribs on the right side, and a rupture of the spleen and pancreas—the liver was fatty, enlarged, and unhealthy, but a there was no injury to it—the cause of the injuries was some violent accident—being struck by the shaft might have caused the injury over the eye—there was a faint bruise across the abdomen, which might have been caused by the wheels of a cart going over it; and the rupture of the pancreas might also hfcve been caused by that—she was unconscious, and did not recover consciousness prior to death—I did not observe any odour of drink—there was a bruise on the right arm, and one on left leg—they might</p>

               <p>have been caused by the fall, or by being knocked over, or by the wheel—some of the wounds might have been caused by the fall, and others by more serious violence—the injuries were sufficient to account for death—I attribute the death to the injuries.</p>

Alice Butler asked her to fight; she said she did not want to fight, and on the Saturday her mother came and said, "Halloa! I respect you, but I do not respect the other; he is a thief; she struck me, and I struck her back." I said, "Is the girl locked up?"

I am a money changer, of 9, Wardour Street—on October 6th the prisoner produced this French P.O.O. for 100fr., signed as it is now, and in the name of Charles Bruselle—I asked, in accordance with the usual practice, for the envelope, and he showed me this one—I handed him £3 18s. 4d.—he came again on October 7th with another French P.O.O. for 100 fr.

                  </hi>. I am a partner in Cave and Benoist, of 136, Cheapside—on November 20th I was looking out some silk at 1s. 10d. a yard—I went to lunch, leaving the silk on the counter—I was absent twenty-five minutes or half an hour—I returned at two, and missed the silk—it was on cardboard, and was about twenty inches wide and four inches deep—on December 31st I was in the office; I was sent for, and saw the prisoners—they asked for some umbrellas, and wanted to see some silk, as they were beginning business—they gave no address, but said they would pay cash for anything they bought—I showed them three pieces of silk; they asked for a pattern of one of them—I said that we did not give pat<lb/>terns, and asked them to give references; they said they would, and left.</p>

I am light porter to Cave and Benoist—on October 26th I saw the prisoners in the front room, between 1.30 and two—they showed me some satin and silk, and asked if we had anything like it—I took them into the front room, and they were alone about two minutes before Mr. Veare came—they spoke with a foreign accent—I saw them again at the office on December 31st, recognised them, left the office, saw Mr. Veare, who came down, and I fetched a policeman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not notice whether the woman had a veil on—I did not look close enough to tell—they were ordinary people—the rest of the interview was with Mr. Veare—the silk was not missing till some time afterwards; I knew of it about two o'clock—I was anxious to identify the people who had robbed Messrs. Benoist—the principal fact I remember is that they were two foreigners by their features; I think they were Jews.</p>

I am clerk to Cave and Benoist—on October 26th, about 1.45, Harris spoke to me, and I went into the front room of the warehouse and saw the prisoners; I have not the least doubt about them—they produced a pattern of black silk, and asked if I could do anything like it—I said, "No"—the female prisoner asked if we could do a pattern at 5s. 6d. a yard; I said that we had nothing near the price; she said that she was very sorry I could not do anything she asked for, and they left without doing any business—they talked with a foreign accent, broken English—we were talking about ten minutes; Mr. Benoist returned about half an hour afterwards—on December 1st I saw the prisoners again in the same room, and recognised them at once, and went out and gave information to Sergeant Bryant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The woman might have worn a veil on the 26th, but, if so, it did not cover her face; if she did not have it down I should not have noticed it—it was not over her face; I saw her mouth—she had no veil to cover her features—it was a foreign accent; I have heard Yiddish; which the low class of Jews speak.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When they got out of the shop they did not hurry away; they looked in the other shop windows—I searched Farsht's rooms, but could not get into Lewis's—I did not find any stolen property; I found a number of invoices, which showed that the prisoners had been dealing with some shops in London, and paying cash—there was an invoice for £1 1s. or 25s.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Stating that the brougham was ready to be sent for.</hi>) That is in the writing of one of our clerks—we charged an extra five guineas for any extra work to be done—a man and horse were sent, and the brougham was sent to Praed Street—we applied for payment, and received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that a month's trial was promised, and that it was on the hire-purchase system.</hi>) This was a cash transaction, and not on the hire-purchase system—we could not succeed in getting the money or the carriage, though we wrote to him several times—there was nothing in the state of the weather to prevent his trying it; it was a close carriage—here is another letter (<hi rend="italic">Asking Barton to send a cheque for the money.</hi>), and another (<hi rend="italic">Asking Barton to return the brougham, and stating that they must charge for a month' shire</hi>).

Barton, Esq., to Messrs. Offord. Second-hand brougham, painting shafts and changing lamps, as agreed, £63"—he said that he was a wholesale caterer, of 4, Featherstone Buildings—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced.</hi>) is the contract note I gave him on the last occasion of my making an advance.

I am a shop assistant, and live at Highbury—in October I advertised, and Barton replied, and I entered into his employ<lb/>ment at Featherstone Buildings—I was to be employed as traveller in the wholesale papering business—I deposited £5, and my salary was to be 25s. a week—I was to have a round, ready for me—the business was described on the letter paper as "Barton Brothers"—I saw Hanns there every day, and Barton not so often—I employed my time in writing and in taking in goods; I was never shown the round I was to go—I became suspicious, but stayed till I got my £5 back—I saw no sauce; there was no business done in supplying restaurants with beef-steak puddings; there were no beef-steak puddings there—a lot of tins of biscuits came, in ray absence—I saw them on the premises, and Lee took them away; I was told that they were for Mr. Parker, of Sevenoaks—Lee signed for them as Thomas Parker—this is partly in Lee's writing and partly in mine—I opened the biscuit cases; Hanns told me to</p>

I am a clerk in the Alliance Company—I had a tenant named Hasseman at 7, Praed Street—I went there in June; Hanns was introduced to me, and I accepted him at £120 a year—he said that he was going to carry on a bicycle business as the Imperial Bicycle Bazaar—he remained four months—I went there in November, and found the place empty—he paid no rent for June or the other quarter—I did not know that he was an undischarged bankrupt.</p>

Hasseman had been in possession of the place two years, and he introduced Hanns, who bought Hasseman's business; it was simply the same business continued—it was an under<lb/>stood thing that £30 for rent due from Hasseman should be deducted from the purchase-money to be paid by Hanns—I have heard from several people that Hanns is interested in a reversion of about £1,700, and that on the strength of that he bought this business; I do not know that it was a good business when he sold it to Barton—I did not know that Hanns was going away, or that he was negotiating a sale to Barton—there was no knowledge of any change of tenancy—I made inquiries of his friends, and believe that before be got into trouble Hanns was a thoroughly honest man.</p>

I put the cheque into an envelope with a letter addressed to Mr. Tabor, of 11, Copthall Court. I am not sure whether I did not address the letter to 8, Copthall Court. I crossed the cheque. It has passed through the bank, and been paid. I do not know the accused, I put the letter in our post-bag, for posting.

I live at 36, Penton Street, Islington, and have worked as a Sheriff's Officer for Hay ward and Odell, of King Street, Cheapside, for many years—I have known the prisoner for eighteen or twenty years, by the name of Charles Henry Yell—he was a clerk, I believe, at Round's Accumulator Company, Broad Street House—I know his writing—I received two letters from him in 1896—this is the second one; it is dated October 13th, 1896. (<hi rend="italic">This was read as follows</hi>:—" Dear Key,—Sorry to have missed you to-day. I went everywhere in town, though it was my last day here, but could not come across you at all.

This is the cheque, "C," enclosed in it—I had a letter the day before this; it is not here—I had seen the prisoner some days before—he said, "Can you pass a small crossed cheque through a bank for me?"—I said, "No doubt I could get it done if the cheque was all right"—he said,"The cheque is all right"—two gentlemen came in, and I left, and he told me to call later on—I did not call later on, and the next day I had this letter, with the cheque in it—I could not make out the name Tabor, and the day after I went and saw the prisoner—he said, "You recollect, eight or nine months ago, your showing my American friend around"—I said, "Oh, yes, perfectly, and I did not get paid for it"—he said, "Well, his name is Tabor"—I said, "I did not know his name was Tabor; I only knew him as Alfred"—I kept the cheque three or four days before I got it passed through, and previous to my getting it passed through I thought it was a bit funny, and I went to a solicitor I know, of the name of Robert Porteus, and showed him the cheque—finally, I showed the letter and cheque to George Gibson, a friend of mine, who passed it through the bank, and I received £8—Mr. Gibson told me the bank charged 2s. 6d. for clearing it—the money I received I took to the prisoner, less 10s. I gave to Mr. Gibson—when I gave the prisoner £7 10s., he gave me back £1 10s.; he said he was going to send the £6 over—he told me he wrote the letter at Tabor's dictation; I never knew the man as Tabor; he said that was his name—the letter is in the prisoner's writing—I did not expect to see him on October 30th—I did not understand the phrase in the letter, "But I could not come across you at all," to refer to him, but to his American friend—I did not ask him why Tabor could not write himself—I did not know Tabor—I thought it was very funny; he told me it was all right.</p>

               <p>Road—about eleven p.m. on December 28th I was with the deceased, Thomas Kelly, crossing the Gray's Inn Road, near Holborn, from west to east—a hansom cab, driven by the prisoner, came quickly from Holborn into the Gray's Inn Road—Kelly was walking on my left, to the best of my belief, but a little behind—the near wheel knocked me down on my hands and knees—the next thing I saw, when I picked my<lb/>self up, was the wheel going over Mr. Kelly—the prisoner may have called out; I did not hear him—the cab pulled up within four or five yards—I helped to pick Kelly up—he was taken to the hospital in the Gray's Inn Road, which we reached about 11.15 or 11.20—he died about 12.30.</p>

About 11.30 p.m. on December 28th I was on duty in the Gray's Inn Road, near the Holborn end, standing on the west side—about twenty-one yards from the corner (I have said fifteen to eighteen, but I have since seen It measured) I saw the prisoner drive his horse and hansom out of Holborn, across High Holborn, into the Gray's Inn Road, from the direction of the Viaduct, at about eleven miles an hour—he drove the right side of the refuge, the proper side into the Gray's Inn Road—about a yard past the refuge he knocked down Camp<lb/>bell—the off-side wheel of his cab appeared to strike him, and about seven yards from the refuge he knocked down the deceased, who was crossing the road from west to east, about six feet from the kerbstone on the west side—the near-side shaft of the cab appeared to strike the deceased in the head, the near-side wheel knocking him down and resting on his body—I mean the wheel on the west side—his clothing seemed to have caught something, apparently the step; his body seemed to be dragged along the ground for two or three feet—then the wheel went over his ribs; his head was towards the west kerbstone—the prisoner then struck at, or struck his horse, and was about to drive, or was driving, away, when I stepped out into the road; on seeing me he pulled up, or had nearly pulled up, when I caught hold of the horse's head and asked him to come back—that was about twenty-two or twenty-three yards away—I furnished information to the last witness to make this plan—I have not seen it—B is about the position where I was</p>

I live at 230, Camber well Road—about 11.10 p.m., on December 28th, I was standing at the corner of the Gray's Inn Road, waiting for some friends to catch a 'bus—I saw a cab come round the corner where I was standing, near a public-house, knock a gentleman down, and run over him—Campbell fell at my feet—I saw the deceased fall, and the wheel pass over his body—the cab was brought back—the constable spoke to the prisoner—when I asked the cabman to take the injured man to the hospital he said he could not, as he had a fare—I said he would have to, as he was not to be left on the pavement to die—I went with him, and the constable and Campbell, to the hospital in the Gray's Inn Road.</p>

I am the senior assistant at a drug store, 39, Rye Lane, Peckham—on an evening in the week following August 24th, the prisoner came in, and made some trivial purchases, which I do not remember—he paid for them—he then wanted to know what quotation I could give him for a carboy of vitriol—I referred to the price lists of the firms which supplied us, and went and told my principal what we were charged, and asked him what we could charge the prisoner—I went back, and told the prisoner that in quantities of that kind we could do it at something between 1d. and 2d. per pound—a carboy, roughly speaking, is 156 pounds—asking for such a quantity is an unusual occurrence in the retail trade—when I told him the price he deliberated a moment, and then said he would let me know, or would call further, or something like that—he said he used a large quantity of vitriol; he bought it by the carboy—he said nothing as to the purpose for which he used it—I did not ask him—vitriol and sulphuric acid are exactly the same thing—on October 2nd I went to Bow Street Police-station, where I was shown some men standing in a row in a corridor—among them I recog<lb/>nized the prisoner—I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He said, "What would you charge me for a carboy of vitriol?"—my principal was in the laboratory behind the shop, and he remained there—I gave the prisoner an exact figure, I don't remember it now; it was over one penny and lets than twopence—a detective afterwards came to our place, in my absence, and asked if anyone had been asking for explosives, or powerful acids, or anything of that sort—he called again later on in the evening, when I was in, and showed me a photograph—after seeing that I identified the prisoner—the detective said, "J under<lb/>stand from your principal that you saw the person who inquired for vitriol"—I said that I had just been roughly describing him from memory to my principal—he then showed me a photograph, and asked me if I knew it—I said I thought I recognised it—he said, "Do you think, if you went up to Bow Street, you could identify the prisoner?" and I said, "Yes," and it was then arranged that I should go up the following Friday—about a dozen men were brought before me at Bow Street—many of them were about the prisoner's age, and they all seemed about the same height, there was no very tall man—I recognised the prisoner by his face; that made the principal impression on me—I fix the date as being in the week after the 24th because my employer returned from a holiday on the 24th—it was the latter part of the week beginning 24th—I cannot be sure of the day—it is fixed in my mind as being that week because I associated the circum<lb/>stances, which were fresh then—I did not hear, till the detective inter<lb/>viewed me, that the prisoner was in London at the end of August—I</p>

               <p>think he said the prisoner had been in London about that time—it was after seeing the photograph and the mention of the date that I went to Bow Street—I did not see the prisoner alone in a eell—the first time I saw him he was in the row with the other men—the detective was Flood—he called on me about the last week in September, just about a week before I went to Bow Street and identified the prisoner—the detective said he would call for me on the Friday—I went through the cells into the gaoler's room—the cells were not open—two or three other witnesses, In<lb/>spector Quinn, and one or two more detectives, accompanied me—the men were paraded before me in a corridor outside the cells—I was called out when the men were in a row, with the prisoner among them—I did not see Bell till he was paraded with the others—I do not know if he had been brought up in Court the week before that, October 2nd—I heard of his arrest, and saw the proceedings in the papers—it was evening when the prisoner called at the drug shop, between 6.30 and 8.30 or nine, after tea; we had not thought of closing—I spoke to him for about two or three minutes, I should think—I cannot recall what he bought from me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I saw his face when I spoke to him in the shop, and I recognised it again—I gave Flood the rough description I had given to my employer; I said the man was somewhat short and stoutish, and had rather a common look.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 682, Holloway Road, and keep a chemist's shop there—six or seven weeks before October 23rd (which was the day I was examined at the Police-court) the prisoner came in and asked if he could have a quarter of a hundredweight of chlorate of potash—I asked him what he wanted it for, and he said to make an experiment—I told him it was too large a quantity to come to a retail chemist's for, and I did not think he could get it there—he stayed in the shop a little while—I told him we kept it only for medicinal purposes—he asked for some preparation of soda; I cannot remember how much—he stood for a few minutes, and seemed disappointed that he could not have it, and I said, "You had better try the oil-shop opposite"—I next saw him at Bow Street, in a small corridor, with about nine or ten others—as soon as I saw him I knew he was the man—I have no doubt he is the man who was in the shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I went in I raised my eyes, and I thought there was a man at the end that looked something like the man, but, as soon as I saw the prisoner, I knew he was the man—I made no motion or sign when I saw the other man; I said he was something like him—the detective, or whoever he was, said, "Look again"—I was very nervous, and feeling poorly—he did not point in any direction—Flood did not take me there—Johnson came to see me about the man who called at my shop—he showed me a photograph—I did not pick out the man from that—I have no reason for fixing the time as six or seven weeks before that, except that I remember it was about that time; it might have been more or less, I cannot say—I cannot fix any date—as far as I recollect, it was six or seven—no one mentioned anything about the prisoner being in London, and I knew nothing about it—the detective came and asked, if anybody had been inquiring for anything of that sort, and then I re<lb/>collected</p>

               <p>that someone had been—he did not say within what time—I told him, as far as I knew, it was some weeks ago—it was six or seven weeks before, I cannot say any more—I believe, when I said it was some weeks ago, the detective said, "How many?" and I said six or seven—the prisoner did not buy anything of me—I was speaking to him a few minutes—I asked him what he wanted it for, as it was such a large quantity—it was before noon he came—I stated before the Magistrate I believed the prisoner was the man, and in cross-examination I said, "I am sure the prisoner is the man."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a F.R.C.S. and Lecturer on Forensic Medicine at Westminster Hospital—on last Friday night, January 15th, I went with Sergeant Bryan to Antwerp, and to Mr. George Goll's house, the Café Rheingrau, at 31, Rue de Brézil, Antwerp—a man was there pointed out to me as Mr. George Goll—I examined him, and found him in a very weak and emaciated condition; his respiration was very feeble, his pulse 110, and very feeble—he was recovering from an attack of inflamma<lb/>tion of the lungs, and was quite unfit to travel to this country—it would have endangered his life—the condition he was in would probably last some three or four weeks; he can only make a gradual recovery—I do not think he could travel for about three weeks.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant.</hi>) I am stationed at Antwerp—I know George Balthazar Goll, the landlord of the Café Rheingrau—I was at Bow Street Police Court on September 25th, when he was called as a witness on the inquiry against the prisoner before Mr. Vaughan—he was sworn, and gave his evidence in the prisoner's presence—his evidence was taken in writing, and afterwards read over to him, and he signed it—the prisoner was represented by a solicitor, who cross-examined Mr. Goll—this is the signature made by Mr. Goll in my presence—on January 15th I went, with Dr. Bond, to Antwerp, and pointed out to him at the Café Rheingrau, the Mr. Goll who signed this deposition in my presence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The deposition of George Balthazar Goll mas read as Jollows</hi>: "I live at 31, Rue de Brézil, Antwerp, and keep a café there, called the Café Rheingrau. My wife's maiden name was Maria Wittges; she has a sister named Gertrude, married to John Francis Kearney. I have been at different times in New York, and from 1883 to 1886 I saw Kearney very often in New York. He was at one time a conductor of a car on Broadway. Both before and after he was a conductor he kept a saloon, and lately he had also a newspaper, called the <hi rend="italic">Irish Nationalist.</hi> I last saw Kearney in New York, about four months ago. He said nothing then about coming to Europe. He has been shot through the right wrist, and his hand hangs loosely, but he writes with his right hand, holding his pen between the first two fingers. On Friday, August 24th, he arrived at my house at Antwerp. He was not expected. He arrived in a cab with Hubert Wittges (his wife's brother and my wife's brother). Kearney said he had come to see the old people, and go up the Rhine to Cobtenz, where they live. He said he had come from New York in the <hi rend="italic">Amsterdam</hi> steamer to Rotterdam, and arrived at Rotterdam the day before. He showed me his Rotterdam hotel bill; it was either the Queen's Hotel or the Victoria, I am not sure which. He had as luggage a small brown leather hand-bag; it contained one change of linen. At ten o'clock on the next evening Kearney and my</p>

               <p>wife and Hubert Wittges left Antwerp for Coblenz. (This was Satur day, August 15th.) Kearney and my wife came back on Thursday, August 20th. About six days afterwards Kearney brought another man to my house, a stranger to me. Kearney told me he had picked the man up on the Red Star landing stage, and added, 'I was expecting him here; he is an old friend of mine from New York.' I did not catch the man's name when Kearney introduced me to him, but Kearney told me to call him Tom. He had no luggage then, but afterwards he brought a small bag, smaller than Kearney's. He was poorly dressed, and bought a suit of clothes next day. He had two of his lower front teeth knocked in<lb/>wards. The two photographs produced (<hi rend="italic">exhibit</hi> 12 and <hi rend="italic">exhibit</hi> 14) are photographs of the man Kearney brought to my house. The assistant steward of the steamer <hi rend="italic">Kensington</hi> came to my house, and I learned that Tom had come from New York in that steamer; the assistant steward talked with him at my house. I had myself made voyages in the <hi rend="italic">Kensington.</hi> Kearney and Tom always went about together. Tom occasionally slept at my house. Kearney told me that he (Kearney) was travelling for an American chemical company, and he wanted to buy raw material and send it to New York. He showed me some letters of introduction, and asked me if I knew where the firms were to which they were addressed. I gave him a directory of addresses. A few days later I asked him whether he had found the firms, and he said, 'Yes, I have found a couple of them.' I did not know what Tom's business was. Kearney was always drinking, and almost every night was under its influence. Tom drank very little; he seemed nervous, and as though he were in a fright. On Saturday, September 5th, I came home between four and five p.m., and found two men outside my door, talking with my wife; the prisoner (Mr. Bell) is one of those men. I did not know the men then, and I asked them who they wanted; the older man said, 'We want your brother-in-law.' He was a man between fifty and sixty, dressed in a grey suit of clothes; his hair had some white in it. He wore a soft felt hat. I replied, 'You will find my brother-in-law in a drinking saloon.' He asked me which saloon, and I said, 'Weber's, up at the station.' My wife offered to show them where it was, and she went to do so, and they went away with her. After they had gone, Kearney and Tom came in, and I said, There have been two Yankee fellows inquiring for you.' Kearney asked, 'Where are they?' and I said, 'I have sent them up to Weber's.' Kearney said he expected some friends from Paris. They waited, and prisoner and the other man came in shortly afterwards, with my wife. They shook hands, and called each other by name; they went into a room behind the saloon. The older man was introduced to me as George Garth, and he and Kearney went upstairs. Kearney's bedroom was on the first landing. I heard Kearney speak of something he had bought, and I heard him say to Garth,' Come, and I'll show it to you.' I do not know if prisoner and Tom went upstairs, but I saw all four together downstairs afterwards. All four were at my house together for about two hours, and then a carriage came, and prisoner and Garth and Tom drove away together. Kearney was too drunk to go with them, and re<lb/>mained at my house. Tom came back between eight and nine next morning (Sunday, September 6th), and told me that Bell and Garth were at the Hotel des Anglais, and that he had taken them home. Bell</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189701110054"/>
               <p>and Garth came to my house towards the middle of the day, and saw Kearney and Tom, and I saw them all four together in my house that afternoon. That evening I saw Bell (prisoner) sitting outside my house on a chair; he was crying. My wife told him to come in. Prisoner and Garth and Tom went away together again that evening; Kearney was too drunk. On the next day (Monday, September 7th), Garth and prisoner came to my house, and saw Kearney and Tom. They spoke of having a ramble in Switzerland and France, and Garth asked me if I had been in Switzerland or Paris. They had told me, the day before, that they were going away. Bell and Garth then left my house, and Kearney and Tom remained behind. Prisoner told me he had a saloon up town in New York, and if I came there I should have a good time. Kearney and Tom had some plans of Antwerp, they said, 'so that they might not lose themselves.' Berchem is about two and a-half miles from my house. The plan produced is a plan of the city of Antwerp (<hi rend="italic">exhibit</hi> 15A), and I think it is one of the plans they had. Garth had plenty of money. Kearney had some American paper money. Kearney was drunk on Monday and Tuesday, September 7th and 8th, and on Wednesday, the 9th, he was in bed, spitting blood. Tom went out each of those days by himself. He said he went to see a young woman. On Thursday, September 10th, Kearney got up, and in the afternoon he and Tom went out together; they came in at five o'clock in the afternoon, both sober. On Friday, September 11th, I was at home between 4.30 and five p.m., and I sat down with Tom in the inner room, and an open carriage drove up to the door, and the man in it got out and came into my cafe, and asked for a glass of beer. Tom said, 'He wants to see me,' and Tom at once left my house with the man. They went about ten steps off, and spoke together for four or five minutes, and the other man then got into the carriage again and drove away; and Tom then went upstairs, Kearney being in his room at the time. Kearney then sang out to my wife for his money; she held it because he had been robbed once. My wife asked, 'What is the matter?' and Kearney said, 'We are going.' I went up and asked, 'Why, and where they were going?' Kearney gave no direct answer, but said, 'It will only be for two or three days.' I pressed him as to where he was going, and he said, 'It is only for a day or two; we were going to the station; that is all I can tell you He said he would write for his clothes, if he did not come back; they seemed in a great hurry to go; they took their bags and walked to the cabs, and he said to me and my wife, 'You look like two great fools; there is nothing wrong.' While they were at my house they were always on the look-out for letters, and took their letters from the postman. After they had gone, a short note or letter came from Rotterdam to me from Kearney, and my wife, in reply, sent the letter produced (<hi rend="italic">exhibit</hi> 13), addressed to 'Mr. John Wallace, Queen's Hotel, Rotterdam.' The letter from Kearney to me I have looked for, but cannot find; in that letter he asked us to send some clothes to him to the Queen's Hotel, Rotterdam, in the name of 'Mr. John Wallace.' When I first knew Kearney, ten years ago, in New York, he spoke of having been in Glasgow. I first made his ac<lb/>quaintance in Antwerp; he then told me he came from England. My wife's sister brought him to my house; he afterwards married that sister. She was servant at the Red Star Emigration House, in Antwerp, and sh</p>

O'Hare had a public-house—she said she did not know, but there was a public-house, Mrs. Coyne's, over the way, and she might know—before that she said that Dan Meagher had been drinking, and it was late when he came in of nights, that he used to go to a hall in Watson Street—while we were in the kitchen I saw a letter in the prisoner's hand—we then went across to Mrs. Coyne; I saw a woman there: I knew her; I think we saw a young lady first, and then the mistress came; the young lady spoke first—she said to her mother that there was a young gentleman wanting to know where P. O'Hare's saloon was—the elder woman said that he had one in Clyde Street, and another one in Marlborough Street—the prisoner and I then went to the one in Clyde Street—we found some man there—the prisoner asked if that was P. O'Hare's saloon—the man said "Yes," but that Mr. O'Hare had some business in Ireland, and was not there; I did not know P. O'Hare myself; he had three boys at school—O'Hare had a farm—I then took the prisoner to No. 8, Watson Street—we went up one flight; a woman came to the door, and he asked if Mr. Daniel Meagher was there; she said, "No"; there were men coming there that night; it would be night before they came—I can't remember what the prisoner said to that—I do not know the name of the person who told me that—I did not know the place at all—I did not go to any other place with the prisoner; that was all—I left him at Glasgow Cross; he made me a present of 2s.; he gave me is at first, and another is at Glasgow Cross—a few days after I saw the prisoner at the Central Police Office, Glasgow—I afterwards went round with Mr. Carmichael and another gentleman to the same places that I had been to with the prisoner.</p>

We are here; come right away; business stopped; wire Garth.—<hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN WALLACE</hi>, Queen's Hotel, Rotterdam"—I repeated that to Glasgow at 11.42—the form has a record made of the time.</p>

As to the other evidence, they felt that, while the correspondence, movements and actions of the prisoner gave room for the gravest suspicion, without the light thrown on it by the evidence as to the explosives, there was not sufficient evidence to justify them in asking for a conviction.</hi>

I am eighteen years old, and am a dressmaker—I live at Braoknell—on Boxing-day I came up to visit an aunt at 4, Francis Street, Canning Town—I reached Fenchurch Street at four p.m., and got into a train to go to Canning Town—the prisoner and a number of other people were in the same compartment—I told a woman that I was going to Tidal Basin, and had to get out at Canning Town, and that I had a box in the luggage van—the prisoner said, "I am going to Canning Town, too; I will look after your box all right"—we both got out at Canning Town, and he got my box, put it in the luggage van, took a ticket and gave it to me; I put it and my purse in my hand, and put my hand in my pocket, and went out of the station with him—I was going to Tidal Basin, but my ticket was for Canning Town—he said he was going to show me where my aunt lived, and I walked with him along the Barking Road—he took me into a public-house, where I head some lemonade—we went a long way</p>

               <p>down Barking Road and down a side street, and he took the ticket from my hand—we went into another public-house, and brought some drink out; I would not drink it, and he threw it over me; we went on—he said, "Wait a few minutes," and went into a lavatory, and told me to wait outside—I did so, but never saw him again—I waited a quarter of an hour, and then went back to Canning Town Station—I got there at 8.30, wént to the cloak-room, asked for my box, and heard that it was gone to the Tidal Basin—I went there and found it, but the luggage labels and the label with my name and address were gone—I saw the prisoner at West Ham Police Station, and charged him with stealing my box and contents.</p>

I thought I should see a soldier in soldier's clothes, and I looked round and touched the prisoner, saying, "This man is the man"—he was disguised; he had a false moustache on when I identified him, I think—the other soldier was a dark man—on the night I was robbed the prisoner seemed to have rough hair all over his face, no direct moustache—when I picked him out he had a project<lb/>ing moustache.</p>

               <p>about 3.45—I took my purse out to pay for the first drink, when I was with the prisoner and the other soldier, and I put the loose money in my pocket—after I left the second public-house with them I kept foaling my purse—I daresay I had four glasses that afternoon—between four and five it would be getting dusk—I had never seen the prisoner before—I next saw him at the Police-station, nearly a fortnight after, on January 1st—I identify him—he was disguised when I went to identify him—the man who attacked me had a rough beard, as if he had been in the habit of shaving, and had not done so for a day or so—at the Police-station he had a fair moustache, which stuck out—Angel Lane seems one of the busiest thoroughfares about that neighbourhood; there are not so many people that end—people were passing—I made an oration because I had lost my purse, and the people paid no attention to me—the other soldier ran off as soon as I began to speak of my loss—I took £1 19s. 2d. when I left work that afternoon as my week's wages—after this happened I did not go to the police, but went straight home, and informed the police next day, about two o'clock—the prisoner was dressed entirely in civilian clothes when I identified him—I looked once, and said, "Is he here?"—I thought I should see him dressed in soldier's clothes—I had another look round, and said, "This man resembles the man"—the detective did not say anything to me before that—he said to me then, "Are you sure?" and I said, "Yes"—I did not drop my purse; I kept on feeling for it—I had not looked at it in the second public-house—I paid for the drink there out of money I had in my pocket.</p>

If not, say so"—he said, "I am satisfied"—he was the only soldier—there was nothing to indicate that he was a soldier—London came in—he said, "Is he here?"—I said, "Look at all those men"—he looked at them, and said, "That man is most like him," pointing to the prisoner—I said, "Is it him"—he looked again, and said, "It is him, I am sure"—the other men were about the same height—the prisoner had a slight moustache, about the same as he has now—he shaves under his chin, but on January 1st he had not shaved for a week, I think—I do not think he had a false moustache; I noticed nothing strange—I have never known him shave his moustache.</p>

I am a dealer in fish-skins at 148, High Street, Homerton—on December 15th these skins were left at my house—the next morning the prisoners came and, asked me to buy the skins they had left the night before—I said they were riot fit for me to buy; they were damp, and were of inferior quality—I said I would dry them—they said they would come the night after, and bring some more, and I said I would pay for them together—after they had gone the police saw me—the prisoners came in the evening, between seven and 7.30—Stannard said, "What about the skins?"—I said, "What do you want for the skins?"—he said, "10s.; I suppose they are worth 10s."—I said, "No; they are not worth 10s. to me; they are worth 8s."—he said, "Very well. come and give me a smoke; you shall have them at 8s."—we went to the Spread Eagle, at Homerton—a detective came in and asked me where I got the skins from—I pointed to the prisoners, and' said I bought them from them, but had not paid for them—the prisoners were taken into custody—the real value of the skins they offered me for sale was 19s. 3d.—Stannard told me he had started Walton in the business.</p>

I am a clerk in the Post Office at Rotherhithe—on December 4th, 1894, the prisoner applied to me to withdraw £8 in the name of Thomas Evans, by telegraph—I gave him the necessary form—I drew up this wighdrawal notice, and saw him sign it—he came for the answer, and I paid him—when he came the third time I had not heard, and he came a fourth time, and drew out the £8—the matter was drawn to my attention about four o'clock—I was shown a group of photographs at the Post Office, and picked out the man I had paid the money to, from twelve or thirdeen others—I am sure the face I identify in the photograph is the prisoner's.</p>

                  </hi>. I practise at Kotherhithe—on November 21st, at 8.30 p.m., I was called to the prosecutor—he was in a chair, propped up, with a good deal of blood about his face and head—on the floor I found some of his hair, which had been torn out by the roots—I found on his head two scalp wounds; one was a lacerated and contused wound over the right temple, with some dirt in it—I think it had been caused with a dirty shovel—the injuries are consistent with their having been inflicted with this dirty shovel—the other was an incised wound on the top of his head, to the left of the median line, and above the ear—the wound over the temple was dented, as if it had been done with the edge of the shoulder of the shovel, and there was a bruise extending up from it, which looked as if it might have been done with the edge of the shovel—the edge of the shovel might have caused the inside part of the wound on the top of the head, and tnou that wound appeared to have been torn by the catching hold of the hair, and pulling it—there were a black eye and a bruise that indicated further knocking about—concussion of the brain had been caused by the whole thing—he was quite collapsed, and in such a serious state that I thought it advisable for the inspector next raorfling to go arid take his dying declaration with me—the injuries, serious in themselves, were more serious having regard to his advanced age—the actual wounds would not have been serious if he had been a younger man, but the concussion would have been—in my opinion, much violence wns used—the wounds wore inflicted about two hours before I saw him, I think—the next day I had him taken to St. Olave's Infirmary—I did not see him after that till I saw him at the Police-court—there must have been repeated acts of violence to cause all the wounds I saw—I should think a fall from giddiness would be impossible to cause them—I had attended him twice before for bronchitis—his heart in somewhat dilated, but I saw no giddiness about him—ho never complained to me of falling about through giddiness.</p>

On November 22nd I was at Rother<lb/>hithe Police Station, when the prisoner was charged with an assault on James Judd—I read the charge to him, and he said, "Well, I was not there, and I did not do it; he was fighting with one of my men on that day; he wont after one of my men with a hammer, and my man picked up a wooden mallet and hit him (Judd) with it. Judd then ran indoors, and came out with two big sticks, and ran after him. The last time I saw Mr. Judd was outside the Half-way House, between two and 2.30 p.m. on the Saturday; there is plenty of people saw him there as well as me"—I said to him, "I have not cautioned you, but I warn you that what you say may be used as evidence against you"—he said, "All right. From the Half-way House I followed one of my vans up the Rotherhithe New Road, as far as Yoxton Road. I turned round, and went to the Sir William Gomm; me and Judd's daughter were together all that time. We went into the Sir William Gomm, and had a drop of brandy. I came out, and went towards home, the Raymond Road way. I met young Judd in the Rothnrhithe Road. We three came back into the Sir William Gomm. I was there three times or more. I had a fit there. I went home, and went to bod. I got up, and went for a stroll with my missus to see if I was all</p>

When I got indoors my <hi rend="italic">missus</hi> told me people had been there with Judd, jun., to accuse me of attacking his father.

                  </hi>. I live at 38, Max Road, Southwark Park Road—the prisoner is my son—on the Saturday when Judd was injured I went to the prisoner's house at two o'clock, and I stopped there till 12.30—he and his wife came in in the afternoon, between four and five, I should say, just as it was getting dusk—we had some tea, and then the prisoner had his boots taken off, and he laid down to sleep for half an hour, I should say—I heard him call out to his <hi rend="italic">missus</hi>, and she called out, "Don't lay too long, because you know where I have to go to"—he got up about six o'clock, and they went out together for not many minutes—they came back just after six—Mrs. Elliott came back alone, not many minutes afterwards, after seeing him off by train—she was out about ten minutes; I cannot say the time; they have no clock in the place—she came back with a pudding-basin in her hand and some onions and a railway-ticket, I think; they went out marketing—the fare from that station to London Bridge is 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a daughter of the prisoner, and lived with him at 18, Oakwood Road, Thornton Heath—the deceased, Sarah Daws, was my step-mother—she was about thirty-eight years of age; my father had been married to her about twelve or thirteen years—there were five children of that marriage—my father is a plasterer; he had been at work at his trade up to Christmas last—on the day after Christmas Day, Boxing Day, he was at home with my step-mother and the children up to eight o'clock in the evening: he was at home all day and to tea—I had been out in the afternoon, and my step-mother said, in his presence, "Father has been towing again"—she said nothing else—then they went out they seemed very well together, and they seemed on friendly terms—they came back together about nine—they still seemed on friendly terms—when they came back father sent me out for two quarts of ale and half a pint of Irish whisky—he brought it, and mother had a glass of ale, and father had a little whisky—I went up to bed about ten, leaving the prisoner and my step-mother together—their bedroom was on the first floor, next to mine—I heard them go in at their door about two hours after I had been in bed—about twelve I was awoke by a bump; it sounded like something dropping on the floor—there was an infant three months old in their room at the time—I heard it scream—I got up and went to their bedroom door; I tried to open it; it was fast; I called out to my mother; I got no reply—my father then undid the door, and gave me the baby; he had it in his arms—he told me to go into the other room, and keep it quiet—as I took the baby from him I noticed blood on the front of its night-gown—I said to him, "Father, there is blood on the baby's night-gown"—he said, "Don't you tell stories"—he then went downstairs; I followed after him—I asked him, "What is the matter with mother?"—he said, "Mother has fainted, and I am going to get some milk"—he then left the house—he was fully dressed at that time, just as I left him—I saw that the whisky bottle on the table was open when he left; he had drank the rest of the beer—before he left he told me not to go into the bedroom—a few minutes after he left I went up into the room; I called to mother—I got no reply—I then went into the room—I put my hand on her face, and found that my hand was covered with blood—I afterwards saw a coal-hammer that was found by the police in the room—I recognised it; it was generally kept in the coal-cellar—I did not know Mr. Ward.</p>

I am the wife of Alfred Daws, the prisoner's brother, and live at 12, Gross Road—on December 27th, about half-past one in the morning, the prisoner came to our house and saw me and my husband—he said to my husband, "Alf., I want you a minute" and they went together into the back kitchen; I followed them—I heard the prisoner telling my husband that he had done it—I said, "What have you done, George?"—he said, "I have killed her"—I said, "You have not; tell me the truth, tell me what you have done"—he said, "I have dashed her brains out, and cut her throat"—I said, "For God's sake, tell me the truth; tell me what you have done"—he said, "Will this convince you?" and he showed me the wristband of his shirt, which I saw was stained with blood—after seeing that I went with my son Albert to 18, Oakwood Road, where the prisoner and his wife lived—I left the prisoner with my husband—when I got there I went into the prisoner's bedroom with the constable Wilson, and there saw my sister lying in bed on her right side, with her throat terribly cut, and two large gashes; she was quite dead—I did not see any injuries to her head; I never touched her—I saw this hammer at the bottom of the bed—I gave it to the constable—I remained at the house till one o'clock.</p>

I am the husband of the last witness and brother of the prisoner—I remember his arriving at my house about half-past one on the morning of December 27th—he said, "Alf., come here; I want you a minute," and I went with him into another room—he said, "Alf. I have done it"—said, "Done what?"—he said, "'I have killed her"; I said, "Killed who?" he said, "Sarah," and he repeated the statement, "I have killed her"—after my wife had gone out, he called me into the wash-house—he was trying to wash the blood off the knee of his trousers—I said, "It's no use trying to wash it off, George; you can't get it out"; he said, "Never mind, let it go"—after my wife had left, I again asked him what he had done—he said he had dashed her brains out with a hammer, and cut her throat—he said he loved me, and he loved every hair of her head—I said, "I have never done you any harm, George"; he said, "No"—he said, "She had been a-worrying on at me, but I loved every hair of her head"—he then said, "Well, we cannot stop here"—he could not make himself contented there; he must go out—I took him down Cherry Orchard Road; we came back again, after being out a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, and he then said, "Come along with me, and let me give myself up"—I took him out a second time for a walk—he said, "There ate plenty of goods trains there, and we can</p>

               <p>soon do it there"—I took hold of his arm, and took him back again, and kept him there till the inspector came and took him into custody; he handed me his bank-book, that showed £210 to his credit; he also handed me about £60 in gold and some silver, and told me to keep it; that I should want it to help him over his struggle; he chucked his watch on the table, and said; "Keep that in memory of me," and he handed the chain to his daughter, and said, "Keep that for little 'Brent' in remem<lb/>brance of me"—that was one of his children by this marriage.</p>

I gave her £30, and worked for her three years without wages, but now she has disgraced me by sending me to hard labour, and being bound over to keep the peace, I have wasted away to a shadow.

She was annoyed because I said I lived with her. £300 of mine has been wasted, and I had no home. I wanted her to let me have my share, but she said the money was all hers. I have had no rest for it. I have no recollection of being there that night. I was taken to the station."</p>

On returning he found another man in possession, and was ordered out of the house. Upon his insisting upon his right to go back, she got roughs to keep him away, leaving him without a home, and the result of his savings and work in the business. He resolved to go to Africa, and bought the revolver, which he thought would be necessary for that purpose, but took it with him when he called to see if she would be more reasonable; but he had no intention of shooting her, only to strike terror to the ruffians in the house.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of Hanworth—on December 14th, shortly before eight p.m., I was walking at Old Hampton—in New Hampton I met the prisoners—I knew the two Bents—they called me by my Christian name, and asked me if I would treat them to a pot of beer, as they had no money—I said "Yes," as they had no money—"Come along, I will treat you to a pot of beer"—we went into the King's Anna and called for a pot of beer—I had a glass of beer, and walked out, leaving them; they walked in the other room with the pot of beer—I paid for the beer out of loose money from my left-hand pocket—I held the money in my hand—I went towards Hanworth—I was seized from behind—my waistcoat was torn open—William held my arms behind, with his knee in my back; Richard had his right arm round my neck, and Barnes said, when I began to holloa out, "If you make a noise I will knock your—head off," gave me a terrific blow on the side of my head, and unbuttoned my trousers pocket, and took 15s. and my bronze—I was glad to get away—when I got a little way away, I said I would go for the police—I went for the police—on my way back with Laws and Munton, we met all three prisoners in the road—I pointed them out as the men who had knocked me about—William pulled some money out of his pocket, and said, "Here, take this, and don't make a b——fuss about a little job like that"; I said. "No, I shall not; that won't pay me for my loss and knocking about"—I think it was 2s.; I could not see; it was dark—I charged the prisoners; the constable took Barnes, the others went away, and were apprehended at their own homes at Fell<lb/>ham—I was perfectly sober that night—I had had my tea—Barnes was the man who put his hand, in my pocket the other two held me, one under the chin, the other with his knee in my back.</p>

"These are the three men who robbed ine and knocked me about"—I did not say, "The other two have nothing to do with it"—the Bents went away; the police had a rough handful with you—at the Police-station the sergeant did not say, "Is there any more besides him?" and I did not reply, "No," nor "There were two more with him, but the other two men know nothing at all about that"—nothing of the kind.</p>

I am a painter, of 2, Newbury Street, Smithfield—on January 1st, about 10.30 p.m., I had been in a public-house, and went over the road to make water; I was thrown over in the mud—I walked along the Waterloo Road, and was knocked down by three or four men—I was taken to St. Thomas's Hospital—when I came back the prisoner was being attended by the divisional surgeon, and I was kept all night on the charge of being drunk—my head being bad, I was more fit to be in bed the next day than in a Police-court—I recognised Irwin as one of the men who had struck and robbed me—he attempted to rob me—after I was pulled down I went into more public-houses, and got more drunk—coming along the Waterloo Road, I was knocked down by three or four more—I thought the prisoner was one, but give him the benefit of the doubt—the second occasion my pockets were torn down, and I was robbed of between 10s. and 12s.—I had 16s. or 17s. in my pockets—I found afterwards between 3s. and 4s.—I had a bit of a struggle—I called for assistance—two constables came—I was taken to the hospital, and had my head dressed—the next morning I was charged with being drunk—the case was put back for a week to hear the case against Irwin—on the first occasion I thought the prisoner was the man who knocked me down—I could hardly see—I do not think he was the man—I told the Magistrate the prisoner was the one who knocked me down the first time; then he came upon me a second time—I said I was sure—I did not feel sure.</p>

                  </hi> (85 <hi rend="italic">M.</hi>) On October 23rd, between one and 1.30 a.m., I was on duty in Newington Causeway—I saw Mary Ward crossing from the Devonshire Street corner of Newington Causeway on the London Bridge side, and near the Anchovy public-house, and where the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway bridge crosses the road—I did not see her come out of Devonshire Street, but she might have come—I she was crossing the Causeway quietly—I next saw Boyes following, a few yards behind—I did not see him till he left the pavement—Boyes said, "Stop that woman"—I let her pass, but walked after her, when he said, "That woman and a man have been in my house"—I stopped her—Boyes then said that a few minutes before, whilst asleep in his front room, he heard the door open, and some person enter the passage; he thought it was a lodger; but not hearing anyone go upstairs, he got out of bed, put on his trousers and boots, and opened the door into the passage, where he saw a woman and a man, who ran down the Causeway, and he suggested I must have seen her; he made a grab at them, but the man escaped first through the door; the woman followed; he ran after them, but lost sight of the man, and followed the woman across the Causeway till he saw me—after that statement I took the woman back to 13, Devonshire Street—I examined the door—I called Boyes' attention to the fact that there were no marks on the door—he said they must have used a key, as one of his lodgers took away a key a short time ago, and lived in the Borough—I asked him whether he charged the woman, and he said he did.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate woman—before October 23rd I had been in the habit of walking in Newington Causeway—on that night I was at the Elephant and Castle—about one a.m. I passed through the Causeway, on my way home—I left the Elephant and Castle a few minutes before one, and was on the side of the Causeway where I should pass the street I now know as Devonshire Street—I did not know it then—I crossed over—as I, stepped on the pavement a man came behind me and gave me in charge—he said to the policeman, "Stop her"—then I went back, and he said, "She has been round at my house, and took a man in there"—I was taken in charge—I had not been up Devonshire Street—I was not in the house—I know nothing of it—I had not been on the door-step with a man—many women of my class are in Newington Causeway late at night.</p>
