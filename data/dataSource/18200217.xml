He cut the bag in half, and ran away with the bottom half, which contained the silver - it lasted a very short time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When the prisoner held you by the throat were you frightened - A. Yes, my Lord. I called out at first, and he then held me tighter. As soon as the other ran off with the bag the prisoner let go, and walked away very fast on the other side of the way - I could not halloo directly, for he hurt my throat. I followed him a little way, and then called Stop thief - Mr. Malcolm stopped him a little way up St. John-street, without my losing sight of him. I was not above a yard from him, and am certain he is the man. I did not see the other man afterwards.</p>

            . I am keeper of St. Sepulchre's watch-house. Malcolm fetched me to St. John-street, and I took the prisoner in charge. The boy said he had been robbed, and shewed me the bag - he charged the prisoner with it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I conceive there is nothing against me. I am not the person, and there is nothing to support the boy's evidence. Is it to be supposed that a man with a wooden leg could commit a highway robbery? he was asked at the office by what he knew me? - he was mute. A person whispered in his ear,</p>
               <p>"Because he has a wooden leg."</p>

On Thursday, the 27th of January, a little before one o'clock in the day, I was coming down stairs, found his room door open, and saw the prisoner in the room with a bundle in his hand, or his hand on the bundle, which contained the articles stated in the indictment - he tried to pass me. I saw that the sheets, pillows, quilt, curtains, and valences were stripped off the bed; he had put them into the pillow-case. He also had a bundle with two pillows, some pictures, and a looking-glass, which were my husband's property.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the pillow-case - A. On the bed - the room is very small. He passed me as far as the stairs, but I called Stop thief! and Youren seized him; he said he would not flinch, and did not attempt to go further; he had left every thing on the bed - I had made the bed not half an hour before, left the door locked, and took the key into the top room until Youren came for it. We both came down stairs together; he put the key to the door, and found it was open - I had left the things in their proper places. The street door was left open.</p>

            . I am a currier, and occupy part of a back room at Anderson's; I went out between eight and nine o'clock, and gave her the key to make the bed. I returned home a little before twelve o'clock, went up to her room for the key, and she came down with me. I put the key to the door, and it flew open; it was unlocked, and the prisoner was there - he either had his hand on the bundle, or the bundle in his hand. While I turned round to the landlady he came out of the room, and passed me; she cried out Stop thief! and I seized him directly. I found the room stripped of every thing, the pictures taken off the wall, and the curtains off the bed; I found a bundle and a pillow-case in the room containing the property - he appeared agitated. I asked him how he got into the room? and he gave me some keys, one of which opens the door. There is a door from the front room into mine, that was locked and bolted.</p>

Soon after I went to Mr. Griffin's, who keeps the Goat, public-house, at Pimlico, and saw the prisoner there. I slipped back that he should not see me, and called Mrs.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182002170005"/>Griffin into the parlour to speak to her.

            . I am a watchman. I heard the alarm, went to the house, and found the victuals in the middle of the area. The window-shutter was daubed with dirt, as if a person had been sliding down - the Venetian blind between the shutter and window was torn away; there was room for a person to get over the top of the shutter. A pane of glass was broken, and the bolts drawn aside. There were also dirty footmarks on the stairs and landing-place.</p>

I went to where they worked again at half-past seven o'clock - Coakley was blowing the forge fire; the prisoner took two pieces of iron out of the fire with a pair of tongs, which were to be welted together, they were six or seven inches long, he had them in his hand; the deceased came to strike them with the hammer to welt them - I heard no quarrelling between them. I then observed the prisoner poke one piece of iron at him. I cannot say whether it struck him or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to do it angrily or in a jest - A. I saw no appearance of anger, my Lord; the deceased was close by the anvil. A skirmish immediately ensued, and they fell, the prisoner undermost; I do not know what became of the iron. They both got up, and I separated them - I saw no blows pass then; I did not hear Coakley complain. After I had separated them the prisoner struck him with his fist, they then had another scuffle, and both fell on a chest under the bellows. I went away to work in another part of the premises, and left them scuffling - I thought they might fight it out. I returned in about five minutes, and saw Povey talking to Coakley. I told the prisoner I thought it very wrong to push the hot iron at him - he made no answer. I did not then hear the deceased complain.</p>

            , JUN. I worked at the manufactory. Between seven and eight o'clock in the morning a lad about thirteen years old came to me, and said Rothery and Coakley were fighting. I followed the lad, and saw them laying on a box under the bellows; the deceased then lay on the prisoner - his hands were under the prisoner's neck. I lifted the deceased off, and advised them in a peaceable manner to leave off.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any iron instruments about them then - A. The prisoner had his hand over a box which had old iron in it. Near the place where they fell there is an iron rod about three feet high, which is drove into the ground with a branch standing out, which has a point to it to hold a lamp on; this was bent nearly double. I supposed they had fell on it and bent it. Coakley did not complain of being hurt then. I left them sitting together.</p>

            . A little after six o'clock in the morning, I went into the smiths' shop; the deceased was then smoaking his pipe - the prisoner had a good deal of work to do, and could not get him to assist. I remonstrated with him on the impropriety of his conduct, and said if he did not assist he should go about his business; he then began to blow the bellows, and I went into the adjoining shop. The boy ran and said they were fighting. I rather thought it was a fit, as the deceased was subject to fits every week, and the prisoner had a great deal of trouble in rendering him assistance in these fits. I went, and found my son parting them; the prisoner was underneath on a box, with his head hanging over the box; the deceased was on the top of him, and appeared to be holding him by the throat. My son pulled him off; he took no notice of his being hurt. I tried all I could to persuade him to go to work, instead of which he went up into the hayloft. I was in the yard about half an hour after, and he came out of the loft. I asked him why he did not go to work or go home? he immediately went home; I took no notice of any thing being the matter then, except a bruise on the nose, which might be occasioned by the fall. I went into the shop to the prisoner, and saw that he had a black eye; he worked two years for my master, and was very attentive to the prisoner when he had fits: He was the most sober and the most humane man I ever knew.</p>

            . I am a student, and practice as a surgeon at the London Hospital. On the 1st of February the deceased was brought to the hospital. I found him sitting on the bed, stripped him, and examined his wound, which was above the groin; it appeared like a burn, as if it had been done with a hot instrument, about a quarter of an inch broad - he died next day. I opened him; the wound had passed quite into the cavity of the abdomen, and through two portions of the intestines. The inflamation produced by it was sufficient to occasion death; an inflamation took place in the bowels. The external wound appeared very slight.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you trace the progress of the wound into the bowels - A. Yes my Lord, it appeared to have been done with a blunt instrument; I did not observe his clothes or his shirt. If they had been burnt I think it would have struck me.</p>
               <p>Q. All the internal symptoms were those of inflamation, which might be occasioned by cold as well as heat - A. Yes my Lord, but there was the appearance of a dreadful burning; the part where it had penetrated was quite destroyed.</p>
               <p>Q. If a person received a wound of that sort, do you consider it possible for him to stand for hours on his legs, and struggle with his antagonist - A. It does not appear to me possible that he could stand.</p>

            . I am an officer of Shadwell. I apprehended the prisoner on the morning of the 2d of February at work. I told him I had come to fetch him, for the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182002170009"/>young man he had burnt the day previous was dead; he appeared a good deal affected. I took up a poker, and asked him if he stabbed him with that? He moved several pieces of iron which lay on the forge, picked out two pieces, which I produce, and said it was with a piece similar to those.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I do not know that I burnt him; I attempted to frighten him away because he would not work - I do not think I touched him with the iron. He hit me on the arm with his hammer, and I struck him.</p>

On the 8th of February, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I was in my back parlour adjoining the shop - the folding-doors between the shop and the parlour were open; I saw a boy run out - nobody was in the shop. I followed the boy, and as I ran through the shop I missed five silk handkerchiefs and one cotton one; he must have crept under the counter to the end of the window to take them - they could not have been reached without creeping under the counter; I had put them there that morning. I followed him into the street, crying Stop thief! and Rickman secured him. I saw him all the way up the street till he turned the corner. I am sure he is the boy; Rickman was pursuing the boy who ran out of the shop. He brought the prisoner back, and the handkerchiefs were found in his hat - they cost me 5 s. each.</p>

            . I said I would give him 20 l. for them both, but he must call for the money at five o'clock in the afternoon. He said they belonged to his father, who was seized on, and he sold them to make up a sum - he went away. When daylight came, on examining them I found they were worth much more money - I hired a horse, rode over to Camberwell, and enquired for Mr. Smith, but could find no such a man. On my return I found Freeman had been to see me about them. I went to Lambeth-street Office to him, and stated the particulars. By agreement, he came to my house at four o'clock, and waited there till a little after five, when the prisoner came for the money. I told him I had been to Camberwell, and found no such person there as Smith. He asked me why I did not tell him in the morning that I was going, and he would have gone with me to satisfy me.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182002170010"/>Freeman then asked him where he got the cows from? he told the same story, and was taken into custody.</p>

The prisoner took hold of my arm, and began talking about the roads being bad, and said he would help me along; I was walking steadily along I am certain. We walked on past Shadwell Office, he having hold of my arm; in passing Ratcliff-cross, some person from the footpath crossing the road, struck me a blow on my left temple, which knocked me down, and the prisoner fell on the top of me; in raising up again I found his hand taking my watch from my fob - I felt him doing it as he laid on the top of me. The man who knocked me down stood up by me; I am sure it was the prisoner's hand at my fob - I felt the watch go from my pocket while we were on the ground together; we rose up together and proceeded forward - I laid hold of his arm; the other man ran off before we got up. I observed to the prisoner that the man had run away with my watch; he said he saw him run up Butcher-row - I saw nothing pass between them; we then proceeded to my house. About 150 yards from my house another man came up and talked to him, then took hold of my arm, and we all three walked home together.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to observe to the prisoner that the other man had run away with your watch - A. I knew the prisoner had taken it, but I did not want to charge him with it until I got home, as I knew an officer who lived near me; I thought he might escape before I could give him in charge. When I got home I called the watchman, gave him in charge, and went to the watch-house with him myself; I was quite able to recollect what passed, and am quite sure the prisoner took the watch from my fob.</p>

            . I am employed by Lack. I had the care of the Rachael, which laid in Whitefriars dock. I saw all her ropes safe about nine o'clock in the evening of the 24th of January - the Frances was also there; I went again about eleven o'clock on the night of the 25th, the ratline was then gone out of the cabin, which was broken open - it weighed 25 lbs. or 26 lbs. I have seen Dunn on the river. On the 27th I went with Forrester to Tyler's house, he keeps an old iron shop in Shoe-lane, and asked him if he had bought any rope lately? he said No. Forrester said if he was an honest man he would let us search, to which he consented in three or four minutes. I saw the ratline under some old rags opposite the door. Forrester took him into custody; the wharp of the Frances was stolen - I had seen it safe two or three days before. On the 27th we found it all at Jarvis's, who keeps an old junk shop at Queenhithe.</p>

            . I am a waterman, and live in Blackfriars-road. On the 25th of July, about one o'clock in the day, I saw Dunn go on board the Rachael at Whitefriars dock. I stood on the wharf, saw him break the cabin open, and come ashore with an old tin saucepan full of grease in his hand. He went on board again into the cabin, returned and went ashore - he had nothing then - I did not see him on board the Frances, but it laid close to the Rachael. I went away, heard of the robbery about half-past nine o'clock, and mentioned this. I knew Dunn before, and did not suspect him.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. On the 27th of January Dunn was given into my charge about eleven o'clock in the morning by Smithers at Bow-street Office, charged with breaking open two barges - I neither threatened or promised him; he stated that he, and a man named Pratt had broken open the Frances and Rachael at Whitefriars dock, and had taken part of the wharp and some other rope, and that they had sold the wharp to Jarvis of Queenhithe for 4 s. 8 d., and had sold the other in Shoe-lane, next door to a chandler's shop. I went and took Pratt into custody at his house in Shoe-lane, which is a chandler's shop. I found a piece of wharp at Jarvis's, and sent Forrester to Tyler's; Pratt was discharged.</p>

            . I am a ship owner, and deal in new and old rope. On the 25th of January, about five o'clock in the evening, Dunn brought this wharp - he said he had some old rope. I weighed it and paid him him 4 s. 9 d. for it, and went up stairs. Next morning upon opening it I found it was old rope put round good serviceable rope, and put it by, supposing it would be owned - if I had seen the good rope I should not have bought it. On the 27th Brown came and I shewed it to him; he claimed it - it is worth 10 s.</p>

            . I am an officer. In consequence of information that I received from Dunn, I and Smith went to Tyler's in Shoe-lane, and asked him if he had bought any rope lately? he said he did not recollect that he had bought any, and did not think he had any on the premises. I cast my eye round, and saw a piece under some old rags, which Smith claimed. I pulled the rags off, and found some more; there was about fourteen or fifteen yards cut into twenty pieces, eighteen of which were new rope.</p>

We have an internal communication with it - the prisoners are strangers to me. On the 27th of January, about five minutes before nine o'clock in the morning, I took the notes and cash stated in the indictment out of the iron chest, and laid them on the desk - there was 297 l. 9 s. 6 d. in all - the warehouse-door was open. I went into the back warehouse, leaving nobody in the counting-house; the door was open. I was not absent five minutes before I heard the warehouse door shut; I came into the front warehouse to see who was gone out, and immediately missed the property. I went out, and saw a man running in the middle of the road, fifteen or twenty yards from the door; I pursued him some distance, calling Stop thief, but he got off, and I cannot say who he was.

            . I am a linen-draper, and live at No. 318, High Holborn. On the 27th of January, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the female prisoner came to our shop, and bought a hearth-rug, carpet and counterpane, which came to 2 l. 18 s.; she paid me a 20 l. note, I gave her the change and goods, and she left the shop. About fifteen minutes after, from information I received, I went out to look for her, and saw her at the corner of Gray's Inn-lane, in company with the male prisoner. I followed them up Gray's Inn-lane, and saw them go into the Marquis of Granby - the man had a bundle under his arm when he went in. They came out in a minute, and I followed them as far as Gray's Inn-gate, across the square through the passage up Brownlow-street into Holborn again, and up to Manning's, the linen-draper, at No. 52, Broad-street, St. Giles's - the female prisoner went in there, and the man returned down Holborn in the same direction in which he came. I followed Sperry into the shop, and communicated my suspicion to one of the shop-men. While I was there I heard her ask for change for a 25 l. note. I went over to Manning's other shop, at the corner of Museum-street, she was brought over there, and a constable was sent for. I went to look after the man, and saw him standing about thirty yards from the shop, where the four streets meet, and asked him to step into the shop with me, telling him the young woman was there whom he was with - he went in without hesitation. In the mean time the constable came, and went into a private room with Manning - the male prisoner walked off. On the following day I was with Plank, and pointed him out in Leather-lane, and he took him into custody; he struggled to get away. I gave the note to Mr. Nutting, after marking it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you point him out to Plank, or did he ask you if he was the man - A. No, I said</p>
               <p>"that is the man." Plank said</p>
               <p>"Be sure" - I was sure, and he took him. I had described him to Plank before.</p>

I am an officer of Marlborough-street, On the 27th of January, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, Sperry was brought to the office under suspicion of uttering a 25 l. note - Rushmer delivered the 25 l. note to me as that he received from her, I have kept it ever since. I asked her how she got the note? I neither threatened nor promised her - she said it was given to her by a gentleman from the country, who frequently visited her, and that he gave her two 25 l., a 20 l., and a 1 l. note. She did not know his name, nor what part of the country he came from. I asked her if her name was Simpson, and if she lived at No. 14, Great Warner-street? she said that was her name and residence. I said I should immediately go there, and if it was not so I should discover it - she then said it was not her address, but that she lived at No. 4, Vine-street, Mutton-hill, and her name was

             - that she was a single woman, and lived there alone. She was committed to New Prison, Clerkenwell. At a late hour that night, Mr. Nutting brought me a printed bill, with a description of the notes; one of them exactly corresponded with the 25 l. note delivered to me. Next morning I went with Mr. Nutting and Mr. Shepherd to New Prison, and asked her, in their presence, if what she had told me the night before, as to her name and address, as also the person she had the note from, was all correct? she said it was. I asked her when the gentleman gave them to her? she said last Wednesday (which was the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182002170013"/>26th). I said,</p>
               <p>"You was apprehended on Thursday, are you sure it was not that day?" she said, No, she was certain it was the day before. I said it could not be, because I had a bill, describing the notes to have been stolen on Thursday, and this gentleman (pointing to Mr. Nutting), was the owner - she declined saying any thing more. I found she did lodge in Vine-street in the name of Allen, in the back room first floor - it is a little broker's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know of Allen - A. I was in Leather-lane with Nicholson about the middle of the next day, Friday - he had given me a very exact description of the man before that. I saw the prisoner at some distance before me, with a large bundle under his left arm, and an umbrella in his right hand - his back was towards us; Nicholson said</p>
               <p>"That is the man!" I desired him to be sure. I got as near to him as possible - he looked at him, and gave me a signal; when he got near him I advanced by the right side of Allen, and asked him to step into a shop, as I wished to speak with him. He rather started back, and said,</p>
               <p>"What do you want?" I seized him by the right arm and said I suspected him to be the man who had robbed a gentleman of 297 l., and if he was innocent he could have no objection to walk into the shop with me. He instantly threw his bundle and umbrella down, and made considerable resistance - I succeeded in getting him into Mr. Green's shop. In securing him the bundle was lost, as a mob gathered. The umbrella was brought in, it was broke in the scuffle. I put him into a coach, took him to the office, searched him, and found one 50 l., two 20 l., four 10 l., two 5 l., one hundred and five 1 l. notes, and 3 l. 15 s. in silver, and a key, which he said belonged to his room. I told him he lodged at No. 4, Vine-street, Mutton-hill, he said he did. I tried the key - it opened the door, and in that lodging, the back room on the first floor, I found a 10 l. note in a small box. He said I should find more money there. I also found a memorandum, which I produce - Nutting claimed it. I also found a shop-bill of Nicholson's for a counterpane, a carpet, and a hearth-rug, which came to 2 l. 18 s. I found a duplicate in his pocket of a hearth-rug, carpet, and quilt, pledged that day at Hill's, Turnmill-street - I went and found them there. I found a new hat on his head, with Blissett's name in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found nothing at the lodgings but the 10 l. note - A. No. If Sperry had not given me the address I might not have found him. She said she was drawn into it by a man.</p>

The 20 l. note paid to Nicholson, the 25 l. paid to Wilson, and the 5 l. paid to Blisset, are all notes which were among them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you swear they are all the identical notes you paid him - A. I do; I paid them to nobody but him.</p>

On Wednesday, the 26th of January, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop and asked for a pair of gloves; I opened not less than three dozen before I could find a pair large enough to fit him - I tried to fit him, and took notice of the size of his hand, it was particularly long and large; I at last fitted him. He also bought two pair of drawers, six pair of men's and four pair of women's lamb's-wool stockings, two nets for the neck, and three pair of muffatees, they came to 2 l. 12 s. He said he was going into the country by the coach, and gave me a 10 l. Bank note. My daughter was present, and said,</p>
               <p>"Mother, you can't give change." I then took it to my father, and sent my other daughter, Ann, next door, to get it changed - the prisoner remained in the shop. She returned in seven or eight minutes alone, and said she could not get change - he said,</p>
               <p>"Then you must send the goods;" she gave him the note, then took it out of his hand again, and said she would try another neighbour, a Mr. Manson - she went out; a man came in, about two minutes after she went out, and said in the prisoner's presence that he was come for a pair of stockings, which he had been for in the afternoon, when I could not change him a 1 l. note - (he had been in the afternoon, and offered me a 1 l. note - I did not like the looks of him nor the note). He paid me 3 s. in silver for the stockings. While he stood there, the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"It is a fine night." I think he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, it is." I folded the stockings up and the man went away. The prisoner directly got up, and said he must go, he could not wait, and I must send the goods. He was moving rather in a hurry towards the door, I asked him what his name was? he said, as he was going out,</p>

I asked where? he said, to the White Horse Cellar - he had by that time got out of the door. I desired my daughter to ask him whether it was the New or Old White Horse Cellar? he was then quite off the steps of the door. He hallooed out,</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. I was sent for to Manson's, where I saw Mrs. Applebee; she shewed me two 10 l. notes, and I marked one in her presence. About the middle of the next day I went to Mr. Applebee's, and she shewed me the note which has been read. I went with her servant to the George and Dragon, Jermyn-street; the servant carried the goods - I remained at some distance from her; she came out in about three minutes, and we went to the Old White Horse Cellar, Piccadilly - there is no Old White Horse Cellar at Charing-cross. We afterwards returned to the George and Dragon, waited there two hours and a half, and enquired for a person named West - a person calling himself West had been there to write a note; I found no direction about leaving the things, On the 3d of February I was informed that a man resembling the prisoner was in Tothil-fields prison, and I immediately took Mrs. Applebee and her daughter there. They saw the prisoner, and identified him immediately.</p>

               <p>"If you have no objection I will go with you" - he had given the name of,</p>

We turned up Great Garden-street, and just as we got to No. 13, (I was about half a yard behind him), in an instant he turned round, and threw the bundle of grocery violently in my face, which stunned me, so that I could not see for two or three minutes. When I recovered I found the bundle and my hat on the ground. I looked up, and saw him running about twenty or thirty yards before me; I immediately called Stop thief! and ran after him - he turned down Chicksand-street, and got away. I returned and marked the note - (looks at one) - this is it. I had it with me all the while; I am certain he is the man. I saw him in custody about two months after,</p>

I saw her write on the note. She gave me the change, and I gave it to Jennings.

               <p>Q. On Saturday, the 15th, did either of them come - A. Yes, Griffiths came between eight and nine o'clock - he first came into the shop, Jennings was outside, about two yards from the door, while Griffiths was inside. Griffiths bought an aitch-bone of beef, he brought it to me to weigh - it came to 4 s. 1 1/2 d. he gave me a 1 l. Bank note, I told him it was a bad one, and that he knew it - he said nothing. I collared him immediately. The moment I collared him I saw Jennings run away from facing the shop, where he was standing in the road. I think he saw me collar Griffiths - he could see me. I called Adams in, and gave him the note. Jennings was brought back in about three minutes.</p>

               <p>"Tom, that is my woman," pointing to the woman who was with Jennings - he joined their company, and all three went away talking together. I had known Griffiths before for three years; his name was Brooker three years ago, when we lived opposite each other.</p>

My master was called in, and he ran away; I pursued him as hard as I could, and took him opposite a hair-dresser's shop kept by Murrell, in Titchfield-street. He fell down there.

               <p>GRIFFITHS'S Defence. On the 1st of January a woman came and asked me for drink; I said I had no money, and told her I lived in John-street, New-road - she said she was going that way; she fell in company with another man, and they went into Adams's; they told me to stop at the door - I spoke to Ollive. When they came out I said that was going to be my woman - they treated me with gin; I should know the man again - it was not Jennings. On the Friday fortnight following I sold my ass for 14 s. in Smithfield, and the man paid me the 1 l. note. Jennings was not in my company when I went to buy the meat.</p>
               <p>JENNINGS'S Defence. I was going to Poland-street, and accidentally looked at the shop. I thought it was late, began to run; I never saw Griffiths in my life, and never was in the shop.</p>

            . I am a hosier, and live opposite Mr. Flint. Between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner and two others lurking about his window. I saw the prisoner very busy, went over, and saw it was cut. As I crossed the road the prisoner ran through Monument-yard - the others went away. I pursued, secured him in Pudding-lane, and found nine pair of silk gloves under his coat. I took him back; one of the boys met him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Halloo, Jem!"</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>DANIEL BOGGIS. I took the prisoner in charge; he said a gentleman gave them to him to carry to Tower Hill. I found a knife on him with the point broken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A sailor asked me to carry them to Tower Hill, and said if I was asked what I had got, I was to say nothing.</p>

            . I am a constable. I saw the prisoner and another man in Fish-street Hill. I saw him turn sharp round, and follow Mr. Ryder - about an inch and a half of his handkerchief was out of his pocket; they followed him into Lombard-street, and in Ball-alley I missed them - there are several turnings there. I caught sight of them in George-yard; they were then running from Mr. Ryder - the other man ran down an alley. I saw the prisoner tucking something down the arm of his coat, and asked Mr, Ryder if he missed his handkerchief? he said Yes. We pursued, and overtook the prisoner; he was very willing to be searched. Mr. Ryder found the handkerchief in his coat-sleeve.</p>

On the 26th of January the prosecutor came to inquire for him - he had not been home all night; he came home between ten and eleven o'clock that morning. I told him his master had been for him, and he had better go to him; he cried very much, and said he had got duplicates of the greatest part of the property. I took him to his master, and as we went up Shoe-lane he gave me eight duplicates in a piece of paper - they referred to Cotterrell's in Shoe-lane.</p>

The prisoner went forward, swore<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182002170019"/>at him, pushed him about, and struck him in the face.

I afterwards saw him come into the taproom alone; he had a glass of rum and water, which came to 6 d., and gave me a 1 l. note. I immediately took it to Mr. Lange, at the bar, and told him

               <p>LUDOWIG LANGE. I keep the house - the prisoner was there; Sinclair brought a 1 l. note out to pay for a glass of rum and water. The prisoner went out, returned in a few minutes, and came before the bar for his change. I asked him where he got the note? he said, over the water, and that he worked for a distiller. I said that it was forged; he gave me 1 s. in silver, and I returned him the note, having marked it with F; he was searched in my house about ten minutes afterwards, and some notes found on him. I sent for a constable, as I found I had another bad note, which I suspected Smith had passed, but he was gone.</p>

               <p>"I suspect you have some bad notes about you." I took him in front of the bar, searched him, and found a pocket-book in his waistcoat-pocket, containing five 1 l. notes. I asked him how he got them? he said he would sooner die under the stick (gallows) first, than tell me. Several people came into the watch-house, and among others a Mr. King. The prisoner said to him</p>
               <p>"You appear to be a gentleman, I'll tell you how I got them. I picked the pocket-book and notes up on Tower-hill this morning." Soon after Smith was brought in, charged with passing a bad note to Lange. He was telling me how he came by it, but the prisoner called through a hole, and said,</p>
               <p>"Smith, if you split I will burst you when you come in;" in consequence of which I took Smith to another watch-house. Next morning the prisoner said he did not know that he had the pocket-book, and if he had, somebody must have put it into his pocket.</p>

On the 22d of January, about two o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came and engaged a bed for the night - we open about that time - he went to bed. About a quarter of an hour after I went to see if my aunt's bed-room door was safe, and found the prisoner's door wide open. I suspected something, went into his room, and found him lying on the bed, with a pelisse and sheet wrapped round him; he was dressed. I asked him how he came by them? he said a coachman, who slept up stairs, gave them to him. I examined further, and found all the articles stated in the indictment concealed in his bosom and in his breeches. He was intoxicated. I was going to leave the room, he said he would go and shew me the man who gave them to him - I pushed him on the bed, shut the door, and gave the alarm; my aunt and one of the lodgers came up. We found he had escaped out of the window - the window was a little open when I first went into the room. The officers came directly, and traced his footmarks in the snow on the tiles, to the window of some back premises.</p>

               <p>"For God's sake let me in!" - he was at the window of a house in the court. I and Reeve went up Red Lion-court to the house - two women were terribly frightened on seeing him come in at the window. I went up stairs, and found the prisoner sitting in a chair under the window, with a great deal of blood about his person. I asked him how he could rob the people? he cried, and begged for mercy, and said another man gave him the things to bring down stairs. He appeared very much in liquor. I found a bolt broken off the closet door of Rickards's bedroom, where the property was stolen from.</p>

On the 21st of January, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner, I suppose, secreted himself in the workshop till the men were gone, and then forced his way into the dwelling-house by forcing a door open, which goes with a spring latch - it was forced with a screw-driver, there are the marks of it on the door. I know nothing of it, except that the property is mine.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Sadd. At night, when the men left work, I locked up the premises a few minutes after six o'clock; the prisoner was formerly a workman there, but not then - he was discharged about Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door between the shop and the house fast - A. Yes, my Lord; I shut it, and returned to the building between seven and eight o'clock that evening - I had occasion to go to the shop, and saw the counting-house door open, and the rushlight blown out, which I had left alight for Mr. Sadd, who was gone out to dinner. I went to the bottom of the stairs, and called out Master! twice, nobody answered. I went down stairs, got a light, and locked myself and another man in the building; went up stairs, across the workshop, through the counting-house to the street-door, and tried the street-door, which was fast. I had locked it in the afternoon, and given Mr. Sadd the key. On returning to go up stairs again, I discovered the prisoner in the passage, with a bundle, and his shoes in his hand. I asked him what he did there? immediately took hold of him, and said he should not go from me till I took him to a place of justice. I took him to the gates, and sent for Hawlks to assist me in taking him to the Compter. As he went along he threw a key away, a young man picked it up, and gave it to Hawlks; and as we crossed over to Giltspur-street he gave me another key. Hawlks took the bundle. It was between seven and eight o'clock at night - I fastened the doors at six.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you find the bundle on me - A. He stood alongside of it. Part was tied up, and part not tied - it was brought from up stairs into the passage.</p>

            . I am fellow-workman with Bynon - he sent to my lodgings for me. When I got out, I found he had got hold of the prisoner outside the shop-gates in Graystoke-place; he told me to go into the passage, and I should find a bundle; I went and saw it lying in the passage, partly tied up; I brought it out, went with him to Giltspur-street Compter. and delivered it to Brand there. I saw the prisoner lay a screw-driver on the table at the Compter, which I afterwards saw the officer try to the door, it seemed to fit the marks.</p>

            . I am a marshalsman. On the 21st of January, about eight o'clock at night, the prisoner was given into my charge with a bundle, containing the articles stated in the indictment - a screw-driver was given to me as coming from the prisoner. I then searched him, and found two small picklock keys, and a number of duplicates of other property. I then went to the premises, and found the door which goes out of the workshop into the dwelling-house had been forced by an instrument. I applied the screw-driver to the marks on the door-post, it appeared to correspond with them exactly. I went up stairs, and found that another door had been tried by the same instrument, but was not forced. The prisoner had given up two larger keys, which had been taken from some large locks in the counting-house; we tried them, and they fitted the locks in the counting-house. The two pieces of gingham were not in the bundle - I found them by the gate, apparently as if they had been dropped in coming out.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There are things in the bundle which were not there when I was at the Compter. I saw the door open, and went in, knowing the place; I stopped there sometime. The door was shut while I was in there. I went to the hall-door, intending to go out that way - two women, and other people, went in and out while I stopped.</p>

I said we would take the horse and cart and both go, but he persuaded me to go alone. I left him in care of the cart, and when I got there I could find no such name or number.

On the 25th of January, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop, and bought articles amounting to 2 s. 2 d., for which she offered me a 1 l. Bank note; on looking at it I saw it was forged, and immediately told her so. She said she did not know it, but she could change it from where she had it, and wished me to return it. I kept it, and asked her where she got it? I told her it was quite new, and had no writing on it. She said she would not tell me, but she got it honestly; at last she said she got it from a gentleman at No. 13, Seacoal-lane, whom she had picked up in the street, and he took her there, and gave her this pound note that evening. I asked her how she got her livelyhood? she said it was the first time she ever submitted to this, and that she worked as a shoebinder for Mr. Miller, in Skinner-street. She said she went into the front room on the first floor with the gentleman, and he paid 3 s. to the mistress of the house, for the use of the room, in addition to the pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give any other account of herself - A.She said she was married, and her husband's name was Turner, that he was a hackney coachman, and named the number that he drove, which I do not remember. I asked her where she lived? she said at No. 108, Saffron-hill, with her mother, whose name was Adams, and that her name was Adams. I said,</p>
               <p>"You told me you was married to Turner." She said he had deserted her, therefore she went by the name of Adams. I sent for Godfrey, who came, and I told him the note was offered to me, and I was sure it was bad; I gave it to him - the prisoner was close by. Previous to that she had called my wife to the back of the shop, and said she wanted to go into the yard; Godfrey stood at the counter with her - the shop door was open; we have a very strong light in the shop; about a dozen people were collected round the door. A boy rushed into the shop between her and Godfrey, and asked for a pennyworth of something? I said we had not got it, and he went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come in like a customer - A. No. He came in violently, and seemed to try to get between her and the constable. My wife proceeded to search her, but nothing was found on her, except 6 d. While we were searching her, immediately after the boy went out, a mob of fifty or a hundred persons collected, and broke my windows, so that I was obliged to shut up. We sent for several neighbours, and took her to the watch-house; she went quietly, but several of the mob called out,</p>
               <p>"Rescue!" As soon as the mob dispersed, I and the officer took her to Seacoal-lane.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182002170026"/>We said we came respecting a forged note which the prisoner said she had taken there that night of a gentleman; The woman said,</p>
               <p>"She has not been here, for I have only had a certain number of persons here to night, and I know them all." I said the prisoner said she had been taken into the room on the first floor. The woman said she was positive she had not, and asked her to describe the furniture? she did so, and the woman's answer was,</p>
               <p>"That description would have done very well nine months ago, but it is quite different now" - we waited some time to go into the room, but it was engaged. We took her to Mr. Miller's; the foreman recognized her person, and said he had seen her there some eight or nine months ago, and she had then been in the habit of bringing home work for a person who worked for them, but they knew nothing of her now. I then left her in the custody of Godfrey and another officer, to take her to Saffron-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. When you refused to give the note up, what did you do with it - A. I placed a weight upon it on the counter, and as soon as Godfrey came he marked it; it was never out of my sight till then - I saw him mark it - (looks at one) - this is it. My wife said, in her presence, that she found a memorandum on her. When she was at Seacoal-lane, she began to state the situation of the bed in the room, and said the furniture was a chintz pattern, and such a colour, and that the window-curtains were the same.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not send a boy with the note to a neighbour to see if it was good - A. No; I sent him for Godfrey, but the note was not out of my presence until Godfrey came and marked it; he then took it out to ask an opinion on it. The boy never touched the note.</p>

            , No. 108, Saffron-hill" - that she met a gentleman that evening, who took her to No. 13, Seacoal-lane, to the front room on the first floor, and paid 3 s. for the use of the room. She said she was a married woman. The prosecutor then stated that she had wanted to go backwards, and he wished her to be searched. We took her into the parlour, where Mrs. Harwood and I searched her, and found 6 d., with a written address on her.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that did any thing happen - A. While I stood with her at the counter, a boy rushed in in a violent way between me and the prisoner, though we stood very close together, he forced himself through. I suspected from his manner that he came for no good purpose, and put him on the other side of the woman - he asked for a pennyworth of something, Mr. Harwood did not serve him, and he went out. Before I searched her, I took the note out to a friend and shewed it to him - it was never out of my sight. I brought the same note back, and marked it then - I rather think I did not mark it till then - (looks at one) - this is it - it has my mark on it, and is the same note Harwood gave me. I did not give it to any person, nor did the prosecutor - it was not out of my sight till I marked it. After the boy left the shop a mob collected to a very great extent, and when we had nearly searched her I heard some glass break in front of the shop. Some neighbours came in; the prosecutor then shut up, and we took her out. I suspected an attempt to rescue would be made, and requested assistance. We went out of the private door - there was immediately a great groaning and hissing, and the mob pressed round me, but the neighbours came round me. The mob cried Rescue! we at last got her to the watch-house, sent for Worrall, another constable, and then took her to No. 13, Seacoal-lane; I there saw a female, and asked her if she had any knowledge of the prisoner? she looked at her, and said she thought she had seen her at that house. I asked her if she had seen her there that evening? she said she had not. The prisoner said she had been there with a gentleman - the woman persisted that she had not. The prisoner said she had been in the front room one pair of stairs; the woman said she had not been there that evening. I asked her to describe the room, as we could not have access to it - she said she thought she could describe it. I asked her what kind of a looking-glass there was? she said she could not tell. She said it was a fourpost bedstead, with chintz-pattern furniture, rather dark, and the window-curtains corresponded. The woman of the house said that might have been the state of the room sometime back, but now there were light curtains to the window. Finding we could not get access to the room we came away, and then took her to Miller's; she went in with great reluctance, I forced her in. Mr. Miller said he did not know her. A young man there looked at her, and after sometime seemed to recollect her - that she used to bring home work eight or nine months back, but he knew nothing of her now. She endeavoured to make herself known to him, by stating who she brought the work from - he then recollected her, and said it was eight or nine months back - we took her to the Compter. I went to Saffron-hill myself next morning, into the garret, as she said her mother lived in the garret. I found nobody at home in the garret, I then came down to the bottom of the house - it is a green-shop. I asked the man if he knew Adams? he said there was a woman of that name in the house, who had a daughter, but he thought she did not live with her mother, but she came backwards and forwards occasionally. The house is let out in tenements.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was not the note handed to several persons, and compared with two or three more - A. No, it was not - one note was taken from the till and compared with it; it was an older note than that, I had them both in my hand at the time. She did not ask me to go to Seacoal-lane, I suggested it. The note was not out of my sight till I marked it.</p>

            . I am a marshalsman. I was in Smithfield, and saw an immense mob turning the corner of Long-lane, and going towards the Compter. The prisoner was in custody, I found she was charged with passing a forged note. There were about one hundred and fifty persons round, some of whom were very active. One said</p>
               <p>"Go it!" another said,</p>
               <p>"It won't do now" - I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182002170027"/>disguised, they did not know me. At last they said,</p>
               <p>"Now go it! now is the time!" One of them lifted up this stick - (producing it) over his shoulder, he was close by Godfrey, and appeared in the act of going to strike him, I said,</p>
               <p>"It will not do, indeed!" I snatched the stick from him, and said,</p>
               <p>"I dare say you know me, and if you don't go you shall have it about your shins." They immediately dispersed.</p>

            . I am servant at No. 13, Seacoal-lane, and remember the officers and the prosecutor, bringing the prisoner to our house, between eight and nine o'clock, I think. The prisoner had not been at the house that evening, nor in the front room up one pair of stairs. She attempted to describe the furniture of the room - she at first said it was white, then she said,</p>
               <p>"I mean to say a white counterpane, and that the bed furniture was dark chintz, and the curtains the same." The furniture is a dark chintz-pattern, but the window curtains are a leopard-pattern, and quite light. About nine months ago they were nearly alike, any one might have made a mistake then, but they cannot now. I am certain she was not there that night. The room was engaged when they came. There is another servant, but I am the only one who receives the company, and shew them up stairs. I am certain I saw all the company that had been there that evening - I think there had been only four people. The persons who were in that room had been there from half-past five o'clock, and nobody but them had been in that room that day. The prisoner said she had been there at four o'clock, then she said it was after five, and then, that it was just before she went to Harwood's. She said there was no glass in the room, which there was. I think I saw her at the house some months ago.</p>

On the 29th of January, at a few minutes before or after nine o'clock at night, the prisoner came to my shop, and purchased a quarter of a hundred of herrings, which came to 2 s. 3 d., and tendered me a 1 l. note. I took it out of her hand, and on looking at it, I suspected it, by the face being so glossy. I asked her for her address? she said,</p>
               <p>"Jones, No. 25, White-street, back of St. George's church, Borough." I asked her where she got it from? she said from her husband, who was a coal-heaver, but she did not know who his master was. Her giving such an address, and her coming such a distance strengthened my suspicions, and I told her she could purchase herrings much cheaper nearer home; she said she wanted to get change to pay a person a few shillings. I told her to wait in the shop while I took it to a neighbour to ask if it was good. I left her with Mrs. Minto, and took it to a neighbour two doors off, and put it into his hand, but did not lose sight of it; he gave me back the same note, and returned with me - the prisoner was in the shop. I desired her to go into the parlour, then sent for Pike, the officer, who searched her, and found 1 s. 6 d. on her; I gave him the note, and he took it with her to the Compter. I went to the Compter directly after, and she there gave me her name as

            . I am a constable. On the 29th of January I was sent for, and found the prisoner at Minto's; they said she had uttered a forged note; Minto gave it to me, and said he suspected it. I did not like to take her into custody without being satisfied that it was forged, and took it to a person, who satisfied me that it was - it was not out of my sight. I kept it in my possession, wrapped in a piece of paper, until I delivered it to a young man at the Bank, who marked it in my presence; I saw him write my name on it. It is the same note I received from Minto.</p>

            . I am a potatoe merchant. Howis had a pair of scales in his shed; I went to borrow them of him, but he said he had sold them to a man, who wanted to sell them again, and took me to the prisoner's house. The man, whom I think was the prisoner, said they were not at home, and I borrowed some others.</p>

About half-past six o'clock, on the evening of the robbery, in consequence of an alarm given by Felstead, I went with him to Brooks's house - it was quite dark; the outer door was on the latch only.

I said they were going out at the window. I heard a noise at the window, and as I went out of the door Elliott came out of the window and fell on me - we both fell together; he got up and I followed; he tried to jump over the pales, but fell, and I fell on him.

            . I live in Harford-street, Shoreditch, and am a turner. I was passing Brooks's house between six and seven o'clock in the evening; Chowns said somebody was robbing the house. I went and called Hedges; we went to the house and found the door ajar. - I pushed it open, went in, and Hedges followed. As soon as I got in, two men came down stairs - one had a light in his hand; I said,</p>
               <p>"Here they are!" The prisoners immediately hurried up stairs; Hedges got the poker - the window was pushed up. He opened the door, went out, and I followed him; we pursued Elliott. and as I was following him Sermon turned back, and passed us - the place is no thoroughfare; he was running. I pursued him, crying Stop him! When he got to the top of the gardens, a man with a gun in his hand met him, and he fell down; he recovered himself, and made his way across Kingsland-road; I, with assistance, secured him there. I never lost sight of him after he ran by me; we took him into the King's Head, public-house - he said he had been rascally ill-used, and had lost a hat, and a silk handkerchief, and he would seek his recompence. I first saw him about twenty yards from the house. They ran down the gardens, which are no thoroughfare.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoners into custody; two hats were left behind - Sermon claimed one of them. Next day, at the office, a crow and a lanthorn were given to me. I produce an agreement, which Beasley picked up, and gave to me. I compared the marks on the box with the crow, and found it fitted them.</p>

I found a bag of pepper there, which appeared to have been cut open, and sewed up again. I weighed it - it weighed 2 cwt. 3 qr. 4 lb. I took the outer bag off, and found the inner one was cut and not sewed up again - it was marked MPR No. 53; the others were put on board the ship. Attwood delivered me 3 1/2 lbs. of pepper.</p>

On the 29th of January, about eight o'clock at night, I bolted my back door, fastened the window, went out, and double-locked the front door. I returned about a quarter before nine - on putting the key into the door it opened - I found Clark coming down stairs from my bedroom; I knew him before - he lived a few doors from me. I went into the parlour, found the drawers broken open, all my clothes taken out and put on the table - they were locked. I left a bunch of keys in one of the drawers, but one was broken open, as the key would not open it. Clark ran out, and was brought back soon after. I am sure he was the person. The other two were secured in my back yard by the officer - they all three lived in the neighbourhood with their parents. Pritchard lived next door, his mother worked for me, and he used to clean my knives - he knew the house. The articles stated in the indictment were on the table, except the spoon, which I have not found; it was in the tea-chest.</p>

            . I am constable of Stepney. I was fetched to the house, and found Clark there - somebody had brought him back. I went into the back yard, and found the kitchen window open, and a table under the window with footmarks on it - it was a dirty night. I took Clark to the watch-house, with the property. When I returned Catling brought the other prisoners to me. I found two knives in Wright's pocket; they were talking to each other when their friends were at the watch-house. They were neither threatened or promised, Wright said to Pritchard,</p>
               <p>"You broke the tea-chest open with this knife." Pritchard said,</p>
               <p>"No, it was not with that, it was with the other." I heard them say they took the tea-chest to Webb-square, broke it open as they went, and took the spoon out; that the man looked at it, said it was only brass, and threw it behind the grate; he would not buy the tea-chest.</p>

               <p>"I don't care." She had on a black silk gown, answering the description of one Mrs. Lee lost. I told her Mrs. Lee wanted her, and I wished somebody was near that I could give her in charge. I asked two soldiers to take her, they said they would have nothing to do with it. I followed her, and asked a gentleman where I could find a constable? he said at the Palace gate - one came immediately, but before he could get a sight of her she had escaped. She once lived in the family where I do, and I had heard of the robbery.</p>

She said she had sold the duplicate to a woman in Whitechapel, but she could not tell her name or residence.</p>

               <p>ELIZABETH MOORE. I am a single woman. At the latter end of November I lost my watch from my apartments in <placeName id="t18200217-69-crimeloc404">Upper Charlotte-street, Fitzroy-square</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18200217-69-crimeloc404" type="placeName"

I came out of Drury-lane Theatre, and on getting into a coach my foot slipped, the prisoner and another assisted me into the coach. They heard me tell the coachman to drive first to No. 6, Upper Rupert-street, Haymarket. I was not in my apartments two minutes before the prisoner and the other gentleman came up into my sitting-room; my watch was on the table. I went into the bed-room to take off my spencer, and the other gentleman followed me - I was not there two minutes, and returned to the sitting-room; I then shewed them both down stairs, returned into my room, and missed my watch. They had promised to return in half an hour. I did not see the prisoner again till the 13th of January, when I met him in Oxford-street. I knew him, got an officer, and took him up. I have not recovered my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you accuse him, in preference to the other man - A. I was in the sitting-room all the time the other was; he had no opportunity of taking it without my seeing him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. Q. You never saw either of them before - A. Never. I am not very often in the habit of seeing strangers. It was on a Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the house - A. It is an oyster-shop. The private door is always shut.</p>

            . I was in Oxford-street; the prosecutrix and another female came to me, and said two men had run round the corner, and one had stolen her watch. The prisoner was pointed out to me, with another person. I followed, stopped him, and said two ladies wanted to speak to him - the prisoner asked for what purpose? I said it was something respecting a watch. The prosecutrix came up and said,</p>
               <p>"This is the man who stole my watch!" I took him to Marlborough-street. He wished me to call on his friends - they said they would not come near him.</p>

            . On the 13th of January Mr. Dean brought the prisoner to Marlborough-street office. Moore charged him with stealing her watch at the latter end of November, he said he was not in England at the time, for he was just come from Gibraltar, and that a captain in the 64th regiment came home with him. I found a book on him - he said it was a journal which he kept, I found the last entry to be Yarmouth, the 19th of November, which proves he could not be at Gibraltar; I also found letters addressed to him in England before the robbery, in the name of G. T. Polack, Esq. R. N.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the prosecutrix fix on the day - A. She said it was on a Saturday, and mentioned the performance she had seen, and we found it was performed on the 27th of November, and on no other night in that month.</p>

I was standing in the shop, saw the prisoner come up to the door, take a shoe in each hand, and break it from the doorpost - they hung by a string inside the shop. I immediately pursued him down an alley adjoining the shop, and all round Prince's-square - I secured him without losing sight of him. The shoes were picked up close by him.</p>

On the 24th of January, between twelve and one o'clock at night, I heard a noise over-head, got up, opened the window, got out, and observed a man on the roof - I called to him to know his business, but got no answer. I saw the lead which covered the window ripped up from the gutter; the tiles were moved - the lead was not taken away. I saw two men running over the adjoining roof, I pursued them along Warwick-street, over ten houses, to the corner of Berwick-street; I there lost sight of them. I returned, dressed myself, and went and told the watchman. I went on the roof again and met Parker. A man ran from the window, which had been broken open after I was first on the roof - we pursued, but lost sight of him, but found a watchman on the roof had taken him. The nails were taken out of the lead; it was completely separated.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. How long before had you seen the lead safe - A. Not for six months. It was ripped up. I found a ripping chisel on the roof next morning.</p>

I found a man lying flat on his back, groaning, as if he had fell, it was the prisoner, Bywater - he had dropped from the scaffold of a house, which is partly built, at the corner of Berwick-street. I secured him, and asked what he did there? he made no answer.</p>

I had received them that day; I sat down to drink with the four prisoners on the first floor - I knew them all before; I was not sober, but sensible. I went to bed in the upper room alone, and put my pantaloons, with the money in the pockets, under the pillow. awoke about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, found my pantaloons on the bed, and my notes gone. I went down stairs, and the three women were sitting by the fire. I asked Burn where her father was? she said he was gone out. I said I had lost 29 l. and some silver - no answer was made. On Monday I saw three of the 1 l. notes in the possession of Seward.</p>

I went to bed between ten and eleven o'clock at night, and got up a little after seven in the morning. I opened the parlour door, and saw the papers laying about the room, on the table and the floor; there was a candle on the bar of the fire-grate, which was in the candlestick the over night - candle-grease was dropped on the papers and on the sideboard; a small drawer full of papers, in the sideboard, was broken open - the cellaret was also broken open. There was a round hole in the small drawer, which had been scooped out, and the cellaret-drawer was broken in front.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the plate - A. The four salts were in a drawer above the cellaret, which was not locked; a silver sugar-bason and tongs were taken from a cupboard in the cellaret, which was not locked; a pair of plated candlesticks, and a bed-side candlestick were taken off the table; a pair of decanters, two stoppers of other decanters, a table-cloth, and a small and large pair of snuffers - also a small taper-stand off the chimney-piece. I went and called my master up.</p>
               <p>Q. How had the thieves entered the room - A. A square hole had been cut in the outside shutter that contained two small bolts, which fastened the sash - they were forced. The window was not broken; every thing was safe the night before - it was getting light when I arose. I was about a quarter of an hour coming down stairs. It must have taken some time to force all these places.</p>

            , ESQ. I rent the house, which is in the parish of Fulham. The servant called me up, upon which I immediately went down, and found every thing in confusion in the parlour; I was the last person there the night before, except the servant - the drawers were locked, and all things safe and in order. In the morning the papers were all scattered about - I missed the articles stated in the inditment - sixteen or eighteen holes were cut in the shutter by a centre-bit, and all broken out into a square hole. A candle was left on the grate, which appeared to have been burnt, from the quantity of grease that was laying about the grate, and my papers were covered with grease - I gave information to Pople. I have since seen a pair of steel snuffers, on the Monday, which I knew to be mine - they were in a drawer of the sideboard over night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Pople apply the centre-bit to the holes in the shutter - A. Yes; it did not fit them - it was applied to the holes in the drawer of the sideboard, but did not fit. A crow-bar was produced, which exactly fitted the holes in the sideboard - it was of a particular shape, and fitted the impression exactly. To the impression of different parts of the drawer and the window, a chisel was also applied, but I cannot speak to that.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. On Sunday morning the 30th of January, Mr. Wyllie applied to me. I went to his house, and examined it. The window-shutter was bored with a centre-bit, and the piece broken out, sufficiently to let a hand in to undo the bolt; I suppose twelve or fourteen holes were bored in it - it would take two or three minutes to do it. After the shutter was opened the sash was forced up by some instrument, apparently by a crow-bar, and the fastening broken. I examined the sideboard in the parlour, and in the middle drawer there was a hole made with a centre-bit, so as to get the bolt of the lock back, and two other drawers appeared to be forced open with a crowbar. I found a piece of printed paper in the room which smelt very strong of tinder, and on this paper was printed</p>
               <p>"Keech, coffee-warehouse, Stretton-ground, Westminster."</p>
               <p>Q. Was the breaking effected by clumsy thieves or not - A. By old thieves, in my judgment. The same afternoon I received information, went to the Bell, public-house, Old Pye-street, Westminster, with

I knew them to be his lodgings by having frequently been there to him - it is the first room on the right-hand side of the ground floor. The following day I was not satisfied with my brother's search, went there myself, and in the table-drawer of the room I found a centre-bit, and in the cupboard I found a tobacco-box full of tinder.

I searched, and found a pair of steel snuffers there, hanging on a nail in the room - a girl whom he cohabited with was there; I am confident they were not in sight when I was there the night before - the prosecutor claimed them. An iron chisel was found there; my brother afterwards produced a crow-bar to me. I went to the house, and compared the centre-bit with the marks on the shutter and sideboard, but they were rather larger than the instrument. The crow-bar fitted as exactly as possible with the marks on the cellaret.</p>

On Saturday night, the 29th of January, I was at the Bull, Stamford Bridge, and saw the prisoners there, about half-past nine, or a quarter before ten o'clock. I knew them quite well before. I called for a pint of porter - they asked me to drink with them; I did so, and put my pint to their pot. They then said they were going on a crack, and shewed me a chisel and a crow-bar, like those produced. I noticed it being broken at the end - it is the same.

               <p>Q. What makes you certain of it - A. There was a poor man, who was discharged from the Guards, came in with pies to sell about a quarter before nine o'clock, and a person for mischief knocked his tins over, and about sixpenny worth of his pies were thrown down. There was a subscription to defray the expence, and the prisoner, George, subscribed. I think Mitcham was there.</p>
               <p>Q. How should you know Bird was there any more than Mitcham - A. It was partly the prisoner's fault that the pies were kicked down. I was very much displeased at it, and spoke crossly to Bird about it.</p>
               <p>Q. If Mitcham was there he must have heard it - Yes. I spoke very high. The prisoner subscribed 2 d. The poor man comes in every night. I did not mention this to him. I can prove nothing more than up to nine o'clock, for I had company in the parlour, and particularly attended to them.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What time did you shut up - A. A little before twelve o'clock. I do not know when Huish went away. Several men were in company with Bird; one was named Hall. The company all left of their own accord. I do not remember seeing Bird after nine o'clock. I paid more attention to the parlour than to them. A man, who is here, brings oysters in every night.</p>

            . I lodge in New Tothil-street. On Saturday, the 29th of January, I was mending a pair of boots for the landlord of the Wheatsheaf; he gave them to me about four o'clock that afternoon - I live next door to him. I went in again at eight o'clock, and saw

               <p>Q. Did he scold anybody that night - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did anything happen about nine o'clock - A. A man asked the pieman for a pie; he wanted the money first - some words occurred between them, and he knocked his tin down. The landlord said it was a shame; he did not speak to Bird in particular. I think I left the house before Bird.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you told to come here - A. On Wednesday a man wanted me to go to Queen-square on the Monday following; and about ten days ago a woman subpoened me.</p>

The pieman stood in the centre of the taproom when his pies were knocked down. The man asked me to buy some of his broken pies, but I would not. I did not see the man knock them down - the men in the opposite seat bought them. I think I saw a dozen pies on the ground. The landlord was in and out, attending to his customers.

I fastened up the house between six and seven o'clock at night; all the doors and windows were secured. At two o'clock in the morning the watchman gave an alarm, I awoke, came down, and saw two men in the wash-house and brewhouse; they could not have got in without breaking the fastenings of the house - three doors were broken open. Dalton secured both the men - one was standing up, and the other lying down; we kept them in the house<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182002170040"/>- the prisoner was one whom we kept in custody; I never saw him before.

               <p>Q. After you secured the prisoner, did you discover how the house had been entered - A. The door leading from the cow-house into the yard was entirely forced down - they had broken another door before they could get into the brewhouse, where we secured them. I found a bundle, which was left on the copper the over-night, was moved into the brewhouse; a collar, and hames and traces were moved - they hung up over a door which leads from the cowhouse to the brewhouse; that door was nailed up; they had broken the boards down, and took the collar and harness off the peg. My jacket hung at the foot of the ladder where I go up to bed - I found it lying on the floor in the same room, about three yards from where it hung. Mr. Baily's drawers were moved off the copper.</p>

            . I live in Wilsden parish and rent the house. Herridge fastened the doors. I was called up in the night; I went with Herridge, and found the prisoner in the middle of the wash-house - he could not have got there a without breaking three boards, which was originally a doorway - they were pulled down between the cowhouse and brewhouse - they were safe overnight; it would take considerable force to remove them. I struck a light, as it was quite dark; I then asked the prisoner, Bolton, where his companion was? he said he was lying in one corner of the room - I found him lying there, and kept them in custody there till seven o'clock, then sent for the constable, and conveyed them to the round-house. The collar, traces, and drawers were moved from where they were the over-night. The cow-house joins the dwelling-house, and is part of it.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Wilsden; I go round these premises every half hour. At half-past eleven o'clock every door was safe and fast. I went again rather before two, having seen two men of suspicious appearance go in a direction towards Baily's. When I went into the yard I found the boards pulled flat down to the ground where the doorway was. I went round to the other door, which goes into the house, and found that open - they could not get at that without forcing the boards down. I sprang my rattle, went in, and found the prisoner there; I kept him in custody till the servant came down. I found a tall young man lying by the side of a truss of hay - I secured him, and took them both to the round-house at seven o'clock in the morning, and the same night I heard they had escaped; I afterwards saw the prisoner in custody at Bow-street, and am certain he is the man. They were both sober.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any particular reason for remembering that day - A. Yes, I wear out a great many shoes, and the last pair I bought I put the date in them to see how long they would last. I bought them on the 25th, and put them on the 26th.</p>

About two o'clock my daughter heard a noise; I went up, found the window open, and missed them; there is a gate in the back garden, which was not fastened. My daughter rose an alarm, and the prisoner was brought back with the candlesticks, but not the spoon.</p>

            . I am a milkman. I was near to the prosecutrix's house, talking to a man; a little girl came out, and said they had been robbed. I ran and secured the prisoner about a quarter of a mile off, and told him he had the candlesticks; he said he had not. I found them in his bag. Three others were with him, who ran away - his bag contained hearth-stones.</p>

On Saturday, the 11th of September, the prisoner came to the shop with an interpreter, and desired to see some spoons and forks, and two gold watches; he said he would not decide on them; I saw him again on Monday with a fresh interpreter, when he desired to see the spoons and forks he had seen on Saturday; he fixed on them, and desired to see some plated goods, saying he was going to housekeeping, and could not afford silver. He ordered a sugar-bason, milk-pot, and a gold watch, chain, seal, and key, in all they came to 54 l. He then asked to see some gold watches, and I produced the two he had seen; he said he did not understand watches, but if I would send them to his lodgings, No. 6, Frith-street, he had a friend there, and he would determine which he would take. I took them myself in about an hour, and saw him with the interpreter; I put them on the table. He asked, through the interpreter, if I would allow him to take the watches to a friend in the next room? I said,</p>
               <p>"Certainly," and gave them to him. As soon as he left the room the interpreter asked me if I knew him? I said No - he never returned. I inquired, and found he had escaped out of the house; I did not see him again until the 2d of December, when I apprehended him at Bath. I found one watch in pledge at Bath, and saw the other at Bow-street; I should not have parted with them without the money. He had ordered the spoons and forks to be engraved.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 16th of January, about ten o'clock, Spendlove fetched me to the Duke of Wellington, public-house, in Crawford-street, where I saw the prisoners - they appeared confused. Shaw took a bundle off the table, and said he must go; I asked him what he had got there? he said he had got dirty linen. I pulled it from him, opened it, and found it was a blue seat-cloth. He said Grantham gave it to him; he denied knowing any thing about it, but at last said,</p>
               <p>"To cut the matter short I'll tell you how I got it; it is Messrs. Thrupps' property, and came out of their premises, but I did not take it." I gave him in charge of Wales, accompanied him to Shaw's lodgings, and found some pieces of leather, and two wrenches like those that are used at our shop. We then went to Grantham's, and found two seat-cloths under the bedstead, and part of a chaise head-lining.</p>

            . I am a dealer in harness. I met Shaw; he asked me if I did not live in South-street? I said I now lived in Crawford-street. He said he knew a man who had a hammer-cloth to sell, and he would bring it to-morrow - he said he worked at Thrupp's. On Sunday morning, about nine o'clock, he brought one, tied up in an apron; he said it belonged to another man, and he was to have 30 s. for it - I offered him 1 l.; he was to let me know in an hour. I locked it up, and gave information to Mr. Thrupp. I returned, and found both the prisoners at the door. Grantham said the hammer-cloth belonged to him. I told them to go to the Wellington, public-house, and I would be with them. I fetched Attfield, and we went together.</p>

As soon as Walters saw me, he ran up and seized Edmonds, saying,</p>
               <p>"This is him!" I went up, seized them both, and brought them back to the shop - I gave them in charge. The print was in the shop five minutes before, by the door.</p>

               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. On the 8th of February the prisoner came into the Lebeck's Head, public-house, Shadwell, and had something to drink. I was in the bar; he took me for the landlord, and asked me for a lodging. He seemed rather intoxicated, and had a chest with him. I asked him where he came from? he said from the Sussex frigate. I told him there was no such ship, and asked him where he brought the chest from? he said from Gravesend, and was very tired. It did not look like a seaman's chest, which arose my suspicion. I looked at his hands, and said he was no sailor. I went to examine the chest, he wished me not to do it, and said it was his daughter's, and he was moving it from her place of service. I secured him - he struggled, and threw two duplicates from his left hand, which were picked up and given to me. He cried, and said he was very sorry, he had done wrong, and that he was sent by a young woman in Tash-court to fetch a chest and box from Peckham, and that he took it to Deptford, broke it open, and pledged some of the things. I fetched the prosecutrix, she claimed the things, and missed several. He said he had left the second box at Greenwich, after it was broken to pieces - I went and found it there.</p>

On the 24th of January, about eight o'clock at night, I found the prisoners standing under the wall of the house, and the three pieces of timber close by them. They both said they were employed by Mr. Watts to take it to his timber-yard in Old Gravel-lane; I knew no such place, and secured them. I took them to Old Gravel-lane, but they could not point it out - the prosecutor claimed the timber. Another man went away; they said they did not know him.</p>

On the 26th of July, (which was the first day of West End fair) between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was collecting money from different gates.

I received a blow from Henley over my hat, which cut my hat and head. He said,</p>
               <p>"You b - g - r, how are you off for old iron! Do you want to transport another man for stealing iron?" - the blow stunned me. Before I could lift my hat up they all got out of the cart, and hustled and throttled me, so that I was almost choaked; I felt them pulling my watch, but they could not get it out. Barrat and the prisoner took hold of me by my neck-handkerchief; I had 320 l. in my pocket, and put my hand there to secure it. My hand was cut by some sharp instrument - I have the mark of it now; it was either Barratt or the prisoner who did it. Some people came to my assistance, and they all got into the cart, and drove off towards the fair. I saw the prisoner and Barratt next day, and seized the prisoner, but he got from me. I did not see him again until the 9th of this month, when he was taken.</p>

            . I am an officer. About a quarter before twelve o'clock I was returning from duty down George-street, heard a man call watch, and saw the three prisoners running down on the opposite side of the way; I and Gill ran after them, they crossed, turned towards me, and stopped - each had a hat in his hand besides what he wore; they made a momentary stand, and Weedon said he could or would have had the old b - g - r's shoes. I seized them, and asked them how they came by those three hats, Weedon said,</p>
               <p>"That is nothing to you, let me go." He used bad language, said he knew who we were, and he would not be taken by any bl - dy patrol. I said I should insist on knowing how they got the hats, he said</p>
               <p>"What hat?" and immediately dropped his behind him. We secured them. The hats all appeared to belong to poor people. Wormwood had the prosecutor's - Weedon had two handkerchiefs, and a shawl. On his way to the watch-house he said he would cut his throat, and so I took a knife from him. I found the prosecutor about two hundred yards off - he was sober, and so were the prisoners.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I was in High-street, St. Giles's, and saw the prisoner following Edwards; he pulled the handkerchief a little way out - he pulled it three times between High-street and Coventry-street, Haymarket, and in Coventry-street he went up very close. I saw him cross the street, and secured him with the handkerchief in his hand.</p>

On the 15th of January, about six o'clock in the evening, I saw eight drays go through the London Apprentice gate, and soon after I met the prisoner and another in Kingsland-road - the other gave the rope to the prisoner; I turned and followed them, the prisoner then dropped it. I secured him, and the other ran away. They were in company.</p>

I secured Say, and in his apron I found some iron railings. He said he found it, and afterwards that he had it given to him; he dropped it, and said,</p>
               <p>"If I am to go to the watch-house, I won't carry the iron" - they were all together in the field. I am sure Snook was one of them. I found another piece of iron in the garden.</p>

I saw the prisoner sitting by the fire, but did not recollect her then. Next night I went with Dickenson and took her. I do not think I was in liquor.</p>

            . My husband is a porter, and rents the house; the prisoner lodged in a room with a woman to whom I let it. The night the prosecutor lost his watch she had been nursing my child, then went out, and did not come home until after the loss - I was confined to my bed at the time. When he came into my room she asked him if he should know the girl again? he said he thought he should if he saw her. Since the prisoner has been confined, the prosecutor came, and offered me a 1 l. note to find out the right girl. He was very much intoxicated.</p>

Morris came in about ten minutes after, looked about, and said nothing - I was in the counting-house; he called to Wooller, who came and snatched the pot up.

            . I was in the house when the prosecutor was robbed. I went out for a necessary purpose, Roach was outside the house; he said the two men had a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182002170052"/>watch, and he would have it from them. Welch was afterwards given in charge for stealing it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you tell this story - A. Not till nine days after. I told Welch's servant of it, and she told his brother. After Welch was taken to the watch-house the prisoner and I walked home together. He took the watch out of his pocket, shewed it to me, and said it was the watch he took from the two men - I made no answer. He went to the bar for some tobacco while the prosecutor was there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is Welch here - A. No. I lodged with him nine months ago. I was in the house when he was charged with stealing it, but said nothing for nine days after.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you not say to Welch's servant,</p>

            . For some time we had missed wine, and in the course of five days we found the stock eighty-five bottles less than had been sold. On the 3d of February I received information, and went down to the warehouse about twenty minutes after nine o'clock, when the men ought to be at breakfast. I found one half of the beer-cellar flap, which opens into the street, open - they ought both to have been down. I called out,</p>
               <p>"Below! Who's there?" After a moment's hesitation, the prisoner said he was. I went down, and at the bottom of the beer-cellar stairs, on the right-hand side, is the door of the wine-vault, which I found forced open by the hinges. Thinking somebody else was there I told the prisoner to go up; I went up with him, and put down both the flaps. When the cellarman came, I told him, and desired him to keep the prisoner in the cellar till I got an officer, but he let him go, and told me he had run into the mill next to my premises. I followed him, brought him back, and put my hand to his pocket; I felt something hard, and told the cellarman to search him. Finding me determined, he pulled a bottle of Port wine out of each pocket - it was drawn out of a pipe I had. I charged him with robbing me; he made no answer, but presently after he took two more bottles from the ground, which were, uncorked, and dashed them into a tub of water - they were on the ground in the beer-cellar, not in the wine-vault; no wine ought to have been there. I took the bottles out; they both had wine left in them. I gave him in charge, and desired them to search the beer-cellar. The cellar-man said, in his presence, that there were two more bottles at the end of the beer-cellar. The prisoner was my servant, but had no business there at that time.</p>

            . I am cellarman to Mr. Hill. On the 5th of February, about nine o'clock in the morning, I went to breakfast, and left the cellar quite secure. I shut both the flaps, barred them, and put the keys in the counting-house. I returned about half-past nine o'clock, and found it open, went to the wine-vault, and found the hinges off the hooks, and the door broken open. There was a pipe of Port on the draught - I had left no wine in bottles, except three that were uncorked; the prisoner went into the wine-vault with me, and my master told me to secure him. I observed his pockets bulky; he went to the mill for water, but I followed, and brought him back. My master told me to search his pockets, but he said,</p>
               <p>"That is more than you or any man dare to do." I said,</p>
               <p>"If you have got any thing in your pockets, deliver it up." He took two bottles of wine out, one corked and the other uncorked. I sealed them, corked them both, and gave them to Mr. Hill; it is the same sort of wine that was in the pipe. I asked him what induced him to do such a thing? he said he did not know. He said there were two more, and he wished me to take them away, or throw them down, but I did not touch them; he took them up, and put them into the water - Mr. Hill took them out. He said there were two more bottles behind the prickles, and I found them there. I found another bottle of wine with the seal partly cut off.</p>

            . I am watchman of St. Marylebone. On the 28th of January, about twenty minutes past six o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner go along my beat, from the prosecutor's premises, with the timber on his shoulder. I stopped him, and asked him where he came from, and where he was going to? he would not answer, but walked on as fast as he could. I laid hold of him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Throw it down, I will see what it is!" It was laid in a sack, entirely covered over. He said,</p>
               <p>"Let me go," and resisted very violently. He escaped after I had torn his jacket; he was secured about half a mile off. I sent him to the watch-house, and took the timber to Hall. I saw him getting over the wall of the premises.</p>

I asked him where she lived? he said if I went with him he would shew me. As we went along he said a man met him in Holborn, and gave him 6 d. to carry it to the Three Cups, in Aldersgate-street, where it was to be booked to go into the country, and that the man who gave it to him ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where Mrs. Lane lived - A. No, my Lord, nor did he know who it was to be booked to. I opened the box, and found two letters in it, by which I found out the prosecutrix.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Laystall-street. On the 5th of February, about twenty minutes after twelve o'clock at night, the prisoner came into my room with two blankets, and asked if I would let her leave them till Monday morning, saying, she had taken them out to pledge to pay her rent, that her husband had been severely beating her, and she was afraid to go home, and asked me if I would let her lay on my boards, and wrap herself in the blankets? I said she should lay on my child's bed, which she did. In the morning she went away, leaving the blankets, and in the evening she came, again, and asked me to put them out of the way? I asked her if they were her own? She said Yes, but she was till afraid of her husband, for he was angry with her. On the Monday she did not come. I heard of this robbery, and applied to the police - the prosecutor claimed them.</p>

            ; we live in Carburton-street, Fitzroy-square. On the 5th of February, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was going to Barnet - I was too late for the stage, and waited at the Bell, public-house, at Pentonville, for a stage to pass. An elderly woman was with me, who assisted in carrying my bundle, which contained the articles stated in the indictment. She called for two pots of beer, which made me angry with her - the prisoner, Yates, was in the taproom, and offered to carry my bundle to Islington for 1 s.; the woman of the house wanted me to leave it there, but I took it away myself. When I got to the door Yates took it from me to carry it - another young man was with him (not Liversedge). We went to the Peacock, at <placeName id="t18200217-154-crimeloc893">Islington</placeName>

               <p>"Now, young man, give me my bundle." He said,</p>
               <p>"There will be a mail up in a few minutes, and I will give it you then." We then went on to the turnpike - Liversedge told me to run into the <placeName id="t18200217-154-crimeloc894">toll-house</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18200217-154-crimeloc894" type="placeName" value="toll-house"/>

I was not a moment talking to the man, when I returned they were gone with the bundle. A little girl said they were gone into the Swan, public-house, just by - I went there, and saw Liversedge in the taproom. I asked him what he had done with my bundle? he used most gross language. I said I wished I could get a constable - one came, and took him. The landlord said I must be mistaken, for he had not been out of the house, but I am sure he is the man. I described Yates to Purton; he took him on the Thursday following, and produced my bundle; several things had been taken out.</p>

               <p>- HICKS. I am landlord of the Bell, at Battle-bridge. The prosecutrix was at my house. I do not think she was capable of knowing what she was about - she was very much intoxicated. I do not know whether she had a bundle or not.</p>

I got off the cart for a necessary purpose; the prisoner and two others came up to the near side of the cart; the prisoner asked me the way to Manchester-square, and kept shoving me from the scraper of the cart towards the wheel - the other two went round to the off side of the cart. I told him to go up Coventry-street. I missed a piece of cloth immediately they were gone from the off side, and saw them all going up Whitcombe-court with another man. The three ran, the prisoner stopped behind and struck me; I secured him, dragged him to a public-house, and then put him into my cart, drove him home, and gave him in charge. I think I saw the cloth with them.</p>
               <p>Q, Who was the first that pushed you - A. The prisoner - he pushed me against the wheel; there was plenty of room for him to pass; they came in a direction to meet the cart. I saw the prisoner speaking to them in the court; the prisoner was running away with them. He stopped, and would not let me pass to secure the men with the property. The court is just wide enough for one person to go through.</p>

I heard Reynolds ask him what he wanted for it? he said five farthings a pound; Reynolds offered him a farthing, and I took him into custody. He then said he himself was a dealer in marine-stores, and lived in Arthur-street, King's-road. I found he lodged there, at the back of the premises where the iron was stolen from, and kept no shop.

He was entrusted with the keys of the shop, and coal storeroom, in which was a quantity of copper and iron tubes, about which a dispute had arisen, and they were put there till it was determined - he had no business to move them. In consequence of something I and Maggs watched the premises. On the 10th of February, as the watchman was going past four o'clock, the prisoner entered the premises with a candle in his hand, went into the shop, and unlocked the door. I entered the manufactory. I could hear him filling a hamper with coals, which he brought out, and went to the passage door - we could see him go home; he returned in a few minutes, and from a different place in the yard collected a vast quantity of iron in heaps, took one lot of it, and went off the premises with it. We then went to the bottom of the stairs - he came and took another load in his leather apron, and we seized him with it as he was going out at the door; we gave him in charge. He had about 50 lbs. of iron then.</p>

On the 9th of February I was sitting by the kitchen fire, the prisoner and another boy came down the area, and knocked at the door. I opened it - the boy who has escaped, asked me to buy a bonnet box - he had two - they stood on the step. I asked him how much they were, he asked 1 s. 6 d. I offered him 1 s. 2 d.; the prisoner said take it. I went across the kitchen for the money, and on my return I found the prisoner at the dresser; he put the box on the dresser, and behind the box, on the shelf, was the silver pepper box - the other remained at the door; the prisoner took the pepper-box. I heard him say to the boy,</p>
               <p>"You go, and I'll take the money." I saw him hand the pepper-box to the boy. I said,</p>
               <p>"You have given the boy the pepper-box" -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182002170059"/>the boy ran away. I hallooed out, and ran up the area-steps, but was so frightened I could go no further, I came down the steps and stopped the prisoner; he said,</p>
               <p>"Don't be frightened." I called out, and two of our men came down and took him. He said,</p>
               <p>"Don't be frightened, and I'll tell you all about it. The boy told me to go in, for there was plate about, and I did take it and gave it to him - you will be sure to have it again. His name is John Hall, he lives at the corner of Sander's gardens - if you will go at twelve o'clock at night, and ring the bell twice, you will find him there."</p>
