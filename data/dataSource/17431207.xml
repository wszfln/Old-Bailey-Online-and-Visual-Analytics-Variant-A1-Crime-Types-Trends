My Wife said she had her Diamond Ear-Rings; the Prisoner asked her if they were worth 20 s. she said they were worth a great deal more: My Wife gave the Ear-Rings into her Hand; the Prisoner asked her if she had got any Salt; my Wife gave her some, and the Prisoner wrapped the Ear-Rings up in a piece of Paper with the Salt; the Prisoner at the Bar said I must not be there, for if I staid it would spoil the Thing, for it was my Wife's good Fortune and not mine; for by Virtue of this the Stones were to rise in the Cellar, and the Treasure would appear; so I went into the Shop, and left them by themselves: My Wife came into the Shop, and told me she believed the Prisoner had a mind to steal her Ear-Rings. The Prisoner told me, my Wife was troubled with an evil Sprit, and had no Faith; and that she thought there was something more than ordinary the Matter with her; and she told my Wife, that she seemed mistrustful, and that because she was mistrustful the Planet would be spoiled. I saw her slip the Ear-Rings away, and I thought that she had changed the Packet ; upon that, I immediately seized hold of the Prisoner's Hand; and in the Paper instead of my Wife's Ear-Rings there was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174312070003"/> a pair of brass Buttons; and in the struggling one of the Ear-Rings dropped down, and the other I found between her Finger and Thumb.

            . The first Time the Prisoner came I was at the Door, and there was a Quarrel in the Street facing our House; the Prisoner said to me, what Quarrel is that, Madam? said I, I cannot tell, I know nothing of it: She asked me if I had any old Clothes to sell; I told her no. Says she, you have a lucky Planet in your Face, I will tell you your Fortune: I said come in; she asked for some Coffee, but I had none; so she said she had a Law Suit depending, and she must make an end of it; that she could not stay then, but would come another Day; and when she came she made me say, In the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, that I would do all that she proposed to me. She asked me if I had any Paper that was never wrote on; I told her I had; I fetched her a Sheet, and she divided it into three Parts. She asked me for some Salt; I fetched some Salt, and she said by the Virtue of that Salt the Mould was to rise in the Cellar, and the Money was to come up. I cannot tell the Sum of Guineas she mentioned to my Husband, besides broad Pieces, and Silver; then she asked me if I had got the 20s. that I told her I would get against that Day. She made me make that Bargain with her before, but I did not intend to give her the 20 s. She asked me if I had the Value of 20 s. about me; I told her I had a good deal more; that I had a pair of Diamond Ear-Rings; she asked me how much they were worth; I told her they cost me 3 Guineas; then she said, In the Name of the Almighty God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, put them into this Paper, and then she said, God Almighty prosper what we are a going upon: Then she asked if I could say the Lord's Prayer, and said I must fall down on my Knees and say the Lord's Prayer three Times over, and by Virtue of this the Mould in the Cellar was to rise, and I should find the Treasure. I stepped out and told my Husband, that I had a Fancy the Woman wanted to steal my Ear-Rings, so he bored a Hole through the Door to watch her, and if he found I could not deal with her, he was to help me: She had the Ear-Rings in a Paper, I looked at her and saw her slip them away, and I thought changed the Parcel: They were to be tied up in this Handkerchief, and I was to swear that I would not open the Handkerchief before she came again; my Husband seized hold of her Hand, gave me a Paper, and said to me, look what you have got there, and in the Paper there was a pair of brass Buttons; when my Husband seized hold of her Hand, he said my Wife's Diamond Ear-Rings are here; she denied it, spoke a great many scandalous Things, and swore and cursed very much; but in the Skirmish one of the Ear-Rings fell down and broke in two, and the other he took in her Hand.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner owned she had been there three Times, denied that she knew any thing of the Ear-Rings, that he must force the Ear-Rings upon her, in order to charge her with the Robbery. <rs id="t17431207-1-verdict6" type="verdictDescription">

I am a Chairman; I was plying in the Rose Passage , where we commonly ply, and I heard Captain Murray cry out Stop Thief; the Prisoner run up against me, and almost stopped himself by it: The Captain came up, drew his Sword, and the Prisoner was pushed into the Rose Tavern Kitchen, and carried to the Round-House. Mr. Gray received a Blow on the Eye with a Brickbat, though we had the Guard of the Play-house: There were some hundreds of Stones and Brickbats seen lying there the next Morning: They flew so that People thought the Gentleman would have had his Brains beat out.</p>

One of them threw a Handkerchief over my Eyes, and stopped my Mouth: They took away from me three Shillings in Silver, and the Half-pence (which I had taken that Night for Letters ) which might be about four Shillings more. One of them called to the other to cut my Throat; I thought that was frightful enough - They did not take the seven Shillings all at once, they came to me a second Time, and then they took the Pouch and the rest of the Money - I gave it out that I was robbed, and understood that one of them had made himself an Evidence, and that

On the 13th of November last, I was on horseback upon the Road, and about two Miles on this Side Southall , the Prisoner passed by me; I observed in him what is not very common in Travellers, he took too much Notice of my Horse, and asked several impertinent Questions: Said he, is not your Master a Lawyer? I said, yes; said he, and you are a Welshman? Yes, said I; we had a great deal of Discourse, he went a Mile and an half with me, and all on a sudden I lost him. I was making a Toast at Southall , and the Coach stopped at the Door, I believe my Master (Mr. Potter) came in first; I saw the Ladies crying, and they were complaining of being robbed; said I, was it by a Man in a great Coat, and a dark cropt Horse? They said, yes: When I came to Chashunt , a Quaker told me, he heard the Person who had robbed the Coach in the Morning had been pursuing it again, and that he was in the Town; in the mean Time the Prisoner coming riding by, said I, There's the Man; he had changed his Dress; at the Time he rode through the Town he was in the Dress he is now,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174312070009"/> with a black Cap on, and when he committed the Robbery, he was in a great Coat, and had on an old Hat. I believe net worth six Pence: I was ordered and pursue him; I went by myself Mile, when I came to Wickmore-Hill, about four Miles from Heathcomb, and four from Missinglam, I that a Gentleman on Horseback had fell down and hurt himself, and was gone into a House on the Common; said I, he is a Highwayman to a Girl said sure that could not be, for like a Gentleman; I changed my took a Pistol under my Coat, and one took a Gun, which I believe had not for two or three Years; we went to the House, which pretended to call for some Beer; he was in the Yard, hold of him, and said, he was my and the Butcher, who had the Gun, said, if he made an Opposition, he would blow out; in his Coat Pockets were a brace of Pistol, one was charged with Powder and Ball, and the other with Powder only; I persuaded him to come to Missingham, he begged very much that I would let him go, for he said, if he came to London, he was sure he should die; I got him away as soon as I could; I set him upon his Horse, with his Whip in his Hand, and he went along with me very quietly.</p>
               <p>Q. What without tying him?</p>
               <p>Pugh. Yes - I knew with the Horse he was upon that he could not ride away from me: When I got him to Missingham , he begged very hard to speak to the Gentlemen he robbed in the Coach; I took him into the Room to them, he fell down on his Knees, and asked their Pardon; he sai d he had lost a hundred Pounds the Night before at my Lady Mordington's , and that it was the first Fact that ever he committed.</p>
               <p>- Holland. I have known the Prisoner from his Birth; he was put Apprentice to a Shoemaker, and was a Trooper or Dragoon in the Horse Service; he had a good Character in the Country.</p>

(a King's Watchman) The Prisoner was employed by a Merchant to watch a Lighter of Sugar, I saw him come out of the Skuttle Hole with a Bundle; I asked him what he had got there; he said his Bed; I thought it was too little for a Bed, and it proved to be Sugar: I went down to the Lighter, and found a Hogshead broke open; I believe this to be part of it.</p>

There was one Harris who kept her Company, but is gone off, said to her, You will come to be hanged for this Practice. Oh! says she, I am not afraid of that by Jesus God, as that is their Irish way of talking.

I was very loth to go in, but she said, I should make her drink something, or it should be the worse for me; when she got me in, the Door was made fast, and they insisted on my going up Stairs, while they went for something to drink; I went up just to the Stairs Head, and begged of her to let me go about my Business, for I was upon a Message; I went into a Room, and the Prisoner brought some Liquor; the other Woman got hold of my Watch, and I pushed her away several times - I did not let her pick my Pocket then. She called for more Help, and then I was afraid of my Life. The Prisoner came in, and laid hold of me - The Prisoner held me while the other Woman picked my Pocket of half a Guinea - She clapped her Hands upon both my Arms, and held me for about a Minute; I had one Hand upon my Watch; the other Woman got hold of my Watch, but I pulled it out of her Hand, and saved that: They called out several Names, but no Body came. I went away immediately to Mr. Sharrock, and he came and took her up - I was so much frightened, that a Child of ten Years old might have managed me - That Half Guinea was all the Money I had in my Pocket - I gave the Prisoner a Shilling to change to pay for what I had, and she gave me Six-pence before the other took the Half Guinea away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was I any nearer to you, than only to give you the Six-pence?</p>
               <p>Johnson. It was after you gave me the Six-pence that you robbed me; I said, you have robbed me, and then I came away - There was no other Person in the House but the Prisoner and the other Woman, neither of her Side nor mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the Woman that held you? Was not you in Liquor?</p>
               <p>Johnson. No, I was not; I can take my Oath I have not been drunk these three Years.</p>

            . I had been at Highgate to carry a Parrot to a Lady, whose Husband was Surveyor General of the Customs in New England. I cannot be certain to the Day - it was late at Night, for it was dark when I came from Highgate: As I was coming by a Corner a Woman asked me how I did, and whether I would not come in and drink a Dram? I said, with all my Heart; I went in with the Woman, and she and I went up Stairs, and another Woman (not the Prisoner) brought up a Pewter Thing full of Brandy - I cannot tell what Measure it was; the Woman who carried me up took hold of me, made use of some odd Expressions, and falls back upon the Bed, and tumbles me o' Top of her; said she, I must feel you; no said I, I do not want no Body to feel me, nor I do not want to feel no Body; why? said she, You Son of a B - h, you are poxed; I told her, if I was, I did not want to pox her nor no Body else, for you shall not feel me. So I asked her what was to pay for the Cup of Brandy; I put my Hand in my Pocket,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174312070013"/> and pulled out half a Crown to pay the Reckoning; I put my Hand in my Pocket again, because I thought that was too much to trust them with, as believing it to be a bad House. I had in my Pocket two English half Crowns more, an English Shilling, two Six-pences, and some Halfpence, and I paid the other Woman (not the Prisoner) for the Brandy; I was coming down Stairs, and the Prisoner laid hold of me, and said, You Son of a B - h, you have not paid your Reckoning; and then she called to her Cousin, and a Woman came down - the Woman that carried me in: They opened my Breeches, and took my Money out; the Prisoner clapped her Arms round about me, the Woman who carried me in took all I had in one Pocket, which was two half Crowns, one Shilling, and one Six-pence; she opened my Breeches, and turned my left Pocket inside out; and the Prisoner slipped her Hand into the right Pocket of my Breeches, and took half a Crown from me and some Papers; I desired she would not keep my Papers, so she delivered me my Papers again: After they had plundered me, they wanted me to stay in the House all Night; they put the Money into a Girl's Hand, and sent her away with it, then I went out of the Door, and said, I was robbed; I was not above six Minutes in the House - I was prodigiously frightened when they took hold of me; I could not tell what to make of it; I did not know but they might have killed me. I found the Constable about six Minutes after in the House where I was robbed; the Coachman * had brought him in to take them up; I told the Constable, I was robbed, and gave him the same Account as I do now, and he secured the Prisoner: He asked me, if I could shew him the Room where I was; I said, yes; I took a Candle, but I was afraid to go up; said I, You must go up before me; he went up with a Sword, but we found nothing; I said, I believed, I had lost twenty five Shillings, but not being used to

               <p>Prosecutor. I do not want to hurt her in any Shape, only to give her a Caution not to do the same thing again. <rs id="t17431207-26-verdict151" type="verdictDescription">

I carried him before Justice Rickards , and he confessed the small Parcel was mine, but that he bought the large Parcel of a Smuggler. I weighed a Cannister of Soucbon Tea, which I suspected this to be taken out of, and by the Account I keep with the Officer of Stock, I found about two Pound and a half wanting: The Lid of the Cannister was loose, and two or three Ounces lay loose upon the Lid of the Cannister, as if some Body had taken it out in a Hurry - It is a Tea of a very strong Flavour, and I never knew any of this Sort of Tea run; and I think I can be positive it is some of my own Tea.</p>

            . On the 18th of September last, as I was going out of Town, the Prisoner came down Stairs, I thought she was not well, and asked her what was the Matter with her, she said she was extremely Ill with the Gravel and Stone; I desired her to send for Mr. Warner, a Surgeon, to come to her, but in talking with her, I thought I observed that she was fallen away, and suspected she had been with Child; I taxed her with having been with Child, she said she had voided a great Quantity of Water, that she was better, and said that she had not been with Child; I talked to her of having the necessary House opened, to search if any Child was there, which she insisted upon in order to clear her Character. On the 9th of November, I received a Letter from Mrs. Porter from Lincoln, where the Prisoner came from, in which she acquainted me, that she was two Months gone with Child before she came from thence; I told her of the Letter, and asked her concerning it; she then owned she had miscarried, and that she was five Months gone with Child when she miscarried; I sent for a Carpenter, and had the Vault opened, and there was a Child found.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the Child?</p>
               <p>Mr. Porter. I saw it, but it was at some Distance, for it was so very nauseous, I did not care to come near it.</p>

             . I am a Surgeon; on the 9th of November I was sent for by Mr. Porter to come to his House immediately; when I came, he said he had found out what he had long suspected; his Maid's being with Child: He had the Vault opened, and a Child was found; he desired me to look at it; I viewed the Child, but it had lain in the Soil some Time, so that the Skull was separated one Bone from another. Mr. Porter asked me, whether I thought there had been any Violence done the Child; I said it had lain there so long, that I could not form a Judgment whether there had or no.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a Male or a Female Child?</p>
               <p>Warner. I took the Child to the best of my Judgment to be a Female Child, though it had lain till I could scarce tell what Sex it was; I was asked what Growth I thought the Child was; I said it was so large, that I believed it might be about nine Months; I could not tell whether the Mother had gone the full Time or not - I cannot tell whether it was born alive, or not.</p>

               <p>Q. Were they Friends before this?</p>
               <p>Child. They were not Friends, or they had not fought; but they fought in order to be Friends with one another; they had fought twice before, and were parted both Times. Baker had given the Prisoner Challenges several Times - Baker had the better both Times, and that was the Reason he gave him the Challenge, because he thought himself to be a better Man than the other. I was the Deceased's Second, and took him up when he was down.</p>
               <p>Q. How often had he been down?</p>
               <p>Child . I believe about a Dozen times; they fought near half an Hour - Baker was down oftenest ; the Prisoner had the Advantage in the Falls, but as to the Blows, I cannot tell who had the Advantage.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they part at last?</p>
               <p>Child. No; Baker was down, and I said, they should fight no more. As soon as the Words were out of my Mouth, they both went away; and Baker being asked by the Prisoner, whether he would drink, he said, he could not drink, but he would fight him another Time - I am very certain this fight was to make Things up; for there was a Difference between several of us besides.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the deceased appear to be ill?</p>
               <p>Child. He was ill in about five Minutes after I said he should not fight any longer; in about five Minutes after that he dropped down, and had not Strength to put hi s Shirt on; I got him up, but he could not stand long.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think to be the Occasion of his Death?</p>
               <p>Child. He might over-strain himself in the Fight, but I don't think the Blows were the Occasion of his Death.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any Malice?</p>
               <p>Child. There was no Malice. There have been greater and harder Fights than this - When they cannot agree, they commonly fight it out; and it is done in order to be Friends.</p>
               <p>Q. What Character has the Prisoner among you? Is he good natured?</p>
               <p>Child . He is as good a natured Boy as any in the House.</p>

            . The Prisoner nursed my Wife in her Lying-in; she came to me the 13th of August ; on Sunday the 28th of August I went to a little Box, I always keep locked in my Bed-chamber, in which I keep my Diamonds; the Bottom was in one Place, and the Lid in another; I missed three Diamonds and a Pearl; I had the Room swept, I did not know but I might have taken them up with my Feet; I searched all about for them, and the Prisoner lighted me all the while. Says she, I don't know but I may have put them among the Ashes, I have thrown some Ashes into the Street; we went down into the Street, I grabbled in the Ashes, but could not find them, which made me very uneasy; I could not charge any Body with them, for I did not know who had been at my Box. I had given them over for some Time, and knew nothing of them till I heard they were offered to a Goldsmith in Whitechapel; so I took the Prisoner up, carried her before Justice Oxenford , of the Tower Liberty , and she made an ample Confession of the Fact, and said, she would make me Restitution for them. I went to the Goldsmith's, to search for them, and it fell out very unlucky, that I could not search for them, on Account of his being dead.</p>

               <p>Blanch Flower. The Prisoner lived in the same House with me at the Field-Gate in Whitechapel; she asked me to go with her one Day, about nine or ten Weeks ago, to sell three Diamonds and a Pearl. I went over the Way with her to Mr. Gray's a Goldsmith, and she gave them into the Boy's Hand; he said, there was no body in the way to look at them; but, he said, you may leave them, and call again - She told me, they were a Jew Gentleman's Cook-maid's.</p>

I know nothing of the Prisoners, it was too dark to know them again; these Gloves are mine, the Hat was at pawn, the Gloves were in the Soldier's Barracks ; there were Marks of Handcuffs upon the Gloves; the Prisoners were brought out of the Country for Deserters, and had wore these Gloves under their Handcuffs .</p>

               <p>Q. What did the Man say when you laid such Wagers?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He said nothing in the World - I lost five Guineas, and eight or nine Shillings in Silver. There were four Fellows like Chairmen sleeping in a Box, and lying upon the Floor; Eales took them all four by their Legs, and dragged them out, and where-ever he laid them, they lay, and did not stir, and put me into the Box where they were; I did not remain there any longer than till a Candle was got, then he took me by the Arm, and carried me into an inner Room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this with or without your Consent?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was certainly against my Consent if I had my Will, but I was afraid; I had given my Watch to him before - for six Guineas he lent me; I went into this inner Room, and laid on his Side still till I lost these six Guineas - I never played myself at all - There were in this inner Room

            , this other Man that played, and I, and Eales's Wife, who lay upon the Bed in her Clothes; I said to Eales, if you will give me my Watch again, I will go home and fetch Money to redeem it; then he said, You owe me six Guineas, if you will bring me six Pounds nine Shillings and six Pence, you shall have your Watch; I went home in a Chair, and brought twelve Guineas; when I returned, I was introduced into this Room, and I immediately tendered him 6 l. 9 s. 6 d. and demanded my Watch; the Prisoner d - d me, and bid me hold my Tongue, and told me I should play with the other person that he had played with, and then I should have a Chance; I said I only came for my Watch, and desired he would give it me, and told him I would not play; he held up his Hand as if he would strike me, and swore by G - d I should play; I played, and in a little Time had the good Luck to win twelve Guineas - I won it of the Man that Eales was before playing with, and the Man paid me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Eales do with the Money he had of you?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Eales said he had lost every Farthing of the Money, but he did not lose any Thing then as I saw; then as I was not a great Loser I was for going away, Eales then snatched up ten of these twelve Guineas which I had upon the Table just by me; I asked him what he meant by this, he swore G - d d - n him he would owe it me; I said, I did not understand that; he said, G - d d - n me, he would make me understand it, and he threatened to strike me, if I did not hold my Tongue, so I did not speak a Word till I saw Eales lose all this ten Guineas with the Man he played with before - It was about nine or ten o'Clock in the Day when I first came out; we played all the while by Candle Light; I believe it is dark there at all Hours of the Day.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174312070026"/>Q. What was the next Thing that was done after Eales had lost the ten Guineas with this Man?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I was going to see for my Hat and Cane to go away, the Woman Prisoner got hold of me, and my Feet hitting against the Bed-post, I made a little slip, and she pulled me down upon the Bed, and wrapped me in the Blankets; I lay for about three Minutes, and then she went away and left me; he came in again, and said, who wrapped you up so; I said, his Wife; he d - d her for a B - h for serving a Gentleman so; she said, she thought it was the best way for me to sleep, for it would do me good.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not he jealous of you and his Wife?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am sure he had no Occasion to be jealous of me; he went out of the Room, and was not gone above half a Minute, before he brought in a Book, and swore that I owed him twelve Guineas upon a Book Debt, and that he would have all the Money in my Breeches for it, and then he put his Hand in my pocket, and took to the Amount of seven Guineas, and upwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you paid Eales the six Guineas?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what Occasion were you at St. James's?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was the Day that was kept for the King's Birth Day - I staid at St. James's till three o'Clock in the Morning -</p>
               <p>Q. Is not there a good deal of Burgundy going forward upon these Occasions?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I do assure you I did not drink above three Glasses of Wine there, and then I came to this Place.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was between nine and ten when you went away; when you were got to your Lodging, how came you to go there again?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Because he had got my Watch, and it was a Watch that I valued.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not you have staid till Day Light?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was Day Light when I went away - I only took the two Chairmen who carried me to my Lodging - The people did not use any uncivil Expressions to me - I was afraid, because I conceived a bad Opinion of the people of the House - merely from being forced down there; for if these people made no use of me after they got me into the Cellar, what Occasion was there to force me down?</p>
               <p>Q. You said four people said you should go down and drink; did neither of these four go down?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Not that I saw - I did not observe that any of them were in Liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you in a gay Humour, and wanted to play without being asked?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by the Chair?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I cannot tell how the Chair was got, so I suppose they got it.</p>
               <p>Nicholson, a Chairman. I carried the Prosecutor home about ten in the Morning, and did not perceive him to be in Liquor.</p>
               <p>- Gray (Constable) I had a Warrant from Colonel De Veil , and went to Eales's Cellar, I saw his Wife in the Bar, and asked where her Husband was; she said, he was in Bed; the Prosecutor said there is your Prisoner, and charged him with robbing him; he went very readily with me, and said, the Gentleman was not robbed there: When we came before the Colonel, he asked him for his Gold Watch; Eales sent me home for it; I told the Maid I came from her Master for the Gold Watch, and she gave it me very readily.</p>

            . I asked the Prisoner when he was before the Colonel, where the Watch was; she said, I have made Money of it, and then he said it was at Home; the Prisoner afterwards begged my Interest with the Prosecutor; said he, Consider what Life and Death is, get them to make it up, and I will resign the Watch, and part of the Money.</p>
               <p>Justice De Veil. The Reason of my sending for the Prisoner was upon the Deposition this Gentleman made, and I think it is not the same he makes now: He came to me, I believe the same Morning he was robbed, a nd he was so much in drink then, that I refused to take it; I told you you were in drink; I am sorry to say you do not swear the same now as you did before me; you swore then you were hauled down Stairs.

            . I have known Flood about three Years, and Bargaine about two Years; I have seen them file Farthings, and make them into Six-pences, and Half-pence into Shillings - I was concerned with them in the doing it; first we file the Britannia off, and take the Ribbon off, which hangs by the Side of the Neck on the Head Side, and alter the Head to make it look like a Six-pence, and then file them to the Size and Thickness of a Six-pence; after that we polish them with a piece of Leather to take off the Scratches and Roughness of the File; then we put them into a little Hand-vice, and put a bit of Leather between them and the Vice, to prevent it from marking them, and then bend them and whiten them over, so as to make them look like Silver, by rubbing them with Aqua Fortis, Cream of Tartar, and burnt Silver, made into a Sort of a paste. [This Witness proved the Experiment.] Then we used to put them off at Chandlers Shops, Bakers Shop, or where we could. I have put off five or six in a Day; we always went single - Sometimes we took out twenty or thirty at a Time, sometimes but two or three; if two of us went out together, only one went into the Shop, the other was placed at a Distance with a Quantity of this Money: He that went into the Shop had but one, and when he had parted with that he came to the person that had the Bag for another. [There were two of the altered Farthings showed to the Witness.] These are like them, they are King George the Second's Farthings. I am positive to both the Prisoners, they used to work at this Business at

               <p>Q. Have you seen them alter more than one, to make them resemble and pass for Sixpences?</p>
               <p>Graham . Yes; I have seen them do a hundred - I have seen both the Prisoners go through all the parts of this Business, altering the Impression, filing them to a Thickness, bringing them to the Breadth, polishing them, bending them, and silvering them over, and I have seen them pass them off.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you never informed against for this practice?</p>
               <p>Graham. I was in Custody in the Year 1738, and since that Cavenagh and Kelly laid an Information against me for counterfeiting the same.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were an Evidence against them, and now you have the good Fortune to be an Evidence against these persons?</p>
               <p>Graham. Yes; I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you been so kind as to desire a little Money of Flood?</p>
               <p>Graham. Yes; perhaps I have; ask me what you will, and I will answer you.</p>

               <p>Graham. I had had some Difference with Flood, and in August last I met him and Bargaine , and four or five more by Camberwell , with Hoes and Sticks , and I was afraid they would do for me, because they knew what I had done; they came up to me, and said, are not you afraid to do so and so? I said, you threatened to lay an Information against me, and I do not know for what, for I never endeavoured to hurt you; Says Bargaine, I am going to Portsmouth to Morrow, I will give you a couple of Guineas if you will not be Evidence against me; so he gave me a couple of Guineas; I thought I would give them good Words till I got away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go away with the two Guineas?</p>
               <p>Graham. Yes; they gave them me in a Day or two; I went to Labouring Work, and there was a Constable on the other Side of the Water, that said Bargaine was taken up for a Robbery in Surrey; [he is brought here by a Habeas Corpus ;] I went to Mr. North that Night with a Constable to prove he was the Man - I cannot fix the Day I made the Information.</p>

            . Flood's Wife has put off twenty six in an Evening, and Bargaine's Wife twenty four or twenty five many an Evening - The least we put off was twenty four or twenty five of a Night; when we went out we used to say to one another, Good Luck to you; we used to lay them out for some small Matter or other, and get good Money in the room of them - I have seen the Prisoners fell the Filings of the Half-pence and Farthings for 7 d. per pound. [There was a Box of paste produced.] Mr. Bargaine had such an one, and Mr. Flood had such an one - I believe it is the same Stuff [smells at it] it is the same Sort of Stuff; sometimes they have cut them cross the Face, and then they would pass better than another; and they said they would serve the K. so if they could: There are several people here to swear against me, Flood's Sister, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Mr. North produced two pieces of Money resembling Six-pences, which had been altered, and which he had of Mr. Matthews , and which he said were both Copper Farthings of the present King's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Matthews . I keep a Publick House, the Swan near St. George's Church, Southwark, Charles Flood and two more came for a full pot of Beer, and Flood gave me this Farthing for a Six-pence; I rubbed it upon the Floor, and delivered it to him again; said I. honest Man, what makes you use me so, it is but a Farthing; then they gave me this, I returned it again, and afterwards desired them to let me see them again, and they gave them me; said I again innocently, Methinks you are full of this Sort of Money (I cannot say that ever I saw Bargaine) Flood took an Apple out of his pocket, and flung this Box [the paste for colouring] out of Doors, and there was the print of one of these pieces in the Apple; this was the 18th of November, 1741.</p>

             - I cannot justly remember how long it was before my Husband went into Confinement ; I saw them making some about a Fortnight before Christmas, I believe it was about the eighth or tenth of December; the last I put off for Mr. Flood and Mr. Bargaine was for a Quarter of a pound of Sassasras .</p>

Sir, said he, I don't care what becomes of me ; I desire you would send this to my Wife. I desired he would give me a Direction where I should send it: He<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174312070034"/> took the Letter, and wrote upon the Back of it with a Pencil, as good a Hand as need to be wrote.

               <p>Mr. W. Nock, Chief Clerk to the Secretary of the Stamp-Office, proved, that the Dye which was counterfeited was made pursuant to an Order of the Commissioners of the 4th of June 1736, and the Plates for the Ornaments by an Order of the 5th of July 1739.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pyne, the King's Engraver for the Stamp-Office, produced the Specimen, and proved the making of the Plates for the Labels to be pursuant to the Order of the Commissioners of the 5th of July 1739, from 105 to 117, from 118 to 131, from 183 to 195, from 196 and to 208.</p>
               <p>Mr. Tuslian . The Prisoner has been my Servant about eight Years; about two years and a half ago, he said he wanted to speak to me; said I, what have you to say to me? he said, he had a Scheme in his Head, that would turn to my Profit and his own; he said, he could get a Label made in order to stamp the Cards with, and said, if you will let me have ten Guineas, to get Things in Order, I will get it done; and I did let him have ten Guineas; then he said, he wanted a rolling Press; said I, What do you want that for? he said, I cannot do without it. He got a Rolling-Press, and he brought the Man to me to pay him, and I paid him 40 s. on two Guineas; then I asked him, what he expected per Week; he said 18 s. I gave it him; in a little Time he said, he was only working for me, and would have more; he said, he would have 12 s. per Week, and 2 d. a piece for the Labels. I found myself under a Necessity of complying with it - The Press was put up in my back Garret in Charles Street by St. James's Square. I was so ill that I never was in the Garret then nor since. He began to furnish me with the Labels and Stamps about two Years and a half ago, and continued to furnish me with them till within these three Months, only there were some Intermissions when I was sick; for I used<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174312070035"/> to put the Labels upon the Cards - They are to denote the King's Duty being paid - I sold a great many Cards with the counterfeit Stamp - I believe four or five thousand - We used more of the Stamp-Office Labels than we did of the Counterfeits - After he went from me to set up for himself, I gave him 2 d. a piece when he worked - He continued but a very few Weeks at 18 s. then I gave him 12 s. per Week, and 2 d. a Pack; and upon these Conditions he continued I believe about a Twelve-month; then he left me - I do not know where he worked; I have asked him several times, and he never would tell me - After he left me he had no weekly Wages, only 2 d. a Pack for the Stamp - I parted with him because he would not stay any longer. He wanted me to leave off Trade, and trust him with all I had in the World; and because I would not do that, he went away in a Huff, and took a House at the Knave of Clubs in the Hay-Market - The Press was gone out of my House long before our Difference - I never saw it, nor don't know that ever he used it - I have heard, that the Stamps may be taken off so as to be used again; I cannot tell whether he ever did so; I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call these Papers that inclose the Cards?</p>
               <p>Tustian. A Wrapper for a single Pack is called a Jow , and a Wrapper for six Packs is a Sission - The Stamps are pasted on at our Houses by the Officers of the Stamp-Office.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not usual for Gentlemen's Servants to take the Stamps off the Cards with warm Water and sell them?</p>
               <p>Tustian. I believe it is done; but I never asked the Price of one in my Life.</p>

            . I am a Clerk in the Secretary's Office; in the Month of September I had an Information, that Thomas Hill the Cardmaker had taken a House in a Passage in Long Lane in Southwark; I suspected, that he made Cards secretly, and got a Warrant to search; I found in his Garret a Rolling-Press, two flat Stones, one with some Pink-coloured Paint upon it, and a Stone they call a Muller; a Grate to set a Pan of Charcoal upon, to warm the Plate over; red Paint mixed and unmixed; Oil, Whiting, &amp;c. such as they use in the Office for making the Labels. Upon finding these Things, I suspected that he had counterfeited the Stamp. [Mr. Hill's Day Book was produced.] I think this is what they call his Day-Book. I have examined the Book, and find, that he has sold and delivered to Persons upon Credit, 901 Doz. which is 10812 Packs of Cards, since September last; and the Prisoner has entered at the Stamp-Office in that Time 7678 Packs [So that he has sold 3134 Packs more than he has paid the Duty for, besides what he has sold for ready Money.] This is exclusive of Cards for Transportation, for he gave Bond for them. I verify think this to be his Hand-Writing.</p>

               <p>Coun. Is not red Paint used in painting the Pips upon the Cards?</p>
               <p>Pinkney. Yes, but they don't make use of Oil in that, but this was mixed with Oil - The Rolling-Press is necessary in the printing of Sissions, but not the Oil.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pyne. A Rolling Press is not necessary in the Business of a Cardmaker; there is no Occasion for a Rolling-Press for the Jews, if they are done in Wood, as they commonly are; Sissions are commonly done upon Copper, but I never knew a Card-maker that made them himself, because they can buy them by the Thousand cheaper. [Mr. Pyne confirmed the finding the Implements and Materials, as mentioned by Mr. Pinkney.]</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any Plates or Dye in the Prisoner's Custody?</p>
               <p>Pyne. No; neither Plates, Dyes, nor Stamp; but there was a Paper found with a Piece cut out of it just the Bigness of the Stamp which is used upon the Cards.</p>

             . On the 31st of December last, I bought three half Dozen Packs of Cards of the Prisoner, and sold four Packs of them to Mr. Pyne; I believe these are the Cards, I never had any any where else; I wrote my Name upon them, and they were sealed up with my Seal.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pyne . These four Packs of Cards I bought of Mr. Jarvis , and they were sealed up in his Presence; and for greater Security, Mr. Jarvis and I both wrote our Names upon each Pack of Cards - These are every one of them different Stamps from the Stamp of the Office.</p>
               <p>Q. Give us an Account what Observations you have made with Regard to the Difference between the Stamp of the Office and that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pyne . The first Difference I have made an Observation of, is, that in the Harp, which is the Arms of Ireland : In one Quarter of the King's Arms in the Stamp of the Office there are but five Strings, in this there are seven or eight, but they are so blind that one runs into the other. The next Observation I made, is, that from the Buckle of the Garter to the end of the Strap is a considerable deal longer in this than in the Stamp of the Office; and there are four more Stubs or Holes in this for the Tongue of the Buckle to go in, than in the Stamp of the Office. The next Observation<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174312070036"/> is, the Arch of the Crown on the Top of the Garter is more arched, and brought down to the Middle of the Cross of the Crown more in this than in the Stamp of the Office. The next Observation is, that the Top of the Letter (N) in the Word Pence under the Garter, is a great deal nearer the Bottom of the Garter than in the Stamp of the Office: Then in the Label there is a great deal of Difference in the Number 201 (these four Packs are all Number 201;) in the Word (Stamp) there is a Difference in the Stroke that goes cross the (T;) the (P) in the same Word is different; the Stroke that runs from the (O) through the two (FF's) to the (I) is different; the (C) and the (E) at the end of the Word Office are remarkably different; in the Top of the (F) and the Tittle of the (I) there is a visible Difference; in the Word (Duty) there is a Difference in the (Y) and the whole Word (Pack) is more remarkably different from the Stamp of the Office; there is a Difference in the Cypher over the Ornament, it is larger, and of a different Shape - I am thoroughly satisfied they are not the Marks of the Office.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there are no more than five Strings to the Stamp of the Office. Look at that Specimen and see how many there are here.</p>
               <p>Pyne . There are more than five Strings here, but this was made in 1714.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the Specimen of 1736, and see how many Strokes there are there.</p>
               <p>Pyne . There are no more than five here, that is the Dye in Use; it never was, and cannot be repaired, the Steel is made so hard; when one Dye is wore out, there is a new Dye made.</p>
               <p>Q. What Letters are on the present Stamp?</p>
               <p>Pyne . Both A and B, they are both used at a Time for Dispatch of Business, only A and B are used for Cards, it is only the B that is counterfeited.</p>
               <p>Q. Look upon the A and B that are now in use in the Office, and see if there is any Difference.</p>
               <p>Pyne . It is hardly possible to see a Difference.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Does not the pasting on of the Label spread the Dye in the Middle?</p>
               <p>Pyne . It cannot alter the Distance of the Letters.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pinkney gave his Opinion, that the Stamp was a Counterfeit, and also the Label, and made several Observations relating to the Difference; but as he was not an Engraver, he said he could not make so many as Mr. Pyne.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Can you take upon you to say, that Mr. Rollis has not made an Alteration in the Dye?</p>
               <p>Pinkney . The Dye was never altered, it has never been in Mr. Rollis's Custody since it came into the Office; we have had no Dye come into the Office since the Year 1736; the Dye is locked up every Night in the Office.</p>

Said I, you may be mistaken; you can't swear to People's Faces; I spoke to the Prisoner, and asked her to go aside [to a private Place] - I asked her, because I thought she was not the Person Mrs. Frenson took her to be. I went out, and she with me; and when we came to the Corner of Somerset Street, coming from Harrow Alley by the vacant Place - about four or five Doors from the Place where we were drinking, she whistled and said, Now you B - h I will have my Revenge on you; I will cut your Throat from Ear to Ear; she said she would have my Heart's Blood, she would present the Blood Bowl to me; upon her whistling, the two Prisoners and three more Fellows came and surrounded me, and Clifford took Frenson's Cloak off my Back, and my Bundle from me; and then they all ran away in a Body together - I am sure that those two Youths are part of the Gang - The five Men rifled my Coats - Both the Prisoners had one Hand, if not both under my Petticoats - They did nothing else, they did not take any thing from me - I never saw the Woman before - I did cry out, but I could not cry out at the first Threatning, because they muffled my Head - One of the Boys went to kiss me with one Hand round my Neck, and the other under my Clothes - It was while they were kissing me, she took the Things - After I cried out Stop Thief three times; Clifford came back again with the Cloak over her Arm and the Bundle in her Hand. and knocked me down in the Mud, and said, take that in the room of the Blood Bowl.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Frenson confirmed Mrs. Gyles's Evidence; that when Mrs. Gyles asked to go aside, Clifford took her into the vacant Place by Harrow Alley, and whistling, five Fellows came round her, some like Carmen, and some like Butchers, but could not swear to either Ettington or Kaines, any farther than seeing them in the Shop - that one of the five Men put his Hand under Gyles's Clothes, and another kissed her, while Clifford took away the Bundle, and then ran all away together; that upon crying out, Stop Thief! Clifford came back again, and pushed them both in the Mud, and stamped upon the Small of Mrs. Gyles's Back, and said, you B - h, take that instead of the Blood Bowl.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any Lamp?</p>
               <p>Frenson. There was a Lamp or two at a Distance, but I could not well distinguish the Prisoners.</p>

               <p>Gyles. There was not Assistance enough to carry them to Goal; I said that Night that Ettington was one of the Fellows - I did not know Kaines so well as the other, that was the Reason I did not accuse him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Mirsin deposed, that the Prisoner came into his Shop, where there were some clear Lawns upon the Counter, and when she was gone he missed a piece; that he accidentally met her in the Street , and dogged her to Mr. Mcculloch's Shop, charged her with it, and that she promised to pay for it, but desired that he would not let her Husband know any Thing of it, for it was a Smuggling Affair, and pressed him to take a Note, that the Prisoner's Husband said he might do what he would with his Wife, if he did not hurt his Character; that he went the next Morning to get a Warrant to take her up, and was prevailed upon to take a Note for his Lawn, and Mcculloch's piece of Cambrick; that the Day following a Person came to pay the Money and take up the Note, and then he said he did not know that Mr. Goodman owed him any Thing, and refused the Money, because he did not know what the Effects of it might be, and then concluded to take her up.</p>
