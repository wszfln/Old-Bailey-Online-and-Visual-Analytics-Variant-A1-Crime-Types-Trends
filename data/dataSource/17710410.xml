It hung up near the door, upon a hook, for sale. I followed her, and overtook her. I desired her to come back with me; she did: and, when she came back, she threw the gown away from her in the passage. I saw her untie her apron and throw it out (the gown produced and deposed to.) She tore it in pulling it off the hook.</p>

I think they were in three bundles. When I went out, I left some upon a chest of drawers, some upon a horse, and some upon a bed. One parcel was pinned up in a handkerchief, upon one end of the drawers, that contained seven shirts, which were ironed ready to go home. I did not miss any thing out of the room.

            . I have the shop and two rooms in the house. Mrs. Spicer desired my boy to have an eye to her door whilst she was out, as there was nobody in the house besides me. I saw her go out. About two minutes after, I heard the latch of the door which goes into the passage lift up. I went to the door, and asked the prisoner who he wanted. He had opened the door, it was on Monday; he said he wanted Mrs. Jones, the washerwoman. I told him no such person lodged in the house. He went out, and latched the door after him. That passage leads up stairs. In a quarter of an hour after, Mrs. Smith came home, and went up stairs: she came down, and told me two young men had taken a candle from her: that there were two young men in Mrs. Spicer's room. We bolted the door, and ran up stairs. They both slipped down stairs; I saw nobody. They slipped down stairs while she was gone up to her own room. I saw the three bundles tied up in the room. I went to Mrs. Spicer's son. Whilst we were talking of it, Mrs. Smith saw two men coming by. She said the prisoner was the man that took the candle out of her hand. Two women pursued them, and Mrs. Barns brought him back. I am sure he is the man that unlatched the door. He denied he had been in the room.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Smith. I lodged at Mr. Orme's. I came home about four o'clock. I went up stairs, and brought a candle to Mrs. Spicers, I knocked at her door, and asked to light it; I wanted to light my fire. The prisoner opened the door; I asked him to light my candle; he gave it to another man in the room. He blowed at the fire, and endeavoured to light some paper, but could not. I asked them for my candle again; they were some time before they gave it me. I said I would go down stairs and light it. I went up and locked my own door, and then went down stairs: When I came to the door, the prisoner was shutting-to the door; he held it against me; he was on the outside. I pulled it open at last, and passed by him. I went into Mrs. Macaulays room, and asked to light my candle. In about twenty minutes, Mrs Barns brought the prisoner into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing about his having been in the room?</p>
               <p>Smith. Not then. Whilst I stood at the door, I saw the prisoner, and the other man, pass by: I said they were the two men that I saw in the room. One Mrs. Barnes ran out after them, and brought back the prisoner. The other got away.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutrix. Was the lock broke?</p>
               <p>Spicer. No.</p>

The cook went down stairs. In a few minutes she came up stairs, crying very much, and said the house was broke open. I went down. The kitchen window was broke open, the sash thrown up, a wooden bar that went from side to side was broke in two, one of the shutters was very much damaged, the bar was broke in two in the middle, and splintered very much. I fastened the window up, myself, over night. There is an iron gate to the area, that gate was left wide open; I locked it myself over night. The things mentioned in the indictment were taken away.

            . I am a chimney-sweeper. The prisoner and I, and one Llewellyn, went out a-robbing one night, rather in the morning. The robbery was committed between four and five o'clock. They came to my lodgings and called me up, I lodge in Aldersgate-street. We went together with an intention to rob. There was no particular place mentioned. We went up to St. George's, Hanover-square. We made one attempt, but we declined it. Then we went to Mr. Carter's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any notice of that?</p>
               <p>Murray. No. I opened the area gate with a chissel; Llewellyn and I went down; Murphy staid in the street. I lifted up the window sash, and Llewellyn helped me to force open the shutters, I believe with our hands. I went in and struck a light: Llewellyn came in, and we first found a silver bowl, then a pair of candlesticks, then seven tea spoons; then we forced open the back kitchen, and took some things out of a cupboard. We went home. When we came up the prisoner was standing five or six doors off. Llewellyn took the things away, and the next morning brought me my money. He said he had paid the prisoner his share. I had four guineas, or four pounds, I can't say which. I think he said he sold it to one

            . On the twenty-third of February, about twelve at night, I met the prisoner in Holborn; she picked me up; I was going to see a friend: it was near the Bull and Gate. She took me to a house of bad fame in <placeName id="t17710410-6-crimeloc33">Church-lane, St. Giles's</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you see any other woman in the house?</p>
               <p>Foreman. Yes; two or three: there was another bed in the room we were in; a man and a woman laid in that.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose those were not women of the first character, but of the same stamp yours were of?</p>
               <p>Foreman. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first miss your watch and money?</p>
               <p>Foreman. About six or seven in the morning; it was day light. On the fifteenth of March, I found the prisoner in a house in Drury-lane; she owned the whole fact to me and the watchman; the watchman is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to her to induce her to make that acknowledgment? Did you promise her any favour?</p>
               <p>Foreman. Yes, I told her I did not want to prosecute her: then she confessed it.</p>
               <p>Court. The whole of the evidence depends upon her confession, made under a promise of favour, which cannot be allowed.</p>

I marked five shillings in half-pence, eight shillings in silver, two half guineas, and one quarter, by filing the edges. I had some suspicion of the prisoner. I ordered the other servants to go up to dinner and leave him in the shop. There were eight shillings in another till, and two half guineas, and a quarter: when I came down from dinner I sent him up, and found sixteen-pence deficient: I called him down; the rest of the servants were come down from dinner. I desired they would pull their money out of their pockets; the prisoner pulled out some, and said that was all he had; I shook his coat pocket, and said, There is half-pence in your coat pocket: my brother put his hand in his pocket and pulled out some half-pence, which were marked: he denied that they were my half-pence: they corresponded with the others exactly.</p>

            . I was present. My brother marked some money. He came and told me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100007"/> he missed about sixteen pence. He desired I would go over and see him searched. I went over to his shop: he desired the prisoner to pull out what money he had: he said he had very little or none: it did not appear indeed that he had much in his breeches pocket: my brother touched his coat pocket and said it rattled: my brother put his hands into his pocket, and pulled out two or three; I put my hand in, and found about eight pennyworth. I asked him how he came by them; he said he did not know, he had had them a good while. About twelve penny-worth were marked.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. Are you satisfied that the money found in the prisoner's pocket was what you had put in the till?</p>
               <p>White. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. Had you paid any of that marked money away.</p>
               <p>White. No; I gave my servants orders not to add or diminish, so they paid sometimes out of their own pockets. I marked three or four together, and the file did not touch all alike.</p>

I followed her, and asked her what she wanted; she said she wanted a piece of cloth; I turned her cloak back, and saw a piece of my cotton, I know it by the pattern, it is my own pattern (produces it.) She begged I would not prosecute her. It was taken from a pile just within the door.</p>

I went out and brought him into the shop; he said he had a pedlar's licence; he took one out of his pocket in a tin box, and laid it down; at the same time with his other hand he laid the case down upon the counter.

Last Monday was three weeks I was in my parlour drinking tea; Mrs. Knight, who lives opposite me, came and asked me if I sold a glass, for she saw two women take one from the stall. I pursued them, and found them talking together in Princes-square. They denied they had been near my shop. Mannon had a long cloak on: I turned back her cloak, and she had my glass under it. I took them both into custody. Mannon said Murphy was innocent of it, for she had met her in the street just before she took the glass. (The glass produced and deposed to.)</p>

            . I lost this spoon last Tuesday was three weeks. I had not missed it above an hour when my neighbour, Mr. Bootle, a constable, brought the prisoner to me, whom he had taken into custody for offering to sell him my spoon.</p>
               <p>- Bootle. The prisoner came into my house; he told me he had a spoon to sell, and produced this spoon: he asked fifteen shillings for it; he said it was worth twenty-five; then he said it was worth twenty-three shillings; then he said it was worth a guinea. I got a stick in order to be able to master him if he made any resistance. Then I examined him again; I asked him how he came by it; he said he had a brother a butcher; that he went to him for some money, that he would give him none, therefore he took away the spoon: I seized him and cut down his breeches to prevent his making his escape. I told him I would carry him before a magistrate; then he declared he had taken it from the next publick house. I carried him down to Mr. Harnan; he owned the spoon.</p>

I did not leave any body in my house; it was Mr. Sibber's house; it became my house upon his death; he left it me in his will; he had been dead six days. I came to town that morning. I was informed the house was broke open; the back parlour windows were broke; it had outside shutters, which appeared to be wrenched off with a chissel, and then the sash must have been lifted up; there was a parlour door broke, and the locks of a beauset broke all to pieces, in which Mr. Sibber kept all his papers, and the papers were thrown all about the room.</p>

            . I am a watchman in Moorfields. I was beating my hour about 3 o'clock on a Tuesday morning in November, the latter end of the month; when I had walked about thirty yards from my stand I saw three men coming with three large bundles; I clapp'd hold of the first man's bundle, and insisted upon knowing what he had got there; he attempted to pull it away; at last he let it go; I turned round to see if the other two were coming upon me; they sheered off. I threw that bundle over the wall; and then I followed the other two; I left that man to secure the other two; I stuck between the posts; the second man dropped his bundle within a few yards of the next stand to mine; then I followed the third man as close as I could across Moorfields: there were several things dropped out as he went along; I did not attend to them but pursued him, and called out to Finsbury watchmen, but they did not come time enough, and the man got off. I kept the things three days, and then advertised them. Mrs. Hogshaw claimed them; she came to the Three Compasses in King-street, and sent for me; I carried the goods to her and she owned them; these are the goods.</p>

I asked him when he had been at Chelsea, for his innocence would greatly depend upon that; he said he had not been at Chelsea for seven weeks; the officer shewed him the warrant; he said he did not know that he had done any thing wrong, and was very ready to go before the magistrate.

About two o'clock, by the college clock, three men came a-top of the building by a ladder; the prisoner was one; when they first came a-top of the house, one of them passed where we were concealed, to listen, I suppose, if any body was watching; then he came up again; and they began working, cutting, and ripping the lead five or six minutes I believe; then I got out with the blunderbuss a-top of the house. I had no sooner got out but the prisoner came up to me with a knife, and was going to make a blow at me with his knife; he was within a yard of me; I told him if he did not stand I would shoot him; he still advanced; I was afraid of taking his life; I fired at his legs in order to disable him, that I might take him; he was about two yards from the edge of the house; there is a little wall about two foot above the leads; he threw himself head foremost over there; which is about eighteen foot high; the other men throwed themselves over in the same manner.

            . I live at the upper end of Bunhill-row, and work in Petticoat-lane. On the twenty-fifth of March, I left my work a few minutes after seven. Going home, I saw Levi and another man walking together: I saw one of them walk up to the window; and, looking through the glass, he left the window and went into the shop. I saw the other man stand as if he was holding the door open. I walked on till I came to Stony-lane. About twenty yards off, I saw Levi receive one drawer covered with paper, the other man took another drawer. Levi ran down the lane, the young man that was with him came up towards me; the other two that were with them walked soberly on. I saw Levi receive the first drawer. When I saw the other two follow Levi, I turned about, and was going home: A man came by me in a great hurry, and asked a gentleman if he had seen any body with some drawers; I said, Yes, master; one is gone up this lane, another down. I went home. I did not hear the gentleman say he was robbed. The next morning, when I went to work, I told my master I saw a man take some drawers out of the prosecutor's shop. My master said he was robbed of an hundred pounds worth of goods. I told him I knew the man. I had taken off a lock to mend for him, in Marlborough-court. My master took me over to Mr. Routh. I went to a public house that same day, with one Brabroke and some more men, to the Red-lion: Levi came in. I said, That is the man; lay hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you saw a drawer, covered with paper, received by Levi?</p>
               <p>Routh. Yes; I knew him very well. Sometimes he wore an apron like a porter; at other times he would have a bit of cane like a bailiff's follower.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. Why did you not stop me when the man came out of the shop? Why not stop me, or give notice?</p>
               <p>Homan. Seeing the other parties go along so peaceably, I thought no harm had been done.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. Did you know the man that gave him these things?</p>
               <p>Homan. I know the gang: there is a sad gang of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the other man a Jew?</p>
               <p>Homan. They are all four Jews; I have seen them many times.</p>
               <p>Q. What house was they at?</p>
               <p>Homan. A bad house; it has been indicted several times.</p>

            . I live in Gravel-lane, Petticoat-lane. I have known the prisoner three or four years.</p>
               <p>Q. How does he get his living?</p>
               <p>Jones. Portering. He lodges at one Mrs. Mark's, in Petticoat-lane, not far from where I live; that is, in Marlborough-court.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where this man was the night the garters were stole?</p>
               <p>Jones. At his lodgings. I nursed Mrs. Mark's child. I went there for money, about three in the afternoon, on Monday; next Monday come fortnight: I staid there till above a quarter after eight. I went home to put the child to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to Mrs. Mark's?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But he does not live with Mrs. Marks?</p>
               <p>Jones. He was in her room.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he come in?</p>
               <p>Jones. Between three and four. He said he had hurt his back by carrying a load. He laid down upon Mrs. Marks's bed. He desired her to buy some fish for supper. A woman who sells fish, and lives in the court, brought some. Mrs. Marks called the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they pay for it?</p>
               <p>Jones. I cannot tell. I went home about a quarter after eight. He never went out of the room whilst I was there. He walked about, smoaking his pipe.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any liquor?</p>
               <p>Jones. Only one pint of beer, which Mrs. Marks fetched. She gave me a shilling; she said she had no more. I went next morning to fetch a boiler I had lent her, then I heard the prisoner was taken up. I did not go before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Bowman?</p>
               <p>Jones. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the room in which you found him, the room in which he lodged?</p>
               <p>Jones. I can't say: I have seen him there when I have been for money.</p>
               <p>Q. When did this happen?</p>
               <p>Jones. A fortnight, next Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it on Monday?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Last Monday?</p>
               <p>Jones. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the Monday before last?</p>
               <p>Jones. It is a fortnight next Monday. I was there on Monday, he was taken up next day.</p>
               <p>Q. If it had happened on Lady-day, you would have known it?</p>
               <p>Jones. It was not Lady-day. I think it is a fortnight ago, but cannot be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. What was due to you when you received this shilling?</p>
               <p>Jones. She pays me four shillings a week; there were fourteen shillings due then.</p>

In the night, as I lay in bed, about two in the morning, there was a light in the pantry; I looked and saw one man in the pantry; afterwards I saw two more come into the pantry; they had all, at last, lights in their hand. Presently after one came into my room, and then another; he that came into my room first, presented a pistol to me, as I lay in my bed, and said, D - n you, you dog, if you stir you are a dead man. Immediately after he came in, the three other came into the room; one cried out when they came into the room, Cock your pistols; and they pointed some of their pistols at me, and said if I stirr'd they would shoot me. I rose up in my bed, and begg'd for my life. One of them said to me, Hold your tongue, and if you will tell every thing we will not hurt you. I said I would tell them every thing they wanted to know. Then they asked me what plate my mistress had; I told them, a pair of candlesticks. They asked, where; I said, I believed in my mistress's room. They asked where that was; I said, two pair of stairs backwards. They then asked if there was any man in the house; I said, None but myself. Then they went about my hall where I laid, and rummaged about. Presently, in a minute or two, I saw Isaacs, the prisoner, take my hat in the pantry; but I look'd through the sash, and saw Isaacs take up my hat in the pantry. Then I saw him come afterwards into the hall, where I was in bed, with my hat upon his head; and his own hat, as I suppose, in his hand. There was a light in my hall where I lay. One of the people, Price, one of the robbers, asked Isaacs why he took the hat; for he said as there are no other men in the house, you ought not to take any thing belonging to this servant, that is here; thereupon Isaacs laid my hat down again; they consulted together; at last agreed among one another, who should stay below stairs. It was agreed that Price should stay below; and immediately the other three of the four that were there went up stairs. Price staid behind, and kept walking backwards and forwards with a pistol in his hand by my bed side. It was three quarters of an hour before I heard any thing after this; then I heard a noise above stairs in the house; first I thought it was a breaking open something or other, presently after I heard the street door bell ring, and a knocking at the door; then I found this pounding was at the door of the house. At this alarm, the three that were up stairs came down again. They came into the room where I was in bed, and swore to me, that if I did not shew them the best way to escape they would shoot me. I said as the people were in the front of the house, I thought the best way to escape was backwards, up the area and over the back wall. They had brought bundles of things down with them, but left them at the hall door when I directed them the way to escape. They went to the door which opened from the hall where I lay into the area; that door was locked; I saw them unlock it, in order to get out of the area and make their escape: immediately I heard them go up the steps of the area; and, as soon as they were gone, I got up, went to the street door, and let in the watchmen; there were three at the door: I directed them to go round to the back of the house, and they might find some getting over the wall. I went up stairs to my mistress; I did not stay long there; I came down again,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100016"/> and then observed the watchmen were pursuing one man, but none were taken at that time. I saw none of the robbers till about half an hour afterwards; then I saw Isaacs in custody at the watch house. I am very sure that Isaacs is the same man that had my hat on his head in the hall when I was in bed. As to the other men, I would not be so positive to Butcher and Haines, but verily believe they were in the house with Isaacs. Presently after they were gone, I happened to go up into the breakfast room, (a room forwards, up one pair of stairs,) the sash of which was open, whether shut down over night I cannot take upon me to say; it was open presently after the prisoners were gone out of the house. What was taken, particularly, out of the pantry, I cannot say; some silver, and the punch ladle, were taken out of the pantry; and the top of the pepper box out of the hall where I was asleep. Some things were never found again: two tablespoons, a pair of tea-tongs, some tea spoons, my mistress's ear-rings, and a small bottle. All the rest were found; some in the area of Captain

            . I am a maid servant; I live in the house. I remember, particularly, this sash in the back room being shut down; and, in the afternoon, the lower shutters were shut to and the curtains of the room let down likewise. I was in the room again between seven and eight in the evening; at that time I did not look particularly at the sash, but the curtains were still hanging down in the same situation as when I saw it at three in the afternoon. I lie in the fore garret of that house. I was waked, about two in the morning, with a noise upon the stairs. I got up, looked down the bannisters, saw a light, and heard strange voices, but saw nobody; then withdrew into my own room, and locked the door; drew up the sash of my own window, and looked out for the watchmen. As I saw a watchman coming, I called to him, and gave him an alarm of thieves being in the house. Soon after, three more watchmen came to the door: I bid them knock and ring at the door as hard as they could. I kept looking out at the window till the man-servant came out of the house door into the street: he assured me I was safe. Then I came down stairs out of my room. I went first into my mistress's room, presently afterwards into the breakfast room. I saw at that time the sash up, and the shutters put back which were shut-to at three in the afternoon. In my mistress's room I observed the drawers had been all pulled out, and the things were thrown about the room out of the drawers. I saw some bundles tied up in the man's bed room below: there was standing a pair of candlesticks and a soup ladle; I know the candlesticks were, over night, in my mistress's room: also a pair of ear-rings of my mistress's, lost out of a drawer in a wash stand up two pair of stairs and two pair of paste buckles in some other drawer: as to the bundle that was found in the man's room in the morning, it was tied up in a particular handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember being in the room you call the breakfast room, the day before you was robbed?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. Yes; they took me out of bed about twelve, to make it: I was there till about three. They let the curtains down to keep the light out of my eyes. The window-curtains were drawn, and the window was shut to. I went to bed again. I was first awaked by a great light and noise in my room. Mrs. Bellamy was in bed with me. I asked who they were; they said, if I spoke a word, they would murder me. I repeated it; they gave me the same answer. They began to rifle my drawers; and that man, Isaacs, (I mistook him next morning, but recollect him perfectly now) he came to my bed-side with a pistol: I asked him if he meant to murder me; he hesitated a minute before he said, No. I then requested that they would not murder any of my servants. He said No, immediately, to that. He stood by me about seven minutes after we both ceased to speak, with his pistol in his hand. I sat up in my bed, looking at him all that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any light?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. I always burn a lamp: there was a great deal of light in the room. I saw through the curtains, which were linen, a great deal of light. Then he

             the curtain to, and left me after he had stood there about seven minutes. I did not see the other two; but all three of them acknowledged, before Justice Welch, that they were in my room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they sign any thing?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any promise made to any of them? Did they want to be admitted evidences?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. No, Butcher wanted to be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100017"/> admitted an evidence, but the justice told him he could not be admitted without farther discoveries.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any promise made?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor no threats?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You said Butcher wanted to be admitted an evidence?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. Yes; the justice said he could not without he made other discoveries; and no other discoveries were made.</p>
               <p>Q. What was said to them? and what answer did they make?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. Another man was brought in with him the next morning; Isaacs was so changed with fear, I suppose, he was so pale that I did not know him then; I thought the other man was the man; Butcher said at Mr. Welch's that the other man was innocent; they are the three men that confessed they were there; Butcher said that Isaacs was the man that was at my bedside with the pistol, and not the man that I had at first suspected; they all agreed that the dyer was innocent; and said they left him in the house in Little Suffolk-street, at a green shop; they were taken there; the woman is here I believe; they all said the dyer was innocent; Haines said, that handkerchief which was sealed up was his; it was given to Butcher; Butcher said it was Haines's, and gave it him; Haines said it was his; this handkerchief had a bundle of my things tied up in it.</p>

               <p>Read. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing in a handkerchief?</p>
               <p>Read. Yes; in that silk handkerchief just produced there was some gowns and some linen in it; this gown was one: it was over night in the two pair of stairs room; I found it tied up in the ptman's bed room below; I gave the handkerchief to Haines; he said it was his; I asked him if it was his; he said yes.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Lady, Did you go into this bedroom?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. Not for some time; I was very ill.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. A silver punch ladle, &amp;c. (repeating the things mentioned in the indictment.)</p>
               <p>Q. from Isaacs. Did you not say you never saw me?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. No. About ten in the morning the constable brought them to my house, as he was taking them to the justice. He had the three prisoners and the dyer in custody. Butcher and Haines were first brought in; I said I had never seen them: then this dyer and others, and Isaacs (there is a resemblance between the Jew and this dyer) and the Jew was so frightened and altered, that I did not at first remember him. I said that the dyer was the man that held the pistol, but I recollect the Jew, Isaacs, perfectly well since.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see them afterwards?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. The Thursday following I saw them all there; before I saw the prisoners, Mr. Welch told me that the other three had accused Isaacs, and that he had acknowledged it, and that the dyer was innocent.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say before the justice?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. I recollected when I came to trace the features of Isaacs, I was sure he was the man; he had two rows of white metal buttons on.</p>
               <p>Q. His life is now at stake, are you sure he is the man?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. I am positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose Mr. Welch had not apprized you that you had fixed on a wrong man, should you have had such a certain knowledge of this man that you should have corrected what you had said?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. I verily believe I should.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. About Ten all the prisoners were brought to your house?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Together with the dyer?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. Yes; he is very much like that man, but he had but one row of white buttons upon his coat, the other had two.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Welch told you that you was mistaken?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not before the justice declare that the dyer was not the man?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. They all said so; Butcher said he was as innocent as a child. Isaacs looked so horrid that he frightened me; and I turned my eyes from him.</p>

            . I am a servant to Capt. Sloper; I live next door to Mrs. Moore's; there was an alarm on the seventeenth of March between two and three o'clock in the morning; I came down and looked out at the fore window; I heard one of the watchmen say, they were got out at the back door and over the wall. I let the watchmen into our house to search our garden; they could find nothing, and went out again. I went into the kitchen; about half an hour after I heard a noise from the back area, I went there; I tried to open the door; I hollowed out, Who are you? a person said, open the door and I will tell you. I did not venture to open the door; I suspected they were the thieves; I sent for the constable and watchmen; they opened the door; and Isaacs was in the area; he said I give myself prisoner; one of the watchmen searched his pocket, and found a little silver salt spoon. They took him away; I shut the doors. About half an hour after that I went into the area, and saw some silver spoons lay under the bottle rack; there was a soup ladle, four silver table spoons, and three cases like buckle cases, with buckles and rings in them: my fellow servant delivered them to Mrs. Moore's servant. I ask'd Isaacs if he left these things in our area; he said, Yes; and said he brought them out of Mrs. Moore's house: I did not hear Butcher or Haines say any thing.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Sunday 17th of March I was the constable of the night. Between two and three there was an alarm of a robbery in South Audley street; I went to Mrs. Moore's house; I saw the one pair of stairs sash open, the footman opened the door; we went through the back parlour into the yard, there we found this pistol loaded, and this chissel lay by it upon the stones (producing them.) An information was brought of a man's being upon the stables; I saw him there, and heard him speak. The watchman fired at him; he was not found. As soon as we got out of the stables, a watchman told me that they had taken one; that was Isaacs. I asked who were his accomplices; he would not confess. I told him it might be better for him to confess; he said, there was him, Haines, Butcher, and Price. I saw him searched; he told me who his confederates were, and said they were to take the things to one

            's lodgings, in Little Suffolk street, at a green shop. Isaacs said Haines got in first at the window over the door, he followed next; he said he got up the palisadoes, up the lamp iron, and so over the door to the window. We went to Ann Bedford's directly; there was one Maynard the constable and myself. We did not know rightly where the house was; we waited expecting to see them come in. We enquired at a house where the green shop was; he said, next door. I went and got more assistance, and returned again about six o'clock: we went into the one pair of stairs; there was a bedstead, but no bed. In the next room higher were Haines and Butcher with their clothes on. In another room we found Hesket and this dyer, along with Bedford and one Murphey. Another woman was laid down upon the hearth near the fire. I said, These are the men (meaning Haines and Butcher) that we want; you must go with us. They said, they would. When they came to the watch-house, we searched them; there was nothing found upon them.</p>

I saw part of the wall broke down, and there were two pistols found just by: we went over that wall to the adjoining yard; they said one of the men was upon the stable; the man fired a pistol at them.

I searched him, and found this spoon upon him (producing it). We took him to the watch-house; there we asked him where the rest of his accomplices might be found; he said at a Green stall in Little Suffolk-street; we went and found Butcher and Haines there.

            . I am a sign-painter, and live in Harp Alley. Isaacs was apprentice to me; he served about half of his time with me. He left me about five years ago. He behaved very well whilst with me. He was turned over to Mr. Haggetty, on account of some quarrels between him and my servants, not on account of any dishonesty.</p>
               <p>Hart Michael. I live in Church Lane, by St. Martin's church. I am a master painter. Isaacs worked for me, off and on, about a year. He left me this winter. I have known him from a child; he has always behaved well. He called two months ago, I had no work then; I said I would employ him when I had any.</p>

We both came out together; we went to the Goat alehouse, at Charing-cross; we had a pint of purl: just before we drank it, the prisoners came in; I don't know that I had ever seen them before. The deceased was acquainted with Hewett; she spoke to him: they asked her to drink; she drank a dram with them. They said they were going to dinner at Mother Red-Cap's; they asked us to go with them. I asked how far it was; they said, but a little way. She first consented to go; then I agreed to it. We went out together: she got into Hewett's coach, and I into the other: this was about three o'clock. The coaches were facing the Goat alehouse; they drove to the coach office, in Great Queen-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to separate yourselves?</p>
               <p>Smith. She said she would not ride two in a coach. They stopped about a quarter of an hour, whilst they went into the office; we staid in the coaches the while. Then we went to the Coach and Horses, in Holborn; we got out there, and had a pot of brandy-hot; we staid there about ten minutes; one of the prisoners paid for it: then we went into the separate coaches again, and went to an alehouse, near a turnpike, just before the turnpike;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100023"/> I don't know the sign: we did not get out of the coach; one of the waiters brought us a pint of wine; she had one glass, and I had a; I threw mine down in the coach, because I would not drink it: the prisoners between the two coaches. We went through the turnpike to Mother Red-Cap's; they ordered a dinner there: I believe this was at four o'clock. We both got out of the coaches, and went into the house; they sent out for steaks, and mutton chops, but could not get any; so we had some cold roast beer and bread and cheese for dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. What drink had you?</p>
               <p>Smith. When we went in we had a pot of brandy hot, and afterwards a pot of beer and two shillings worth of brandy punch. We staid there till after dark; the prisoners paid the reckoning; then we got into the coaches just as before.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you or your companion fuddled?</p>
               <p>Smith. No. She had a glass of brandy at coming out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she fuddled?</p>
               <p>Smith. She was not fuddled when she went into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she when she came out?</p>
               <p>Smith. I did not perceive that she was.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you was not fuddled?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. During all this time, till you got into the coach again, whilst you were at this house, were you friendly together?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes; very friendly: laughing and joking, and very agreeable together. We got in as before; Hewett's coach went first, we were a good way behind; about an hundred yards. I don't know how we came so far behind: we had been close together all the way going there. They drove from Mother Red-Cap's, on the road to Fig-lane; I did not know where it was. Johnson's coach stood still, whilst Hewett's coach drove on about a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Orbell get into the coach?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes; into Hewett's coach: he drove first, then Johnson followed him; our coach stopped just turning into <placeName id="t17710410-29-crimeloc158">Fig-lane</placeName>

Then I saw Hewett's coach, about an hundred yards before us, standing still; it was rather dusk; Hewett was upon his coach box. Then I left Johnson in his coach, and went up directly to Hewett's coach: I asked the young woman to let me ride with her; she consented; I opened the door, and got into the coach to her. As soon as I had got into the coach, and had sat down, Hewett came off his box and got into the coach, and began to use Orbell very ill; with that I jumped out.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by using her ill?</p>
               <p>Smith. He began to pull her about, and put his hands up her coats; she squalled out; I did not hear him say any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell where Johnson was at this time?</p>
               <p>Smith. I did not see him after I left his coach.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of you then?</p>
               <p>Smith. I stood against the coach door. I saw him pulling her about very much. Soon after I got out, she fell out of the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner?</p>
               <p>Smith. She fell upon her backside.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether she came down on the step to get out?</p>
               <p>Smith. She fell out with her backside next to the coach, and her head fell backwards under the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Hewett at the time she fell out?</p>
               <p>Smith. Next the other door of the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe he did any thing as she came out?</p>
               <p>Smith. No; he came out at the same door about a minute after she fell out. She screamed out, got up again, and walked about twenty yards down Fig-lane, before he came out of the coach: he followed her; she fell down just before he came up to her. I did not see Hewett get out of the coach; she had just fell down when he came up to her.</p>
               <p>Q. You say she walked twenty yards after she fell out of the coach; did you perceive whether she was hurt by the fall?</p>
               <p>Smith. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing after she came out of the coach?</p>
               <p>Smith. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she appear to have any hurt, as she walked along?</p>
               <p>Smith. No; none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether her head struck against any part of the coach?</p>
               <p>Smith. No; she did not seem to have hurt her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100024"/> head then. When Hewett came up, he began to pull her about, and d - n and c - e her; I did not hear any thing but oaths; she was then upon the ground; he pulled her about, and dragged her upon the ground by her legs: she was holding her petticoats down with one hand, and with the other she catched hold of a little stump; he pulled at her, but could not get her any further; he let her go, and then I ran away: I was much frightened. When I left her, she lay along on the ground, upon her back, and Hewett stood close by her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he speaking to her?</p>
               <p>Smith. No; only standing by her side.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she call out murder?</p>
               <p>Smith. When she fell out of the coach. I saw no more of her.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition was she when you left her? Was her cap, handkerchief, bonnet, or cloak off?</p>
               <p>Smith. They were all on when I left her.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish you could fix the spot, exactly, where you left her.</p>
               <p>Smith. I can't fix exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the roads that make a bow?</p>
               <p>Smith. It was a good way down the lane from that place.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the covers over her shift sleeves when you left her?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes; upon her elbows. I ran to the turnpike at Battle-bridge. I never saw or heard any more of her, nor of the coachman.</p>
               <p>Q. What made her fall the second time?</p>
               <p>Smith. I don't know; she fell upon her side.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she hit her head?</p>
               <p>Smith. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she speak when she fell the last time?</p>
               <p>Smith. No. She never spoke after we left Mother Red-Cap's together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her speak to the coachman when he was pulling her about?</p>
               <p>Smith. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was pulling her about in the coach, did not she bid him let her alone, or the like?</p>
               <p>Smith. No; she only screamed out.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got into the coach, did she appear to be sober, or how?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not see Johnson after you got out of the coach.</p>
               <p>Smith. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Johnson say any thing to you when he was getting into the coach?</p>
               <p>Smith. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you get out then?</p>
               <p>Smith. I thought he wanted to do something to me that I did not like.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet any carriages in the road, as you went to the turnpike?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes; two or three drays.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to the turnpike, when you met them?</p>
               <p>Smith. A very little way.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you at the turnpike before you saw a coach come?</p>
               <p>Smith. I did not see it; I heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say nothing to the turnpike-man?</p>
               <p>Smith. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not get assistance for your companion that you had left in such distress?</p>
               <p>Smith. I thought she would get away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see

               <p>Smith. The gentleman ordered me to go there.</p>

               <p>Smith. At my mother's at Knightsbridge; I lay that night with two servant maids of my acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you go to see for a place?</p>
               <p>Smith. I had caught the itch; I staid at home to cure myself.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you see Johnson's coach?</p>

               <p>Q. What did you say before the justice? did not you say the cause of her falling down was from some injury she received by falling out of the coach?</p>

               <p>Q. Had you no talk with the turnpike man about them?</p>

            . On a Thursday about two months ago, the night the young woman was killed, I was in Hampstead Road about six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you near the Crown alehouse?</p>
               <p>Martin. I was in it; facing the end of Fig-lane I saw two Hackney coaches stand, one just down Fig-lane, the other near the end of it; with the horses heads towards Pancrass; there were nobody on the boxes, and I saw no passengers.</p>
               <p>Q. How near together?</p>
               <p>Martin. About eight or ten yards; they were pretty close together; I staid about a quarter of an hour, or something more; I thought the coachman might be in there; I went with a view to get a cast to town; when I came out the coaches were gone away; I we nt down Fig-lane; and about thirty or forty yards down I saw something lying in the road.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the coaches standing there did you hear any noise or bustle in the lane?</p>
               <p>Martin. None at all; when I came up to it I found it was a woman; I said, you drunken hussey, or some such thing, what do you lie there for?</p>
               <p>Q. In what position did the body lie?</p>
               <p>Martin. It lay longways in the middle of the road; about one hundred yards from the end of the lane.</p>

               <p>Smith. Towards the turnpike house; I left her with her legs towards Pancrass.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know this Crown alehouse?</p>
               <p>Smith. I did not know that any house was near.</p>

             till we got a candle and lanthorn; I felt her arm cold; then I thought she was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any marks of violence about her at that time?</p>
               <p>Martin. I went back for a candle and lanthorn to the Crown; I met a coal cart and a broad wheel waggon at the entrance of the lane; I desired the drivers to stop, for I believed there was a woman dead in the lane. I went and got a candle and lanthorn; as I was coming back again a dray was coming from Pancras; we hollowed out to the man to stop; before he could stop his horses he had passed the body; a gentleman took the candle and lanthorn from me to look at the track of the wheel to see if it had passed over the body; it had passed a yard distance from her; we examined the wheel all round to see if there was any blood upon it, there was not any.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100026"/>Q. Was there any appearance as if any carriage had gone over the body?</p>
               <p>Martin. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the situation of her cloathes?</p>
               <p>Martin. Her petticoats lay down; her cap lay about a yard off; she had a black silk cloak lay about a yard from her body all over blood; the cloak laid opposite to her; there was a great deal of blood in the road by the body, and the cloak was in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was her hair bloody?</p>
               <p>Martin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You could see better when you came with the candle, had she any cap on?</p>
               <p>Martin. No; her bonnet lay near her head.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that bloody?</p>
               <p>Martin. I did not see; I never saw any handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any observation of her arms?</p>
               <p>Martin. There was some housewife cuffs, as they call them, down at her wrists; the blood came out of her ears, nose and mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the body?</p>
               <p>Martin. It was carried up to the Crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the body any more then?</p>
               <p>Martin. No; I saw the body again the Monday following at the Crown, it was stripped then; she had a cut in her temple; I think the right side; it seemed not to be done with a sharp instrument, but rather with a fall or a blow; her breasts and neck were black all the way down; and both arms were black; especially her left arm; and under her left side there seemed to be a scratch across her breast; two or three little scratches, as if done with nails.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the blood running out of her nose when you came to her, or was it clotted?</p>
               <p>Martin. One of the men took a garter to tie up her chin, and the blood run out of her nose; it was a frosty night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any observation how the body was? whether it was warm or not when you first touched it?</p>
               <p>Martin. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any stump in the road?</p>
               <p>Martin. None that I have ever seen; and I have been up and down the road many times.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any part of the body that was not black?</p>
               <p>Martin. It was all black as far as I saw; I saw no farther than about her breasts.</p>

            . I came up Fig-lane on the seventh of February about six in the evening; I was driving a dray; I heard a voice call out Johnson twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to be a man's or a woman's voice?</p>
               <p>Wright. A man's; I was going up towards the Duke of Bedford's gates; I met a coach; the coachman stopped; I did not see him till he came close to me, it was so foggy and dark, and being frosty the coach drove very smooth; he stopped and cried, Hollo! I said, Hollo again; he said, Where am I? I said, Don't you know? he said No, he had lost his road; he said he wanted to go to Grosvenor Square; I desired him to go further on and turn, and I would direct him in the road; he swore an oath, and said, No, he would not, and drove on; he passed on the off side of my horses; I was on the near side; he passed by towards the field side.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was this from where you afterwards found the body?</p>
               <p>Wright. About fifty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you called to soon after?</p>
               <p>Wright. In about two minutes after, or hardly so long, the man was coming with a candle and lanthorn, and said there was a dead body, and bid me stop, which I did as soon as I could stop my horses; I had passed the body about a yard; I observed a bruise on the left side of the temples; a gentleman came up on horseback; I desired him to let me have his horse to pursue the coachman; he said he could not spare it; her hair seemed pulled about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any blood?</p>
               <p>Wright. A great deal; when we went to move her she bled very fast from her nose, mouth, and ears; we asked the gentleman where we should take her to; he said to the firsthouse; four of us carried her to the Crown; she had neither cap, bonnet, nor handkerchief on; and had a bit of black ribband upon her wrist; she had something on both her hands.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you met the coach was it that you heard the person call Johnson?</p>
               <p>Wright. About five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the voice come from before or behind you?</p>
               <p>Wright. It came towards me as I went up.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100027"/>Q. How soon after that did you hear the wheels of the coach?</p>
               <p>Wright. It was just upon me soon afterwards; it was not above one hundred and forty yards from where I heard the voice.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you form any judgment whether the voice was the same as that of the coachman that spoke to you?</p>
               <p>Wright. I did not take so much notice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet any other coach?</p>
               <p>Wright. No.</p>

            . I stripped the body at the Crown alehouse, and examined the bruises; first I examined her head before she was stripped; her right jaw was broke; it was on Saturday, the day but one after this murder was committed; just behind her right ear her skull was broke and pushed in; there was a scratch upon her left temple, as if done against the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe on the throat?</p>
               <p>Wright. That was only dirty; her breast was scratched.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the blackness upon the breast and throat that of dirt or blows?</p>
               <p>Wright. I saw no blackness about her breast; the small of her right arm was black for the breadth of three fingers; she was black on the inside of her left arm; and the flesh was broke in through the skin as broad as the top of a finger.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the lower parts of the body?</p>
               <p>Wright. No further.</p>

            . I stripped the body on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. to Martin. When you first saw the body how did it lie?</p>
               <p>Martin. Lengthways in the road, upon her left side; her left side of her face upon her left arm; her arm was spread from her; and her right arm lay down upon her side; she lay right in the middle of the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Her head straight or inclined?</p>
               <p>Martin. It lay upon one side of her arm; she lay in a straight line upon the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Could a wheel have gone over the head and the two arms according to the position she was in?</p>
               <p>Martin. No, I think not.</p>
               <p>Q. You say she lay in the middle of the road; if a carriage had gone by was it possible to avoid the body?</p>
               <p>Martin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was room enough?</p>
               <p>Martin. Yes, on both sides to go past; she lay in the middle of the horse road; it is quite a level gravel road; there was room enough for a carriage to have passed on each side.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. As she lay straight a carriage might have gone over her, and each wheel have passed her without touching her?</p>
               <p>Martin. The horses could not miss her well.</p>
               <p>Court. The left arm lying extended out she must have been run over in some part?</p>
               <p>Q. to Martin. You are used to horses?</p>
               <p>Martin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual for them to go over a body if they can avoid it?</p>
               <p>Martin. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any appearance of a carriage or horses having been over it?</p>
               <p>Martin. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the cloak and hat appear as if squeezed in a rut?</p>
               <p>Martin. It was all squeezed among the blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it look as if naturally dropped into the blood, or pressed in by a wheel?</p>
               <p>Martin. It did not seem as if pressed in by a wheel.</p>
               <p>Murphy again. I saw her at the Crown; I stripped her; her skull was broke on the right side.</p>
               <p>Q. The skin broke?</p>
               <p>Murphy. Yes; her left jaw was broke; and from her shoulder to the flat of her arm she was very black; her left side seemed very much mortified within two ribs of her last rib.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the lower parts of her body; her legs or thighs?</p>
               <p>Murphy. Yes; there were no marks of violence there, nor upon any other parts of her body; but five or six marks on her left breast.</p>

They complained that they were almost starved, and begged I would give them a glass of something to drink; as they begged so hard, I went with them into a house of ill same in Butcher Row. We had one half crown bowl of punch, a pot of porter, and some negus. The girls kissed me, they desired I would stay all night with them; I told them they were welcome to the liquor, but I would have nothing more to do with them. This young man,

On the twenty-second of February, a woman told me the dust people had been there to take away the dust, and the maid had missed a silver spoon out of the fore kitchen. I went to the fore shop, and there the maid was accusing the prisoner of having taken the spoon.</p>

            . The prisoner and the woman were protesting their innocency: I saw two other dust men in the shop; I asked them if they knew any thing of a spoon; they said if there had been any thing taken out of the kitchen, it must be by that man. While I was talking to them, a woman that was supposed to be concerned, called one of my apprentices away to a passage, and shewed him the spoon behind a door; so I took the prisoner and the woman before Justice Sherwood. The prisoner confessed to his taking the spoon, and hiding it in that place; he said that he took the spoon out of the kitchen, and hid it behind the door; and said it was because he was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. When your apprentice found the spoon in the passage, what became of it?</p>
               <p>Dimes. He took it to the justice: I cannot swear to it; my wife can.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the spoon that was behind the door?</p>

I was alarmed by Mr. Richardson, an opposite neighbour, between one and two o'clock: I got up, and found my door open and a great croud about it; I went immediately over to Mr. Richardson; I found his son wounded. Upon examining my house, I found the counting house had been entered, and three desks broke open. Out of one desk was taken five guineas, eight half guineas, and a crown piece, and eighteen guineas more, from out of another desk, of my property: and five pounds, two shillings, and three pence, belonging to

            . The sash over my drawers was broke; it had a hole big enough to admit a little boy to pass through; it had been broke ten days before, and had not been mended. The street door was shut when I went to bed; I found it open when I got up. I went to the watch house: there I found the prisoner in custody of the watchmen; he was taken to Bridewell: upon searching him, only eighteen pence was found upon him, and a knife.</p>

            . I was alarmed by Mr. Richardson. There was a box in Mr. Moser's house, that was brought there to go by the waggon, that had been, over night, put under the desk in the counting house. The desk where I had put my money was standing open; the money Mr. Moser speaks of was lost out of the other desks; it was there over night; and, in the morning, this box, which was under one of the desks in the counting house, was gone out of that place. I heard the man was in custody; I went back to the house, and staid till Mr. Moser came. The box that was lost out of the counting house, was found by somebody in the street, who gave it to me.</p>

            . I am son-in-law to Mr. Richardson; I keep the Three Cups, opposite the prosecutor. I went to bed a little after twelve. I happened to look out of the window, and saw three or four men under it, and a little boy; they were swearing together: they crossed the street, and went to Mr. Moser's house: presently after that, I saw a light pass through the pane of glass over the door. I was alarmed; I went to my father, and called him; he got up, and opened his sash; then we saw this light: we went down stairs; I went along the street to see for a watchman, but found none: I came back again towards the house, and observed Mr. Moser's door was open. As I passed along, just as I came up to Mr. Moser's house back again, I saw three or four men and a woman run out of his house; one had that box in his hand which was afterwards picked up in the street; I ran after them, and caught the man that had the box: he dropped the box; we scuffled together; he, at last, wounded me in the back; I let him go, and he got away: my father caught the prisoner at the bar. When my father and I came down to the gate of the house, I saw three or four men, and a woman, go into the house, before I went to look for a watchman; and am very sure the prisoner was one of those that came out of the house when I came back. I was not gone above three minutes, in which time they got into the house, and rushed out again. As soon as I saw this man come out of the house, I gave the alarm to my father, and desired him to stop him; I ran after the man that had the box. As soon as that man that I engaged had got away, I saw my father engaged with the prisoner, and he had got him upon the ground. At the time this man ran out of the house, my father was not farther from Mr. Moser's door, than three or four houses.</p>
               <p>- Richardson. I live almost opposite; at the Three Cups. I got up at my son's alarm; I opened a window, and, looking at Mr. Moser's house, saw three or four people, with a woman among them, at Mr. Moser's door; I dressed myself, and opened the gate. In two or three minutes time, I saw Mr. Moser's door open, and two or three people rush out into the middle of the street: I pursued them about thirty or forty yards from the house, and overtook the prisoner. I am sure he is one of the men, for I had not my eye off him all the time, from his coming out of the house, till I laid hold of him. The constable came up; I gave him in charge, and they took him to the watch house.</p>

               <p>Sharpe. Yes; I did. My mistress gave leave for me to go with her; this was in the evening, between six and seven.

               <p>Q. Did you cry out all this while?</p>

               <p>Sharpe. No; not till after she held down my hands on each side.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say?</p>

               <p>Sharpe. I felt something hot and wet.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in your body?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. Yes; and I screamed out. I felt something hot and warm come from him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might he be about this?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. About half an hour.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100034"/>Q. From the time that you swear the woman came in, and held down your hands, before he had completed this act?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. It was above half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay at this house?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. All night. They locked me up.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go home to your mistress?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. In the morning; Mrs. Cove went home with me. I refused to have any supper. Mrs. Cove told my mistress, when she went home with me, that she was very sorry to keep me out all night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing of what had happened, to your mistress, before Mrs. Cove?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she stay?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. She went away immediately; she did not stay.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened after she went away?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. My mistress said I had not been in bed all night. I told her every thing the same as I have said now. She searched me; I was black and blue between my thighs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that yourself?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you bloody?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. Yes; my shift was all greasy and bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. When were these people taken up? how long after?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. A warrant was applied for to Justice Fielding, on Tuesday night, the second of March.</p>
               <p>Q. That was Saturday. What day of the week was it upon?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. I can't justly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the warrant was applied for on Wednesday?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. Yes; and they were taken up that day, and carried before Sir

               <p>Sharpe. It was that gentleman.</p>

               <p>Sharpe. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had this Cove ever called to see you at your mother's before?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. Yes, many times; she appeared very fond of me, and was always a kissing me; the man and woman went to bed; I got out of bed; they would have had me lie with them; I got out of bed, and sat in my shift in the fore room; their bed was in the back room; he laid upon her and said, It was all the pleasure in the world.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. She was not an acquaintance of your mistress's?</p>

               <p>Q. Was your mistress in a good or bad state of health; well or ill?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. Very well; she has got twins.</p>

               <p>Sharpe. A great while; she was an acquaintance of my mother's.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with her?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. A great while; she knew where I lived.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there nobody in the house but her?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. I saw nobody but her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you complain you had set up with your mistress for a shilling a week, and would do so no more?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is it from your mistresses to this house?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. I do not justly know; it is from Conduit-Court, in Long-Acre, to Wilde-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he had took your stomacher off before she went out; why did you let him do it?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. He took out my stomacher.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100035"/>Q. Why did you let him?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. The woman helped him; she held me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you after that attempt to go out of the room with this woman?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. I wanted to go out; they said, Stay, stay.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all the force used on you?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. No; the bed was most force.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you quiet after your stomacher was pulled out in that manner?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cry out?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. He put his hand on my mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before the woman went out for the beer?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. Both before and after.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the woman went out, and after he clapped his hand on your mouth?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. Yes, both before and after; my stomacher came out very easy.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was no need of the woman's holding you?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. They would not let me cry out.</p>
               <p>Q. You was at liberty to call out when she went out for the beer?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. She went out directly.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not cry out much till he hurt you on the bed?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. Not till his private parts hurt me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cry out or not before you was on the bed?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. Yes, a little; but not so much.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his hand on your mouth or breast before he went into the bed-room.</p>
               <p>Sharpe. On my breast.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you think he would hurt you before he went into the bed-room?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. He said he would stab me; he bade me not cry out. On the bed he throttled me; he pinched me on my throat that I could hardly swallow a bit of meat.</p>
               <p>Q. So you have not been able to swallow since the second of March? what was the price you and your mother insisted on to make you satisfaction?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. I do not know any thing about it; I never asked any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you sat in the outward room in your shift?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not put on your cloaths?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. They were in the next room on the bed; I was afraid to go for my cloaths; I was afraid to go near the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Does nobody live in the house?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. I did not see any body.</p>
               <p>Q. You was in the other room, why did you not call out for assistance?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. I was afraid of my life; he had the key of the door; he locked the fore room door.</p>

               <p>Q. During the whole of this time did you eat no supper?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. I eat nothing; I sat down in a chair.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to undress yourself?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. They pulled off my cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not undress yourself?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What, did the man take off your stays?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. He broke the lace from my boddice; he pulled off all my cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, what conversation had you with Mrs. Cove, going to your mistress's?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. She said, she would make me a present of a silk gown and silk handkerchief, if I would not tell my mistress.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not sick in the night, and came to bed again?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said, in the night he got out of bed again to you?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. Yes, but I would not go to bed.</p>

               <p>Leonard. Once before she came with a bundle from her mother.</p>

               <p>Leonard. On Monday night, the third or fourth of March, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say when she came to your house?</p>
               <p>Leonard. Sally went to the door to her; they spoke together in the passage; then both of them came in together; Cove asked me if I could spare her out a little to-night, or tomorrow night; I let her go that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand she was to come home that night?</p>
               <p>Leonard. Yes; she put up the shutters, and said, she would stay but a little while; that was all that passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Cove say what she wanted the girl to go for?</p>
               <p>Leonard. No.</p>

             say?</p>
               <p>Leonard. She begged my pardon for keeping her all night; she said, they had been talking till it was too late to bring her home. She went away directly.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed then, after she was gone, between you and the girl?</p>
               <p>Leonard. She said, she could not get away; that she undressed herself to go to bed, or that she was undressed, and the candle was blown out. She said, she refused going to bed, and sat without her cloaths all night. At breakfast she complained of her throat being very bad: I asked her what was the matter with her throat; she said, by a man that was there, and that she had been very badly used.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that her expression?</p>
               <p>Leonard. Yes; she said she would not go to that place again if they would give her a lapful of guineas. She pulled up her coats, and shewed me a place in her thigh like the marks of nails, scratched, and quite black about the middle of her thighs. She said, she wished her mother knew how she had been used; I told her I would let her mother know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say first, of her own accord, she wished her mother knew how she had been used?</p>
               <p>Leonard. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine her body?</p>
               <p>Leonard. Not till I fetched her mother. I went that day; she could not come then; she came the next morning between eight and nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find her?</p>
               <p>Leonard. Badly used.</p>
               <p>Q. You must lay aside ceremony on this occasion; how did she appear?</p>
               <p>Leonard. Very much inflamed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she appear as if she had been used by a man?</p>
               <p>Leonard. Yes; her mother has her shift; I saw it over night.</p>
               <p>Q. She stripped herself the night before her mother came, how did she appear?</p>
               <p>Leonard. There were marks of blood and grease upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. How had this girl behaved herself in your service?</p>
               <p>Leonard. Very sober.</p>
               <p>Q. You had work enough for her with your five children, was she busy and industrious?</p>
               <p>Leonard. Yes; a very handy girl.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she or not discover any light turn of disposition in her behaviour?</p>
               <p>Leonard. No, not at all.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. When she came home I suppose you rather rebuked her for being out all night?</p>
               <p>Leonard. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she tell you then?</p>
               <p>Leonard. She said she undressed herself to go to bed. She did not care at first to tell me, but she told me afterwards. They had promissed to give her a new gown not to tell her mother or me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say afterwards?</p>
               <p>Leonard. She said the candle was out, and she sat up all night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you why she staid out till bed time?</p>
               <p>Leonard. No; she said she set up without her cloaths all night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say why she did that?</p>
               <p>Leonard. She said she did not care to go to bed with a man and woman.</p>
               <p>Q. And she complained she was locked in?</p>
               <p>Leonard. Yes; she did afterwards. I asked her why she did not find her clothes; and if she was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you ask her if she was in liquor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100037"/> if she did not use to drink? Had she sat up all night before?</p>
               <p>Leonard. She sat up late that night to attend the children.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you ask if she was sober, or drunk, that she could not find her clothes?</p>
               <p>Leonard. Because I thought it very odd not to find her clothes. She said Mr. Cove could not find her tinder box; she had got a cold?</p>
               <p>Q. How long did her cold continue?</p>
               <p>Leonard. A good while.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before she began the story of her ill usage?</p>
               <p>Leonard. Some of it at breakfast; some sometime after. She said she would not tell the whole to any body but her mother.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray when did she pull off her clothes?</p>
               <p>Leonard. At eleven o'clock at night, to go to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the room with her?</p>
               <p>Leonard. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told that story?</p>
               <p>Leonard. No; she told the story at twelve o'clock at noon.</p>

               <p>Leonard. Between ten and eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she appear quite sober at that time?</p>
               <p>Leonard. Yes.</p>

She said her mistress asked where she was to go to; she said her family was gone from home, and she wanted her to keep her company: that her mistress gave her leave; and she went. She said that Dowling -</p>
               <p>Q. Did she mention his name?</p>
               <p>Molineux. She told me the story: that she brought her to her room, and bid her sit down; that she gave her a glass of rum, or brandy; rum I think; that she looked round the room, and Mrs. Cove asked what was the matter with her; she said, Mrs. Cove, this is not such a house as you used to have when my mother nursed you: she said, Never mind that; and then Dowling came in; she got up, begged his pardon, and was going away; (she did not know any thing of the gentleman ) he said, No, no; stay, my dear, you must not go away: that he pulled her stomacher out of her stays, and then afterwards abused her; and that Cove held her hands the while. Her throat was very much swelled and fore: the inside of the thick part of her thigh was scratched with nails; it was black and red.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine her private parts?</p>
               <p>Molineux. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they appear?</p>
               <p>Molineux. Very sore and red; her mistress and I examined them together.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the inspection you had of the girl, did it appear as if a man had carnal knowledge of her?</p>
               <p>Molineux. Yes; her linen was in a filthy, bloody condition, and greasy with grease that he put upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is your daughter?</p>
               <p>Molineux. Fifteen.</p>
               <p>Q. Has she been in service before?</p>
               <p>Molineux. She had lived at a pawnbroker seven weeks; their place was too hard for her.</p>

             standing by the fire along with this woman. There was a remnant of a pint of beer standing upon the table; I sent for another myself. I did not think, by the girl's behaviour, that she was sober; she begged to stay there all night: I consented to let her stay, and she did, all night, in my apartments. She said she would not stay to serve such a b - h of a mistress, for a beggarly shilling a week, to keep her up all night and day. She got up four different times in the night, and was sick. She puked all over the room, fell down, rolled in it about the room, and got into bed, four different times, of her own accord. I made many words, and would have got up to go away, the stench was so offensive, but could not tell where to go to sleep the remnant of the morning. She went away about seven o'clock in the morning. Her father came to me, in Newgate, last Monday, and told me his wife was a very honest woman, but a very covetous one: he said; he did not imagine I had got any money, because I was in gaol; but if I would get a friend to raise a little money, he would stop all the prosecution. I told him I had none; he asked me if I would give a bond: I said I would not. His answer was, if I did it would be of no utility, because I was in gaol: but, if I would send a friend to meet him that night, and lay down a trifle, he would stop all prosecution. I sent a friend to him last Monday night: he came to me again last Thursday; he claimed a bond, and five guineas down. I told Mr. Gore (the gentleman that came to me last Thursday) that I had no money, and he gave me sixpence he is here. I did not meddle with her.</p>

               <p>The girl was with me. She swore she would not go home to work for a b - ch of a mistress for a shilling a week; and she said that one of her master's lodgers had laid with her. Mr. Dowling never laid with her.</p>

            . I live in Blackman street, Clare market. I am a peruke maker. On Thursday, between twelve and one, I came here to look at the list where the prisoners names are; I could not find the name of Dowling. I came from the place about a yard or two, and stood by a man that I found afterwards to be the girl's father in law, Molineux. H e was quite a stranger to me. I asked him if he could inform me whether Mr. Dowling's trial was over; he said it was not. He asked me if I knew Mr. Dowling; I said I had been acquainted with him five or six years, and was sorry for his present situation. He replied, that if he had made any proposal that was clever and genteel it would never have come to what it is now; but that there was a man called on him, and had offered him two guineas; but that his answer was that that would not do; it would not pay the expences he had been at; and that he farther offered to be bound, in a bond with Dowling, as far as twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you, prisoner, wish to have this evidence given. This is evidence, as this man gives it, that you had sent a man to compromise this matter, and had offered to be bound with you, so far as twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Gore. He said, I should be willing to make it up. He said he would ease it, rather than take life away. I asked upon what terms; he said, if Dowling would give five guineas, and a bond for fifteen more, payable at six shillings a week, he would make it up. I went to the prisoner, and told him; he said he had not got a farthing in the world to help himself. Molineux then said he must proceed.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen Molineux since?</p>
               <p>Gore. Once or twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been at his house?</p>
               <p>Gore. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100039"/>Q. How do you know it is Molineux?</p>
               <p>Gore. Molineux is here in court.</p>
               <p>(Molineux comes forward, and is sworn.)</p>
               <p>Court. Look at Gore; have you seen him before?</p>
               <p>Molineux. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any discourse with him about making up this prosecution?</p>
               <p>Molineux. I said, I do not know: he said, if it could be done between me and my wife, it would be better. I said, I am not her father, only her father-in-law; she must do as she pleases; I had no notion of doing it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Gore come up to you and speak first?</p>
               <p>Molineux. Yes; I never saw him till he was at the lift.</p>
               <p>Court. This evidence is not material; here is the father-in-law of the girl; the jury will judge of Mrs. Leonard's evidence, and suppose this father-in-law was, upon an overture of the prisoner, inclined to take a sum of money; is that to stifle such a prosecution as this, or to contaminate the other evidence, and sought out by their own witness, appears to a demonstration.</p>

               <p>Riley. Yes; the rooms are very small, and the wainscots thin. I was up and down the stairs several times to let my lodgers in, and see the doors were fast. I was up stairs, and came down to let them in.</p>

               <p>Mr. Wathen. I am a surgeon, and live in Bartholomew lane; I was desired on the twenty-sixth of February to attend the coroner's jury to examine the body of an infant which was said to be murdered. I went to Mr. Lang's in Great Westminster-street; the child was in a copper, from whence it was taken out; the copper had water in it, which was covered with ice; from under which the child was taken out; it was a male child. I found a very large wound upon the fore part of its neck; in which was divided the windpipe, the gullet, or throat, the large arteries, which we call carotas, on both sides the jugular veins, and the lateral muscles of the neck on both sides also; the wound was so deep as also partly to separate the spine of the neck.</p>
               <p>Q. By that you mean from the upper part of the back bone?</p>
               <p>Wathen. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the head, according to your description, was almost cut off?</p>
               <p>Wathen. Yes; it hung only by the back muscles of the neck, and part of the spine of the neck which was not divided. I gave it then as my evidence, as I do now, that the wound was mortal.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you form any judgment by your observation how long the wound might have been given; was it a fresh wound?</p>
               <p>Wathen. A fresh wound; it was under the ice in water; it was impossible to say the period.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a fresh wound?</p>
               <p>Wathen. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it bled?</p>
               <p>Wathen. It had no appearance of blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to have bled?</p>
               <p>Wathen. It must certainly have bled if it had been alive.</p>
               <p>Q. According to the best of your judgment was there any appearance that looked to you as if it had bled?</p>
               <p>Wathen. I think it had bled.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us the reasons of your judgment that it had bled?</p>
               <p>Wathen. Only the vessels being divided, and the child being full grown; therefore I suppose it to have been alive.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100043"/>Q. I will ask you, in fact, was the child at its full growth?</p>
               <p>Wathen. It appeared so to be; it was as large as most children I have seen at full growth.</p>
               <p>Q. By the other appearance of the child was it at its full growth?</p>
               <p>Wathen. It appeared to be so in every respect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any observations of any kind by which you could say the child had been once alive?</p>
               <p>Wathen. Certainly it had been so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it so after it was born?</p>
               <p>Wathen. I cannot say. I did make an experiment on the lungs, which was formerly thought decisive; but now that opinion is exploded, that a child that had been still born had not the lungs inflated with air.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Wathen. She was in the work house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine her?</p>
               <p>Wathen. No; she said she was the person that was delivered of the child.</p>
               <p>Q. What day did you see her?</p>
               <p>Wathen. The twenty-sixth; after I had seen the child; she had not confessed this affair in full before I asked her, How could you do such a thing as this; I suppose it was unpremeditated? she did not confess positively, she replied it was unpremeditated; she said she did not know how she did it; or which way she did it; she said she had provided child bed linen and a lodging, and was going away, I think, from her mistress's; that she did not know what she did.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose the wound was made with some sharp instrument?</p>
               <p>Wathen. I asked her with what; she said she could not tell with what she did it.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot form any judgment how long the wound had been given?</p>
               <p>Wathen. I was informed it was done the day before; and I saw no reason to dispute the truth of that from the appearance of the wound.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether it might be impossible in the separation of the child, supposing a person to be delivered in the dark, for such an accident to happen in the separation?</p>
               <p>Wathen. I do not think it probable; it appeared too much like a wound made by a sharp instrument; such a wound as that would be a very irregular laceration.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know whether the navel string might be entangled round about the neck?</p>
               <p>Wathen. I do not; the navel string was not tied or cut; it was broke off; it appeared as if the placenta had been torn off; it was five or six inches long.</p>
               <p>Q. Sometimes I believe it happens to be intangled round the neck; there are instances of it?</p>
               <p>Wathen. There are instances of it; and strangulation very possibly may arise there-from.</p>
               <p>

            . I live next door to Mr. Lang. I found the child on the twenty-fifth of February between twelve and one at noon, the day before Mr. Wathen saw it, in a copper of water at Mr. Lang's; the copper was in a shed in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there ice upon the water at that time?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. Yes; loose ice; the ice was broke; it was a thaw; then the child had its throat cut in the manner Mr. Wathen has given an account; the prisoner was by me at the time I found it.</p>
               <p>Q. He came you to look into this copper?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. Mrs. Lang came and told me she suspected her maid servant had been delivered of a child; I went directly; she let us in at the first door; we asked her if she had not been delivered of child; she said, No; then Mr. Ingam looked about the house for the child in places.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner with you all the time?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. Yes; we went into the yard; the prisoner went with us there; we looked first down the necessary; we looked into the copper hole, and then into the copper.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see the child through the water?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. No; the water was very bloody; the child was to the bottom; the water was all over bloody; I put a stick in the water and, and the child came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing while you was looking into the copper?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. She said it was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say when you had poled the child up?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100044"/>Jornagan. I believe she made no answer at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her say any thing about this child?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. No; we questioned her no more after we had found the child; I only asked if she had provided any thing for it; she said, Yes, she had some little things for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see any thing she had provided for it?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. No; I went away; the officers were sent for to take her away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any instrument of any kind?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. I found a knife, before I found the child, in a porridge pot that stood in the sink, very near the copper.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a knife?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. A common case knife; it was bloody; the blood was towards the handle.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any blood in the shed, besides on the knife and in the water?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. No; I saw none no where else; I taxed her with cutting the child's throat after I found the knife, before I found the child. She denied it, and said, She was surprised how I could accuse her.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw no blood any where but on the knife?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. No, not in the shed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was no drops of blood on the floor?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. None in the yard; there was in a closet in the kitchen, on the floor, several drops of blood; while I was out, taxing her of having the child in the kitchen, I saw several drops of blood fall from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that they came from under her petticoat?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. To be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether the child was born alive or no?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. I cannot say; it was at its full growth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear how long it had been cut?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. It could have been cut but a little while, because the blood on the knife was fresh.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean that morning?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. It must have been in a few hours.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw some drops of blood in the kitchen in a closet?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. Yes; and on the kitchen floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a dark or a light closet?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. A dark one.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she to go away that morning?</p>
               <p>Jornagan. Mrs. Lang was to discharge her that morning; the girl said she had the rheumatism; she had desired to be discharged.</p>

            . I live at Mr. Snell's, in Austin Friars, Mr. Lang is in partnership with my master. Mrs. Lang came to my master's counting house on 25th of February, between twelve and one o'clock. My master came to me, and desired I would go to the counting-house, and see Mrs. Lang: however I did not. She desired me to go to her house, for nobody was with her children but Mrs. Jornagan: I went directly, and left Mr. Lang in the counting house. I went into the kitchen; the prisoner was setting up against the wainscoat upon a chair. Mrs. Jornagan seemed to be in a fright. I said I hoped things were not so had as was expected. She said it was; and if I would go to the copper I should see. A little while after, Mrs. Jornagan said, let us take it out of the copper. She took a stick to raise it up with. I asked the prisoner how she was; and whether she would have any thing hot; she made me no answer. Mrs. Jornagan reached the child up; I saw its throat cut, but did not examine it.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the water?</p>
               <p>Davis. I cannot say; it looked very red; it looked something discoloured. Mrs. Jornagan shew'd me the knife; I said, it is not bloody. She said, it has been wash'd then. I went into the kitchen; she was sitting in the same posture as when I went out. I said, O Lord, what have you done! she made me no answer, and did not even look towards me: soon after the parish officers came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear the prisoner say any thing about it?</p>
               <p>Davis. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any blood on the floor?</p>
               <p>Davis. No; I did not see any.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to the copper you left the woman sitting in the kitchen, and found her there when you came back again?</p>
               <p>Davis. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you have been at the copper?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100045"/>Davis. Not long.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the water was not much discoloured with blood?</p>
               <p>Davis. It had a brownish colour. I did not take any up out of the copper.</p>
               <p>Q. Not red; not like bloody water?</p>
               <p>Davis. It was not red.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you said before the coroner you thought that the girl was out of her senses?</p>
               <p>Davis. I was with her about ten minutes; she and I and the children, when Mrs. Jornagan was gone to finish her dinner. She sat in the same posture; I don't know that she stirr'd hand or foot: she seemed in a stupefy'd way, as if she had just come out of a fit.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether there were any things found in her box?</p>
               <p>Davis. Last Saturday I saw Mrs. Lang take some small things out of the servant's box; they were given me, and I carried them back, as the trial did not come on.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you them now?</p>
               <p>Davis. They are here.</p>

               <p>Mr. Wathen. It would have been very deeply tinged.</p>
               <p>Q. If the child was born dead it would have been but little discolour'd?</p>
               <p>Wathen. Yes; if the child was born alive there must have been a large effusion of blood certainly, whatever became of it; there must have been ten or twenty times more blood than I perceived. The blood would have been coagulated, which would not have escaped me; there must have been a great effusion of blood, which must have been done something with.</p>

On Thursday,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100047"/> the twenty-first of March, a gentleman's servant came to me, to pay me two shillings for some cloaths I had scowered for him: he wanted change for a five and three pence; I gave it him. He had put the five and three pence down; I thought I had taken care of it. After I had given him the change, I asked him to go and drink with me: I was going out of the shop to give him some beer, but he was in a hurry, so I took him up stairs and gave him a dram; then he went away. I went to give my wife some money, and missed this five and three pence. I went, immediately, and asked the prisoner about the five and three pence; he said he saw the gentleman's servant put it down upon a board, and did not know what became of it. For further satisfaction, I went after the man that paid the five and three pence, and brought him back. He said, my man saw him put the five and three pence upon the board. The prisoner insisted that he knew nothing what was become of it; I insisted upon it that he should be searched; we sent for a constable; the prisoner pulled off all his cloaths but his stockings, we did not find the five and three pence. My wife asked if he had been searched; we gave her an account of it: she insisted upon his stockings being pulled off; in consequence of which, one stocking was pulled off: then the prisoner said, if the constable would go with him over the way, to a court he named, he would shew him where the five and three pence was; the constable and he went together, and came back soon after. The constable produced the five and three pence: then the prisoner owned he had taken the five and three pence. I said to him, How came you to do this? The prisoner said he believed the devil made him do it. I bid him go along out, and never come there any more: he complained he had no money; I gave him six-pence, and sent him about his business. In about an hour after, when I came in, I found the prisoner there abusing my wife, and saying they could do nothing with him for taking the five and three pence. Then I ordered the constable to take him in charge.</p>
               <p>The constable confirmed this evidence, and added, that, in the court, he pulled his stocking off, and took the five and three pence out of the foot of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I know nothing of the five and three pence the servant put down upon the board; I found this five and three pence, as I was crossing the way, in the street. When my master said he would fetch the constable again, I said I would stay and see what the constable would do.</p>

I had seen the prisoner loitering about the door, and suspecting him, I watched him; he took the piece off the counter; he reached, and laid hold of the piece; he was not entirely within the door, I believe; he reached his hand out, and took it; he carried it off: I pursued him directly.

            . I live at Mr. Morgan's in Lincoln's-inn-fields. I am a hosier. The prisoner made me a pair of shoes; he brought them home this day six weeks. He asked me to take a walk to see the synagogue in Duke's Place. As we were going up Cornhill, we heard a great cry of Stop thief, stop thief. The prisoner said, he would go and see what was the matter; we were then about an hundred yards beyond the Royal Exchange, in Cornhill.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did the cry of Stop thief come?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. They went towards Leadenhall-market. He left me, and said, he would come to me presently; - he went towards Leadenhall-market; the mob was before us; he ran and joined the mob. I staid some time, and he did not come home; they told me at last, that he was taken up for stealing something out of a shop; I heard that at his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. About five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to see him?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. Not till about a fortnight or three weeks after. I went directly home to my lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave you an account at the prisoner's lodgings that he was taken up?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you the curiosity to enquire where he was gone, or what was become of him?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. I did not trouble my head about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you think it extraordinary, that an innocent man should be taken up for this thing? Did not you see him?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. I did not know where; I set out, five days after, for Leicester.</p>
               <p>Court. That will not do.</p>
               <p>Mitchell. I can't say any more.</p>
               <p>Court. But I have something more to say to you. You was told he was taken up?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. Yes, I asked the people, but they could not inform me where he was gone to.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. They said he was taken up for shop-lifting.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know at whose house?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived in London?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. Eight years; I have lived with lord Waltham, and the biggest noblemen in the land.</p>
               <p>Q. So you would persuade me and the jury, that you that have lived in London eight years, did not know how to find out a man that was taken up for shop-lifting? How came you not to find him out, and give your testimony in his favour, that he was innocent, as you had been with him the whole time?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. I have nothing more to say.</p>
               <p>Court. But you must have something more to say.</p>
               <p>Mitchell. I thought no harm would come of it, because I knew he was innocent, so I did not give myself any further trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. And so you suffered this innocent man to lie in gaol, and never went near him, nor gave him any assistance till a fortnight ago? How did you find out then where he was?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. By a friend of his.</p>
               <p>Q. Who might it be?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. Mrs. Hart; I met her in the street; she told me; that is about a fortnight ago.</p>
               <p>Q. In what street?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. In Newgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she tell you?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. That he was in Newgate for the affair that happened when I was with him. I have no more to say.</p>
               <p>Q. So you went to Newgate?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go that same day?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. No, the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where Messrs. Grace and Kennedy live?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you where the house is he is accused of stealing the goods from?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. I do not indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. to Lancaster. Do you know any thing of that man?</p>
               <p>Lancaster. I cannot positively swear to the man; I think I have seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Lancaster. I am not certain whether I have or not.</p>

            , an acquaintance of his?</p>
               <p>Josephs. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to Lancaster. You said you watched the prisoner, and saw him come i and take the cloth, and then run away; had you your eye upon him?</p>
               <p>Lancaster. He was never out of my sight till I got hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a great number of people?</p>
               <p>Lancaster. No, but few; nobody pursued him but myself and the other evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no crowd of people then intercepted your view of him?</p>
               <p>Lancaster. No; he was never more than five or six yards before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been any alarm that afternoon before this happened?</p>
               <p>Lancaster. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen 
               <persName id="t17710410-41-person477">
                  Mitchell

                  </persName>
             that day?</p>
               <p>Lancaster. I had seen somebody with the prisoner that ran the other way: I do not recollect that I saw Mitchell at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard what Mitchell has said; have you any doubt now that the prisoner is the man?</p>
               <p>Lancaster. Not in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it?</p>
               <p>Lancaster. Almost dusk; the lamps were lighting.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hall. You say you saw the prisoner come out with linen on his left arm?</p>
               <p>Hall. Yes; somebody opened the door from the inside; he threw the linen down, and then he ran into the middle of the highway. Mr. Lancaster pursued him, and cried, Stop thief. He was never out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Mr. Kennedy's above the 'Change?</p>
               <p>Hall. About three hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Hall. It wanted about twenty minutes of six.</p>
               <p>Q. to one of the Jews. What time did your Synagogue begin about the first of March?</p>
               <p>A Jew. About five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mitchell. You may have an opportunity of explaining any thing you have said, or correcting it, if you have made a mistake; now what do you say?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. I have spoke as far as my abilities will allow to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you now swear that there was a crowd in the street?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. A great many people, the prisoner said he would run and see what was the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the prisoner ran at all, was there a cry of Stop thief?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You and the prisoner were walking along quietly together when you heard the cry of Stop thief?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. He was before me about ten yards; he stopped to tell me there was a cry of Stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear this cry?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. No.</p>
               <p>Q. After the prisoner had said he would go and see what it was; which way did he go?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. Towards Leadenhall market.</p>
               <p>Q. What side of Cornhill was you on?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. The right-hand side.</p>
               <p>Q. What side was he?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. The right-hand side, both of us.</p>
               <p>Q. In the foot way?</p>

               <p>Mitchell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he run along in the same foot-way, or did he go along the middle of the street?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. He was gone in a moment; I could not see.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say about the time?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. It was between five and six, very near six to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100050"/>Q. Which way did you go to his lodgings afterwards?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. Through Leadenhall Street.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must have gone by Leadenhall market?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. Yes; the crowd was all gone when I went by there; I stopped some time where I was; I followed the crowd gently on.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of that crowd?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. I can't tell; I never like to interfere in a crowd.</p>
               <p>Q. What side of Leadenhall Street did you go down?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. The left-hand side; I crossed the way at the pastry cook's.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you might stay long enough to see your friend come back?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. No; I kept walking on.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you wait for him?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. Two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you expected to meet him in the crowd. You did not stay to see what happened?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. No; I always keep from a crowd.</p>
               <p>Court. I think you was right not to stay. Both these gentlemen saw this man come out of the shop, and he was never out of their sight; how do you account for this?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. People might run; I cannot be accountable for that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you suppose they are mistaken with regard to this man, that it was not him?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not suppose your friend ran along after he had left you, and committed this felony, do you?</p>
               <p>Lancaster. We brought him back in less than four minutes; if he had been there we must have met him.</p>
               <p>Q. This synagogue began before six, I believe, at that time?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. I do not know; he asked me if I would take a walk and see it.</p>
               <p>Q. He said you desired to see it?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. I asked him if he could shew it me; he said he could.</p>

            . On the first of March, I was down at the end of Fleet Market, when the Welch gentlemen were going in possession to St. Bride's. I observed the two prisoners were attempting to pick pockets, I kept my eye upon them all the way to Ludgate, and I saw Lane put his hand into the prosecutor's left hand pocket, as he stood to see the procession; and pulled this handkerchief about half way out. The prosecutor turning round, he stood as if unconcerned, gaping about. The prosecutor was earnest in seeing the people come by, then they came close up to him, and surrounded his pocket; then Mullock took his handkerchief quite out, and was putting it into his bosom. They stood together; they immediately made off. I told the gentleman he had lost his handkerchief; he felt in his pocket, and said, he had, Mr. Kinman seeing it, seized Mullock; I saw him immediately drop the handkerchief; I picked it up; the other ran across the way between two coaches. I seized him, and we took them to the Counter. The prosecutor said, if the handkerchief was his, there was a P on one corner of it, which there was.</p>

            . I was going to St. Bride's church, after I had lost my handkerchief, between two and three o'clock; there was a great crowd just by <placeName id="t17710410-43-crimeloc231">St. Bride's chu</placeName>

I was obliged to stop in the crowd; I had not been there a minute before the prisoner picked my pocket of my watch, a silver one; it had a gold and a silver cornelian seal to it. I felt my watch going out, and saw it in the prisoner's hand; he was about a yard from me then. I took hold of his collar, and said, he had got my watch; he said, No Sir, I have not got it; he dropt it, I picked it up. I did not let him go.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Whether in so great a crowd you might not mistake me for somebody else?</p>

Coming from Shoe Lane, from the springer and liner's, I went into the cook's shop in Salisbury Court, to dinner; coming from dinner to go home, I came through a great crowd of people. When I came close to the gentleman, he said, I had his watch; I told him I had no such thing, I know nothing of it. He laid hold of me, and said, I had his watch; I said, No, I had not; he said, he would do for me. A gentleman with him, said, he should have some fun now, and wanted to duck me. I said, let me have justice done me; they dragged me up the court that leads to St. Bride's church. I said to a constable, There Sir, take me into custody and see me used well, for these gentlemen want to molest and duck me. The constable took me, he said he would take care of me. He asked me if I had any money. He said, will you have a coach, I said, Yes, I had a coach to the Counter, and paid for it. This man, when I was going into the coach, held up his fist, and said, Ah, you villain, I'll transport you.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. Did you talk of ducking this man?</p>
               <p>Price. I never mentioned a word of that sort. Some of the Bridewell boys came up and wanted to abuse him; I told him they should not abuse him by any means. I never attempted to strike him or do any thing to him.</p>

I observed a good many things upon the parlour floor, a pair of shoes, and a hat, and a joiner's tool or instrument; in the back parlour my bureau was broke open, and a great number of papers scattered about the room; my pocket book was taken away, in which was a bank note of 20 l. that was taken away from the upper part of the bureau; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100052"/> saw it there the night before; there was a silver waiter taken from the fore parlour; and the silver table knives and forks gone from off the slab; from some drawers in my bureau I lost a number of callico shirts, muslin neckcloths, seven pair of cotton stockings, and four pair of silk, and certain other goods; the sash of the middle window was up, and the shutters pushed back; there are three windows in the dining room; I suppose the persons got up by the lamp iron.

            . I am a constable. Upon the eighteenth of March, Mr. Sinclair got a warrant to search Pollock's house, in Brown's Gardens, St. Giles's; we searched it next morning. There is a little press upon the right hand, going into the kitchen; in one of the drawers, was a quantity of old stockings, among which Mr. Sinclair pulled out these; I have had them, ever since, in my custody. Pollock was not at home; I went to him next morning, when he was at home; he went with me to Sir

            . I used to keep my money in my waistcoat pocket: I had lost some; and, in order to find out who stole it, I marked some money, put it into my pocket, an d hung my coat and waistcoat over a door, near the back door, over night. The prisoner was a chair woman; she was to come next morning; I set a person to watch her. When I came down, I missed a guinea out of my purse; and the person that watched her, told me he saw her take it. I sent for a constable; she took it out of her pocket; and there was the mark on it. (Produces it: the mark was very visible.)</p>
               <p>- Spencer. Mr. Cowderoy set me to watch the prisoner: as soon as she rung at the gate, I secreted myself; I saw her go to the prosecutor's cloaths; she took the bag out of his pocket; she opened it, and poured the money into her hand; she put a guinea into her mouth whilst she put the rest of the money into the bag, and then she put the guinea into her pocket. I gave Mr. Cowderoy information of it; he charged a constable with her, and then she pulled it out of her pocket.</p>

I missed some more next day that we had dined on. I remember that the prisoner had been at my house that day soon after we had dined. I afterwards found three of my plates at Mr. Crowland's.</p>
               <p>- Crowland. I have known the prisoner some years. He brought some plates to me to sell, and said they were his mother's; among which was this cracked plate. He came the next day very much confused, and wanted the cracked plate again, and said his mother charged him with stealing it. I bid him fetch his mother; which he did. His mother said she had sent him with all the plates. Then he said it was not his mother, but Mr. Law charged him with stealing them.</p>

The prisoner had mentioned that he wanted a float of Riga timber, and of memble. When the prisoner wanted timber, he spoke to us, and we used to bring the timber down to the Three Cranes, there it was delivered into the care of the wharfinger's man, and so it was conveyed to the prisoner: we delivered it at the Three Cranes, and settled accounts afterwards with him; and the constant rule was, we were paid twenty shillings a load for all timber brought in that manner. We did, upon New-year's day, about four in the morning, take out of Mr. Smith's dock, at Batterses, these four pieces of Riga timber: we got five pieces at another place, we dropped them all down at the Three Cranes, and delivered them to Brackstone; to the order, and for the use of Griffin. We had no opportunity of settling the account with Griffin, because we were taken up before we could do it. This timber was to be served upon the same terms as the rest of the timber was. These were delivered with the marks; Griffin has seen us, many times, raze them out. We used to meet at the house of one Birt, at Chelsea Reach, and from there we used to go out and survey the timber; we afterwards met the prisoner at the Wilkes's Head, in Houndsditch; there half the money was advanced; not the whole of it: there was no regular settlement of the account.</p>

               <p>- Brackstone. I am servant to the wharfinger at the Three Cranes; I know Lyon and Griffin. Lyon has several times brought timber down for Griffin, particularly upon the seventh or eighth of February; I think, Riga timber. Griffin used to employ a name-sake, one Griffin, who used to carry his timber for him, and generally had his orders, against the timber came down: so I went not to Griffin, the prisoner, but to his carman, Griffin, and told him some timber was come for Griffin; the carman came, and carried it away.</p>
               <p>- Griffin. I am a carman; I do business for the prisoner. There was, upon the seventh or eighth of February, nine sticks of Riga timber; I do not know the precise quantity, but I know the number of feet: I delivered it at Mr. Rudduck's yard, in Skinner-street, by order of Griffin; the prisoner had been with him the day before, and told him there would be this quantity of timber come down, that or the next day.</p>

            . I am a carpenter; I applied to the prisoner in consequence of a conversation I had with Mr. Pricklow, which led me to suspect the prisoner was concerned in some illicit traffick; I went to him and talked about some laths. I went to a publick house with him, and then told him I heard he had some timber to sell; he said, Right, he had some timber to sell; he asked who told me; I mentioned the party. I said I wanted sixty or seventy loads; he said he could not serve me with so much; then I said it would not signify. He asked me what time I should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100055"/> want to use it; I said I should be six or eight weeks in using it up; he said he had two captains that could serve me in that time: he asked where it should be sent to; I feigned a place of delivery, not real; I said such a place in Whitechapel; he said he believed it would be no great difference in the price; he paid 4 s. a load for carriage home, and would deliver it; I asked the price; he said two pound five shillings. I asked who was to pay the carriage; he said he was to pay the carriage. I said, Then you have but forty-one shillings for your load of timber? I asked him how he was to be paid; he said in money, he was a poor man; I said that was not the usual way, I should have two month's credit; I went so far, and said, I am rather suspicious of these gentlemen; I am not suspicious of you; I doubt these captains of yours; I should not care to deal with you unless you can indemnify me, without there is a proof of their property in this timber. I then said, I observed your timber in Tomlinson's yard had the marks razed out; Pray how came that? the prisoner appeared very much confounded when I first made the observation; after some time he recovered himself; he first said, That is to myself; afterwards he said, that the cause is, I used not to raze the marks, and my people told where I bought the timber. then I razed the marks because other people bought it over my head. We then agreed that the first load, consisting of eighteen sticks of Riga timber, should be delivered the Monday following; I went and told my friend what I had done; we went upon 'Change next day to several people concerned in the trade to take advice; they encouraged me to proceed; the timber was not delivered. Upon the Thursday following I met the prisoner again in Moorfields, and asked after the timber; he said, You shall have it, Master. I said, I have altered my mind; I will not have it delivered in White Chapel, as I said before, but in my own yard in Skinner-street; the prisoner seemed very well satisfied, and said I should have it on Monday next. It did not come on Monday; I received a note on Wednesday, which signified that the timber was got to the Three Cranes, but could not be brought up till the next day, upon account of the pavement; next day half a float came, consisting of these nine sticks; the prisoner brought to me a bill of parcels for that timber.

            . I live at the Red House at Battersea, close by the side of the river, opposite Chelsea Reach; my house is about a quarter of a mile from Smith's timber dock; I have seen the prisoner and the two Lyons together at my house often; they used to come in and go out upon the walks. I saw them about a month before Lyon was taken up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I did assist the Lyons in the selling this timber to Mr. Rudduck. I did not act for myself; the Lyons had told me that they had a parcel of timber to sell for a friend of theirs that was insolvent; therefore upon Mr. Rudduck's pressing me to know if I would direct him to any body from whom he might buy timber, I did tell Lyon that Mr. Rudduck would buy his timber; and as soon as Lyon had sent it to the Three Cranes I sent Rudduck word of it; it is not truth what Rudduck says, that I agreed for forty-five shillings, nor sent the bill of parcels.</p>
               <p>He called a number of witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

On the first of April, about six in the evening, an opposite neighbour, Mr. Norgrave, told me something was stolen; I followed the prisoner, Smith; down Pennington-street, there I overtook him with the bedstead, already tied up as the men brought it home. I cried, Stop thief; he asked me how I had the impudence to take hold of him with the bedstead. I said it was my property. He made a great noise, at first; at last, he took the bedstead back, and put it in the same place it was before. He said, before the justice, that he bought it of my wife, and that he left a woman to pay for it. I am certain it was my bedstead.</p>

            . Just at six o'clock in the evening, I was in my own house; I saw the prisoner take a bedstead from the prosecutor's door; he fell backwards with it against the house; the corner of the house kept him up. He stood for two or three minutes; the woman gave him a sign when she thought it safe to take it; he staid two or three minutes before he took it, then the woman assisted him; he ran down Nightingale-lane with it. I went over, and told the prosecutor; he pursued him: I went after him. The prisoner said, when the prosecutor stopped him, that it was his own property, and he would swear a robbery against him. We persuaded him to bring it back: he said he left the woman to pay for it. He said, before the justice, that he paid the prosecutor's wife for it: first he said one thing, then another.</p>
               <p>Jennet Thompson. I am wife to the prosecutor. I saw the prisoner about the door: I never sold him any, nor took earnest for any.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was in a publick house with my wife: I sat down half an hour: a man came in, and wanted a porter; I agreed to carry the bedstead for him; I bid my wife stay. The man put it on my shoulder; I went down after him; I could not overtake him: the people cried out, Stop thief; my wife came out. When they found she was my wife, they took her to the justice. Thompson is her maiden name; she is my wife. Lord have mercy upon my soul, what a hard case it is!</p>

In a box of his, which was not locked, we found the things mentioned in the indictment. It was a thin cloth; it seemed to be part of a parcel of cloth which belonged to Captain Webb, who was going to the East-Indies, and wanted it thin for that hot climate. The prisoner was so struck, that, without any solicitation or promise, he fell down on his knees, begged pardon, and acknowledged that he had stolen these goods from us.</p>
               <p>- Noakes. I am a constable. I searched the prisoner's lodgings, and found the goods in his box. The prisoner, first, said he bought them in White-horse-Yard; afterwards, I heard him say something about being merciful. I did not hear his confession.</p>

Last Tuesday was fortnight, between two and three in the evening I went to the Crown alehouse in White's yard, Nightingale lane. I did not know the way, so I inquired. One Robinson came up to me, and said he would shew me; he carried me to the prisoner's, Hancock's, house. I said that was not the place. She said it was her lodging. She took hold of me, and wanted me to send for something to drink. She began to feel about my pockets; I had half a guinea loose in my waistcoat pocket; I put my hand into my pocket to save the half guinea. I took it out in my hand; I don't know whether she saw me take it out or no, but she got it out of my hand. I struggled with her; she handed it to

I went away for fear of my life. I took them up next day. Hancock was very abusive: she said she would swear before the justice that I gave her the half guinea for to bugger her; they were carried before the justice, and were committed.</p>

            . The prisoner deposed that he was a formast-man, on board the King David, that captain Broad was then first mate, and Scott fourth mate. That he saw captain Broad knock Scott down twice with a blunderbuss, near the windlass; that then he struck the cock in his breast twice; that he then punched him three or four times with the butt end, into his belly; and then turned the mussel of the gun, and struck him in the belly; that Scott died in less than 24 or 28 hours. That he had no assistance, but lay where he fell; and that Wheeler and Osgood were there and saw him. That he really believed the blows were mortal at the time they were given; and that every one that was there thought so too. That he asked captain Broad to let the surgeon bleed him, he said d - n you, you bouger, if you be not quiet I will serve you in the same manner. Upon his cross examination, he said, it was between four and five in the afternoon; that it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100060"/> broad day-light then, being in the month of July. That several blows were given him before he came. He said, that the captain knocked him down twice with the blunderbuss; that he got up and was knocked down again. He said he first struck him on the head; afterwards, he said, the first blow was in the stomach; then he said, he was knocked down both ways, both times; he could not say whether he struck him on the breast or the head with the second blow; but was certain he was knocked down with the blunderbuss in the stomach that was the first way; the punching with the cock was upon his breast, and that he punched him with the muzzle in his belly; he said, the occasion of it was, they had a shower of rain, and Scott had gone off the deck to shelter himself out of the rain; that Broad beat him upon the deck, and used him very ill, because he was off the deck. He was asked, how he could reconcile that, he said, he could not; he had said the man remained twenty-eight hours one time, and twenty-four another; being asked which he would stand to, he said to the forty-eight-hours; he was sure he did not live longer than that; that he said twenty-four in a short way for brevity sake: the truth being forty-eight hours. two whole days and nights; that all the ship's crew that were left saw him lie upon the deck in that condition, but no one could assist him; that Broad d - d him; in regard to Doughty that he never spoke to the captain about Scott, but when he said the captain d - d him he meant about Doughty; that he did not say a word to Broad about Scott, or to the surgeon's mate, or any body; that he called for no assistance, and no body offered him assistance but one Whallen and Drinkwater; what he said about the captain's denying his assistance, was in respect to Doughty; that Scott was speechless all the while; that he never heard him speak from receiving the blow; that he could not be always with him, but did apprehend he was unable to speak, and continued so during all the time; and that Osgood was upon the deck at the time the thing happened; but he did not remember any body else that was. That nobody did interpose, because they durst not speak for themselves. That the last words he ever heard from Scott, was the day before he used; he said, for God's sake, if you live to go home to Bristol, remember me to my wife and family; then he was bid to remember that two minutes before he swore that the man was speechless from the time he was knocked down till he died. His answer was, He told me that; he was then asked, if he had forgot what he said just now, that from the last time of his being struck down, he never spoke any more; his answer was, I never heard him speak after the last words; he died the day after he said this. The blows were the day before that of the conversation; he was asked if he did not say he was speechless from that time. His answer was, Not the time after he spoke to him; he never spoke in his hearing but once. Then he was asked, if he did not swear just now, that from the second time he was struck down he never heard him speak one word, and believed he was speechless. His answer was, I might say so, he was speechless; but the time he saw him and spoke to him, he said he was in a very bad condition, and died with the blows: that he looked at his breast and it was both black and blue, and he was swelled both on the right and left side of his breasts; he looked at him before he died. At the time he spoke to him. he opened his breasts; that he looked at him once in four or five hours which was as often as he could; that he did not look at his blows at any other time till he sewed him up; that he opened his cloaths at first when he spoke to him, but saw no other blow but upon his breast: that Scott told him he thought his death was owing to this blow: the words he used was, I am a dying man, and said, Captain

             knock Scott down with a blunderbuss, punch'd him with the butt end in his breast after he was down, struck the cock in his breast, and punched the muzzle in his belly; and he died, first he said, in less than twenty-four hours; afterwards, in less than forty-eight hours; and that you was there and saw it; now the question is, is that true or false?</p>
               <p>Osgood. False; I am certain of it.</p>

            . I was on board the King David at the time Scott died.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner gave an account on the last trial of Broad's knocking him down with a blunderbuss; do you know any thing of such a blow being given by Broad?</p>
               <p>Osgood. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what Scott died of?</p>
               <p>Osgood. I imagine a fever; I was upon the deck generally.</p>
               <p>Q. For the last three days before Scott died, was you upon the deck?</p>
               <p>Osgood. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of his being struck and punched with a blunderbuss by Broad?</p>
               <p>Osgood. No, I may venture to say there was never one made use of in the whole voyage in that manner.</p>
               <p>Q. You was second mate?</p>
               <p>Osgood. Yes; I had a peculiar care of the arms and arm chest.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hold any conversation with Scott for two days before he died?</p>
               <p>Osgood. I saw him frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever complain of the ill usage of Broad?</p>
               <p>Osgood. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Commings's coming back to the ship at any time?</p>
               <p>Osgood. Yes; he came back in the King's long boat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any relation made then of this murder?</p>

               <p>Osgood. I heard none.</p>
               <p>Q. And you was on board when he came back?</p>
               <p>Osgood. Yes; it was the King's long boat he came back in; neither he nor any other person complained of this murder.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether or not Scott died a natural death with a fever, or was killed by any blows from Broad or any other person?</p>
               <p>Osgood. I believe he died a natural death; and as for a blunderbuss I am certain it was never made use of in such a manner in the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any violence made use of to Scott?</p>
               <p>Osgood. I never knew or heard of any.</p>

               <p>A. I do not; because, being commanding officer, I am seldom on board.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing him on board?</p>

               <p>A. If such a complaint had been made to me I should have put him into custody there, and had him tried by a high court of Admiralty there; he never spoke a word to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You can be very certain that this man never mentioned it to you?</p>
               <p>A. I do not know the man; I am certain I never heard it from any man.</p>

               <p>Mr. Miller. On the latter end of September I was in my counting house; the prisoner at the bar, together with another sailor, waited upon me to demand their wages for their service on board the King David; at that time the ship was hourly expected; it turned out afterwards she waited for a freight, I asked if the ship was come in; he said, No, he came home on board the Preston man of war. I said, Have you deserted the ship? I turned to Captain

            's letter, and found that he was put down in that letter as entered on board a man of war. I said, You are a pretty fellow to leave the ship at such a time, after so great a mortality, and put us to straits to navigate the ship; for we buried, I think, upon the coast of Calabar and to Jamaica seven or nine and twenty white men of the crew. The original crew was about forty, and about two hundred and seventy-seven negroes. Commings said, they left the ship for bad usage; that there was no such thing as living with Capt. Broad, and also from his predecessor Capt. Patty. I said, As to Capt. Patty he might be a little severe; he was remarkably rough in his disposition, but as to Broad, I have known him many years, and looked upon him to be a different sort of a man, however when he comes home he must answer for himself: and as to your wages, it is impossible to settle with you, till I see how you stand on the ship's books. They went away; in two or three days the prisoner and the other man returned again and brought their landlord. They repeated the same demand; I gave them much the same answer, and said it was impossible for me to settle with them till I knew how they upon the ship's books, I was apprehensive they had forfeited their wages, for agreeable to that made, if a sailor does exceed forty-eight hours after a sorting from the other ships before he eaters on board a man of war, he forfeits his wages; they said, they had not forfeited it; they said I would not pay that wages they should. I would accept their power of attorney I said, I would not put them to the and expence; if they would would pay them when the ship returned which they were very thankfull. in particular, said, God bless your honour they took their leaves; I called Commings in, in order to enquire the occasion of our misfortunes by the mortality in the ship; he told me the reason of it was, they had been a long voyage about twelve months upon the coast; that they had contracted disorders, and likewise for want of the doctor, that that brought on distempers. I said, I was very sorry to hear Captain

             behaved in that manner; I looked upon him as a different person. Sir, says the prisoner, if I may speak the truth, I never was ill used by captain Broad in my life, nor never saw any thing by him, but what was humane. I asked him, if he was not a d - d rascal, that the last time he was with me, he gave me for the reason of his quitting the ship. The ill usage of captain Broad, he said, Sir, what I said was false; we must say something to make our story good.</p>

The other evidences that were with me, are at sea, both Howard and Wilson, if they had been examined, it would have proved the charge. I was wade drunk.</p>
