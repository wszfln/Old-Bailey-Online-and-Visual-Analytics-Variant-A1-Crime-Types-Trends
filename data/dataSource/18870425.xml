                  </hi>. I am a chartered accountant, of 22, Queen Street, Cannon Street—in March last year I was appointed by the High Court of Justice administrator, <hi rend="italic">pendente lite</hi>, of the estate of Ann Marshall, deceased, described as late of 14, Haselmere Road, Peckham—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the letters of administration taken out by Messrs. Pritchard and Marshall—as administrator I had been told there were various claimants to the property, claiming under different wills, and George Marshall was also claiming the property as husband—at different times I had advertised for the recovery of certain Egyptian and Spanish bonds which had belonged to Ann Marshall, and which I was informed were of considerable value—I knew the prisoner as the brother of George Marshall, the husband—I had had various negotiations with different persons for the recovery of these bonds—on 27th January last the prisoner and his brother came to my office—I, and Mr. Baker, and Mr. Pritchard, the solicitor, were there—the prisoner said, "I know where the Egyptian</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188704250004"/>
               <p>and Spanish bonds are, and if I can have 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I will return with them at 6 o'clock"—he asked me to remain, there to receive them or the money back—Mr. Pritchard, who was my solicitor acting in this matter, then had this document drawn up—Mr. Pritchard is also solicitor for four other persons interested in this matter—I then drew a cheque on the Bank of England for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and sent Mr. Baker to cash it, and he brought back some notes—the cheque was made payable to George Marshall, and he signed this document, that was in case the prisoner was not able to pay back the money—I handed the notes to Mr. Pritchard, and he handed them in my presence to the prisoner and he either signed this document then or before that. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had received</hi> 751. <hi rend="italic">for the delivery of certain bonds, that he would either deliver them up or deliver back the money; underneath was a memorandum, signed by Frederick B. Smart, stating that the</hi> 751. <hi rend="italic">was to be applied to that purpose. Another document, signed by George Marshall, stated that in case his brother was not able to pay the</hi> 751. <hi rend="italic">back it was to be charged to his estate.</hi>) I don't know whether at the time these documents were signed suits were going on in the Probate Court—I know all the claims have not been paid—the prisoner, with George Marshall, went away with the 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I arranged that either my clerk, or Mr. Pritchard's clerk, should meet him at 6 o'clock, as I could not—I never saw the prisoner again, nor my 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and have had no explanation from him—I have not found these bonds yet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have seen George Marshall about six times altogether—I don't know whether the bonds come to something like 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is an action pending now which will take all the money I have, if it succeeds—the prisoner had come with his brother once or twice before, and has talked about his brother's affairs—I have no recollection of the two Marshalls, on the 27th February, attending in pursuance of a letter from me; to the best of my belief they did not—I heard they were in my room and I went to see them—they did not come with Mr. Pritchard—these documents were all signed together nearly—the cheque is payable to George Marshall, and is signed by him—in one document George Marshall is to become liable if the money is not returned within three days, and the other states that the money is to be returned within six days—I did not draw up the documents and am not responsible for them—I expected to receive back the notes I gave or the bonds—in all probability I should have been content if I had received the money; as long as I got the sum of 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I should have been satisfied.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> George Marshall had asked me to lend him money before, and I had declined; and some one came to me from some loan society that he was trying to borrow money of—I am not in a position to judge what his share will be, at present I don't think it would cover the 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—if the bonds were recovered I have no doubt there would be sufficient.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant in partnership with Mr. Detro—I received this letter, dated 23rd March, it is the prisoner's handwriting—some time in March, in consequence of what I was told, I said to the prisoner, "You have been robbing us by keeping back money that you should have paid to the bank, and also by collecting and retaining ac<lb/>counts"—he replied, "I am very sorry and hope I shall be let off"—he also said if I asked him questions he would answer them—I gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This conversation took place in the presence of Call, who was my senior book-keeper—the prisoner was an assistant—I did not say that all I wanted was my money—I said to both, "You have robbed us of a considerable amount, and before I can go into any ques<lb/>tion of mercy there must be restitution, because I believe you have got the money put by"—I have not received any—T did not tell a Mr. Wood that I had received money from Call's friends—I went to the prisoner's house and saw his wife—I looked at things she asked me about—I did not say I must have money or I would have the length of the law—I never said to Mr. Brook I would withdraw from the prosecution if I got 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not send Mr. Wood to the prisoner when he was remanded, and ask him to confess, he had confessed before—I said they had admitted to 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., consequently each ought to restore 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after receiving a heartrending letter, Mr. Wood said, "Supposing 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was restored would you withdraw from the case?"—I said certainly not, but I would ask the Court for mercy.</p>

I am divisional surgeon of police to the F Division—on the 16th of February, between six and seven in the morn<lb/>ing, I was fetched to the police station, and there saw Frederick Rudge—he was suffering from an incised wound on the right cheek about an inch and a half long, and penetrating the whole structure of the cheek, so that blood ran into the mouth—some degree of force must have been necessary to inflict such an injury—I considered it a serious wound—in every wound there is a risk of erysipelas, there was no danger from hemorrhage—the</p>

               <p>result is that the wound is healed, but the man is left with im<lb/>paired sensation on the whole of that side of the cheek and a very ugly scar—I don't think this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) would have caused the wound—my opinion is that it was inflicted with something with two edges, because the scar is not in a straight line, and it was ragged in its edges, and the deepest part had been cut both backward and forward—he had also a sharp cut on the inner side of the left finger.</p>

I was with Sergeant Rudge on the 16th of February on duty in plain clothes in South Kensington, and between five and six in the morning we were near Ashbourne Place, and saw the two prisoners and another man there close to the doorway of 4, Ashbourne Place—I was in Cromwell Road, and when I came to the corner of Ashbourne Place they came towards me and then turned back again—I spoke to Rudge, and we went down Ashbourne Place, Rudge on one side, and I was on the side the three men were on—the two prisoners and the other man were on the step of 13—I walked to the end of Ashbourne Place into Courtfield Road, and we both concealed ourselves there for a few minutes, keeping observation on the prisoners in Ashbourne Place—after a lapse of two or three minutes the two prisoners and the other man came towards me and passed me, turning into Court<lb/>field Gardens—we followed them, and in Courtfield Gardens we stopped them under a lamp, and I said, "What are you doing here?"—Coaffee said, "We are going to work," and the man not in custody, who was carrying a red pocket handkerchief containing a piece of bread, said, "Oh, yes, we are going to work, here is our food," and showed the piece of bread—I said to McCarthy, who was carrying a black handbag, "What have you go in that bag?"—he said, "Paints and colours, we are going to work"—I said, "Let me see what is in it?" and at the same time I caught hold of him with one hand and he pushed the handbag to me—I opened it and found it contained only a box of silent matches—I then said to Rudge, "Catch hold of that man," meaning the man who is not in custody—he did so and struggled with him—Coaffee then said, "Have a go for it"—I had McCarthy in custody—the third man got away from Rudge, he chased him a few minutes and rearrested him—I then heard Rudge call out "I am stabbed!"—he was then 15 or 20 yards away, round the corner of Courtfield Road in Courtfield Gardens—he came towards me bleeding from his face, and I blew my whistle, and some officers came up—McCarthy then dropped this naked dagger from his right hand coat sleeve—I picked it up and said, "Halloa! what else have you got about you, have you got any more?"—he said, "No, I know nothing about it, I did not drop it"—I said, "Let us see what you have got?"—I searched his outside overcoat pockets, and in the inside pocket I found this sheath of the dagger—I asked him where he was going to work, and he made no reply, and I took him to the police station—on the 24th of March, about 11.30 a.m., I was with Constable Drew in Seymour Place, Marylebone, and saw Coaffee in company with a female—I spoke to my brother and then went towards Coaffee, who was on the opposite side of the road—as soon as I turned towards him he put his right hand in his jacket pocket and withdrew it, and put it alongside him partly behind, and stooping down he said, "If you do I will"—Drew went towards him and he made a plunge at him with his right hand with something bright—I then struck the prisoner several times with a stick which I was carrying,</p>

               <p>and my brother broke his umbrella over him—he made several plunges at my brother and myself and then ran away—we ran after him and caught him in a mews—he was very violent, and it took six or seven officers to carry him face downwards to the station—at the station I charged him with being concerned with a man in custody in attempting to break and enter a dwelling-house of Ashbourne Place, and also with attempting to stab an officer—he said, "All night, I don't mind, I had a go for it"—I found no knife upon him.</p>

On 28th March I was with Sergeant Clifford in Pentonville Road, and saw the prisoner there with three other lads—when he saw me he commenced to run away—I gave chase through several streets, and caught him in Collyer Street, South<lb/>ampton Street—I charged him with stealing the constable's watch and assaulting him, and causing grievous bodily harm to Mr. Robinson—he said, "I was there, but I did not have the <hi rend="italic">copper's</hi> watch; but I know who did have it"—he struggled to get away—we took him to the station—I was present when Robinson picked him out from five others at the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Slater, of 94, Paul Street, a few doors from where the prisoner lived—I have known him and his wife about nine years—on Saturday, 19th March, about midnight, I was at home—I can't tell whether it had gone 12; it was just on the verge of 12, if it had not gone 12—the prisoner came to me and asked me to go down to his wife—I followed him down the street to his house—the front parlour door was locked—I went round to the back parlour—I went in and found the deceased in the front parlour lying on the floor—the prisoner was very much the worse for drink; he could scarcely stand—the deceased was lying on the floor with her head resting on a pillow—she was fully dressed—I knelt down by her side—she said "He has done for me"—the prisoner was in the room, and was near enough to hear what she said—I raised her up, and gave her some brandy—I asked her in the hearing of the prisoner what he had done—she said h" had stabbed her—I asked her where—she said in the stomach—I raised her up and got her on a chair, and she fell forward on to the table and appeared to be in very great pain, and she asked to be allowed to sit in that position—she said she did not think it had pierced her—I asked her if she would like to go to bed—she said it was all dark, she could not see me, she would be glad to get to bed if I could get her there—I got her to bed as well as I could—she then said she could not lie down, she was in such pain—the prisoner then came into the bedroom, and when he found how ill she was he kissed her and said "<hi rend="italic">Liz</hi>, I am very, very sorry for what I have done"—he then went into the front parlour to the cupboard and got out the knife-box and set it on the table, turning the knives over and grinding his teeth in a most dreadful manner—I called to him to bring the brandy, for she said she felt she was dying—he brought the brandy; he did not speak; he went straight back to the knives again, turning them over—I was afraid he was going to commit suicide, so I called him to bring me some water, which he did—he did not speak again—he went back a third time, and I asked him to bring the smelling-bottle—I did not know what to do, because I had the deceased on my arm in the bed—he brought it again—I then disengaged my arm from under her, and put him on the other side of me, and told him how very ill she was—I then asked her if she would like to have a doctor fetched—she said she would—I then left her in the prisoner's charge while I went to see my husband—the supper was prepared on the table in the front room—there was a knife on the table, a table-knife—I spoke to my husband and he fetched Dr. Roe, and Dr. Roe and two con<lb/>stables, Passmore and Lodge, came immediately—after they had spoken to the prisoner and Dr. Roe had examined the deceased, he ordered her</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188704250024"/>
               <p>to be sent to the hospital—she said"<hi rend="italic">Jim</hi>, my boy, if they are going to take you away, I freely forgive you for all you have done"—she then asked him for some money, and he handed her four sovereigns—before that she said something in his presence—he sat in a chair part of the time taking no notice whatever till I roused him—she said he came home and was having his supper—I asked her if they had been having any words—she said "No, not particularly;" that he began grumbling about his supper being dry; that she said to him "How can you expect any other, <hi rend="italic">Jim</hi>, when you ordered your dinner at 3 o'clock, and now it is 11"—she said that he sprang up and stabbed her immediately, momentarily, with the table-knife, before she had time to get out of his way—it was after that that the money was asked for—I went with her to the hospital, and remained with her till she died, about 3 in the morning—the prisoner was drunk when I first saw him—when he found how ill she was, it evidently sobered him a great deal.</p>

I am the prisoner's mother, and live at 2, Edward's Place, top floor front—I have only one room—my son lives there too—I was looking out at my window, and heard the prosecutor and prisoner quarrelling—the policeman conveyed him down the court, and after the policeman went back the prosecutor came back and charged the prisoner with stealing a watch—I had seen them fighting in the court—the prisoner hit the prosecutor and then ran up to the first floor, but he never came into my room at all; but afterwards he hid under my bed and said "They can't do anything only summons me"—I heard Noakes say to the woman he lives with, "If we cannot give him in charge for assault we will charge him with stealing 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. "—this is all spite ever since the first summons for an assault on the first floor—Day Blank, a man who lives on the first floor, and my son went up as a witness to Marylebone Police-court—Bridget Clark got the summons out; it was for an insault, I mean an insult, or an assault, one or the other—there was no one in the passage whatever—when Noakes got up he and the woman he lives with went round to the police-station, and they could not get him taken for assault, so they charged him with stealing 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

"—I gave you the money in Cornhill as we were walking along—after I had got the money I and Mr. Ensworth went and refreshed ourselves, and I apologised to you when I came back for keeping you waiting—I did not spend any of that money; I had money in my pocket—after the cheque had been cashed I went to the London and then to the Lambert—while there Tate came in; he is a tall man, but I managed to black his eye that night—I was as sober then as I am now—I went from there to the King Lud—I was not requested to leave there, and I did not request you to get me into a cab—I paid for some of the drink and you paid for some—I had about 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. when I got home.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a compositor of 47, Alma Street, New North Road—about 12.30 a.m. on the 9th of March I saw a woman whom I thought I knew in Bookham Street, New North Road—I walked up the street and saw her going up the steps of No. 53—I saw I was mistaken—I passed the house, I did not speak to her—I then turned to go home, as I passed the house again I observed the woman and the prisoner talk<lb/>ing on the kerb, I walked inside on the pavement between them and the wall—the prisoner struck at me with this walking stick (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he missed me but hit the wall—I turned and asked him what he meant by it—he swore at me; I can't remember the words—I went across the road, he followed me, and when I was round the corner of Nile Street he struck at my head with the stick—I avoided the blow and it fell on my shoulder—I then struck him with my fist in self-defence, in the mouth, and he thrust the stick into my eye—he was then rather more than an arm's length from me—after that he stood talking to me—he was crying be<lb/>cause his mouth was cut, and he threatened to gouge my other eye out and other expressions, I cannot remember the exact words—after that I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188704250038"/>
               <p>went to a doctor and then to the hospital, where they removed my eye to prevent the other eye being affected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was apprehended on the 4th of April, and this happened on the 9th of March—I saw him coming out of his house on the 4th of April about six o'clock, before he was arrested—I was in the street about eight o'clock or just before with a policeman, and the prisoner was then apprehended on this charge—when I accused him he said, "The man is mad, I know nothing about it"—on the 9th of March I had been strolling about with two or three friends—we had been to one or two places of refreshment; not more than two—I left work with them at eight and walked up Holborn—I left my mates in Holborn about a quarter to 12—I had seen the prisoner once before on that night after I saw the woman, but up to that night he was a perfect stranger to me—he passed by me after I passed by the woman—I turned back to go home, having turned out of my way to see if I knew the woman—I was in the man's company ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I might have said something, I struck him in the mouth—this was on the Wednesday—I first communicated with the police on the following Tuesday, the 15th—I know the prisoner lived at Bookham Street—I live close by, in an ad<lb/>joining street—I only came out of the hospital on the Sunday, the 13th—the man who did the injury had no grievance against me, I had no quarrel with him—I am positive the prisoner is the man—I pointed him out to a policeman when he was taken—two men, Knight and Valentine, were there when the injury was caused—Knight was before the Magis<lb/>trate, Valentine was not—Knight was at the corner of the street three or four yards away, and Valentine was about 10 or 12 yards away—Nile Street, where the injury was inflicted, is a very small and narrow but well lighted street—there was nearly a full moon that evening.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I was talking to the prisoner for about 10 minutes—there were two lamps just by where this occurred, we talked under them—we asked him whether he knew Stubbs, or what he had done it for—he gave no explanation—he made no answer—I told him we had nothing to do with Stubbs.</p>

                  </hi>, I am a house decorator, living at 20 Steding Street, North Kensington—on 26th March, at a quarter-past 6, I saw the prose<lb/>cutor near the Clarendon public-house, about 10 yards in front of me, the worse for drink—I have known him by working in the trade—as he passed, Thomson went behind him and caught him by the two arms, and I heard him say "How much b—money have you got about you?"—he put out his left leg and threw him sideways across his left leg on to the ground, and the prosecutor's head knocked the ground which seemed to knock him insensible—I crossed to the opposite side of the road and stood there a little time to see what they were going to do with him—then Thomson lifted him up again, and as he got him on his feet, Olden got in front of him and knocked his trousers pocket with his hand, while Thomson kept hold of his arms from behind-Olden put his hand in the prosecutor's right-hand trousers pocket and pulled something out which I could not see, and passed it to Thomson; then he felt in his other pockets, and the second time he drew out his hand from his right trousers pocket, a piece of blacklead pencil fell on to the pavement—it was very much like this piece—Olden picked it up and put it in his own pocket—Thomson then left go of him and put himself in a stooping position behind his legs, and Olden struck him in the jaw and knocked him over Thomson's back on to the back of his head—after two or three seconds the prosecutor got up; Olden caught hold of a pail of water standing by the kerb for the horses, and went up to the prosecutor and poured it all over him—he was then standing staggering about, as if he could not help himself—the prisoners then ran off and I followed them—I watched them for some time, to try and get assistance to take them into custody—I sup<lb/>pose they ran about 100 yards down the Clarendon Road, and then two more men came up singly, looking as if they had been drinking—the prisoners caught hold of them, but they got away—I followed the prisoners as far as the Portland Road, a turning out of the Clarendon Road, where they stepped into the side bar of the Portland public-house—I went and got the assistance of two policemen, and pointed out the prisoners, and gave them in charge for assaulting the prosecutor, and highway robbery—I did not hear them say anything—the prosecutor had followed, and stood outside the door—the prisoners were taken to the station, I followed there—I saw them searched—Thomson said "I hope one working-man won't lock up another; if I can make you any compensation I will"—I saw some money and pencils taken from him—I could not say what was taken from Olden.</p>

On the night of 13th April I saw the prosecutor with Quin and Regan in East Street—Wheldon had had something to drink, but knew what he was doing—when he got from them the first time he made a staggering run—Quin and Regan tried to get him down Baker's Court, a very dark passage leading out of East Street into Blandford Mews—I walked towards him and he succeeded in getting away from them—they let go of him as soon as they saw me walking towards them—the prisoner then went down East Street into the Wallace's Head, followed by Quin and afterwards by Regan—they stopped in there about five minutes, and then Wheldon came out followed by the two prisoners and went to the top of Blandford Mews, leading out of Blandford Street—they tried to persuade him to go down with them, he refused—I walked towards them again; he then went down South Street towards High Street, Marylebone—I heard a shouting towards High Street and went there—I saw Wheldon holding Regan by his coat collar—several people were there—this was outside the Angel at the corner of South and High Streets—Weldon said that Regan had attempted to rob him—I took Regan into custody, and having seen Quin</p>

                  </hi>. I am Superintendent of Records in the Bank<lb/>ruptcy Court—I produce the file of proceedings in the bankruptcy of Thomas Harding, furniture dealer, of 14, Norfolk Terrace, Bayswater—the petition was filed against him on 21st April, 1886, by Messrs. Saxelby and Faulkner, the act of bankruptcy being the non-payment of a judg<lb/>ment debt of 61<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he was adjudicated a bankrupt on that petition on 12th June—his statement of affairs filed on 28th May shows liabilities of 82<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and there is 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. preferential claims—his total assets are 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., of which 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is due for rates and taxes—the notes of his public and private examinations are on the file—his public examination was on 25th June, 1886.</p>
               <p>

Saxelby and Faulkner appeared as creditors only, at those meetings, not as solicitors to the receiver—at the private sitting they employed Counsel to cross-examine the bankrupt, to assist the official receiver to make a report—this is his report (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the certificate of the official receiver of a clean bill of health as regards any misdemeanour on the part of Thomas Harding—private sittings were held on 6th November, 22nd November, 23rd November, and 4th December—a witness in bankruptcy is always paid his conduct money—on 21st December they got an order for prosecution—a barrister's opinion was taken by Saxelby and Faulkner.

Saxelby and Faulkner found me at my office just before this case commenced, on 12th January, 1887—I appointed Mr. Hansler to collect the rent just after Harding took the premises—my interest in it has just expired—the Duke of Westminster is the ground landlord, and he is pulling the house down.</p>

"—he said "I cannot think what the devil they want with you"—my brother, who was with me, said "Come out and have a drink and talk it over"—we went to the Crown public-house and had a conversation about it, and he said he would go to a good solicitor in Lincoln's Inn Fields, who he had been recommended to—I said "The only thing you will have to satisfy them about is that the furniture is Fred's; where is he going to say he got the money?" and he said that he was going to say that his sister had lent him the money—my brother, William Vincent, was present then, and also when I cross-examined the son, and directly after that I went down to Saxelby and Faulkner's office.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I was cross-examined on the first occasion I said that there had been no charge of swindling brought against me, and I say so now—I was in Holloway Prison nine months under an attach<lb/>ment by order of the Court of Chancery; that was for not paying a balance into Court of a sale, which I had offered to the solicitors—I said "I bought some furniture at King Henry's Road, and agreed to pay 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and paid every farthing"—that, was subject to about 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deductions—I have got the receipt with me from the lady who sold the furniture—I was sent to Holloway Prison 10 years ago for not paying 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I have many judgments against me—I may have sworn on cross-examination that I did not remember any judgment against me in 1886, but I was proceeded against in the County Court for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I did not pay it—I have been twice in Holloway Prison, I think—I said that I had accounted to the owner of the goods in Welbeck Street for all the proceeds of the sale there, and I have brought all the papers in my bag—when I was cross-examined I said I had a client in 1885, Mrs. Wilson in Princess Square, who sent me furniture for sale, which I sold for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and paid her all the money; I did so, or paid it away at her request—I repeat that statement now, and I have an I O U for money due to me—in 1885 a young man named Bell entered into partnership with me and invested money in the business; I will not swear it was not 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot say how long he remained with me—I gave him on leaving a promissory note for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to be paid off at 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—I said "The draft was dishonoured, and Bell sued me and got judgment"—that is a mistake; it was 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he sued for—the judgment was for 62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., he had had over 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he has never been paid that—in May, 1885, a Mr. Smith joined me in partnership; he was about my own age; he paid in 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and opened an account in his own name with 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he</p>

I am a bootmaker, of 18, Brabington Road, St. Peter's Park, Paddington—I have known Thomas Harding for about 25 years—I am the brother of the last witness; he and I were once passing the defendant's shop; he drew my attention to some furniture that was missing; Thomas Harding was present, and my brother said that he had been doing some business—he replied that although there had been some sales there was not much money coming in for it—I always understood by the billheads that the furniture was Frederick Harding's—I was present when my brother asked Frederick some ques<lb/>tions—my brother was reading the paper with his glasses, and they said that he looked like a Judge—he said "I don't know how Frederick would stand a private examination; let me put him through his facings"—Frederick was then coming in from the end of the shop, and he asked him how he got the money to buy this furniture—he said he had saved it up—my brother asked him how much a week he had—he said "5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. "—my brother said that would not hold water; the idea of his saving enough money to buy 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of furniture—he said "If you cross<lb/>examine me like that I shall <hi rend="italic">turn it up</hi>"—I knew my brother was sum<lb/>moned to the Bankruptcy Court, and on the following day Thomas Harding came into my office, and said on that occasion that the money was borrowed from the sisters.</p>

Saxelby and Faulkner's account"—he said, "I shall not pay them a b—sixpence"—I said, "I am ashamed to hear you make that remark, that remains to be seen;" served him with the writ, and came away—we then proceeded with the action—it was referred to one of the Masters, and this is his award—we signed judgment for 61<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. including the costs—afterwards, finding that nothing was realised, we took proceedings in bankruptcy, and on April 21st we presented a petition—a summons in bankruptcy had been served on him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was introduced by a client of the firm in the liti<lb/>gation of Sir John Kelk—Mr. Long, our conveyancing clerk, saw him first—he is not here—the requisition was on 17th January, 1885, by Sir John Kelk against him and Alexander, and from that time my firm communi<lb/>cated with Thomas Harding—Sir John Kelk was not allowed to get costs when it was clear that the covenant had been broken, because we were advised that the action should go on, and we should get the best terms we could—a distinct covenant was made with Alexander by Sir John Kelk prohibiting his letting the premises, 178, Buckingham Palace Road, as a furniture shop—your client has got the bill of costs—I cannot give you any further information—the delay was caused in consequence of his owing rent, and we got him off the rent—that action was against Alexander for breach of covenant, coupling him with Harding—Alex<lb/>ander has, I believe, received 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Harding for the lease and fixtures—the action for damages for letting the premises without disclosing the covenant was not commenced till the other was settled on February 6th, 1885—the delay was caused by Harding not being able to get a place to go to, and Sir John Kelk kindly extended the term—Harding went from 111 to 78—Alexander had let judgment go by default long before that—that action had nothing to do with Sir John Kelk; it was to get damages out of Alexander; it went on from February 6th to July 15th—we did not in that interval advise him to sell the furniture that had been moved and exaggerate the damages claimed by Alexander—we had not agreed to conduct the litigation for costs out of pocket—the damages against Alexander amounted to about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and beyond that there were other claims for loss of business and inconvenience caused by the plaintiff being obliged to remove to other premises, for which he was unable to estimate his loss—Mr. Harding never remonstrated with us about such a monstrous amount; that I solemnly swear—we discovered at the end of six months that the action was unfounded altogether—Harding said he had never signed any agreement—I said, "If you have, it does not occur to me that you have got any case at all"—when we got the documents I made a copy of this one.

I wrote to Alexander's solicitor, Mr. Anderson, asking if there had been a preliminary agreement, and also to Messrs. Carr, whose answer was: "We understand the agreement was a verbal one"—I sent for Harding to my office, and he swore with an oath that the document I showed him was not his writing—I said "I am very much surprised to hear you make such a statement"—he said "It is not my document; I never signed such a document"—I made him sit down and sign his name, and I at once identified the signature, and told him so, but he still maintained that it was not his writing—he wanted to go to</p>

               <p>the other side, but I said "Your case is already bad enough; I do not think it is wise to go there, it will be showing too much of the white feather; you had better go home and talk it over with your wife;" because I believed he knew it was his signature—I have never shown this document to him for the reason I have given you—the taxed costs in Kelk's action was the foundation for the Bankruptcy proceedings; the amount was made up of our charges and the other charges, and some other charges in respect to the lease—I have not acted in the bankruptcy summons and everything; I manage the common law department under the supervision of my principals, but I do not advise clients—I suppose our charges will be made against the Treasury as their agents; there is not much profit—before we got the order to prosecute we had expended quite as much money as our bill of costs amounted to—that was not because they were so annoyed that he had not paid their bill of costs,—we are not acting for any other creditor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Before taking any steps I asked the defendant on several occasions whether he had signed any preliminary agreement because I saw the importance of it, and I wrote to ask him to bring any preliminary agreement; after I had discovered that document of May 5th he wrote me this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with a long explanation of how he came to sign it; it is Winstanley's writing, but signed by Harding—I have seen him sign his name, and to the best of my belief this is his signature. (<hi rend="italic">This stated</hi>: "I hereby authorize you to settle the matter in the best way you can for my interest. T. Harding ")—that was accompanied by a letter from Winstanley referring to the agreement—they came in the same envelope—the consent of the ground landlord had to be obtained—I have the Counsel's opinion here, he had this before him—at that time Alexander had a claim against him for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for rent—I settled the action and induced Alexander to withdraw his claim for rent, and we withdrew our counter claim—the defendant and his son settled the particulars, which it is suggested we have invented or grossly exaggerated—I saw the younger defendant, and handed them to him, and he took them home to his father, and Mr. Winstanley assisted us—it was on his instructions alone.</p>

               <p>of Easter Monday, 11th April, I was going home from the Admiral public-house, a little before eleven o'clock—I reached my doorway, and put my hand into my pocket for my latch key, when I was taken by the arms from the back by two men, one at each arm—the one on the left-hand side took my watch, and I heard clippers or a knife breaking the chain—they took my silver watch and part of my gold chain, value together 5 guineas—I went down as they let go of my arms—this is the other part of the chain—I had had a little drop to drink, but knew what I was about—I had my senses about me.</p>

I am a page boy at the Hotel Metropole, living at 43, Richmond Street, in the neighbourhood of Huntsworth Terrace—a few minutes before 11 p.m. on 11th April I was outside the Admiral, and I saw Pedder cross the road and speak to Denmead and another young man, and they all three went down Carlyle Street, on the left-hand side, following Mr. Honey, who was going towards Huntsworth Terrace—I was on the right-hand side—Mr. Honey went down Carlyle Street a little past Huntsworth Terrace, and I went past, and I was standing at the corner about 50 yards from Huntsworth Terrace, when he and the three prisoners all passed me, Mr. Honey having gone down Carlyle Terrace and come back—I saw them follow him down Huntsworth Ter<lb/>race on the left-hand side (I was also on that side)—Mr. Honey got to his door, and put his hand in his pocket—Pedder ran up to him on the left-hand side, and Denmead on his right—I saw them both catch hold of his wrists—Pedder snatched his watch away, and then they seemed to pull him backwards, and put their feet behind him, and they threw him down on his head in the gutter—Pedder ran towards me up to Carlyle Street, and Denmead ran the other way down to Salisbury Street, I think, and I saw no more of him that night—as Pedder ran past me I tried to catch him, but could not stop him—as he ran down Carlyle Street he put something up his left-hand sleeve—I saw Constable D 177 in Carlyle Street, just past Princess Street, down which Pedder turned—he could have seen the constable—I shouted to the constable "Stop that man, he has got a watch"—Pedder turned round to me, and said "Go away, go away"—as soon as I shouted the constable ran—Pedder slipped down in Princess Street, but he ran to the bottom of the street, and then down Salisbury Street and Orcus Street, where he was caught—I did not see him caught—they were faster than me, and several yards in front of me—it is a very dark street—I have no doubt the prisoner is the man I saw.</p>

I am a builder, of Station Road, Forest Gate—on 18th March last I was engaged in building in the Napier Road, Barking Road—I saw the prisoner in the Station Road at my house; I had another job on in the Station Road; he said "I want the loan of six battens to enable me to get my advance on Saturday"—I said "I will give you the six battens, and when you are ready to come for them you come round this way with a cart and I will either give them to you myself or I will send a man with you to give you the battens"—I made no settled price for them; he was to have the loan of them to enable him to get his draw—I did not charge him anything—that is all that took place; he went off—on Sunday morning I went to the premises I was building in Napier Road, and I there missed 27 ridge tiles, 5 red bricks, 3 front-door panels, 16 drain pipes, 6 chimney pots, 150 stock bricks, 16 battens, and a door from upstairs, which had been pulled off the hinges—I was plastering the building—they were materials I was going to use on the building—the battens were mostly upon the ceiling joists—I had last seen the things safe on the premises on the 17th, the Thursday I think—I next saw the prisoner about a week after in Stratford—I said, "Have you been and taken that material off my job in the Barking Road?"—he said "Yes, and you can summons me or lock me up or do anything you like to me"—he gave me a lot of <hi rend="italic">sauce</hi> about it; he said "You are kicking up a b—row about these two or three little matters"—I said "It is enough to make anyone kick up a row to strip the job as you have done"—I met the prisoner at West Ham once—I don't feel certain whether that was before or after I saw him at Stratford—I spoke very few words to him then—I made inquiries and ascertained something about a Mr. Page—I went to the police-station and lodged a complaint against the prisoner—I saw him next at the Barking Police-station—I charged him with stealing the materials; he made no answer—I was shown all these materials at the police-station; I identified them all—their value is about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not hear him say he had sold them to old Page—he had no authority from me to take them off the premises—he had no business or anything to do on the premises at all—he was to have the six</p>

I did live at 60, Hollington Street, Camberwell—I now live at 10, Archer Street, Vauxhall—Henry Manning is my husband—the prisoner is my son—we let the house out in lodgings—up to within a week of the 2nd April the prisoner had been lodging with us—we had not quarrelled—he left us—I did not know that he was going to leave</p>

I am a labourer—on the night of 2nd April I was lodging in this house—several families were also lodging there—five adults and three children were in the house at the time of the fire—at a quarter to 9, in consequence of what I was asked by Mrs. Manning, I opened the door and saw the prisoner—he went into the back room or kitchen and stopped—I let the mother out—I went upstairs—in about 12 minutes he left—I did not see him leave; I heard his footsteps—he hurried out sharp, and about two minutes after I smelt burning—I spoke to my wife, and went downstairs and found a fire in the room where the prisoner had been—there were some dresses and pictures blazing, and a paraffin lamp was broken—the cupboard had been set fire to, and the partition and ceiling was scorched—I put that out—my children were in bed upstairs, and there were several other people in the house—I don't know whether the prisoner was drunk or sober when I let him in—he had had enough—he had the sense to shut the door and leave the place—I could not call him drunk—he was able to walk—he did not speak to me.</p>

I am a master butcher, of 287, Camberwell Road—on Monday, 11th April, I was at Kempton Park Races, and about 2.30 p.m. I was in the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. betting ring—I did not see the prisoner there till I found his hand in my pocket—he was on my left side; I had 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my pocket in three packets of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, done up in paper, and a half<lb/>sovereign loose, and a cheque for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the packets were in my purse separately done up, as my money goes into the bank every Monday—the cheque was in a purse in my left pocket—the prisoner put his left hand in my left trousers pocket and took out my purse—I tried to seize his left hand but could not get it; I seized his right hand and was knocked to the ground and <hi rend="italic">confidentially kicked</hi>, by his companions, I suppose—I kept hold of the prisoner two or three minutes, till Sergeant Shaddock came up, and still held him after he was in custody—I saw the corner of the purse in his hand and identified it—it was a three-clasp purse, bright metal—I called out "Stop thief"—I have not seen any of my money since—I have stopped the cheque.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I lost the purse as near 2.30 p.m. as possible—I started for the racecourse about 10.30, and drove down from Camberwell Road—I stopped at two public-houses on the way and put up at the third—I had the usual glass at all those places, it was beer and nothing else—I did not go to bet, but naturally enough I had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. "on"—I took all that money with me because I did not like to leave it at home; I thought it was safer to take it to the racecourse—I left some money at home—I had no drink on the race course previous to charging the prisoner—I got there at 1 or half-past—the second race was being run when I felt a hand in my trousers pocket—I had no drink between the first and second race—the man, whoever he was, stood at my back leaning towards the left, and I felt his hand in my pocket at the end of the race when there was excitement, but through the confusion I could see the steel mounting on the purse—I cannot describe the man immediately in front of me or the man on my right side—I had never seen the prisoner before to my knowledge—I have not said, "It was during the excitement caused by my seizing the prisoner by his right hand that I saw the purse in his left," what I said was read over to me—I was quite as free from excite<lb/>ment as I am to-day till he put his hand in my pocket.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant.</hi>) On April 11 I was in this betting ring, saw a crowd, and the prosecutor and the prisoner and two or three others on the ground struggling, about four of them—the prosecutor was holding on to the prisoner's right hand, and the prisoner was trying to get away—I caught hold of him and said, "What is the matter?"—he said, "This man has stolen my purse"—I said, "You will have to go to the station with me," and took him through the ring—there was a large crowd, and several of them shouted "<hi rend="italic">Rouse</hi>"—that means to <hi rend="italic">lynch</hi> him from my custody—I said, "You had better not <hi rend="italic">rouse</hi>"—I got assistance and took the prisoner to the station—when the charge was read over to him he said, "Did not you catch hold of two or three other people before me and the prosecutor?"—I said, "No, I took hold of you and no one.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Rouse</hi> is a term of rescue, I have heard it on several occasions—it is accompanied by cries of "Shame" and "Let him go"—the prosecutor was excited, naturally enough—there were a good many people there, 5,000 or 6,000 in that particular ring—I have seen the prisoner's left hand, I do not think there is much the matter with it—he has not told me that it is partially crippled, nor did I hear it at the police court.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 6, Market Street—on Thursday night, 7th April, I left the John o'Groat's public-house, Boundary Road, about 12 o'clock, having just got a light for my pipe, in doing which I pushed against the prisoner's wife, and she pushed, me back—I then came out, and the prisoner and his wife came out, and she started calling "Murder"—I went up to him, and asked him to pacify her—he drew his hand up and struck me under the chin; I do not know what with, but I felt blood running down—the prisoner went away, and I went after him, caught hold of him, and gave him in custody—I was unnerved and dazed; I was not intoxicated—the doctor dressed my wound at the station.</p>

I am a tin-plate worker, of 6, Boundary Road—on 7th April I was at the John o'Groat's public-house from 8.30—I believe Williams was there before me—the prisoner and his wife came in later in the evening, and just at 12 o'clock Williams went to get a light, and pushed against the prisoner's wife—she pushed him back, and that caused a scuffle between him and Mr. Williams—they then went outside—I stood by Mr. Williams, and the prisoner's wife halloaed out "Murder"—Williams went up and spoke to the prisoner, and I saw the prisoner strike him a blow, but I did not see any knife—he called out "I am stabbed"—the prisoner ran away; I ran after him and stopped him—he was taken to the station.</p>

I am a surgeon, and assist my father, the surgeon to the L Division—on 8th April early in the morning I was called to the station and examined the prosecutor, and found a clean cut wound on his throat a little below the jaw, on the left side, about seven-eighths of an inch long and three-quarters of an inch deep; it was bleeding freely; it had opened the windpipe to a very slight extent—this knife would cause it, but the blow must have been very forcible—the prisoner did not appear drunk; he was very excited—the prosecutor had been drinking; he was excited; he is quite well now.</p>
