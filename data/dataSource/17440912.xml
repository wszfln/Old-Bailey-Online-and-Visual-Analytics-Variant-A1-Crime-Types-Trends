She said I have got nothing, my dear, but a little Apothecary's stuff; then he put the pistol to her breast and bid her deliver.

I never knew any harm of him before; I missed the things and charged him with taking them, for he had been at my house the night before; upon which he cried and confessed that he took them, and had pawned them to one Mrs. Aris in Baldwin's-Gardens. I went there and saw the things, and because I refused to pay her for them, she swept them off the counter and would not let me have them.</p>

I had 3 s. to pay, and I gave the man of the cellar half a guinea instead of a sixpence. I lost my purse, in which I had a two guinea piece and 60 guineas; though I swore but to 59 guineas, because I don't know but I might change one. I lost my snuff box. When I came home I told my wife I had been robbed; I went to the cellar and told the person that keeps it what had happened. He said if I would give him 5 guineas he would help me to my money: and the Prisoner was taken with the money upon her, and my purse was brought to me with 45 guineas in it, the rest of the money was gone. When she was before the Justice she fell down on her knees and begged for mercy; she owned the taking the money, but she denied that she took the snuff box.</p>

On the 22d of July I went to put a bank note into the drawer and missed this purse. I examined the Prisoner concerning it, she looked a little confounded at first, and wondered I should mistrust her, more than any other person in the house? I told her because there was nobody came into the room but herself, (I heard she had let other people into the house to lie there) when I went to the drawer the key did not easily unlock it, and since she has been taken , there was another key found behind the door, which opened it as well as my own. - There was nothing found in her possession.</p>

               <p>Job Lilly. This Spoon was brought to me by a poor woman to be sold: I asked her how she came by it? She said, very honestly. I said, good woman , I don't know how you came by it, but there has been some violence used to it, and I believe 'tis stolen . She said she would fetch the owner of it: she went and fetched this boy. Said I, my lad , is this spoon your's? He said, yes. I told him I would stop the spoon and him too. He said he would fetch the young woman he had it of. He went away , and I did not see him again till he was brought by the Constable: he said he was let into the house by a journeyman Baker, and seeing the spoon lie about he took it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had run away from my master. I was let in by a journeyman Baker, who was the cause of my running away. I asked him to lend me sixpence; he gave me this spoon, and said I should have three parts of the money if I sold it: he said he would be a friend to me all my life time, and desired I would not say any thing of his being concerned with me. <rs id="t17440912-10-verdict52" type="verdictDescription">

A young gentlewoman who has lived with us six years, saw her take it out of the drawer and put it into her left side pocket; we had a suspicion of her before, so we watched her. I let her go out of the shop and then followed her and brought her back, and told her she had got a piece of ribbon. Says she, why should you think so? I was afraid it being night that she should drop it, and I said to her, I am determined you shall not drop it upon the ground; but she found means to throw the ribbon away, and I found it upon the counter.</p>

Last Friday was a month, I saw the Prisoner go up the dark gate-way by Galley-Key, with this box under his left arm: about 10 or 15 minutes after, I met a woman in Thames-street with the same box. A few minutes after, I saw the Prisoner with Mr. Mead and Mr. Addison at the water-side; and they desired the box might be sent back again, and promised him favour. Said I, Bothaw, receive mery while you can - and he made reply, You black-guard dog, what business is it of yours? I went to the woman's house whom I saw with it under her arm, and found it in her room, under the rug upon the bed: And some people will scandalize me about it, with being a thief-taker, but I am sure I am not, for I want no reward - I knew the woman before, by her sitting with others and things upon the Keys ; and got information concerning it by a neighbour of hers in White's-yard, who saw her carry it into the house, after I had waited 2 or 3 hours at the door. - The Prisoner worked upon the Keys.</p>

             . The Prisoner brought this pair of boots to me to sell: I turned them up, and out dropped a pair of silver spurs. I was sensible she did not know any thing of the spurs, so I asked her , how she came by them? She said, she had them in Kent; that a gentleman who was on horseback pulled off his boots to go over a hedge, in order to be concerned with her, and she run away with them.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there nothing but the boots?</p>
               <p>Beaning . The spurs were in the boots, but they were not found then.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Yes, there was 2 whip too.</p>
               <p>Benning. She said, she would not part with the whip; and when the spurs were found, she would not sell the spurs with the boots. When she came before the Justice, she said she met a man who wanted to make use of her; and that the man pulled off the boots to go through the hedge: whereupon the Justice said, he never knew a man pull off his boots to go through a hedge. And she said, while he went through the hedge, she run away with them. <rs id="t17440912-20-verdict104" type="verdictDescription">

I went home about six o'clock in the afternoon, and found a pane of glass taken out of the back window, and the door open; and I lost all these goods. (I never had any of them again but one coat, which a woman brought to me, and said she found it.) I asked the neighbours, whether they saw any body carry any clothes away. They said, they saw 2 young fellows go up the yard between 4 and 5. I made enquiry, and described them; and the woman at the

I got a warrant from a Justice of the Peace, and took him out of the Savoy.

               <p>Prisoner. I went down to Northamptonshire to a brother on the 16th of June; and coming back, I came to the Swan at Hockley , and lay there all night. In the morning I went away, and it rained as hard as it could. There stood 4 or 5 people under a hedge, and a little, well set man in a blue coat said he would sell me his horse. I said I had not so much money as to purchase him, and that I did not want a horse. However I purchased the horse, bridle, and saddle for 43 s. - I bought him at the first house in Dunstaple under the gate-way: I think it is the sign of the Bull.</p>

After that they talked of laying a wager about fighting, and then they went to fighting by consent: they had three falls, and the third fall they both fell down together sideways, and the Prisoner had rather the worst of it - I don't know any thing of any wound he received - He went home and died in about an hour afterwards. The Churchwarden said the Coroner obliged him to prosecute, and I appear for the parish.</p>

            , Surgeon. I live in Great Russel-Street; I was sent for to the deceased three days after he was dead to open the body, and found a vast quantity of blood in the cavity of the abdomen, which I believe proceeded from an eruption of one of the blood vessels, for there were no wounds upon him; and this must from the shock of the fall: there was one of the capital vessels in the cavity of the abdomen, and the body was quite in a diseased state before this accident. I opened the skull in order to see if there was any contusion upon the brain, but found it clear and safe. One lobe of the lungs was quite adhered to the pleura and was quite emaciated (but that was not occasioned by this fall) and there was a little adhesion of the other lobe, but not like that. <rs id="t17440912-25-verdict131" type="verdictDescription">

I got up upon my legs and pulled out 9 s. 9 d. (for I had just before received 9 s. 9 d. at the Civet Cat in the Strand,) and paid 3 d. for the pot of beer. During the time they were drinking these three glasses of gin, which I don't think could be above two minutes, the money was gone - I turned round to take up my basket , and missed the money. - I did not feel any body's hand in my pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it before you took up your basket or after?</p>
               <p>Thorn. I had just got my basket on my arm ready to go out as they went out - The other two went out first , and the Prisoner followed ; then I put my hand in my pocket, and the money was gone. I asked the women of the house if she know them, and she said she did not; I got one to go after them, and I went down to the water-side, and saw them all three in the boat together; I called out to the waterman, thieves! one of them had thrown sixpence into the boat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the waterman seize them?</p>
               <p>Thorn. No, he did not; he pulled them away [rowed away] as fast as he could. I took a boat and rowed after them - There were some lighters a little way off, and some boats faitened to them, and I took one of them and rowed after them. When they came on shore I jumped upon a lighter, got on shore and took hold of the Prisoner and kept her. - I could not take them all for I had not a Constable?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing upon her?</p>
               <p>Thorn. I did not examine her as to that; the Justice asked me whether I could swear to the money in my pocket? I said, I could not; but it was small silver - I believe the Prisoner took it because she was by me.</p>
               <p>Q. They were all three by you, why might not one of the others take it?</p>
               <p>Thorn. The other two did not come near me after the money was lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Which side of the table did the other women sit on?</p>
               <p>Thorn. They sat on the off side of the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Prisoner near enough to touch you after you pulled out the money to pay the reckoning?</p>

We walked along Hog-Lane till we came to the Baker and Basket , and then I felt Roach's hand in my breeches pocket; finding his hand in my pocket, I called out to Mr. Newton and told him I was robbed: with that he turned from my left side to Roach and collared him, and then they skuffled together in the road - I lost 8 s. - I had in that pocket 23 or 24 s. and in my left hand pocket I had 3 guineas - I did not know what I had lost till I came home. Mr. Newton secured Roach that night, and the next morning he told me he had taken the other; the Constable shewed me a paper which was taken from Roach, which was a bill of parcels I had taken that night in Shoreditch of 30 l. odd money.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the bill of parcels in that pocket the money was in?</p>
               <p>Brampton. I can't tell which pocket it was in; whether it was my waistcoat or breeches pocket. - I had 13 s. when I came home - A watchman and Mr. Newton went home along with me. - I am sure I lost 8 s. and some halfpence.</p>
               <p>Jury. You say the Prisoner said to Newton you are heavy loaden, was you in liquor?</p>

            . I was along with Mr. Brampton at the Swan Tavern, with a person he paid twenty six guineas to: Mr. Brampton was very much in liquor and wanted a coach. I said, if they would give me a broomstick I would see him home; these two lads were at the end of Hog-Lane, and I had a full sight of them. They said, master, you are very heavy loaden ; and, as Mr. Brampton says, they agreed to go with us, and Roach took hold of his right arm: we went together as far as the Baker and Basket in Hog-Lane; then Brampton said, hollo, Newton! the fellow has got his hand in my pocket, and said that his pocket was picked. I had got the broomstick in my hand, and I said I would knock his brains out if he offered to move, and then the money fell down - I don't know how much: then he pretty artfully catched hold of me and threw me over the rails into the road, but we both tumbled over together. Bucklimes was looking for the money: I still held Roach by the collar, and Bucklimes seeing I had managed him, held this stick up and said, G - d - your eyes , if you don't let him go, I'll knock your brains out; when I had him down I cried out murder, and in some little time the watch came.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of the money?</p>
               <p>Newton. I'll tell you, Sir; I found one shilling that night, and there were three shillings found afterwards - The money was found in the place where Brampton lay down, for he was very drunk.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you hear the money chink after Brampton told you his pocket was picked?</p>
               <p>Newton. Yes, and the money dropped out of Roach's hand; there was some money found in the tenter ground, and some in King Street. Roach was carried to the watch-house, and that money was delivered to me at the watch-house, and one shilling was found in his shoes: then I went home with Mr. Brampton and examined his pockets; the next morning Roach was examined before a Justice of the peace, and there he said I had robbed him of 3 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Roach. What was the first place I met you at?</p>
               <p>Newton. It was at the end of Hog-Lane.</p>
               <p>- Bricknell (Constable). This note was taken out of Roach's hand in the watch-house, and there was a shilling found upon the ground near him - The watchmen were searching him when this paper was taken out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Jury. When did Mr. Brampton fall down?</p>
               <p>Brampton. Not till after my pocket was picked.</p>

They had drank 3 pints of beer, and had had a pennyworth of bread and a pennyworth of cheese, and had no money to pay the man. As soon as I saw them, I charged them with robbing me. Pugh said, What do you mean by that, Mrs. Moore? there's no body here has robbed you: and Banham said, It is a lie, for we have robbed her. The next day I had them before a Justice, and then both of them owned that they had bought each of them a gown out of the golden guinea they had robbed me of, (they have the gowns upon their backs now) and each of them an apron, a shift, and a silk handkerchief; the handkerchiefs cost half a crown apiece - There was a guinea and a half in gold, 7 s. in silver, and 2 d. - I found 2 spoons at Mr. Tyson's, facing St. George's church in Southwark , by their direction. They owned they had sold my coral to Mr. Peters in the borough; (Banham told the Justice, that Mrs. Peters melted it down as soon as she had it) and that they had sold the buttons at Mr. Bennet's at the bridge-foot.</p>

As we were going to a Justice of the Peace, I went up to a man that the people told me the Prisoner nodded at, and went to lay hold of him, and that man presented a pistol to me, and told me he would blow my brains out, if I came any nearer: I came up pretty near at him, and he presented his pistol again, and made his escape. He presented his pistol at every one he met as he went along. - There was nothing found upon the Prisoner. The Justice asked him to discover his accomplices, and he said he had none.</p>

            . I was looking out of my window, and saw the Prisoner at the bar go into Mr. Lockall's house - it was just after the people were gone to church. I suspected he was a thief, for there was another person came and stood about 10 or a dozen yards short of him, on the other side of the way. I drew my head in again, that they might not observe me, and I saw the prisoner come out again, with something in his apron, and he walked very soberly towards the other man. I said, There is a boy come out of Mr. Lockall's house with something in his apron, and I believe he has robbed him; and cried out stop thief; and then the Prisoner ran along, and cried stop thief. One of them run on one side of the street, and the other on the other side; but when they came to the corner of the street, one turned one corner, and the other the other corner. - I believe the prisoner was about 5 or 6 minutes in the house.</p>

I went to an acquaintance's house in Bow-Street, and not getting in there I was going to another place, and met this woman in Drury-Lane; and she said, Baker, where are you going?</p>
               <p>Jury. Were you sober?</p>
               <p>Caryl. I was not drunk - I can't say I was quite sober - No, no, I was not drunk: we went together into Windsor-Court, and I staid there all night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lie alone?</p>
               <p>Caryl. Yes, I did; the Prisoner gave me a candle, and I went up stairs and went to bed; and she came up and fetched the candle away - I had no liquor, the Prisoner and another woman or two that were there had some. I lay till near seven o'clock on Sunday morning, then I was going to get up. I went to take my breeches from under my head to look what it was o'clock, and my watch was gone. I happened to light upon the Prisoner the 24th of July and had her taken up - I am sure I had it when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that?</p>
               <p>Caryl. Yes, I am. I did not come here to take a false oath; when I came down there was only an old woman, and I asked her concerning it, and she said there had been nobody in the room but the woman who lighted me up - I never had my watch again, and know no more of it but by her confession before the Justice - She confessed she took the watch, and gave it to a gentleman who had pledged it, but she did not say where it was pledged.</p>

            . Last Wednesday sennight I was in the kitchen backwards, and was surprized with a very great noise; I thought the servants had been fighting: I went into the shop and they were very quiet; the maid went a little way up stairs and came down very much frightened, for she saw her mistress's cloaths scattered about the stairs. I happened to look up and saw the sash up two pair of stairs lifted up, and the Prisoner look out of the window; I cried out Thieves directly, and she made the best of her way down stairs to get out of the house; but one of my servants seized her coming down stairs; she fell down on her knees, begged we would forgive her and said she would never do so any more; I believe she had loaded herself too much and made a false step and so tumbled down stairs. <rs id="t17440912-36-verdict192" type="verdictDescription">

            . As I was at work in a brick field, I heard a noise of men quarreling for upwards of a quarter of an hour; I left off work and went into the brick field where they were and went up within six yards of them; and there stood the Deceased, and the Prisoner came up to him; the Deceased said what is it you would have? And the Prisoner said what do you want with me, sirrah? What do you mean by abusing me in this manner? Upon that the deceased asked him if he would fight him: fight you, says the Prisoner, what should I fight you for? you fight me! Says the deceased, fight you, aye, but won't you take the Law of me? the Prisoner said to the deceased, I take the Law of you, what should I take the Law of you for? with that the deceased struck the Prisoner or struck at him - I can't tell whether he struck him, but he struck at him; - they had each of them sticks. (The stick the Prisoner had was produced, which was a small bamboo cane with a crook Ivory head, part of which was broke off.) After he had struck at the Prisoner, the Prisoner struck at him again; and after several blows had passed on both sides, the Prisoner laid hold of the deceased and threw him down with his face upon the ground; his face was very bloody and the blood run down very sadly between his Eyes. After he was down the Prisoner beat him with his stick several times, and broke his stick upon him. Then a person took him up, but the Prisoner being stronger than he drove him four or five yards, and he fell down flat upon his back in a cart rut; and then the Prisoner went to strike at him again, though I don't know that he struck him any more, but the deceased lay in a dismal condition; for I believe he was in liquor, and what between that and the blows he could not stir himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you observe the deceased turn from the Prisoner, and then the Prisoner follow him and strike at him.</p>
               <p>Smart. I did not see that - the deceased had the biggest stick.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you observe that when the deceased was down, the Prisoner continued to strike him over the back and reins?</p>
               <p>Smart. Yes, and I asked whether he was going to murder the man, and the people said the deceased began first; I said if he did begin first he ought not to be murdered.</p>
               <p>Sparham, Surgeon. On the 16 or 17 of May, I was sent for to the deceased, which was thirteen days, as I was informed, after he had received an injury by Mr. James the Quaker; there was a wound upon his nose, which upon searching I found was almost healed up by his own applications, and I found his under jaw contracted close; his swallowing prevented almost entirely; he could not go to stool and could hardly make water. I examined his head to see if he had received any wound there; there was no fracture, and I could not perceive any wound except that in his nose: I did something to relax the jaw and to make him evacuate; but in about three days he died: the upper part of the bone of the nose was bruised, upon which I put my probe into the outward membrane or covering of the bone, and the probe came through into the roof of his mouth, and by the simpathy between one membrane and another, this bruise occasioned the contraction of the jaw, so that it is my opinion the man died of a penury or a perfect starving.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know an instance of this nature before?</p>
               <p>Sparham. Yes, two or three times; but 'tis very rare, I saw it once in a carman; that such a contraction was occasioned by the bruise of one of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174409120019"/> his fingers. It is my opinion this contraction occasioned the want of swallowing and going to stool, and that this contraction was occasioned by this blow.</p>
               <p>Jury. Mr. Sparham, if you had been sent for at first might not this have been prevented?</p>
               <p>Sparham. I believe if I had been sent for I should have laid it open, and that would have relieved the membrane. <rs id="t17440912-37-verdict197" type="verdictDescription">

            . The Prisoner came to lodge with me August the 14th, and desired leave to go into my room to work a border for a cap; and while my little girl was gone of an errand, she took twelve guineas out of my box with a false key. They were separately wrapped up in a piece of brown paper; I missed them September the 3d, and saw them there a week before - I suspected the Prisoner because there was nobody else in the room, and when she came to lodge with me she was very poor and mean, and could not pay for washing or lodging. On Saturday the 1st of September she brought in a parcel of goods, I have an inventory of them; there was a pair of callimanco shoes, 4 s. 6 d. a pair of breeded shoes, 8 s. a pair of stays a guinea and a half, a hood and cloak in the nature of a capuchin with a lace round it, two pair of muffatees, half a guinea, there was a silk gown and some shifts, but I don't know the value of them: she gave a woman sixpence to bring them into the house. She dressed herself up and went that Saturday to Ranelagh-House with a gentleman. I asked her how she came by the money. She said she had a guinea and a half of that gentleman. She continued in the house, she did not run away.</p>

               <p>William Hall. On the 3d of this month about eight o'clock in the evening, I was coming from Edmonton to London in a hackney coach - There were also in the coach Mrs. Pickersgill and a child of her's, Mr. Gretton, and Mr. Podger. On the other side of Islington fronting a lane they call <placeName id="t17440912-48-crimeloc247">Frog-Lane</placeName>

I sat some little time, and found means to secrete my watch under the cushion of the coach; when I had done that, I desired he would use us civilly and he should have what we had; then he made use of another oath, and bid us come out of the coach. - There were two others with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the other Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Hall. I was very cautious of looking too much at them, for fear they should think I was drawing their pictures as they call it. I came out of the coach, MackEvoy rifled my pockets, turned them inside out, and took out 4 s. 6 d. or 5 s. 6 d. and half a guinea, a bone perfume box, a tin tobacco box and a knife; when they had rifled my pockets so far, I was left by myself; presently the same man [ MackEvoy ] catches off one sleeve of my coat which came pretty easily off; then came another and pulled off the other sleeve, and he that pulled off the last sleeve took the coat away, and instantly as the sleeve of my coat was pulled off, my hat and wig were pulled off behind me, but I cannot tell who took them; there was a linen handkerchief taken with my coat it being in the pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Considering it was eight o'clock at night, how could you see MackEvoy so as to distinguish him?</p>
               <p>Hall. The moon shone, and I had so much reason to remark him, for he was the first man that came up to the coach, and as I was secreting my watch, I looked pretty much in his face to see whether he observed my motion about the watch. He has a very remarkable face, and his voice is as remarkable - After they had robbed me they took the other gentlemen out of the coach and robbed them, and then went up Frog-Lane - They were all on foot .</p>
               <p>Q. Had MackEvoy a cutlass?</p>
               <p>Hall. I saw two cutlasses, but I don't know whether MackEvoy had any or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they do any thing with their cutlasses ?</p>
               <p>Hall. They cut one gentleman who was in the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. When were they taken up afterwards?</p>
               <p>Hall. They were taken up by an accident . Capt. Dodd at the Savoy sent a letter concerning them: I saw them before Justice Fraser, and knew MackEvoy directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing taken upon them?</p>
               <p>Hall. There was a trunk taken upon them, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174409120023"/> in that trunk were several things that were stole. - I had nothing back again but this bone perfume box, which I can't tell whether I took out of the trunk, or off the table at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>MackEvoy. Pray, Sir, what clothes had I on then?</p>
               <p>Hall. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>MackEvoy. What dress was I in?</p>
               <p>Hall. You had a cap or a handkerchief tied about your head, I cannot tell which.</p>
               <p>MackEvoy. Tis a strange case that a man should distinguish a man's face, when he could not tell whether he had a cap or a handkerchief on. Was the handkerchief down upon my face or no?</p>
               <p>Hall. It was not down over your face, it was in the nature of a cap.</p>
               <p>MackEvoy. Can a man have a handkerchief upon his head without its covering his face?</p>
               <p>Hall. Yes, very easily.</p>

            . I was in the coach with Mr. Hall, and saw a person come up to the coach with a pistol in his hand: I can't swear positively, but I verily believe MackEvoy is the person, he had (as Mr. Hall says) a cap or a handkerchief upon his head, but not a wig: he used the same expression as Mr. Hall says; when he put the pistol into the coach I endeavoured to secrete something as Mr. Hall did. After he had taken Mr. Hall's money, they took him out of the coach; then I saw two persons about him, and saw them very busy about his pockets - Rifling them.</p>
               <p>Q. You say to the best of your remembrance that MackEvoy was one, can you say any thing to Ryley ?</p>
               <p>Gretton. I said I believed it was MackEvoy; and I think the same of, Ryley, I have the same idea of both of them, but I can't positively swear to them: the moon was in and out, and the moon glistened against the pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see ever another person there?</p>
               <p>Gretton. Yes, I thought there were four persons in the robbery, I thought so all along; and Mr. Hall said then that he should know one of them. - Ryley had his hat flapped, and I think a dark wig on as he has now.</p>
               <p>MackEvoy. Should you know me to be the person, if you were to meet me at any part of the town?</p>
               <p>Hall. I really should, for I looked full in your face, and remember it particularly well.</p>

            . I was behind the coach: at the end of Frog-Lane I saw three men; one came up to the horse's heads, and the other to the coach side, and bid the people in the coach deliver their watches and money, and he that was at the horse's heads said he would blow their brains out - The first thing I saw them do was taking Mr. Hall out of the coach, and then they rifled him and took his coat, and after they had stripped him of his coat, one of them took off his hat and wig behind him - I believe the Prisoners are the men, they were about their bulk and stature, but I cannot swear to their faces. I heard Mr. Hall say at the Justice's, that he could swear to MackEvoy.</p>
               <p>MackEvoy. Are there not other persons of my size and stature ?</p>
               <p>Pickersgill. There may be so, but I verily believe you are the man.</p>
               <p>MackEvoy. How many came up to you?</p>
               <p>Pickersgill. There were three.</p>
               <p>MackEvoy. The other gentleman says there were four.</p>
               <p>Pickersgill. I am sure there were three, there might be more; they came rushing from the end of the lane up to the coach.</p>

However we went into the house, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174409120025"/> MackEvoy jumped out of the window in his shirt and a handkerchief about his head; and the man of the house stood by the door of the room, where they were, in his shirt and said, I should not go into that room. But Capt. Dodd's men broke open the door, and I took Ryley covered over head and ears in bed, and this hanger was lying by his bed side. I was not careful enough to secure the hanger then, but the woman of the house put it into another room. The landlord had got into bed again, and I said to him, friend, you had better discover the fire-arms. He said there were no fire-arms, but a hanger in a trunk that belonged to Ryley, and we found these three hangers in the trunk.</p>
               <p>Pris. Ryley. Did I offer to run away or resist in any way?</p>
               <p>Thomas. No.</p>

               <p>MackEvoy. Do you expect any part of the reward?</p>

               <p>Frost. I am not able to think of their names. Last monday was sennight about eleven o'clock at night, Askin came home and the two men at the bar with him - I am sure it was on monday sennight - I am sure the Prisoners are the men, because they had been with him several times before. The manner of their coming was thus; Askin came to the door first, and said open the door and take away the light. I did not see any thing brought in for they went up in the dark - I knew who they were by their coming down together afterwards. Askin came down asked for a candle and went up again, and I thought I heard them telling of money. They all came down together I believe in about a quarter of an hour, and they all three sat down in a little room we have below and sent for two full pots of beer. After that Ryley took his leave of the other two and went home, and MackEvoy lodged all night with Askin. After these two went up, I having some suspicion that they were something worse than smugglers, as they pretended to be, stepped up stairs, looked through the door, and saw MackEvoy pull off his clothes and put on a scarlet coat. Those two rose about five or six o'clock in the morning and went out, but what they brought in or carried out I do not know.</p>

               <p>Q. Who brought the box?</p>
               <p>Burchall.

               <p>Burchall. You are the person, and you gave me directions how to spell your name; you said I must make a large (M) then (ack) a great (E) a narrow bottomed (v) and (oy).</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the box that was brought to your house?</p>
               <p>Burchall. This is the box, I know it by the direction, and this is the box that was opened at Justice Fraser's. There were four watches taken out of it, three silver ones and a studded one, and some plate buttons, and there was a little Ivory Box taken out of it [Mr. Hall's box] - I never saw Ryley till now, and I never saw MackEvoy till he brought the box.</p>

He asked him if he robbed Alderman Heathcote, he said no. He asked him if he robbed the coach at Islington, and he told him he did, and that he would make large discoveries if he was admitted an Evidence.</p>

Last Thursday was sennight about twelve o'clock at noon, there was a trunk brought with a direction to be left at the King's-arms in Bishopsgate Church-yard . I went up stairs into a large drinking room, and there was the Evidence Askin, and the two Prisoners together. I asked them if any of them owned a trunk that was ordered to be left at my house, and Askin said it was his trunk, that he had some clothes in it and designed to send it to an Inn to go to West Chester. I had a letter from Capt. Dodd to bring the trunk to Justice Fraser's, and it was carried there afterwards; there were in it three silver watches, a silver snuff-box, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Gostelow. I believe he is not, but I can't be positive; then another person came to me, put his hand in my pocket, and took my watch and 2 s. 6 d. in money.</p>
               <p>Alderman Heathcote. Did he take only the watch out of your pocket, or the money and watch both?</p>
               <p>Gostelow. I believe he took both; but I cannot be positive - my back was towards them, and I had some difficulty to keep the horses quiet, that I had no opportunity of making much observation.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they rob the coach first or you first?</p>
               <p>Gostelow . There were some of them robbing the coach, but whether they robbed it at the same time or a little before or a little after I cannot tell - after they had robbed me, they turned about and did not return any more - they went off towards the gate, towards Hack ney.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the watch your own?</p>
               <p>Gostelow. It is mine and it is not - it was in pawn to me for about two guineas - when I was paid the two guineas I was to return the watch.</p>

               <p>Gostelow. I think it was one person that robbed me both of watch and money.</p>
               <p>Q. to Askin. You say you took his money.</p>
               <p>Askin. Yes, I got up upon the coach box and took his money.</p>
               <p>Q. Who robbed the coach?</p>
               <p>Askin.

            .</p>
               <p>Q. Did he rob the Alderman before he robbed the coachman?</p>
               <p>Askin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. to Gostelow. Was your master robbed first or you?</p>
               <p>Gostelow. Really I can't say, I think it was at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same man that robbed the Alderman, that robbed you?</p>
               <p>Gostelow. It was dark, I could not tell.</p>
               <p>Askin. After I had taken the coachman's money I rifled the footman. Then we went towards Hackney, and went that night to the blue Lion in Red-Lion Street.</p>
               <p>Alderman Heathcote. Did the coachman readily deliver his watch?</p>
               <p>Askin. No, he was very unwilling to deliver it.</p>
               <p>Alderman Heathcote. How came he to deliver it then?</p>
               <p>Askin. I believe, because you said, give him the watch and I'll make you satisfaction for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174409120027"/>Q. to Gostelow. Did the man that bid you stand stay till the coach was robbed, or did he go away directly?</p>
               <p>Gostelow . He went off a little way, and came up again .</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was Alderman Heathcote's footman robbed of any thing?</p>
               <p>Askin. He was robbed of some money . - I can't tell how much, because we committed several robberies that night; I put all the money together.</p>
               <p>[Alderman Heathcote made a motion to speak.]</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I beg your silence, Mr. Alderman Heathcote, if you please; I desire Askin may be asked, whether he took a watch from Alderman Heathcote's footman?</p>
               <p>Askin. No, I did not take a watch from him, if I had twenty watches I would not deny that I had them.</p>
               <p>Alderman Heathcote. Did not you search my fingers for rings?</p>
               <p>Askin. I came up to you and asked for your rings, and you said you had none, and I took your Honour's word.</p>
               <p>Alderman Heathcote. My chariot was stopped in Hackney-Marsh , about the middle of the marsh between the bridge and Hummerton-Gate . One of the persons who came up to the chariot door, and presented a pistol into the chariot, had my money and my watch, and took me out of the chariot and rifled my pockets: I saw one of them at the wheel of the chariot, and heard him say he would blow my coachman's brains out, if he would not give him the watch. I was afraid he would do the coachman some mischief, as he did not readily give him the watch, and (as the Evidence has declared) I desired him to give him the watch, and I would pay him for it. Upon which, my Lord, I believe the coachman either gave them the watch, or suffered them to take it from him - He told me he had lost a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you look at the person that robbed you?</p>
               <p>Alderman Heathcote. I looked at him a little as he was by the side of the chariot, but I did not look much at him, because I thought he might think I did it with a view of bringing him to justice.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please to ask Mr. Alderman Heathcote whether his footman lost his watch?</p>

               <p>Alderman Heathcote. I can't tell what my footman lost; he told me he lost a watch, and I advertised it according to the description he gave me of it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Mr. Alderman, had two of them pistols?</p>
               <p>Alderman Heathcote. I only saw one pistol that I could distinguish.</p>
               <p>Prisoner . I desire Alderman Heathcote's footman may be called?</p>

               <p>Thomas. No, he did not - I can't tell whose the box was; I opened the box and took out four watches, and I took three out of another box the Saturday before. [The box that had been in the possession of MackEvoy was produced.]</p>
               <p>Q. Did Gostelow challenge one of the watches?</p>

I said, gentlemen, I will give you my money directly, and I gave them 3 s. or 3 s. 6 d. in silver; then they asked me for my watch and my gold. I told them I had no watch, for I had put it into my coat pocket; they said they must search me: one of them put his hand into my breeches pocket, and took out a 36 s. piece with some keys. I asked them for the keys, and they returned them; they searched my coat on each side and felt nothing; then they insisted upon having the coat, and they took it from me with my watch in one of the pockets, and went away directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other man with them?</p>
               <p>Hazard. I saw but two of them: I met a single person before, but he did not say any thing to me. I saw my watch and my buttons at Justice Fraser's. This is my watch and these are my buttons.</p>

               <p>Hazard. I don't know their faces, their hats were quite flapped over them; it was very dark, they were much about the same size as the Prisoners.</p>

            . These keys [there were three keys produced] I took out of Ryley's breeches pocket while he was in bed - This is the key that opened the box, the buttons were taken out of.</p>
               <p>Ryley. What do you know it by?</p>
               <p>Dell. I know it by a dent in it.</p>
               <p>Ryley. How do you know the breeches you took the keys out of, were my breeches?</p>
               <p>Dell. Because you owned the breeches, MackEvoy's breeches were leather.</p>
               <p>Ryley. I asked you for a mark upon the keys, and you will not tell me any.</p>
               <p>MackEvoy. Gentlemen of the Jury, please to hear me; that key is mine and I can give the description of it before I see it: was there a string to it or no?</p>
               <p>Dell. Two of them were tied together with a reddish string, but the other bright key that opened the box had no string. <rs id="t17440912-50-verdict261" type="verdictDescription">

            . Mr. Jones and I went out together last Sunday, and returning home going down Long-Lane, I had occasion to ease myself and he kept on. In about two or three minutes I came up with him, and he was by the rounds near Hosier-Lane, I said, Hollo, Mr. Jones! said he, I am robbed. I took hold of this boy in the blue coat [Peirson] and Jones took hold of him in the green [ Fitzwalter ] one had an apron on hanging down, and the other had something about him tucked up. I saw Jones without his hat and wig; then four or five fellows came up to us and said, What are you going to do with those boys? One of them had a stick and jobbed it in my face, and they said they would cut us as small as sausages if we did not let them go, and indeed I was glad to let them go. - I saw something glisten, but whether it was a sword or a hanger I cannot tell - I know these are the persons, because we had them a minute or two under a lamp in Smithfield. The Tuesday following I saw the Prisoners in the fair in Southwark, and I said to one that was there, these chaps robbed a friend of mine last Sunday. I dogged them out of the fair to St. Margaret's-Hill, and then took them; and Peirson said in the coach as we were coming along, that we could not hurt them, for they did nothing but pick pockets of handkerchiefs - They said they lived in Black Boy-Alley.</p>

            . On the 4th of this instant about six o'clock in the evening, the deceased and I were walking on little Tower-hill, I saw the Prisoner in company with a woman standing close to the houses. After I had passed the Prisoner, I walked I believe about ten yards and missed my companion (the deceased) I looked back and saw the deceased<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174409120031"/> talking to the Prisoner, upon which having a suspicion of a quarrel, I came back again and interposed between the Prisoner and the deceased. I got between the deceas'd and the Prisoner without saying any thing to him or he to me, seeing the knife drawn and having no weapon of defence, neither sword nor stick, I went back, and going back the Prisoner made a stab at me with his knife; upon his making the push at me I got upon the hill, where I saw six or seven Gentlemen with sticks or cane in their hands, upon which I related the affair to them and begged one of them to lend me a stick to defend my life, which I apprehended to be in danger and borrowed one; I came back to the Prisoner (who I still saw with his knife drawn) and said to him, You villain, if you don't put up your knife I'll knock you down - I held the stick up at him but did not strike him. The Prisoner upon my threatning him in this manner put his knife up; upon which I was going to return the stick to the Gentleman I borrowed it of, but before I gave it to him I met with another Dutchman (as I suppose by his apparel) and he had one of his hands in the side pocket of his breeches. Then I heard some people cry out for me to take care of my self for he had his hand upon a knife, upon which I bid him keep off or I would knock him down, and the man did not offer to come any further; so I looked back and saw the Prisoner pursuing the deceased, who was retreating backwards.</p>

               <p>Q. Had the deceased a stick in his hand?</p>
               <p>Hartcup. The deceased had a stick in his hand and kept going backwards, and the Prisoner with a knife in his hand was pursuing him - I saw the deceased make some blows at the Prisoner at that time with a stick - I can't say whether he struck him or no; upon which the Prisoner rushed upon the deceased, got on his left side and stabbed him in the back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he close with him or hold him?</p>
               <p>Hartcup. The Prisoner put his left hand to the fore part of the deceased's body, and put his right hand behind him and stabbed him in the back, upon which the Prisoner run into the sign of the Hamburgh-arms . I seeing what was done pursued him as fast as I could, and came up to the door of the house, but was refused admittance and I could not get in; then I returned back to the deceased and he was carried into Justice Willoughby's brewhouse yard: I saw him there lying upon some boards. I believe Mr. Willoughby sent for a Surgeon and he examined the wound - it was under his right shoulder and bled pretty much. I attended him to the Infirmary in Goodmans-fields . About an hour and half after the thing was done, as I was going up stairs with him I asked him how he did; the answer he made me was, that he should die, and he repeated it often that he should die and was a dead man - the deceased was a soldier, I was conscious he would die and I sat myself down by his bed-side - this might be about three hours after the wound was received: I asked him whether he gave the first offence, the answer he made me was, as I hope for mercy I did not offend him at all [that is the Prisoner]. He said he saw a woman in the Prisoner's company and passed them, but the passage being very narrow he believed he might touch both the Prisoner and the woman, and at that instant of time he received a blow from the Prisoner with a stick; this the deceased alledged to me was the Reason of his first stopping; this is all I have to say, my Lord - the deceased was a very civil man, had not been above a month in the regiment, and had an estate in the country of 33 l. a year .</p>

            . I am a labourer at the Victualling-office, about half an hour after six I saw the deceased and the Prisoner at the Hamburgh-arms door. There the Prisoner drew his knife and followed the deceased about twelve yards. I said to the deceased take care of yourself or he will stick you: I believe I said so three or four times. Soon after I had given him this caution, the Prisoner jumped upon the deceased and stabbed him in the back - The deceased had a stick in his hand, but did not strike the Prisoner, as the Prisoner pursued him he held his stick up (as I believe) to keep his guard in his own defence.</p>
               <p>Fortune Willoughby. I happened to hear a noise and run to the gate of the brew-house yard, and I saw the deceased strike the Dutchman two blows with a stick, he offered to strike a third time and his arm fell down. Upon that the deceased clapp'd his left hand to his coat and waistcoat, unbuttoned it and pulled it off, and the blood came through his shirt from his right shoulder down to his breeches; then the landlady of the Hamburgh-arms came out and took the Prisoner into the house. With that the deceased's comrade [Hartcup] came up and broke the windows and the mob rose so high that I thought they would have pulled the house down - I believe Hartcup did it for fear they should favour the escape of the Prisoner - I did not see any thing before the two blows, but I thought this was a very peaceable Dutchman to take two blows without striking again, not knowing that the deceased had received a wound before - when he came into the yard he was very bad; a Surgeon came to examine the wound and I looked on it, which I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174409120032"/> was sorry I did, for I never saw such a wound in my life - it was a sort of a triangle.

His hand was round the handle of the knife and he closed in upon him; - he put his hand to the forepart of his body and jobbed the knife into his back, and then gave his hand a turn - whether it was to pull it out, or to put it in farther I cannot say, and as soon as he had stabbed him, he went into the Hamburgh arms .</p>

            . I am a labourer belonging to the Victualling-office. As I was coming along I saw a great crowd and the deceased retiring backwards, and the Prisoner pursuing him with a knife in his hand - the deceased had a stick in his hand and did hold it up, but I did not see him strike; then the Dutchman stabbed him in the same manner as the other witnesses have related.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the deceased had struck the Prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I did not see a blow struck: the deceased did offer to strike him; but the Prisoner closed in upon him and stabbed him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Harrison. The unhappy fellow the deceased was brought into the London Infirmary on Tuesday the 4th of September. I did not see him that night, my brother Surgeon of the Infirmary dressed him. The next day I took off the dressing and observed a wound in the back about an inch in length at a small distance from the Spine. I did not see that it bled at that time or that it had bled in the night; but upon enlarging the external wound, I perceived that it penetrated into the cavity of the breast between the 10th and 11th ribs through which I could very easily pass my finger next day at the dressing of the wound; upon opening of the wound there was so large a discharge of blood that the man fainted with the loss of it. I took a proper method to prevent a greater effusion being apprehensive of fatal consequences. The symptoms of death encreased so fast that I thought it impossible to do him any good, and he died on Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the wound made at once?</p>
               <p>Harrison. It was made at once, for the knife came out in the same direction it went in: I opened the body on Sunday night, and then I made farther discoveries, which confirmed me in the opinion that the wound was the occasion of his death.</p>
               <p>Q. According to the account that has been given of the wound it was just under the right shoulder.</p>
               <p>Harrison. That account is erroneous.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the depth of the wound?</p>
               <p>Harrison. I imagine the depth of the wound to be about four inches. The knife must have passed between those ribs through the Diaphragma and wounded the liver; there was a wound in the liver of near two inches in depth and one in width, and I am very certain that wound was the immediate cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bleed much inwardly?</p>
               <p>Harrison. The cavity of the Thorax might contain at that time a quart or three pints of blood besides what he must have lost before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the deceased make any declarations as to the occasion of this accident?</p>
               <p>Harrison. He told me he had not given any offence to this Dutchman either by word or deed, and if he had brushed against him or given him any shove, it must have been inadvertently and undesignedly in passing by. - He was very sensible at the time he made this declaration.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner in his defence said, he was at Mrs. Stepperfields, and saw two or three men walking on Tower-hill, that one of them [the deceased] u gainst him, that he asked him why he ran so rudely against him, the other answered him by cursing and swearing and threatning him, to which the Prisoner answered, You must not use me so, you must not speak against my life, that the deceased had a stick and struck him two or three times, and the other soldier [Hartcup] coming up, he was necessitated to draw his knife in his defence; but does not know that he wounded the deceased.</p>

            . I keep the Hamburgh-arms . I saw the Prisoner and the deceased at words, the Prisoner gave his stick away and said what do you intend to fight? Then the deceased said, what does that son of a bitch come upon the Hill for? In the mean while another Dutchman took hold of the Prisoners arm to keep him from fighting, then the deceased run and snatched a stick out of another person's hand, came behind him and struck him three or four blows over his head, and he had nothing to defend himself with, so he put his right hand into his pocket and drew his knife, and said, take care of your self, keep off, and then jumped at him under the left arm, and stabbed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Prisoner speak in English or Dutch?</p>
               <p>Stepperfield. He spoke in Dutch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see the Prisoner pursue the deceased?</p>
               <p>Stepperfield. No, not at all - the Dutchman had done nothing at all to the deceased that I know of - I did not see the first blow, I saw the deceased give the Prisoner two blows before the accident happened.</p>

               <p>Stepperfield. He run up to him, he had his knife in his hand then, to do something or other.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the first time the soldier struck the Dutchman?</p>
               <p>Stepperfield. Just before the thing was done - the Prisoner did not pursue the deceased before the deceased struck him.</p>
               <p>Q. When the Dutchman said keep off, did not the deceased retire?</p>
               <p>Stepperfield. No, he did not; the Prisoner had turned his face to my house in order to go away, and the deceased struck him two or three blows, then the Prisoner turned upon him - both the Soldiers had struck him before he drew his knife - After he had stabbed the deceased, Hartcup came and broke all the windows in the house.</p>
               <p>Hartcup. There were but three panes of glass broke.</p>

            . [being a foreigner his Evidence was given by the Interpreter]. I came out of Stepperfield's house and saw the Prisoner in trouble, I said what have you to do with them? I took him away pretty near to Stepperfield's house, and then both the Soldiers came up to him, and both of them struck him upon his head till he reeled; I was in fear of being struck by them, so I left the Prisoner. The Prisoner seeing himself alone drew his knife and stabbed him in the manner you have heard.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you whether you did not see the deceased retire, and the Prisoner pursuing him with his knife in his hand?</p>
               <p>Bremer. No, I did not; before the Prisoner stabbed him, he said, beware (in Dutch) and one of the Soldiers, (I think it was the deceased) gave him two or three blows more after the wound was given - both the Soldiers beat him before the wound was given.</p>

After that one of the Soldiers gave the Prisoner such a terrible blow on the head, that he had like to have tumbled down - the deceased struck the Prisoner before he drew his knife, and then the Prisoner gave him a push in the back - whether he had a knife or no I can't tell - he went under and struck him in the back - both the Soldiers struck the Prisoner before he gave the wo .</p>

             (servant to Stepperfield ) I was going out of my mistress's house and saw the Prisoner running to come in. The deceased came behind him and gave him three blows with a stick which made him reel; the Prisoner asked him whether he had a mind to fight? the deceased said, yes, then the deceased struck him again - Upon that the Prisoner immediately put his hand into his pocket, but I can't tell whether he drew his knife or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you understand Dutch?</p>

               <p>Thomas Way. I was at the Hamburgh-Arms , and hearing a noise I went out, and saw a man in a white coat, and a red waistcoat [the deceased] push the Prisoner with his arm; the Prisoner asked him in Dutch if he would fight - The deceased had no stick, but he jumped over the way and took a stick with a nob at the end of it from another person, and gave the Prisoner three or four strokes over the head, so that he could hardly stand (there was another Dutchman by, and he went away for fear he should have some other blows) then the deceased gave the Prisoner some other blows. The Dutchman put his hand to his head to put his hat right, and then put his hand in his pocket and spoke a word that I did not understand - During all this time the deceased was not wounded at all.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the person ride a straddle?</p>
               <p>Brotherton. Yes;

             the other boy was stopped first, and the person told him there was something in the mail that belonged to him, and Tapping said if there was he should not have it - Then the person stopped me, and said I must go along with him and he would not hurt me, then I was carried into a great field about half a mile out of the way; to the side of a great gravel pit, and the person desired me to jump down that place; I told him I could not, but at last I jumped down - He made me jump down, for he was going to draw a pistol at me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you jump down with your horse?</p>
               <p>Brotherton. I sat on my horse and jumped down, I can't say I jumped down, for I tumbled down; then the person opened the mail and took out the Exeter bag and the Portsmouth bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the person stay with you after that?</p>
               <p>Brotherton. She put her hand in her pocket, and gave me a shilling.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. What makes you say, her?</p>
               <p>Brotherton. Because I took her to be a woman.</p>
               <p>Council. What made you think so?</p>
               <p>Brotherton. I thought so by her voice and her hand.</p>
               <p>Council. Why by her hand?</p>
               <p>Brotherton. Because it was a soft hand.</p>
               <p>Council. How do you know it was a soft hand.</p>
               <p>Brotherton. Bec ause she took hold of my hand when I was in the pit.</p>
               <p>Council. What did she take hold of your hand for?</p>
               <p>Brotherton. She shook hands with me.</p>
               <p>Council. Look at that woman with the child in her arms, and see whether you think she is the person?</p>
               <p>Brotherton. I can't be positive to the person - The person had a crape over her face; and a long white wig on.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you give any description of the clothes the person had on, or of the horse?</p>
               <p>Brotherton. Yes, the person had on a blue great coat, and rode upon a bald faced sorrel horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard the Prisoner speak since?</p>
               <p>Brotherton. Yes, and I believe her to be e same person.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174409120035"/>Q. Why do you take her to be the same person?</p>
               <p>Brotherton . By her voice, Sir.</p>
               <p>Jury. How long was it after the 8th of February before you saw the Prisoner again?</p>
               <p>Brotherton . I believe it was about a month - At Sir Thomas de Veil's.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were with her there, had you any apprehension that the voice was the same?</p>
               <p>Brotherton . Yes, Sir?</p>
               <p>Q. And you take upon you to swear that you thought then it was the same voice?</p>
               <p>Brotherton. I cannot swear 'tis the same voice. - I said to Sir

               <p>Q. What time did this thing happen?</p>
               <p>Brotherton. Between six and seven in the morning - I believe I did not go out of the office till five.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go after you were robbed?</p>
               <p>Brotherton. I went to Staines - I told them I had been robbed - I did not say any thing of it's being a woman's voice there - I did when I came to London to Mr. Robinson the Sollicitor to the Post-Office, that I thought it was a woman's voice, and to Mr. Jesse .</p>
               <p>Q. When was the crape put over the person's face?</p>
               <p>Brotherton. After I was in the pit; and the person kept my hat something over my eyes, that I could not very well see.</p>

I believe it was on the 29th of March that the Prisoner and Brotherton were before me, and Brotherton gave an account about the robbing the Western mail, and he said then that he was sure it was a woman by her voice, and by her hand: he said to the best of his remembrance the person that robbed him and gave him the shilling was the person that was then before me; and I think he said that he verily believed that the same blue veins that appeared there, were the same that gave him the shilling.</p>

            . When the Post-boy came to town, he gave an account to the Post Master General that he was robbed. I was immediately sent for; I asked him whether he could remember any thing about the voice, and he said, it was a comical voice, it was not like a man's voice, it was a womanish voice.</p>

               <p>Brotherton. It was a tall person.</p>

               <p>Pris. Coun. Did the Prisoner pay that money?</p>
               <p>Dare. It was laid down upon the book with the ring, I can't tell who laid it down - they were married according to the form of the Common-prayer and the Ceremonies of the Church of England; I took the Gentleman's hand and joined to the woman's, whether he thought the ceremony was over or no, I can't say, but he went to salute her, and I said, pray don't be in a hurry, have a little patience, and then you may do as you please - she was given away by a Gentleman I don't know. After the ceremony was over he gave the gentlewoman of the house a shilling for officiating as clerk, I said it was usual to give something more; he frowned, which made the cresses in his forehead appear more than ordinary, and I took particular notice of him - I observed his nose was remarkable; my Lord, there is something more corroborating, a gentleman came to me some little time afterwards, to know whether I had married one Mrs.

            . The Prisoner came into my stable-yard in Grosvenor-Mews, a young woman saw him run one of my fowls down and asked him why he chased the sow! down; he said it was his own, and he said he would have it, for he knew it by the marks; but he could find no mark upon it; then he went away and came again, and took the fowl before my face, put her into his basket and went away with it - he is a man that goes about to fell meat and fowls.</p>

               <p>The fowl being taken publicly in the day time, it could not be a felonious taking, and is rather actionable than indictable. Therefore the Prosecutrix (though with much reluctancy) acknowledged her self in the wrong, and asked the Prisoner's pardon in court, and he very readily forgave her.</p>
