                  <hi rend="italic">legal father and mother; it is said that the consent of the mother should have been obtained, but the law takes no more notice of the illegitimate child of a mother than of a father. For certain purposes the law recognises in the character of father or mother, the natural father or mother of an illegitimate child; but I am not aware that the law draws anp distinction between the father end mother's status in that respect; for certain purposes of affiliation &amp;c. after the age of sixteen, the mother's settlement, must decide that of the illegitimate child but that it a matter technically arising out of the law; the law really takes no further notice of the illegitimate child of the mother than of the father. It is said that the defendant might have made an affidavit according to the facts, that so have procured the licence, but he does not do soâ€”he distinctly points out George England as the person that has given his consent, and falsely swears that he hat done so. Then it it not the same at Reg. v. Phlipott, 2 Denison, p. 302, where it was held, that as the defendant had thought proper to make a matter material, it raised the question, and the materiality of perjury arose. I am unable to distinguish the principle of that case from the present; then it is impossible to contend that but for that false allegation the licence would have been issued. I find no trace in the Act of Parliament of making the law applicaple to a false oath control the materiality of the perjury; there is no necessity for any averment of materialityâ€”there was no such averment in Reg. V. Chapman, 1st Denison, which was discussed at great length in the Court of Criminal Appeal.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I apprehend that raises the same point, because if it be immaterial for this purpose it may be rejected; it is not necessary to him that ment proved, the mere fact that, it is averred carries it no further; the Jury may reject that portion of the indictment, and then it would stand that he had untruly sworn that George England had consented.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi> (<hi rend="italic">in reply). With regard to the averment of immaterial, there never wat any necessity for an averment of materiality in perjury at all; it was only put in by the pleaders when the alleged false state<lb/>ment did not show it to be material to the question; you must either show materiality on the face of the indictment, or aver it; in the present instance they have undertaken to show materiality on the face of it; they do not allege materiality, but they allege the absence of consent of the natural and lawful father, the person whom it is shown on the face of the indictment, according to the Act of Parliament, would be the person who alone could give consent; I should have contended, if that had been omitted, that the indictment would have been open to objection; that there was neither an averment of materiality, nor materiality thown. A distinction has been attempted to be drawn between this indictment and an ordinary indictment for perjury. I belive the only reason why a person cannot be indicted for taking a false oath before the Surrogate is, that it it not in a judicial proceeding, which it one of the elements of perjury, therefore is called "a false oath," but all the other mattert connected with Perjury are just as applicable at if within the strict form; therefore the state<lb/>ment, that a matter need not be material in order to support a charge of taking a false oath, cannot be supported upon principle. Again, it hat been urged that this is material, and on the ground that, however immaterial a thing may really be, yet if a person imagines it to be material, or uses it so as to produce any effect, in that case there is as much materiality at if the matter wat really</hi>

Philpott, it a strong authority in my favour, and from Lord Campbell's Judgment the distinctions between that case and the present it perfectly clear.</hi> (<hi rend="smallCaps">THE RECORDER</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">called attention to Reg. v. Gibbons</hi>). <hi rend="italic">I am not familiar with the details of that case, but at my friend has not quoted it, I may infer it it not in his favour. Supposing here that there was no father or mother, and he had sworn that he had the constent of the father, I apprehend that would be a matter wholly imma<lb/>terial, there being no such person in existenceâ€”here, he says, "I have the content of so and so, the father," then we must look to what legal power the father has; I contend that if the father had been present, and had given his consent, it would not have been a content within the meaning of the Act of Parliament, if the case I have quoted it correct: a guardian it bound to the appointed by the Court of Chancery, and he alone could give the consent required by the Act. It is clear that a legal connexion, and a legal position, must be referred to in the Act of Parliment, and it it for the purpose of maintaining those rights, and that position, that this number of restriction on put upon it; it does not anticipate the question of a father in relation to a bastard child, who hat no rights whatever in society, and has no claim upon the father, even to make him support it with its daily bread: if deserted by him, the could not by application to a Magistrate, or elsewhere, obtain any assistant from him within the Poor Law Act; the child, until the marriagt of the mother, follows the settlement of me mother, after that the has no rights, no position, no claim; if I am right in that, the father of such a child has neither right or claim upon her duty or obedience, and has no right whatever to expect that the should obtain his permittion to do any particular act.</hi>

COMMON SERJEANT</hi>). <hi rend="italic">I am generally exceeding unwilling to stop a case upon a point of law without taking the opinion of the Jury upon the facts, especially when there is an opportunity, as there now is of reserving it for the consideration of the Court of Appeal, but if I entertain a clear opinion, I think I am bound to take that course; I do so here; and I am confirmed in that opinion by the Common Serjeant; I think that in this case the charge that is made is not established; there might be some question raised upon the point, of whether the particular averment was or was not material, but here the particular form of the charge is, that the defendant intended to obtain the licence without the consent of the lawful and natural father of the said Eliza Ann England; now that is not this case, because it appears upon the evidence that there is no lawful and natural father, and the distinct averment here made is, that the said George England is the lawful and natural father, that seems to be the form of charge made throughout, and that charge does not, upon this evidence, appear to be established, it is, therefore my duty to say, that in point of law, there is no evidence to support the charge.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The witness, Henry Brown, has sworn to a falsehood; he says he took the shilling off the counter, and the woman says she had them in her hand and never let them out of her hand; they lay on the counter, and all the time we were talking about them I could have taken them up off the oounter and gone about my business if I had liked; not being guilty, I let them lay there. She does not say she saw me touch the shillings, and I never handled them. She never marked or weighed the money, or sounded it, or tried it in the detector. She does not say what sort of shillings they were, Victoria, or William, or George the Third; she does not know whether they were good or bad. She say, "I think they were two good ones." The shilling that dropped out of my pocket was my own, and if it had not been I should never have given it up, but they held out a promise to me that they would not press the charge against me if I would give it up; I gave it np willingly. If ever there was a man sent to this Court innocent, I am that man, and as for running I was too tipsy to run. I had gone half way down the street when the prosecutor left the shop. He came up to me; I shoved him off with my-right hand, I never ran at all. He says I took it off the counter. That is a falsehood, and if he will say that he will say anything. I have got a respectable hard-working wife. I gave correct address, and the policeman saw my home, a clean respectable looking home. I have a family. I have no occasion to do such things. If I had done what a cunning man would have done, I should have put the had shilling under the good one, and not the bad shilling at the top.</p>

I brought it to London, and took it to London-wall and got it engraved"â€”I asked him where it wasâ€”he said, "Oh, I have not got it; I sent him a proof from it on paper, addressed, 'Post Restante, Liverpool," at the same time he brought this plate from the cupboard, and said, "Here it is"â€”he pulled it from under some paper in the cupboardâ€”I asked him where the copper plate was that he had got as a patternâ€”he said he had sent that to the gen<lb/>tleman, who promised to call and see him, but he had never seen him sinceâ€”I then took him into custody, and took him to the stationâ€”this is the plate that he so producedâ€”I had previously gone to 12, Haberdasher-placeâ€”after leaving him at the station I went there again and searchedâ€”I have stated what I found thereâ€”that was on the Monday, about 10 o'clock in the morningâ€”there was Andrews, the landlord, there, and Brett, my brother officer, and Inspector Leonardâ€”I found a great quantity of engraving tools, which are here, some colouring matter for printing, and all these other things which are producedâ€”here is a galvanic battery, tools of all kinds, chemicals, gutts percha, and wax for taking impressionsâ€”they were found in the second-floor front room, on the table, and in different parts, in the drawers and boxesâ€”I also found this paper, cut into sizes, ready for printingâ€”I afterwards went to 6, Bevington-street, that is a place also occupied by Reichbergâ€”I there found a letter-press, and a very heavy press which I do not know the name of; they are hereâ€”they were in the cellar or kitchen undergroundâ€”on Monday, 13th, I went to 65, Lower Thames-street, where a person of the name of Sanskowski had an officeâ€”I there found a copying press, which is</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the travelling inspectors of the missing letter department attached to the Post-officeâ€”in consequence of instructions I received, I went to Belper, on 25th February, and made up a letter, in which I enclosed two half sovereigns and eighteen postage-stamps, each of which I marked with the word "Trent," and "T. J." my initialsâ€”I addressed the envelope in which I enclosed them, to F. Bury, veterinary surgeon, Esher, Surreyâ€”I posted it myself at the Belper post-office at half-past 9 that night: it would be in time to go by that night's postâ€”I then went into the post-office, and saw the postmaster take it from the receiving box, and I left him some instructions concerning itâ€”it would go to London that night, and the bag containing it would be opened in the travelling post-office on the Midland Railway in its passage up to Londonâ€”the prisoner was employed in the post-office tender that nightâ€”he was a sorter, and was also acting as assistant mail-guardâ€”I went from Derby to London by the same train, and arrived at the General Post-office about 5 o'clockâ€”I was there a little before the prisonerâ€”previous to his coming I had received some information, in consequence of which, when he came, I sent for him into the comptrollers-officeâ€”he came there to me, and Child, the Post-office constable also came inâ€”I said to the prisoner, "You were on duty in the Midland sorting carriage last night?"â€”he replied, "Yes;"â€”I said, "You sorted the London letters from Belper, I believe?"â€”he replied, "No; I did not"â€”I said, "I have been informed that you did"â€”he said, "Perhaps I did assist," or "help; it was Mr. Hill's duty"â€”I said, "Did you see anything of a letter directed to Mr. F. Bury, veterinary surgeon, Esher, Surrey?"â€”he replied, "No"â€”I said, "The truth is, circumstances have come to the knowledge of the authorities which have led to the suspicion that you have been taking letters for some time, and the letter I have spoken to you about, was purposely sent from Belper last night, with a view of testing that matter; the letter came into your hands that is now missing, will you let us see whether you have got it about you now, or any of its contents?"â€”he took various things of no importance from his pockets, and turned some of his pockets inside out: after he had done, I said to Child, "It will be more satisfactory if you examine the pockets now"â€”he did so, and took from one of the coat pockets eighteen postage-stamps, rolled up in a small compass, but still all attachedâ€”I said to the prisoner, "Where did you get these stamps?"â€”he replied, "I bought them in London, when I was going down into the country on Monday night; I intended writing to my sister, but have not done so"â€”there were no marks visible on the stamps, at that time, but soon afterwards I applied a liquid to some of them, and then recognized my own mark, "Trent, T. J." on each that I applied the liquid toâ€”I told the prisoner I could identify them as the stamps I had put into the letter I had been speaking to him aboutâ€”he still adhered to</p>

In February last, I was a sorter in the Midland district travelling tender to Londonâ€”the mail-train coming up at night does not stop at Belper, but there is an apparatus which holds the letter-bag, which the train touches as it goes by, causing the bag to fall into a netâ€”Mr. Jeffery, the travelling inspector, had made a communication to me about a letter which was comingâ€”on the night of 25th February, the prisoner brought me the sealed Belper bag into the travelling officeâ€”I broke the seal and opened itâ€”among the letters, I found two bundles, in one of which I saw the letter for Mr. Bury, veterinary surgeon, Esherâ€”I opened the bundles, and placed them before the prisoner to be sorted, with that letter among themâ€”it was placed among the letters for the London districtâ€”the prisoner ought to have placed it in the blind letter-box, but I looked there, after he had finished sorting, and could not find itâ€”I knew that it was a test-letterâ€”the Midland train stops At Rugby twenty minutes, and before we got there I tied up the letters out of the blind letter-box, and placed them in a bag with other letters to go to London to be sorted thereâ€”the London district letters are sorted in the trainâ€”the prisoner got out at Rugby, put all the bags on a truck, and brought them to the train to the post office carriageâ€”his post-office duties at Rugby occupied him about eight minutesâ€”on arriving at Euston-square station, the bags are conveyed from there in vans and post-office omnibussesâ€”the prisoner had charge of the Midland bags in the omnibus; there was only him in that omnibusâ€”I made a communication to Mr. Jeffrey's at Rugbyâ€”besides the prisoner and</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was there any injury of any serious character? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was the cut over the left ear, that was not more dangerous than scalp wounds generally are; it was only dangerous from the fear of erysipelas setting in; in itself the wound was not dangerousâ€”erysipelas is more liable to set in from scalp wounds than from others.</p>

I am one of the police constables attached to the General Post-office in St. Martin's-le-Grandâ€”in consequence of instructions, I was watching on 12th March, in such a position that I could see the passage which leads from the Inland Office to the District Officeâ€”it is a passage about five feet wideâ€”it runs direct under the hall where the public pass throughâ€”there are steps to go down at one end from the Inland Office and steps to go up to the District Office at the other endâ€”at one end of it there are folding doorsâ€”about half-past 6 that morning I saw the prisoner come from the Inland Officeâ€”I knew him previously by sightâ€”he was a sorter in the Post-officeâ€”he was coming from the Inland Office to the London District Office, through the tunnel, with four or five large letters in his right hand, with his left hand placed underneathâ€”whilst he was going through I observed him draw his left hand with a smaller letter, from under<lb/>neathâ€”it was a bluish-looking coloured envelopeâ€”he crumpled it up in his fist, and placed it in his left hand coat-pocketâ€”I believe he has on the same coat nowâ€”he went through into the London District Office, and I lost sight of him for about a minute; not through the folding-doors; he was through them when I saw himâ€”I followed him through afterwards, and met him returning from the Letter-carriers' Office towards the Inland Officeâ€”he had nothing in his hand thenâ€”I stopped him and took him into the Comp<lb/>troller's roomâ€”he was close against the door when I met himâ€”he there</p>

               <p>commenced putting his hands first into his waistcoat-pocket and then into his coat-pocketâ€”I told him to keep his hands out of his pockets, and sent for the inspector, Mr. Delanyâ€”I had no one with me at the moment but the prisonerâ€”a messenger came in with some letters for the President just at the moment, and I sent him for himâ€”upon Mr. Delany's arrival, I said to him, "I have reason to believe the prisoner has a letter in his pocket that does not belong to him"â€”the prisoner could hear thatâ€”Mr. Delany in reply said, "Have you, Cooke?"â€”the prisoner said, "No, sir; what I have is my pockets belongs to myself"â€”I then asked the prisoner if he had any objection to be searchedâ€”he said, "No"â€”I commenced searching him, and it his left-hand coat-pocket I found this cloth; at that time there was some bread and butter in it, and the letter, now produced, crumpled upâ€”it was the coat-pocket where I had previously seen him put his handâ€”the letter was crumpled up and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> down by the side of the cloth in the pocket, between the cloth and the side of the pocket, <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> down tightâ€”the letter was not in the state in which it would come from the Post-office; it was crumpled right up: the same as if a person were to take a piece of paper in their hand and crumple it upâ€”it is addressed, "Messrs. F. L. Carver &amp; Co. 57, Skinner Street, London, E.C."â€”it was opened before the Magistrate, and contained a half-sovereign in a card, nine penny postage-stamps, and an order for a new hatâ€”the card was crumpled upâ€”it was smoothed out when it was openedâ€”the envelope bears the London postage-stamp of the morning of the 12th, and the stamp of St. Columb, Cornwall, of the llthâ€”after I had done searching the prisoner I said to him,"Is this your letter, Cooke?"â€”he said, "No; if that came out of my pocket, some one must have put it then; I know nothing about it"â€”I then asked where he livedâ€”he said at 55, Gopsall-street, Hoxtonâ€”I asked what part of the house he occupiedâ€”he said the two parlours and back kitchenâ€”I went there and found a quantity of Money in two cash-boxes, amounting altogether to 312<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and some promissory notesâ€”the prisoner subsequently told me that he had brought it home from Australia, and he was going to purchase a house in Pakington-street, Islington; I think he said for 430<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.â€”he said he was endeavouring to raise the money to pay that sumâ€”as I was about taking the prisoner from the Comptroller's room to another room of our own, he said, "This is a piece of villany on the part of some one; I will swear before all the judges in London, if it was necessary, that I never saw that letter before"â€”I said, "It is no use you talking in that way to me, Cooke; it is not the first letter you have put in your pocket, and that I know with my own knowledge"â€”the prisoner replied, "Oh no, sir, you are wrong"â€”he was then taken into custodyâ€”directly I commenced searching him Mr. Powley, the president of the London District Office, came inâ€”I found a pocket-book in the prisoner's pocket, containing some memorandums; there was no other paper in that pocketâ€”Rumbold, a brother officer, was with me when I was watching the prisonerâ€”he was with me at the place where I first saw the prisoner in the passage.</p>

               <p>the prisoner and Smee thereâ€”I did not see the letter taken from the prisoner's pocketâ€”Smee said in his presence, "I have reason to believe, sir, that this man has a letter in his possession which does not belong to him"â€”I said, "Is that so, Cooke"â€”he said, "No, sir"â€”a letter carrier should not take letters from one part of the office to the other without he has orders from his superior officer, the superintending sorterâ€”there are collectors regularly employed, who clear away the letters when they are subdividedâ€”a portion is taken to the letter carriers' office, which is the London district office, and there the letters are made up for delivery.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Langham's Defence.</hi> I was at home in bed by 11 o'clock on the night of the robbery. They did not go and see whether I gave a right address, and whether I was at home in bed at the time I state. The prosescutor states that Sheehan was the man who had hold of him. I appeal to anybody in this Court whether the prosecutor could state, on his oath, if he saw a man with whiskers on that night, in a dark suit of clothes; and saw him again eight days afterwards without whiskers, and dressed differently; that he was the same man. He says he can speak to Sheehan better than to me. I saw the constable Gordon on Sunday night, afterwards: I was the man who spoke to him when he came in. I know every word he said to the landlady. I remained there that night until 12 o'clock. I saw him on the 27th, standing in plain clothes, in Seven Dials, and passed him within three yards. It is evident, if I was the man he intended to capture for this robbery, he would have taken me then. I was not the person. It is because, perhaps, I bear rather an indifferent character, I am selected as the victim of this case. I think Mrs. Donovan is here to prove that I was in bed.</p>

The prosecutor shoved the lady by the arm, and I said, 'You should not shove the lady.' I knocked him about with a stick; he went back and then approached again, and wanted to have some words with us. We told him it would be better for him to retire; I said, 'I do not intend to fight here, but come to my house and I will fight.' He then pushed me on the cheek with such violence that I fell. I had a German wooden pipe in my hand, and struck him with it; I cannot tell how, as I had drunk well. I cannot say what further occurred till I was taken into custody.

Secondly, that at the time of the marriage he was a minor, and did not openly live with his wife, but cohabited with her at Billingsgate, and that she had no issue. Thirdly, that about January, 1839, his wife left the house at Billingsgate, where she had been living as a domestic servant, without communicating with him, and that he was unable to discover her residence. Fourthly, that in consequence of her absconding he went abroad in April, 1840, and did not return till 1841. Fifthly, that on his return about November, 1841, he discovered that his wife was living in adultery with Robert Kemp Foxall. Sixthly, that she had since that continued to live with Foxall, and had had several illegitimate children by him. Seventhly, that no collusion existed between the defendant and his wife.

White a guinea for the silver pepper castors and the milk jug, and I then took him to Bow-stationâ€”I took possession of other articles in the houseâ€”Sarah Shank was at the station, and on my producing the articles she said, in the prisoner's presence, that they were her master's, taken from the house on the night of 10th Decemberâ€”I did not hear him make any reply to thatâ€”on 8th March, Mary Ann Abrahams and Charles Abrahams were each in a separate cell connected with the charge roomâ€”I went to visit the female prisoner's cell at 9 o'clock, and she said, "Can I speak to you, Sir, in the presence of my son?"â€”I said, "Certainly"â€”I unlocked the door of Charles Abrahams' cell, and brought him to the door of his mother's cell, she took him by the hands, cried, and kissed him, and said, "Charley, let us tell all about it and make a clean breast of it"â€”I brought them into the charge room and sat downâ€”I said, "Mrs. Abrahams, before you make any statement to me it is my duty to caution you; do not tell me anything to criminate yourself, but whatever you tell me will be taken down in writing, and used in evidence against you"â€”she then repeated the following statement, which I took down in writing, "When first <hi rend="italic">Fred,</hi> White came to me, he brought me eleven pieces of cloth, which he stated he found when coming from work; I sent four pieces of the cloth to my sister Mrs. Taylor, Pearley-cottage, Brighton-road, Croydon; then he brought me what my son has given you last night (<hi rend="italic">meaning these articles;</hi>) then he brought me the coat, which I gave up to you last night, and told me he bought it in Petticoat-lane for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; three pieces of cloth I sent to Mrs. Franklin, at Islington, to sell for me"â€”the prisoner Charles then immediately said, "And four pieces I had; "he continued: "Now I will tell you, Sir; you asked me last night if I had not got an Inverness cape and a pair of boots; well, I had; it was got out of pawn by <hi rend="italic">Fred.</hi> White himself; the amount was 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the ticket; I disposed of them both, but I can get them back again; I know where there are two pieces of the cloth, one my wife has and one Miss Mitford has; the cape is at Mr. Starkey's, at St Mary-at-Hill; the boots our second mate had on board the <hi rend="italic">Earl of Auck<lb/>land"</hi>â€”that is allâ€”on the morning of the 8th, at Stepney station, he made a further statement to meâ€”on 11th March, while at the Court and passing the cell, White said, "Officer, can I speak to you?"â€”I said, "What do you want?"â€”he said, "Just tell my sisters I want to speak to them"â€”his sisters came to the cell door and handed him some tea or coffee, and bread-and-bntterâ€”he said, "Officer, I stole all them coats, all them pieces of cloth and table cloths, and them silver things; Mrs. Abrahams told me to steal all that I could, and bring them to her to dispose of them"â€”she was not there.</p>

I am foreman to Mr. Joseph Harris, a pawnbroker, in High-street, Deptfordâ€”on Saturday, 8th March, about half-past 11, I was behind the counter in the front part of the shopâ€”I heard a crash of glass, and saw a hand and a stick going from the windowâ€”I immediately ran out, and laid hold of the prisonerâ€”his hand was bleedingâ€”he said, "I beg your pardon, I was drunk," or "had been drinking, and in falling broke the glass"â€”I found at his feet one gold chain, and two others, which I threw back into the window through the broken pane of glassâ€”I took the prisoner into the shop, and sent for a constableâ€”he took him away, and when I had got about six yards, from what I heard, I went and asked the constable to bring him back, that he might be searched, in case he should pass anythingâ€”he was searched in my presenceâ€”the policeman put his hand into his left-hand pocket, and I put my hand into his right-hand pocket; and took out a gold watch, and this ticketâ€”it is part of my master's propertyâ€”the prisoner afterwards assumed to be drunk; but he was not at the time.</p>

               <p>of that I went to Horsemonger-lane Gaol and saw themâ€”I saw Bassett first; Stokes was in a separate cellâ€”I put down the same evening, as near as I could remember, what passed between asâ€”these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the notes I madeâ€”I asked him what he sent for me forâ€”he began by say<lb/>ing, "I have been eleven years on the premises and never had anything found against me"â€”I asked him if he had nothing else to sayâ€”he said he had only been concerned in the two lots discovered, and that a short time ago a man came to the works and induced him to send some goods to Mr. Learyâ€”he did not know whether he or Stokes first accepted the proposal, but Stokes could tell us more about it; it was a long time for a man to remem<lb/>berâ€”the money for the goods sent to Mr. Leary was received by the strange man, whose name he did not knowâ€”he either said "We" or "I"â€”I believe he said, "I never received any of the money, nor saw the man again;" that the goods last taken away had been sent to Mr. Vane's and another man's; "but I know of nothing else except 5 cwt. of twine; that is everything that has ever gone out by night; but as to anything being sent off by day, I could not say, as I am always in the rope ground, and could not tell what went in or out"â€”I said I knew what he was saying was incorrect; that we held the receipt for the moneyâ€”he then said, "It is a mistake; I mean the last lot and not the first, that I did not receive the money for"â€”I told him it was no good wasting my time in telling me what was incorrectâ€”he said he told me the truth and nothing but the truth, and all that he knewâ€”I said he had no business telling lies and making statements he could not prove; that was all with himâ€”then I went to Stokes' cellâ€”he said, "I have never been concerned in taking away any goods: on the evening of the 18th, I was out with my wife till half-past 9; when I came home I found that all was not right, and in the morning I found the rope house all in a scurry;" that was the expression, I believe, meaning confusion; "and missed some of the goods, I then spoke to Bassett about it, and about three or four hours afterwards he said, "I sent the goods away"â€”Stokes said he did not say anything about it, because he wished to save Bassett from trouble; that was the only time such a thing occurred; everything that went out he had enteredâ€”he said he had put a great quantity of money into the Company's pocketâ€”I asked him who authorized him to do so.</p>

               <p>have you got to say?"â€”I have no recollection of your asking me to be as merciful as I could on account of your confinementâ€”your words were that you would make a clean breast of it, and did not care who it would implicate so long as you found out who it wasâ€”I did not tell you I would get you your liberty if you would make a clean breast of it, or anything like itâ€”when I found you were not speaking the truth I went awayâ€”I believe you said, "I know of nothing else except a lot of twine," or "5 cwt of twine."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Stokes. Q.</hi> When I told you a great deal of money had been put into the Company's pocket by false weights, did not I tell you it was you gave me orders to put 10 per cent on all goods that went aboard ship? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I did notâ€”(<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition being read, stated,</hi> "I never told Stokes to put on false weights; I admit he told me of it, and I reported it. I do not recollect saying anything about 10 per cent")</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean you had heard he had put on false weights before this happened, or that he told you of it in the gaol? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not in the goal; he had told me of it before any of this happenedâ€”some goods were being weighed at the time, and he told me he was in the habit of occasionally, in shipping orders, making the weight a little more than it actually was, and I reported it upon a lot that was then weighed; nothing further came of itâ€”I did not say one day, when Stokes was weighing a lot at the scales, "I think, Stokes, you had better put some weights on those, for I do not think they weigh those at the Arsenal"â€”I did not say anything of that sort.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Stokes.</hi> If I never live another moment, you said so; you told me all throughout to do it; did not you put four cwt. on two tons of goods that went to Barking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can produce the receipts; Mr. Hewitt weighed them; I sent the weights perfectly correct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Stokes.</hi> He put four cwt. on two tons, and said, "Weigh every coil separate, and make a mistake in the addition, so that if it should be found out I can copy off every weight, and send it down and say it was a mistake in the adding up." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> The weights were all correct that I sent to Mr. Hewitt; I will admit there was a mistake in the adding upâ€”I was aware when the bill went in that it was not correctly added upâ€”some of the coils came back; that did not lead to the bill being set rightâ€”I sent down the weight of each coil separatelyâ€”I can show it on my lettersâ€”I gave the weight at the officeâ€”I did not send the original bill; but I wrote a note to Mr. Hewittâ€”there were about 18 lbs, over in one, and 18 lbs. under in another, so that it came equivalent, and a little in his favourâ€”I put down the weights correctly, but did not add it up right, and then that bill went to the officeâ€”(<hi rend="italic">The witness was twice asked the question by the Court, whether he added the bill up wrong intentionally, but gave no answer.</hi>)â€”Stokes first of all told me that he thought it would be practicable, and I mentioned it at the office, for I had only recently come up to Londonâ€”I did not know what were the rules of the tradeâ€”I was only a clerkâ€”I will admit that I did so to that lot; but I reported it the same as I did a previous lot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Stokes.</hi> When he found I would not put weights on, he actually told me to make no notes, and he told a lad also the same. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I told him to put no weights on any ship's notesâ€”it is not a usual thingâ€”it is never done in any other house in the tradeâ€”when these goods were taken away there was nothing like ten or twelve tons of rope sent away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Bassett. Q.</hi> How can you tell that the two coils found at Kemp<lb/>ster's were the property of the London Ropery Company? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I recognise them as being spun at Whitbyâ€”I saw the remainder of the spun yarn of which that was partâ€”I said at the time it was spun yarn, and at</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186204070144"/>
               <p>the police-station they said it was a species of rope, and I said, "Yes, it is"â€”spun yarn is the yarn of rope not twisted; it is always sold with rope; it is the same price, and they are sold togetherâ€”I recognised it imme<lb/>diately.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had you been with the Ropery Company? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Five months.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ORRIDGE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I understand you called Mr. Hewitt's, the customer's, attention to the weights? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he sent me an account, saying he kept so many coils, and I sent him an account of the weights of those coils; which he kept, giving him the weight of each size by itselfâ€”I had taken those weights as the coils left the yardâ€”I sent him my account, and when I went down there he said, "This weight is not correct, there is 18 lbs. deficient; but on the other lot you sent there is 18 lbs. too much"â€”it was equivalent, except that the things which I charged 18 lbs. under were more expensive than those on which I charged 18 lbs. over.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that wrong addition which anybody who added up the account could find out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had seen Mr. Hewitt before, and had actually told him, speaking of the rope-making trade, that it was the practice to do so, and in February we had a conversation about it, and I leave it to you to think whether it was probable he was going to be taken in in that way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Bassett's Defence.</hi> The first lot before Christmas, belonged to a man named Wood, and never came from the Ropery Company. We were ordered to sell for him if we possibly could. The parties were entire strangers to us; we sold the rope and had the money returned to us, and we gave it to Mr. Wood. There is no proof that that rope came from the Ropery Company; it never did come from them. The rope was in Kempster's place before we knew anything at all about it; I went there to look at it, and said I would see if I could get a customer for it, and I and Stokes went down to Mr. Leary's and bargained with him, and sold it to him and returned the money to this Mr. Wood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Stokes' Defence.</hi> One day before Christmas, a stout short man, came with rather a seafaring man to the gate, and asked if Mr. Morgan would buy any rope. I said, "I do not know; trade is very slack; I don't think he will;" he said, "If he will, we have got a lot we will sell cheap;" I said, "I am almost sure he won't buy it." I promised to ask him; that was in the afternoon. In the evening after dark he came again, knocked at the door of our house, and said, "I know a party that will buy that rope; they know me very well, but I don't understand representing in the matter of rope, like you; there is a Frank Leary down town; he don't buy it himself, but his partner Vare will advance money to any extent; we want 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the lot; it is a lot all put together." I said, "I don't know anything about it;" he said, "If you, will come with us, we will pay you for the trouble; you represent yourself as the seller of it." I said I did not mind, and they took me to Mr. Vare's, and he took us to Mr. Leary. Evans did not go there with us; I dont know why. Leary appointed to meet Bassett next day. I declare that I never saw the rope; a lad drove the van and met me going down; a gentlemen called for me after breakfast and told me to go down and get the money at the public-house this side of the Surrey Canal bridge. (<hi rend="italic">Stokes here asked the witness Ward if he remembered meeting him there, and Ward replied, "Yes, I think it was you".</hi>) I met Leary and Bassett, and they took me into a public-house; 46<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was what they agreed to take. Bassett not being able to write, Leary told me to write a receipt; I said I did not understand doing so, and he told me the words and I wrote them;</p>

               <p>that is all I know about it: and as for knowing about anything going off the premises, I assure you I did not. Last Christmas I captured two lads that had been robbing the premises, and the officer Hughes knows that I was out till 12 o'clock at night after the other one, and captured him the next day at Greenwich.</p>
