I put it in my pocket and gave her the change. As to the other bar<lb/>maid, I never had anything of her at all; she said first that it was a Victoria half-crown, and now she says that it was not. A man that passes bad money would not be so foolish as to go in with a lot of bad half-crowns. Being vexed at finding she had another bad one in the till she says that I gave it to her, not wishing her master and mistress to know it. There were plenty of people in the house, and it is very hard to put it upon me.</p>

C. district, and Billett was making up the E. C. bag—there was a box for mis-sorts on the right side of each—it was the prisoner's duty to put it into the box, but they do not always do that, they merely pass it over—I was present when Mr. Gardner questioned the prisoner in the postmaster's room, and heard him asked whether he had a coat—I went down and fetched it—I found it on the third peg in the kitchen, where the prisoner told me, and took it up stairs, handed it to the officer, and saw the pockets emptied and a bundle of stamps found.</p>

C. district he would go to fetch some newspapers—he would not pass the General sorting table only at its very extreme end—he does not stand a yard from it—he could fling a letter there, but it was against his duty to do anything but put it in the mis-sort box, although the man was standing next who ought to have received it—mis-sorted letters on the General sorting table are restamped for the next hour—they are in the legal custody of the senior stamper, but he does not wait there all the time—there is nobody there to look after them.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "I saw Crawley fighting with Quill—there was a crowd there—neither Marr, Donovan, nor I struck complainant—I must have seen them if they had done so.") Dennis Crawley was the complainant in that summons—on the same day the summons against James Ives was also taken—Webster was sworn as a witness on his behalf—he said "I swear Ives never spoke to Crawley, nor did any of the three strike him; I must have seen it if it had occurred"—the Magistrate cautioned the witness, and then he said: "I swear positively that neither Donovan, Ives, nor Marr struck Crawley; if either of them had done so I must have seen it"</p>

                  </hi>. I am a signalman on the District Railway—on 11th April, about 8.30 in the morning, I was on duty in my signal box, and saw the prisoner handling a pair of points for about five or six minutes, on the West London Extension Railway—he was about fifty yards from me—I saw him stoop and pick up something close by the points where he was standing and working the handle—I saw him put it between the points, I could not tell what it was until I went to it afterwards—he then left those points and went in the direction of another pair of points on the West London Railway—I could not see what he did there on account of some trucks of coal standing in the way—I then saw him go over a fence six feet high—I called the attention of Lansdale, one of the plate layers—I got out of my box, and went to the first pair of points, and saw the clinker there—I and Lansdale followed the prisoner over the fence into the road—Lansdale caught hold of him and said "If there was a policeman here I would give you in charge"—the prisoner said nothing to that—Lansdale told him that we had taken the clinker out of the points—he said he had only kicked his foot against it—there was a conversation with the prisoner and Lansdale—the prisoner was not then taken into custody—I believe he lived near there at a public-house—this is the clinker I took out (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I could not take it out without pushing the handle over; it was placed between the rails; the points were about two inches off from the metal on each side—that kept the points half-way open—after we came back, Lansdale and I went to the other pair of points, and there found this piece of brick in</p>

               <p>Between the points, which were also partially open—I have been on the railway there just on twelve months, and am familiar with the working of it; if a train had come by while these things were there, it would have been thrown off the rail—the line is sometimes used for passenger traffic, but mainly for goods; there are many trains in the course of an hour—one came up three minutes after we came back over the fence, we stopped it—it would not have been stopped unless I had known of the things being there—if the train had passed on without being stopped, it would have been thrown off the line at the points where the brick was—the points where the clinker was is not a point for trains—they are running about there shunting all day long—trains frequently pass over there.</p>

                  </hi>.—I am a constable in the service of the London and St. Katherine Dock Company—on Saturday, 22nd April, about 20 minutes before 12, in consequence of something that came to my knowledge, I was watching in the C jetty tobacco warehouse—I was behind a partition—I made a small hole through the partition, so that I could see between the tubs—Ashmore worked up stairs—Summers had charge of the tobacco department on the ground floor of the C warehouse—as I was looking through the hole I saw Summers go to a bag of tobacco—Ashmore was present—they both took the bag together and put it on the floor—Ashmore sat down, unbuttoned his waistcoat, and put this tobacco (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the waistband of his trowsers—Summers stood looking at him—they both took down the bag—it was betwixt some tubs on some more bags—I went round from behind the partition and came into the tobacco warehouse, went up to Ashmore, and asked him what he had got there, touching him on the breast—he said "Only a little piece of tobacco for a smoke"—Summers was still in the warehouse, about three yards from Ashmore, but he turned his back to me when I spoke to Ashmore—I took the tobacco from Ashmore's waist<lb/>band, took him to the Victoria Dock Police Station, and then went back to</p>

               <p>Summers—I asked Summers if he knew anything about this tobacco—he said he knew nothing at all about it—I took him also to the station, and charged them both—the tobacco weighs 1 1b. 6 oz.—I was eight yards from them when I saw this—I have known Summers seven years, as long as I have been in the employ—there was no one but the prisoners in the C warehouse at the time except the Custom House officer, who was against the door in his office.</p>

Hill &amp; Sanderson, on Sunday morning—it was on Saturday that I unloaded—I don't know the day of the month—I received the receipt from the mate at 11 o'clock on Saturday night—although the receipt is for 340 casks, I do not myself know how many were actually delivered, because I had to leave to come to the foreman to get a receipt, as I had none.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. I was first asked to give evidence in this case somewhere about December, I think—I am not positive about the first time I was required to give evidence, I was questioned about the casks in November, when I returned—when I got this answer from Mr. Hill, I went to the office and explained it to them—I was first examined as a witness at the Mansion House, some time last month, I think about the 6th—at the time I signed for the 340 casks the barge was quite empty, that I am sure of; there was nothing left in the barge—I struck out "364" in the receipt and wrote "340" in words as well as in figures—this "340 casks of soda, J. Spurring," is my writing, that was written at the time they were taken in—I believe these crosses across these two figures were there as they are now, but I don't know for certain—I don't believe I struck them out myself—I looked to the second mate or the quartermaster to tell me what the proper tally was; there are both abroad—it is the ordinary course at the water-side if there are any in dispute to sign the receipt, and say so many in dispute—I did not do that, because the lighterman was so positive—he had taken them out of the ship and tallied them into the barge himself, and I had not time to count them over—I wished to sign in that way—I told the lighterman I would sign for them in dispute—but he would not have it that way, he was so positive they were in the ship—a mate does not always do what the lighterman wishes, certainly, but in this case it was on account of his being so positive—in the hurry of shipment we are often obliged to trust to others—I don't know whether the dispute I had was with either of the lightermen who have been examined to-day—I could not recognise the man again if I saw him—I have seen the two Slacks, but I could not tell which presented me with the note; I will not swear it was either—I saw the marks at New York—the deficiency was in the "A K," I don't believe it was in the "B T;" it was in the "A K;" I would not swear to it; I am almost positive it was in the "A K," the others all turned out right; it was the "A K" that was sixteen short; it was not in the "BT;" I am certain positive it was not; I would not swear it, but I know very well it was not in the "B T"—I don't know anybody of the name of Cock—besides the sixteen casks there was no other part of my cargo short, that I am aware of, which ought to have gone by me, and which went by the <hi rend="italic">Stetson</hi>—I am not aware that 175 that ought to have gone by me went by the <hi rend="italic">Stetson</hi>—the only things short of delivery were the sixteen—I have no idea that any part of the cargo that ought to have gone by me went by the <hi rend="italic">Stetson</hi> instead—I am not aware that there is anyone here who can tell you—when Mr. Hill showed me the book at his office he did not ask me what the marks were, nor did I tell him that I did not know—I told him there were sixteen short; I did not refer to marks, neither did he—he did not tell me to go to my broker's and find out the marks—I will distinctly pledge my oath that nothing of the sort passed between us—I was told the marks at the time of the discharge at New York, "A K"—I had no note when I was at Mr. Hill's, of what the marks were, only my memory—I won't swear that I did mention the marks, and I won't swear that I did not—I do not remember any reference being made to my broker—there was no reference whatever made to the broker—only Mr. Hill and myself were present, there was no one else in the office—the conversation did not last more than five minutes, five to seven minutes perhaps—I did not notice the time—it was in the afternoon, after 12 o'clock, I think; it may have been before 12 o'clock, I can't say—there were</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187205060039"/>
               <p>no clerks there—Mr. Hill was alone, and as soon as I came up he came in, and then I stated the nature of my visit—no one was present but myself; he shewed me the book; I have already said I have no recollection whether that last line was there at the time or not; I would not swear it was not there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The last line is written very much smaller than the rest, and in a different hand apparently—the number in dispute between me and the lighterman was sixteen, and sixteen was deficient at New York—I say they were sixteen "A K's."</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Smith, Sandihurst &amp; Co., ship<lb/>brokers, 33, Gracechurch Street—they were brokers for Messrs. Malcolmson to the <hi rend="italic">Parana</hi>—on 18th September last, I saw the mate's receipt (marked "A") for 340 casks of soda—I have a copy of the marks from the bill of lading—in consequence of something that came to my knowledge on 10th November, I went to the defendant's office in Mincing Lane—I there saw Mr. Sanderson—I said we had received advice from New York that a cer<lb/>tain number of casks had been short delivered—I had the letter with me that stated the number of casks, and I read from the letter that there was a certain number of casks short at New York by the <hi rend="italic">Parana</hi>—I said that we had not been able to discover what had become of those casks, and as I believed they were the lightermen I should feel obliged if they would give me information about them—he referred to a book, and I went into the inside office, and he said all he could tell me was that they gave a clean receipt to the Newcastle steamer (that is, they had given a receipt for a certain number of casks, and that they were in good order), and they had received a clean receipt from the <hi rend="italic">Parana</hi>—that was all he could tell me about it—I said it was rather an unfortunate thing for the mate; as we had not been able to trace anything about it, he would have to pay for them—that was all that passed—the <hi rend="italic">Parana</hi> returned to England some little time afterwards, and I wrote to the mate to go and see Hill &amp; Sanderson's—I heard nothing more about the matter until January this year—on 26th January a man named Hall called at our office and gave me certain information, in consequence of which I saw Mr. Robinson, the agent for the owners of the <hi rend="italic">Parana</hi>—I went to South Devon wharf, and afterwards to Mr. Bumstead's office—on 30th January I received this memorandum from the defendants. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Memorandum, 30th January, 1872, from Hill &amp; Sanderson, licensed lightermen, to Messrs.

H &amp; S.") On the same day that I received that memorandum I called at the defendants' office and saw them both—I had this memorandum in my hand—I said that I had called about that memorandum that they had sent us that day, and I asked them if they could tell me how the error had occurred—I can't say which of them spoke—I rather think I commenced the conversation with Mr. Sanderson—I think he replied to the first ques<lb/>tion—he said that they were shipping other sodas at the time, the barges that contained the soda going to the <hi rend="italic">Parana</hi> had likewise sodas that were going to the <hi rend="italic">J. E. Stetson</hi>—I asked where the <hi rend="italic">J. E.

Malcolmson are not here, to my knowledge—F. W.

                  </hi>. I live at 103, Cumberland Street—the prisoner is my brother—he carries <hi rend="italic">on</hi> business there as a machine-sewer for the boot and shoe trade, sewing the soles into the uppers by a machine—Starkie, the deceased, was in the habit of bringing work for me and the men to sew, and at that time he came from Bamberger's, a manufactory in Great Cam<lb/>bridge Street—he has not been coming very long, perhaps twelve months</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187205060049"/>
               <p>—on Tuesday, 2nd April, when the two workmen were at tea in the work men's room behind the parlour, Starkie came—5 o'clock is the usual tea hour—there are folding doors between the parlour and the workmen's room, but they are always kept locked—the parlour is the room where my brother used to sleep, and to make out bills—he was there that afternoon, making out bills, and I called him to his tea as Starkie came in—Starkie brought two pairs of boots, and said "I want these sewn"—my brother told him he could not sew them until they had had their tea—he said he would wait, he would not go without them—my brother said that there was work to be sewn that was brought there before he came—my brother then came into the kitchen, where I had got the tea ready for him—he sat down to tea, but he did not finish it; I do not think he had any; he Said "I will finish the bills you called me from"—Starkie followed him to the parlour door, calling him vile names—he said he was a thief, and he did not like him—he said "James, yon b—shit, I will try and do you all the harm I can; I will try and take Bamberger's work away from you; and he called him a b—villain, and lots more that I could not hear exactly; and the prisoner kept telling him to go—he said I shan't; I won't" and then I heard the parlour door close; the door out of the parlour into the passage, as if my brother was trying to shut him out—then there was a report of fire-arms, and I saw the deceased leaning in the parlour door, where my brother was, like this, as if he was putting his head round and taunting him, with his back towards the street—the door was open then, but I did not see it opened—I could not see it where I was, but it must have been open, because he was putting his head in at the doorway—he was loaning in the doorway when I heard the shots—I heard three shots, but I missed him from the doorway previous to the third shot—the whole thing did not take very long; it might have taken ten minutes from the beginning, when I saw him at the parlour door to the time the shots were fired—I do not mean the whole occurrence; of course it took some time to quarrel—I may be mistaken; I said ten minutes between each shot, but it was not so, it was almost momentary; it was very quickly; I was very excited, the man frightened me by using abusive language—it was about two minutes from the first to the second shot, not any longer, and the third followed very quickly—I heard a scuffle before the third shot—I did not see the man leaning against the doorway when the third shot was fired; I lost sight of him, and I heard him say "Take that, you b—shit"—after the third shot, I saw him fall at the parlour doorway, with his head outside the street doorway, and his body partly in the passage—the street door if very near the parlour, and it was open—the doctors and the police then came in—my brother kept a revolver down in that room; it was under his pillow at night, and on the table or sideboard during the day—I cannot say whether it was loaded.</p>

               <p>him—Starkie refused to leave; my brother asked him to leave before he went into the kitchen to me—he asked him I think more than once, and Starkie said "I shan't"—my brother said "Don't make a noise; let the men have their tea in peace; how would you like to be disturbed while you were having your tea?"—he spoke very quietly, and Starkie said "Don't be so d—d independent about it, you will lose it soon enough; I will get it from you, if I can; I will ruin you"—that was before my brother came into the kitchen—he then came into the kitchen, leaving Starkie there, be<lb/>cause he wanted him to go; but before he left the men's room, I heard him once more ask the man to go—as my brother left the men's room, Starkie seemed to follow him, taunting him about his independence—he did not come on as far as the kitchen; he stood there, and my brother came on into the kitchen, and left him—I said that, if I were he I would not go into the room while that man was there; and he said that he would go into the parlour and finish the bill he was making out—Starkie had gone back to the work-room—I said that from what I saw of Starkie he seemed to be so frightfully excited, as if he was mad—as my brother left the kitchen I heard loud talking, and saw the man follow him up as he went towards the parlour—I can't say whether my brother went into the work-room from the passage, because the parlour doorway is inside, but the work<lb/>shop is not—I know he went towards the parlour—he would have to pass Starkie on his way if he was standing in the doorway, because he would have to pass the workshop to get to the parlour—my brother went quietly towards the parlour, without saying anything or looking behind him—I saw him go into the parlour, and heard him close the door, and so far as my brother was concerned, the matter between him and the deceased was at an end—that was what he wanted—I then heard the words I repeated before—the deceased was leaning in the parlour doorway after that, as if he was putting his head in and taunting him—I did not see the door open, but I saw him there as if he had opened it; he was in a stooping position, taunt<lb/>ing him—my brother keeps his money up stairs in the day time, but he always kept his pistol down stairs in that room—as my brother passed on towards the parlour, Starkie called him a b—thief, and a b—rogue, and a b—swine—my brother took no notice, but walked into the par<lb/>lour, and I heard the door shut—the next thing I saw was Starkie leaning in—he opened the door twice—I heard it shut quick and then opened a second time, and then I saw him leaning—I heard him call him a b—villain, and say that he would do him all the harm he could—I heard him say "Put me out," but what else he said I can't say—I heard my brother tell him to go—after the first shot was fired Starkie laughed loud, and said "Blank cartridge"—I think he said it twice—I then lost sight of him—I then heard a scuffle; it seemed to be in the parlour, as if he rushed in—I then heard the expression "Take that, you b—shit," and then the third shot was fired—I can't say whether it went off by accident or other<lb/>wise.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 22, Sewardstone Road, Victoria Park, and was a workman for the prisoner—on Tuesday evening, 2nd April, About 5 o'clock, I and my fellow-workman, Hannibal, were at tea, in what we call work<lb/>men's room—Starkie, who I had only seen once or twice before, came into the room about 5.15—he had two pairs of boots with him that he wanted sewn—he said "Oh, you are at tea, I will wait"—the prisoner followed him into the room, and said "I would rather you would come again when the men have done tea hour; would you like to be annoyed during your tea?"—Mr. James then left the room and returned in two or three minutes, and said "Why don't you go?" and put the two pairs of boots on starkie's arm, saying "I neither want you or your work"—Starkie said "James, you know I don't like you; I have tried to do you all the harm I could; I will try to take Bamberger's work away from you, but I can't, because he won't have them done anywhere else"—Starkie then walked towards the work-room door, and James followed him, and then loud language was used in the passage just outside the work-room door—he said "James, you are a b—rogue, and a b—shit, and a b—swine"—I cannot tell you where they were standing, as I was sitting down at tea, and we remained seated all the time; we did not rouse ourselves—I heard Mr. James walk up the passage, but I did not see him; I thought it was Mr. James—he appeared to go to the street door, but it appears it was to the parlour, and he said "Will you go out of my house?" he said that three times over, and then I heard a report directly after that—the next thing I heard was a clapping of hands, and then the deceased said "You b—fool, they are blank cartridge"—a second report followed very quick after the first—I then rose up to go to the door, and heard a slight scuffle in the passage <hi rend="italic">again</hi> the door—I had just got the handle of the tea-room door in my hand and got into the passage when a third shot was fired—the tea-room door was partly closed, I suppose Mr. James half closed it as he walked out—I got into the passage as the body fell half outside the next door and half in the passage—I ran and got the police—when they came the body was not as I left it—I did not go for two or three minutes.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was dated 28th December, 1869, from the defendant to Mr. Clifton, forwarding a plan of a proposed wharfage to be made by him at the Bow Bridge Saw Mills, explaining its nature, and requesting that the necessary application be made to the Commissioners to enable him to carry it out.</hi>) That application was made to the Commissioners—I am referring to the minute-book of the Commis<lb/>sioners—it is not written by me—it is merely to refresh my memory—I can speak without it—the application was made at the next Court, on 22nd April, 1870—it is mentioned in this book—the Court made an order on that application, which is contained in this order-book. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "That Joseph Willmott forthwith remove the brick wall from, and reinstate the common sewer, and forthwith remove the piling from the river wall, the same having been placed there without the knowledge or consent of the Court of Sewers; and that he also make a proper thoroughfare for the Marsh bailiff and his assistants.") I believe notice was given to the defen<lb/>dant of that order—the facts were again brought before the Commissioners on 28th October—this is the entry: "That Joseph Willmott remove the timber and other impediments on the river wall, and make proper thoroughfare for the Marsh bailiff and his assistants"—There is a further order in the following April—the Courts are generally held half-yearly—there is a report in the minute-book of 3rd March, 1871: "Major Seward and Mr. G. L. Howard having made their report and presented a trespass on the river wall and common sewer, it was proposed by Mr. Howard, seconded by Rev. A. Hill, That instructions be given to Carter, the Marsh bailiff, to remove the obstruction, the work to be carried out under the supervision of the Commissioners' surveyor; 'whereupon the above propo<lb/>sition was put to the meeting and carried unanimously"—then the order of 21st April, 1871, is: "That Joseph Willmott remove the obstructions from</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Upon reference to the minute-book, it appeared that on 27th February, 1870, no business was transacted, there being no quorum; and on 11th April the defendant appeared personally, pursuant to a summons against him for committing a trespass on the Millmeads Common Sewer, when Mr. Benton applied on his behalf for permission to erect a wharf, etc., on the river wall; but as it appeared that he had already commenced the work, the application was ordered to stand over till the next Commission, Mr. Benton, in the meantime, undertaking that nothing further should be done. On 22nd April, 1870, "it was resolved to grant permission for the work to be carried out, provided Mr. Willmott adopted the line of wharfing recommended by the surveyor, tinted red, the work to be done under his superintendence, all costs being borne by the applicant".</hi>

               <p>an angle on the opposite side; but the main reason for the Commissioners to be careful of it was that this river has a drain from the lands coming into it, and any obstructions into the river passed the water back into that sewer—in my judgment, the plan as proposed by him would have been a mischief to the river wall and to the drainage of the marsh generally—the two things are mixed up—permission was given in the way described; he was to be allowed to do it, but in my line, not in his—on 27th January I accompanied Major Seward and Mr. Howard to inspect the grievance—I found that the wharfing had been completed in his fashion instead of the other line; there was a sewer at the back which, was the common sewer, and he had taken possession of half that sewer and built a wall there as a boundary to his premises, and in the other half he had put a pipe, and it was partially filled up, I think; there had been an interference with the common sewer, which is a wide ditch and rather a useful one, because in times of flood it stores the water, and prevents its going over the lands—I think the effect of what he had done was to increase the risk of floods there, but at the same time, subject to the Commissioners' orders, an apparatus, was put in—I did not consent to it as it was done; in fact, it was taking the sewer off his land and putting it on other people's, as it were—the piles of the wharf were not advanced in front of the river wall at the foot, they were at the top; the line was 10 ft. out, I think, and it should have been 4 ft.; it was 6 ft. too far out—in the state in which he had left it, it was not possible for the marsh bailiff to examine the river wall properly; it was all covered with timber and bricks and everything; in fact, there was no passage there at all; he had erected a crane, and I think piles were driven in, and so on, to erect an apparatus for unloading—I was unwell at the time of the assault, and sent my son—afterwards, on 1st June, I had an interview with Mr. Willmott, with the marsh bailiff and Mr. Howard—there was a good deal of conversation about this line, and how little we could take away of the wharf, so as not to destroy good work; but it has never been done to my satisfaction to this day.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. I have been surveyor to the Havering Sewers Commissioners since April, 1860, but I have knows this place a good deal longer than that—I was engineer to the Lea trustees, and I am now consulting engineer, I don't take an active part—I am a salaried officer of the Lea Conservancy Board—I ceased to be the ordinary engineer about the beginning of last year, and a resident engineer was appointed, Mr. Forbes—it must have been before the end of 1869 that Mr. Willmott took his lease of the land where the wharf was erected—I should think I saw him before a single pile was driven in—I daresay I represented myself to him as the engineer to the Lea Conservancy: I told him he had got to write to two parties and that the Commissioners of the Level preferred having the Lea Conservancy approve of the frontage—he was to write to both—this letter which has been read is evidently written by Mr. Willmott—I did not give him the draft of the letter he was to send, I only advised him to make the application—in April, 1870, the Court recommended that I should have a meeting with the parties; the wharf was not made in April, it was in Pro<lb/>gress; there have been so many acts and meetings about it; I met Mr. Will<lb/>mott and his solicitor, or some gentleman acting for him—the piles were not all driven in before the latter end of April; some piles were driven, and if they had acceded to our plan then there would have been nothing to undo—this plan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) looks like the place, I find the projection of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187205060060"/>
               <p>the bank marked 10 ft. 6 in., the indentation shown here opposite the lime works is like that of the ordnance map of 1869, or nearly so, as far as this extends—this photograph (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) appears to me to represent the wharf correctly; it shows the foot of the conservancy wall, some has been cut away and some left; it is well within the exposed ground, it is on the wall, your piling is driven into the conservancy wall, it is the river wall—Mr. Willmott complained that the water from the open ditch percolated through to his sawpits; my impression is that the complaint was that he had put his boiler too low, and at flood time the water swelled up into the boiler—I don't know that I discussed with him whether he should put 12 in. or 9 in. pipes into the ditch; there very likely was a talk about that when he began to build the wall in the ditch, and I very likely said that 9 in. pipes were not big enough; we certainly should not have allowed less than 12 in.; I think he did afterwards put in 12 in. pipes, but not by my consent, because I pro<lb/>tested that the whole thing was done entirely without our consent, I had no right to allow such a thing—the wall and the ditch are two different things—I am not aware that the adjoining owner, who alone could be affected by the open ditch, consented to what Mr. Willmott did, and was anxious himself to put it up—I don't know who the adjoining owner is: a tenant of his, Mr. Barber, said he did not object to it, but I have no right to listen to the tenant—I don't know that the owner consented; I don't know that Mr. Barber did; he said he did not mind it, or something of that kind—the ditch is a public sewer, it brings water from above as well as from the two places occupied by Mr. Willmott and Mr. Barber—I certainly am not aware that that ditch has been stopped up for years; the very reverse, it has been open; I have ascertained that as a fact—I did not say that it has had communication with other grounds than Barber's and Willmott's; I think it goes along Mr. Barber's, and I think there are other grounds above Mr. Willmott's, but irrespective of that, it has to take off in flood time water that affects other people above: it is not tidal water, it is dammed up by the tide when it rises—I don't say that the tide rises up to Willmott's wall; it is not above a lock, so as to be unaffected by the tide, it is under high water and it is affected by the tide, and if the trap is left open the tide does go in, but not as flowing: I mean in the cut where the wharf is, it is all tidal, and it is an excessively troublesome thing; if that wharf had any trifling hole in it at any time the tide would go over the land—I have at times seen the water so low that the old piling was seen at the bottom of the river—I should say those old piles were from 2 to 5 feet beyond the new piling, but that is down below, it is not a high erection like this, it was done for a different thing—we wanted it 6 ft. instead of 6 ft. 10 in., and I think there had been a little compromise even then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Since this alleged interference was committed, in April, 1871, have you not, acting for the Commissioners, agreed that by rounding off the wharf, and putting 12 in. pipes into the ditch, you would be satisfied? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think so, by taking the ordinary 30 ft. length, taking off 4 ft. instead of 6 ft.; but that was a conversation, I think, in June last year—it is not within my cognizance that it was put in writing, and that the Commissioners wanted 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for costs, and Mr. Willmott only wanted to pay 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am not aware of that fact—we had a very great deal of discussion—I was most anxious to settle it amicably, and I thought it was settled at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You consented to an alteration since 1871? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—those alterations have never been made—the meeting was a meeting of amity,</p>

               <p>and I coaxed and tried particularly—there was to be a plate put on the ditch that we might have the power of opening or removing the ditch at any time, for I felt myself, as an engineer, rather at fault whether the ditch should be closed at all on account of the flood—I don't know why the negotiation went off, for the interview came quite to an amicable end, and I thought we should never hear of the matter again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were the surveyor directed to supervise what the marsh bailiff did when he went on the land forcibly to destroy the wall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was—I never went on 19th April, I was too unwell to go, but I gave strict directions, both to the marsh bailiff and to my son—I was there by deputy, my son went for me—I think Mr. Willmott afterwards gave the marsh bailiff access, perhaps you had better ask him—I know I was myself very much obstructed by the piles and bricks and mass of things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There were piles of bricks put on the wall, and a crane and pieces of timber—I could not get through very often—I was willing to allow a certain width of surface coming clown on the river wall, but not so much as he has put—the thing I thought would be right to allow would come further in shore, so that we could get to examine and repair the bottom of the wall; but the great thing was to get a line that would admit of the water going off when in flood, because the lands suffer very much then—the narrowing of that part of the river tends to throw up the water, because the wharfing takes up a space in the river, although it makes what is left stronger—besides being a surveyor, I have been an engineer, man and boy, for forty-five years, almost—in my judgment this was an impedi<lb/>ment to the free passage of the water for sewage purposes—the other matter in the ditch was also certainly an impediment, but the Com<lb/>missioners are bound to suit circumstances, and they allow certain things—they endeavour as well as they can to accommodate individuals in dis<lb/>charging their duties, so long as they do not let them obstruct—the wharf has not been removed, and things remain as they were—then has never been any other wharf except this that the defendant has erected in that part.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Marsh bailiff of the Commissioners, and was so at the time these entries were made, in 1870 and 1871—I recollect the presentment of the Marsh Jury on 22nd April, 1870—three trespasses of the defendant were brought before the Marsh Jury, the wharf, the obstruc<lb/>tion to inspection by the officers, and the building of the wall in the sewer—I can't say whether I served the order made by the Commissioners upon that, I have served a good many, but I can't say upon what date I served one—I remember the survey by the Commissioners and the engineer in January last, and I remember the order to remove being made on the 3rd of March—I served a notice, and in consequence of the order not being obeyed I went on 19th April to the defendant's premises where this wharf is—I went about 8 o'clock in the morning, and worked till noon—the men who were with me then went away to dinner, on their return a general melee ensued—I had seven men with me—a force of some twenty or thirty persons came and objected to our going on the premises; the defendant was there; he ordered his men to keep us at bay, not to allow us to enter on the premises—they had in their hands such things as you would find in a timber-yard, little bits of timber—I went in and spoke to the defendant, and he told me that he should not allow the men to come on—he knew I was the marsh bailiff, we had had several conversations, I did not attempt</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187205060064"/>
               <p>to get my men on; threats were used to the men when they attempted to enter; perhaps that continued a quarter of an hour; the threats were "D—you, you shan't come in"—that was all I heard on that occasion—after a while I took my men away—we went by land that day; next day, the 20th we went again, by a barge, about 8 o'clock or from that to 9 o'clock in the morning—I went in obedience to the order to remove the wharf—we fastened our barge to the timbers of the wharf the time occupied in doing so gave the defendant sufficient time to collect this same mob that we had met the day previous, and a few more added to their numbers; they had things in their hands, one had a handspike which he put within an inch of my nose—the defendant was on the wharf, directing the operations—he said to the man with the handspike "Knock him down," and it was upon that that the man put it at my head—this continued for some few minutes, during which time Mr. Willmott ordered the people to fetch hammers and chisels, and they attempted to cut our fastenings from the wharf, and then I thought it was time to retire, and I gave orders to go away—I could not enumerate the whole of the threats—I think I have already used one, "Knock his d—head off"—in consequence of this opposition I could not do what I was sent to do; nor was I able to inspect the wall; the timber had been piled on the footway of the wall—on 21st April I reported to the Court what had happened.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I can't tell what tools we took with us on the 19th—we carried such things as were necessary to remove a wharf, an axe, a saw, chisels, spades, I don't know how many more, crow bars most likely—we dug out the earth at the corner of the wharf, we worked till noon—we removed the ground, and the planking at the back of the ground, so that it was brought into the condition represented in this photograph (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) we worked from 8 o'clock till 12, or thereabouts—I think I called at the police-station in the morning and asked for assistance—they did not go with me, the policeman came on the ground possibly after we had been there an hour, and looked on for another hour and then went away—we then went to dinner, and when we came back Mr. Willmott said we should not go upon his property; he let me in, but would not let my men in—I don't know how many men he had there, beyond a dozen certainly—I don't remember that there was any policeman there then—next day I took with me one or two more men than the day before—we did not begin to cut away the wharf—I have mentioned about the handspike before to-day—properly built, the wharf would strengthen the bank of the river; it does not now, in as much as the filling in is of a loose nature, and the tide would leak through the wall—I say that the work is not properly done; if it was properly done it would be a positive protection to the bank; the loose portion is at the point where my men were disturbing the wharf—what they did has not loosened the protection of the bank—I say that the putting up of this wharf has facilitated the incursion of the water, in as much as the water would follow the passage of the ties driven through it—the land behind is very nearly as high as the wharf.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that the indictment cold not be sustained, inasmuch as the Commissioners of Sewers had exercised an authority which they did not lawfully possess. The Act of 1868 (31 &amp; 32 Vict. e. 154, which created, the Lea Conservancy Board, had defined their boundaries in section 3. The locus in quo was dearly within the jurisdiction of that body, and they had given no notice to the defendant, or taken any proceedings. Whether the Commissioners of Sewers ever had any powers on or over the bank of the Lea or not, the Con<lb/>servancy Act of 1868 had repealed all those powers, and vested them in the Con<lb/>servancy Board, who had made bye-laws for the purpose, He further submitted that, even if that Act did not repeal the former Acts, there was an express exemption of the water in question from the jurisdiction of the Commissioners of Sewers by their own General Act</hi>, 3 &amp; 4 <hi rend="italic">Will.

There was, therefore, no authority in the marsh bailiff to go upon what was private property, and to resisting him the defendant had committed no offence.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">contended that the jurisdiction of the Commissioners of Sewers was not ousted by the Lea Conservancy Act; no statutes were held to repeat other statutes unless they were inconsistent with each other, and it perfectly consistent that each of these bodies might have jurisdiction for their own particular purposes, the Sewers Commissioners over the walls and banks of the river, and the Lea Conservancy over the water. As to the ditch, the term "sewer" was not intended to apply to a place through which sewage passed, but to any channel which carried away the flood water. The Commissioners had a dear authority under the statute to prostrate any obstruction, and to take any necessary steps for that purpose; and in resisting, the defendant was liable under this indictment.</hi>

                  </hi>: <hi rend="italic">I am dearly of opinion that there is no ouster of the jurisdiction of these Commissioners. The objects of the two bodies are entirely deferent; the object of the Conservators is to maintain and improve the navigation of a navigable river, the object of the Commissioners of Sewers, is to maintain the drainage of the district; and unless there is an absolute inconsistency between the two statutes under which they are acting, the two map be construed together, each body discharging under them their own peculiar functions. In this case the Commissioners of Sewers had authority to interfere with a wharf and wall which interrupted and disturbed the efficiency of the rivulet as an open drain to carry off the water. I am, therefore, clearly of opinion that the Commissioners of Sewers have jurisdiction over the locus in quo, and in the exercise of their proper authority they were proceeding to do what they were obstructed in doing. Whether the erection of the wharf was an improvement or not, or whether the Commissioners exercised a right judgment or not, has nothing to do with the question; it is a misdemeanour at common law to obstruct persons having proper authority to remove.</hi>

I am a greengrocer, of Lewisham—I have a small stable 100 yards from my house, in which my horse is kept—I employed Slade to look after my horse—on Saturday morning, the 13th, about 4 o'clock, I went to the stable and found the prisoners both sleeping there—I said nothing to Luxford—I told Slade if I found him sleeping there again I should lock him up—he was not entitled to sleep there—he told me he lodged at a beer-shop—he brought me the padlock key the same evening at 10.30, and told me everything was safe—about 12 o'clock I went to the stable; the padlock was gone, which I had seen safe that morning, and the door was unlocked—the only way of looking the door was by that padlock—there was no one in the stable then, and I tied the door with a chain, and went home—the padlock was unlocked when I saw it on Saturday morning, and anybody might have taken it away—about 8.30 on Sunday morning, I was called by the police, and found the stable on fire, and the horse, which had to be killed afterwards, outside the shop door—I had had a tin can of varnish in the stable for six months—I saw—it last on the Friday morning, about ten yards from the stable, and after the stable was burnt down I found the can in the place where the horse had stood, right in the middle—about three-quarters of an hour after the fire was out, the constable brought the two prisoners to me—I asked them what business they had there—Slade said that they had been there sleeping, and ran away—I gave them in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Coroner for the County of Kent—I held an enquiry into the death of Cecilia and George Hurry—on the inquiry into the death of Cecilia Hurry the prisoners were sworn, and made state<lb/>ments which I took down in writing, and which appear on the depositions—George Hurry was the first witness called to identify the deceased before any imputation was made—he signed his depositions—this is it: "George Hurry, of Plumstead, engine driver, says the deceased was my daughter, Cecilia Hurry, aged seven years; she died on 8th April, 1872, she was taken ill about 28th March, last; on 30th March it turned to small pox. I called in no medical advice, it is contrary to my creed; deceased had not been vaccinated; I received notice to have it done, but as the authorities did not trouble me I did not trouble them. I have four other children, only one vaccinated. The elder attended my child, and annointed it with oil, and laid hands on it, and prayed over it; I belong to the "Peculiar People."</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187205060068"/>
               <p>The reason that I did not call in any medical advice or assistance is because we trust in the Lord for us and for our children. I knew the child was labouring under a very serious illness, of a most dangerous character, but I trust in the Lord for being solely able to save the life of my child. George Hurry"—Cecilia Hurry says:" I am the mother of the deceased, Mrs. Raven told me on the Sunday she thought the child was dying. I did not suggest the propriety of calling in any medical advice, the child had not been vaccinated. I received a notice when it was registered that within three months it must be vaccinated, it was not done"—<hi rend="italic">Second Statement</hi>: "Cecilia Hurry voluntarily says, I took my child to be vaccinated on Tuesday, 16th April, and I told Dr. Wise I did not think my child was in a fit state to be vaccinated; he made answer and said he did not think there was anything the matter with it; I said there was, there was a little rash on its fide. I showed Dr. Wise the side, and he said it looked rather suspicious, he told me to take it again in a month; there were only two persons there besides myself. I did not call in any medical assistance, my trust is in the Lord. I had my brethren to lay hands on, and annoint it, in the name of the Lord, and I believe by so doing I confirm the word of God."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Manslaughter was the voluntary verdict of the Jury, but I did my best to lay down the law—one of the grounds on which I con<lb/>sidered the parents responsible was, not that the children had not been vaccinated, that question was not before me or my Jury, but the question was asked whether they had been vaccinated.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Raven, a labourer, of Richmond Place, Plumstead—I knew the little boy and girl who are dead—the boy was six months old, and Cecilia was seven years and not quite two months—she had very good health, but was taken ill about 28th March—she lived at home with her parents, who were at home in the house—after three or four days I saw that she had what they call white small-pox, very bad—I had seen several cases of it before—it came out very badly—I attended the child, and was with her night and day, and kept her warm and gave her what nourishment she wanted, arrowroot, and a little very weak brandy—the father and mother knew what was the matter with her—I told them thought it was the small-pox when it was first coining out; they could afterwards sea for themselves what it was—I am one of the "Peculiar People"—I did not suggest to the parents the calling in of a medical man, and no medical man was called in—there is in our persuasion a person called an elder; his name is John Vine—he is a labouring man—he saw the child Cecilia from time to time, and laid hands on it in the name of the Lord, and anointed it with oil in the name of the Lord—the child was very bad on Saturday and Sunday, and died on Monday, 8th April—it was not delirious; it was very sensible—an inquest was held after its death, and the father was committed to prison—after that the boy became ill.

                  </hi>, M. R. C. S. I am a general practitioner at Wool<lb/>wich—I did not see either of these children before their death—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of the body of Cecilia, by the Coroner's order—the proximate cause of death was serous effusion on the surface of the brain—that is the mode in which small-pox very frequently terminates—the fever on the brain was caused by the small-pox—small-pox is a disease amenable to medical remedies—it occasionally yields to them, I think, but it is very difficult to decide where nature is the successful agent or the medical man—in the early stages you treat it as you do all febrile actions, that is, very strong fever—we avoid stimulants, as the brain is very apt to be affected—we apply ice-bags to the head, and share it, and give medicines of a saline character with a view to induce perspiration—in my judgment and from my reading and experience, those medicines are salutary, and tend to the cure of the patient—I am speaking from experience—I have gone into cases of small-pot where there has been very high febrile action, and have been able to trace an effect from the administration of the medicine, a lowering of the fever, which I have attributed to the remedies I have adopted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it your judgment that supposing those remedies had not been administered the patient might not have recovered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The tendency of every fever is to get well, but the medical man comes in and assists nature—the main object in small-pox is to check congestion of the brain, and that requires science and skill, and also a knowledge of disease, from which you can predicate results.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We have no specific for small-pox; no certain remedy—Mr. Marson is at the small-pox hospital—I do not agree with him in his evidence before a committee of the House of Commons, when he says "I fear we have no control over the disease"—I agree with him that there it no specific—I do not agree with him when he says "We have no power what<lb/>ever in controlling small-pox"—I know Dr. Seton, of the Privy Council—he has written a good deal on small-pox, but I do not know that I should take him as an authority—he has had some experience; if you ask me which portion of his opinions I agree with, I will tell you—I hare heard of Dr. Dixon—I agree with him that "the disease admits of no specific mode of practice"—I do not undertake to say that this child would not have died had I attended it—I do not know the form of small-pox called <hi rend="italic">corymbose,</hi> there are new forms getting introduced about every four hours into the profession, and perhaps new modes of treatment—there is scarcely any form of small<lb/>pox I am not acquainted with, but I do not know it by that term—the child died from small-pox, from the immediate effect of serous effusion on the brain producing convulsions, not in the girl but in the boy—convulsions are very common in infancy, but death is not very frequently caused by them—congestion or effusion on the brain will undoubtedly produce con<lb/>vulsions, without small-pox—I can swear that the girl died from small-pox—it is very uncommon for parents to neglect to procure medical assistance for their children when ill—I should say that 99 out of every 100 would do so in serious cases—as far as my experience goes, it is only these "Peculiar People" who neglect their duty in that respect—I know nothing about vital</p>

               <p>statistics—it is very possible that many hundred thousand die under five years of age—many medical men are in the habit of using oil in febrile cases; I use it very largely myself—I would not attribute to the "Peculiar People" injuring the child by anointing it with oil—I know nothing about the nursing—the child died from a debilitating exhausting disease, and I cannot say whether she was fully nourished—I cannot say whether she had been vaccinated, because the eruption was so thick over the cuticle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There is no doubt that the child had the small pox—very few specifics for diseases are known—small pox has a specific type of its own, and a general derangement of the system attends it—it is the duty of a medical man to anticipate symptoms, and it is a matter of importance that those symptoms should be taken care of—I believe that the service of a medical man is of high importance.</p>

I am employed by the Treasury in the Mint prosecu<lb/>tions—on the morning of 6th April I went to 3, Alfred Place, Salisbury Street, Bermondsey, with Inspector Bryant and other officers—I saw the prisoner's side face at the window, as I was going up Alfred Place—there is a little fore-court in front—I opened the gate and went in—the house had two rooms—I knocked at the door—the prisoner put his head out of the window, and then came down—I said "Well, Goodwin, I want you, you are suspected of dealing in counterfeit coin; I come here with a warrant, you are entitled to have it read, if you like"—I saw a file on the table at that time, and I picked it up—when I said he was entitled to have the warrant read, he said "What is the use of that, Mr. Brannan"—it was about 7.30—he was partly dressed—I heard footsteps up stairs and I ran up, leaving the prisoner in Bryant's custody—I was a very short time there when Bryant said "Brannan, come down; I think you will find what we came for down here"—he directed my attention to half a bag of plaster of Paris, which was on a little shelf—I was going out, and Bryant pointed to a saucepan which Stood by a little water-butt—the prisoner said "You b old villain, if You find anything in that saucepan you must have put it there yourself"—I had not mentioned the saucepan before that, nor had anyone else—I went to the saucepan, it was full of cinders—I brought it in and emptied the contents on the table, and I found this little water proof bag, which con<lb/>tained 26 counterfeit half-crowns, 6 florins, 60 shillings, and 42 sixpences:</p>

               <p>at present—on 4th March, I saw a man named Daniel Harris running in Caroline Place, leading into Lansdown Place, New Town, and I saw a per<lb/>son who I afterwards knew as Mr. Sykes—I did not see Harris taken into custody—I did not go before the Magistrate when Harris was in custody—on 20th March I was served with a subpoena about 0.45 in the morning—I did not leave my house for the purpose of going to the Court, I was going to the doctor's shop—I was passing Smith's house, which is No. 17, in Lans<lb/>down Place, where I lived, and I went into the room merely to speak to Mrs. Smith—there were a few children in the room, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and the prisoner Murray—I said "What do you think, Mrs. Smith, I am subpoenaed up for that poor chap that stole the gold watch"—she said "For God's sake don't go, if you do you will be murdered"—Mr. Smith said directly "You had better say you don't know him, old <hi rend="italic">gal</hi>"—Mrs. Smith, referring to Murray, said "That is his wife"—Murray said "You had better come with me"—I was so terrified, knowing that she was his wife, and knowing what I had to go through, that I got out of doors as quickly at I could, and I heard her say directly "If they don't do for her, I will"—when I got out, the detective Upson was waiting outside for me, and I went with him to the Surrey Sessions—that was not above ten minutes or a quarter of an hour's walk—I did not see either of the prisoners as I was going into Court, or in Court—the Court was cleared while I was in Court, except the gallery—Harris was in the dock, being tried—I was examined as a witness, and said what I knew about him, that I had seen him running on 4th March, that was all—after the case was over, I went home—Upson went with me, and saw me safely home—I did not see the prisoners as I was leaving the Court—I saw Murray as I was going along, at Smith's door—I did not notice that she said anything—I walked along, and got into my house and shut the door—the officer left—that must have been about 6.30 or 6.40—after that, Murray was the first that came up to the window, making the expression "You bleeding old cow, I will gouge your eye out before the night is over"—I also saw Lynch and a great many more, but I did not take notice what they were all saying, I was too frightened—Lynch was against the window; they were all against the window—mine was the front parlour window—the street door was fastened—I was at the window—after a little while they went away, they all went quiet—I wanted some coals, and I looked out three times at the door to see if there was any there, being terrified—I only saw some children opposite, and I went out—I was only going about two doors off—this must have been about 7 o'clock, I daresay about twenty minutes or half an hour after they bad been there—I had got about two doom from my house, when Lynch came up on my left shoulder from behind, and hit me on the shoulder—I turned round like that, away from her, and my eye was out instantly by Murray—not a word was said—Murray had her fist like that, and hit me—I put my head down, and said "Murder, I am stabbed"—I felt pain, just as if it was forked lightning falling out of my eye—I was all blood all over—my eye was out so far as that, but I did not know it at the time—stuff came from my eye; I was smothered all in blood—I saw nothing of the prisoners afterwards, I got in doors as quick as I could—all my clothes were torn off my back as I was getting in doors—I can't say who did it, there were plenty of them—two constables afterwards came, and I was taken to Guy's Hospital—I did not know the prisoners before this, only by seeing them once or twice, not as friends to speak to; I only knew</p>

I was at the Southwark Police Station when Murray was brought there in custody—I said to her "Before I take the charge I shall take you down to the hospital, to the bedside of Susan Snellgrove, the injured woman"—on the way there she said "I own I struck her, and as soon as I did so she fell over a barrow against the wall; I did not strike her with any sharp instrument; there were several children there at the time, and they commenced to kick her Was the hospital I saw Snellgrove is bed; I said to her, in Murray's presence, "I want you to look at this woman, to set if you know her"—she looked at her and said "Yes, that is the woman that struck me when the other one turned me round"—Murray again said that she owned she struck her, but she did not strike her with any sharp instrument—at the station, after I returned, she said "If you get the right party I will <hi rend="italic">round</hi> upon her, but I won't say nothing until you do"—she cried and sobbed very much at the hospital, and seamed very sorry: she said she struck her in the eye once—on the 9th April I took Lynch to Snellgrove's bedside, she had then had her eye taken out—I said "I want you to look at this person to see if you know her"—she looked at her and said "Yes, that is the woman that turned me round"—Lynch said "Do you say that I turned you round?"—she said "Yes, you did"—Lynch then became very violent; she shook her fist and said "I wish I had stiffened you; may you lie there for ever, you bleeding old cow"—I then ordered the officers to take her out of the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. On Wednesday night, 20th March, I was house surgeon at Guy's Hospital; Snellgrove was brought there about 10 o'clock—I examined her; there was a rupture of the right eye; she was then per<lb/>fectly blind of that eye; the rupture allowed the escape of the internal structures of the eye, they had come out; the parts all round were bruised, and on lifting the eye-ball yen could see a wound about a quarter of an inch in length running horizontally—the eye was not out of socket, it was in position, the parts were all tremendously swollen—what I call the internal structures of the eye are the lens and the fluid contained in the eye there was bleeding into the eye, and there was blood outside it—I think the injury could have been inflicted with a blow from a fist or a thumb-nail; either or both would do it—a blow would rupture the eyeball, it was not from the finger making a puncture—a blow from the fist might have caused it; it might have caused the wound a quarter of an inch long; both the rup<lb/>ture and the wound—I should think the blow was given from below upwards, so as to cause the eyeball to strike against the edge of the socket—I attended her up to the 19th of April—I removed the eye on 25th March, the Monday following her admission—there was a certain amount of irritation set up in the other eye; that is now free from danger; there was danger to it Until the injured eye was removed; there were no symptoms to require its removal before the Monday—I found no mark whatever of a graze, as if from a fell against a wall or a barrow.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I say the internal structures of the eye had come out, I mean that the lens and the fluid had escaped; of course I could hot see them escape, the parts gradually came away; I could not say what structures were gone until we opened the eye after it was removed; they were all gone then, there was nothing but blood Inside the eye, the lens and the fluid had run out of the wound; I don't mean that the eye came out; when I took the eye out all the internal structures were gone—they might have escaped before; I expect they did escape after the injury, from the opening in the eye—a process of inflammation was going on for some days after the injury—I thought first the first that it would be necessary to remove the eye; but there was no irritation set up in the other eye, and therefore there was no occasion to hurry—the sensation to the person from a blow on the eye is such as the prosecutrix has described as a flash of lightning; that would be the sensation from a blow with the fist on the ball of the eye; it might follow from a Violent blow of any kind—I do not think the injury could have been caused by her turning round suddenly against the fist, from the position of the Wound it must have been driven up against the edge of the orbit—I don't think a person could turn sharply round with sufficient violence against a stationary fist to have caused the injury—I think the appearance of the eye completely precluded the possi<lb/>bility of the injury being caused by a fall against a wall—I think it was most likely inflicted by the fist.</p>
