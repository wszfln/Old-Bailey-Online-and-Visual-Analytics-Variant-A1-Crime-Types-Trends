               <p>On the first of February a portmanteau of mine, containing the cloaths mentioned in the indictment, was stole from behind Mr. Faden's carriage; I was on horseback before the carriage; Mr. Faden called to me, that the portmanteau was gone; I saw that the straps were cut; I rode back, and saw a man near the Whitehorse-cellar with this cloak-bag under his arm; I pursued him, and cried stop thief; he ran, and in crossing the way he fell down; he got up, and ran on, but was presently surrounded, and secured. I kept him in my sight from the time I laid hold of the cloak-bag till he was surrounded; I could not then see him, but heard he was secured; he was all over dirty, and I have no doubt but he is the person that had the cloak-bag.</p>

               <p>Was the prisoner running or walking when you first saw him with the portmanteau? - He was walking with it under his arm.</p>
               <p>Might not it drop from the carriage? - I saw it fastened with cords; the cords and straps were apparently cut.</p>

Then Lake put his hand into his great coat, and pulled out a pistol which he presented to me, and said, d - n your eyes, make haste; I gave him one shilling, which was all that I had about me; Lake said, I will be d - d if this will do, you have more; I said, if you think so, you are at liberty to search me. Then he asked me for my watch; I told him I never wore one. Then he demanded Mr. Bowry's money, which he gave him. Then he asked for Mr. Bowry's watch; Mr. Bowry told him he had a watch; Lake bid him hand it over to him, which Mr. Bowry did, and then they rode off.</p>
               <p>Are you positive to the person of Lake? - I am; he is the very man that robbed us both; I knew him before; he lived with a baker at Pimlico, whom I served with flour; I recollected him when he took out his pistol and presented to me; it was quite light, and he had not any thing upon his face to disguise him.</p>

On Tuesday evening, at about six o'clock, while I was busy in my shop, I heard the cry of stop thief; I went out and followed the cry. The prisoner was taken in New-street, at about 20 rods beyond my door; I did not know at that time that I was robbed; I heard the people say the mercer's shop had been robbed; I brought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177802180006"/> the prisoner, and the person who took him to my house. The person that pursued him desired me to recollect if I had lost any thing; I could not then recollect that I had. The prisoner was taken to the Compter; in a little time my man and I recollected that we had lost a piece of silk and stuff; I have never recovered my property again.</p>

               <p>As I was coming from Shoreditch, on the 3d of February, at a little after six o'clock, I saw the prisoner in the prosecutor's doorway, and there were two other lads, one on each side of the window; the door stood ajar; I saw the prisoner stoop down, and drag a piece of brown stuff off the counter; he was pursued, and taken soon after; I am certain he is the person. They went off on a sudden; I do not know what became of the stuff.</p>

Whether you have not declared that you could not positively say that the door was locked? - To the best of my knowledge I locked the door; but I did say, I could not swear it till I had enquired of the smith whether there was, or not, a possibility, that if I turned the key in the door, it could happen that the door might not be locked; the smith said, it could not be that in so good a lock as that, the key could be turned in it, but the door must be locked; therefore from the best of my knowledge the door was locked.</p>

He refused to be searched till a constable came; then he was searched, and several pick-lock keys and a tinder-box, in which there was some lighted tinder, and a turn-screw were found upon him, and there was a wax-taper found in the room. The scutcheon upon the key hole of the door of this parlour was removed from its usual place as if done by violence. The prisoner did not make much resistance when he was taken, but he went down on his knees, and asked forgiveness of Mrs. Ashton.</p>

               <p>Upon Sunday the 18th of January last, I went with a letter to Mrs. Watts; as Mrs.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177802180008"/> Watts was lighting me down stairs again, she cried out, Mrs. Ashton, your parlour door is open, and here is a man here that does not belong to your house; I went back and saw the prisoner in the parlour, and Mrs. Watts have hold of his coat; I laid hold of the prisoner, and said he should not go till he gave a good account of himself; he then said, that he came to see for one Mrs. Smith: a laundress; afterwards, he said, he wanted one Mr. Williams.</p>
               <p>To the prosecutor. Did any such person lodge at your house? - No.</p>
               <p>Underwood. The prisoner was desired to empty his pockets, which he refused to do; he was searched when the constable came, and the things which have been produced were taken out of his pocket. There was a bag found in the room, but I did not hear any body say who it belonged to.</p>

               <p>I lodge in Mrs. Ashton's house; I was the last person with Mrs. Ashton in the room; I came out with her, and saw her turn the key in the lock; therefore to the best of my Judgment she looked it; I am sure that the door was shut.</p>

               <p>I picked up this bag with a parcel of breeches and things in it; I went up to this house; a man stood at the door; I asked him whether Mrs. Smith lodged there; he said, he could not tell; I went into the passage, then another man came out; I went to the stair-foot; then Mrs. Watts came down, and called out to Mrs. Ashton, here is a man, and your door is open. Then the man laid hold of me, and asked me what business I had there? I told him. Then the bag was produced, and a man was taken to the watch-house, but they let him out next day upon bail, and he has not since been heard of; I was never in the parlour; I was only in the passage.</p>
               <p>Court. Was any other person taken up?</p>
               <p>Ashton. Yes; a man who was seen at the door was taken up on suspicion; there was nothing against him, and he was discharged.</p>

               <p>Last Sunday was a week, Mr. Atkinson and I were stopped, in a post-chaise, between three and four in the afternoon, upon the <placeName id="t17780218-13-crimeloc75">Edgware road</placeName>

Two highwaymen came up to my side of the chaise first; then one came on each side; the person who was on my side, said, give me your money and watches, and be quick; I gave him two guineas and two dollars; as soon as I had given him that, they rode off; I cannot say whether the prisoner is the person.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing of them afterwards? - Yes; there was a chaise before us, which was coming towards us. The gentlemen who were in that chaise, suspecting they were highwaymen, got out as they rode towards that chaise, upon which they turned back again.</p>

               <p>I was in a post-chaise with the prosecutrix; about three o'clock in the afternoon, upon the Edgware road, we were stopped by two men; Miss Barkham was robbed. The prisoner came first up to my side of the chaise; then he went to the other side where he demanded the money of Miss Barkham; he had a silk handkerchief tied across his face; I took notice of him as he passed the chaise, before he stopped us; he had not any thing over his face at that time; I suspected they were two highwaymen when they passed us; I said so to Miss Barkham; I recollected his face when he passed by.</p>
               <p>You say you recollected his face; had you ever seen him before? - Yes; I had seen him several times about the streets of London, and had taken notice of him; I have seen him about with four or five men, who used to be suspected.</p>
               <p>Did you see enough of him before he put the handkerchief on his face, to be sure as to his person? - Yes; and besides he dropped the silk handkerchief off from his face while he was committing the robbery; I am quite sure he is the man; they rode off towards a returned chaise which was coming up; four or five men jumped out of that chaise, and they then turned back, passed our chaise, and rode towards Edgware. The post boys took one horse out of our chaise, and another out of the other chaise, and pursued them.</p>

               <p>I drove the chaise Miss Barkham and Mr. Atkinson were in; two highwaymen passed the chaise, and soon turned about again; the one with a mask on, the other with a handkerchief tied round his face; one came up on each side of the chaise; he that had the mask on said, he would blow out my brains, if I looked back; a returned chaise was coming up; as the highwaymen were going towards that chaise, I called out stop thief; then they turned back, passed us, and went towards Edgware; the other post-boy got behind me, upon one of my horses, and we pursued the highwaymen for about a mile; then the other boy got off the horse, and I continued to pursue them. I never lost sight of them; particularly the prisoner, till such time as he got over into the fields. I overtook them in Hendon town; they galloped on as fast as they could; the man that made his escape rode amongst the country people, with two pistols in his hands, threatening to shoot them; at the same time the prisoner rode up to me, and shot me in the side with his pistol; saying, if I would not go back, he would blow my brains out; I pursued him further, half a mile; then the prisoner's horse failed, and he quitted him, and got over into the field; I still pursued him, and he was taken. At the time he shot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177802180010"/> at me his face was uncovered; and I then saw him distinctly, and am sure he is the man; after that, when he got over into the field, he was not above a minute out of my fight; he was dressed in a blue coat.</p>

               <p>I drove the returned chaise. I drove up towards the other chaise; when the two men came, they rode about ten yards towards me; both their faces were uncovered; I plainly then discerned the prisoner; I am sure he was one of the men; and there were no other men on horseback there besides those two persons; they turned back; the other post-boy and I rode upon one of the horses for about a mile; then I alighted; the other boy rode on. A man coming up upon one of my horses, I mounted that, and immediately followed them; and I saw one of the men fire at the other boy. The prisoner had a blue coat with blue buttons on.</p>

            , to enable him to receive the dividends, and to apply it for the trusts upon which it was vested in Dr. Myonnet and Mr. French. Mr. Hewlett died about three years ago, I believe, and Mrs. Hewlett continuing to be entitled under this trust, the prisoner received the dividends for her; and she did, I believe, to accommodate the prisoner, agree to sell out the Reduced Annuities, and upon this occasion Dr. Myonnet and Mr. French executed a letter of attorney to the prisoner, to enable him to sell the Reduced Annuities. Soon after this, Mr. Sherwood became a bankrupt; and some suspicions arising, that the Consolidated Bank Annuities had also been transferred, as well as the Reduced Annuities, Mr. French, who is a trustee, upon hearing that, applied at the Bank, and there he found that the Consolidated Bank Annuities had been transferred, for which there had been no letter of attorney given, as well as the Reduced Annuities, for which there had been a letter of attorney given.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, it appeared from the books, that the prisoner at the bar had transferred these Consolidated Annuities, under a pretence of being the attorney for Dr. Myonnet and Mr. French, and was authorized, by a letter of attorney from them, to transfer it; there was no doubt, nor, I believe, will be, that the letter of attorney was forged. If there is any doubt in the business, it will be whether the prisoner at the bar be the person concerned in that forgery, or in publishing the letter of attorney, knowing it to be forged.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I shall now state to you the evidence against the prisoner with respect to this forgery:</p>
               <p>The prisoner applied to a Mr. Nesbitt, a broker, to sell the stock under this forged letter of attorney. The stock was accordingly transferred, and the prisoner, as is usual, set his name as the person acting and authorized by this letter of attorney.</p>

            , salesman, of Houndsditch. Upon enquiry for such persons, it was found that the names were real, that they had actually subscribed this letter of attorney, as attesting the execution of it. They are both relations to the prisoner at the bar; but it will be proved to you, that they were desired by the prisoner to set their names as witnesses to the letter of attorney, that neither of them saw it executed by either Dr. Myonnet or by Mr. French, that the prisoner brought it into his shop folded up, and desired them to set their names to it as witnesses. I believe the witnesses at that time did not conceive that they were doing any thing wrong, depending upon the credit and integrity of the prisoner that he would not do a thing which was improper, or desire them to do a thing which was improper. They set their names to it, not seeing it executed by Dr. Myonnet, or by Mr. French, and, in truth, at the time they subscribed their names to the letter of attorney, the name of Mr. French was not to it, but the name of Dr. Myonnet was; the execution of the letter of attorney by Dr. Myonnet alone would not have answered the purpose, for this stock being vested in two trustees, jointly, both of them must concur in an act to transfer it; they must either both concur in the very act of transferring, personally, or they must authorize an attorney to do it for them; one of them alone would not be sufficient. The name of Mr. French, however, appears with a seal to that name to this letter of attorney; and under this letter of attorney it will be proved to you, that the prisoner at the bar applied to sell, and actually did sell, this stock.</p>

               <p>"At a Court of Directors, at the Bank,</p>
               <p>"on Thursday the 15th of January, 1778,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Governor acquainted the Court,</p>
               <p>"that - ."</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>I object to the reading of that minute, it being proposed to be read for the purpose of shewing, that Mr. French, whose name is affixed to this instruments, which they say is forged, is a disinterested witness and capable of proving it; and in order to render him a disinterested witness they would shew that the Court of Directors have replaced the stock, so that it is indifferent to Mr. French whether the instrument be valid or a forged one. Now, if the Court of Directors have done so, they have placed themselves in the situation of Mr. French, and the Bank are themselves interested in proving this a forged instrument; because, whether it be true or forged, upon that will depend whether they are or not capable of demanding a repayment of that money by Mr. French, or the person whose name this imports to be. Therefore as the Court of Directors are themselves interested in the question, consequently no minute made by them will be proper evidence.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown.</p>
               <p>They state themselves liable to make good to Mr. French and Dr. Myonnet this stock which has been improperly transferred, and as they make an order to direct the stock to be transferred, so they act against their interest.</p>
               <p>Court. The prisoner is trying for forgery. This evidence offered is tending to prove that the prisoner is guilty of the forgery; if he is found guilty of it, the Bank can never have the money back again; therefore so far from its being a matter in which they are interested, they are in the strongest degree proving against their own interest.</p>
               <p>[The order read by Mr. Lewin, as followeth:]</p>
               <p>"That the committee of Treasury</p>
               <p>"have power to make good to the said Dr.</p>

               <p>Court. Prisoner at the bar, the evidence being now closed for the prosecution, do you wish to say any thing in your defence?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>Court. You will understand that your counsel cannot do any thing farther for you, than call your witnesses. Therefore if you would say any thing in your own defence, you are at liberty to say it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I refer it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>I wish Mr. Sherwood to be informed, that the counsel cannot speak for him. If Mr. Sherwood will urge what he has to say for himself, if that furnishes a hint for his counsel, they will pursue it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The power of attorney for selling 700 l. Three per cent. Reduced Annuities, was signed by Mr. French, at a butcher's shop in White-Chapel; there was nobody present but him and me, at the time he signed that; upon reading it over he said,</p>
               <p>"this</p>
               <p>"should be witnessed at the time of signing;" I told him, I supposed that was nothing but matter of form; I would get it signed; he said nothing more, and departed.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>I have witnesses to prove, which is already very clearly proved; namely, his undoubted good character; the Court are in possession of that by the evidence of Mr. French; whether that is proved by one or ten thousand witnesses makes no difference at all. There is another thing which I would shortly submit to the court; we have some evidence, that this is the hand-writing of Dr. Myonnet. Dr. Myonnet, the counsel on the other side, are pleased to say is in an infirm state of health; I believe he is not so very infirm; I should be glad if the counsel will tell me whether Dr. Myonnet is here, or not?</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177802180017"/>Counsel for the Crown.</p>
               <p>Dr. Myonnet is near at hand, but he is of a very great age.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>He is a very old man, and is very apt to forget; supposing this is the hand-writing of Dr. Myonnet, but not the hand-writing of Mr. French, so that it is not Mr. French's deed; whether this being described in the indictment as the deed of both, can be truly said to be so, or not; it is a counterfeit deed, quoad Mr. French, but not a counterfeit deed, quoad Dr. Myonnet. I believe there is no count in the indictment, shaped to that particular case.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown.</p>
               <p>There is a count in the indictment to answer that objection.</p>
               <p>Court. Both the witnesses have said, that Dr. Myonnet was not present at the time they subscribed the letter of attorney.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>It is too common a thing, I believe, to obtain a subscribing witness after the party has signed a letter of attorney; it is frequently done in this way; it is not commonly understood, that two witnesses are necessary. A gentleman has signed a letter of attorney, in order to have some stock transferred, and has subscribed it in the presence of only one witness, thinking that sufficient. Afterwards the broker finding two necessary, he does not care who signs it afterwards; that is a very common, but a very improper practice; but it is not less his deed; the deed is complete before it is subscribed by any witness; therefore, supposing this to be the deed of Dr. Myonnet, the question is, whether the deed as described in the indictment can be said to be forged.</p>
               <p>Court. The charge is for counterfeiting this warrant of attorney, purporting to be the warrant of Dr. Myonnet and Mr. French; now allowing that Dr. Myonnet did execute that deed, yet, if it be necessary for the transferring the stock, that Mr. French should likewise have signed and sealed that deed, and if he did not, then the deed is forged.</p>

               <p>Did you know Tickner's person? - Yes; I went up to him and spoke to him, but I don't remember what I said; he struck me so soon that I had not time to say any thing.</p>
               <p>Where did he strike you, and with what instrument? - I can't tell; it was something fixed on wood which cut me.</p>
               <p>Could you discern whether it shone? - No; I judge from the fling of it, it seemed to be fixed into a stick; it hung loose, and hit hard; it was not a long bill, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177802180018"/> something loose, I think, came round my head, and it seemed to me to be tied to a stick, like a flail; the first blow fell upon my nose, the next on my head.</p>

               <p>When you received the second blow, what became of him? - I don't know; I was knocked down; I received several blows after I was down.</p>
               <p>Was you sensible of having received several blows on the ground? - Yes; but I suppose that I lay some time on the ground senseless.</p>
               <p>Did you either see, or hear, any person besides the prisoner Tickner? - I thought I heard somebody else when I was down; but I was not rightly sensible; but I am not sure whether I saw any other man or no.</p>
               <p>How long do you suppose that you lay upon the ground? - I suppose about ten minutes; I got up; I saw no more of Tickner; I went home and called up a servant, and I was sent to the Hospital.</p>
               <p>What sort of a night was it? - A very light night; I saw Tickner very plain; Tickner was a hired servant to Adams; he lived with him as a part of his family.</p>

               <p>You are, I believe, one of the surgeons of St. George's Hospital? - Yes; Jacobb: was brought to the Hospital on the 17th of January; I was not present when he came; I examined his person, and found a small superficial wound upon the right side of his nose; he had a very large wound upon his neck immediately under the lower jaw; he had eight wounds on the top of his head.</p>
               <p>Do you mean cuts by wounds? - Yes; and one upon his hand, and a small one also in the right brow; I think three were all.</p>
               <p>What instruments, in your judgement, do you think these wounds were caused by? - I think by a sharp instrument.</p>
               <p>Court. What sort of a wound was that upon the nose, did it slit the nose? - No; it divided the exteguments of the nose; it did not go through the bones of the nose; it was of an oblique direction.</p>
               <p>Court. How far did it penetrate? - It did not go through; there is very little but the skin covers the bones of the nose; it went to the bone.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you call it a cut, or a scratch? - It was a cut.</p>
               <p>Court. Did it penetrate through the skin so as to cut the flesh? - I here is hardly any thing but skin; it went through the skin.</p>
               <p>Did it reach the bone? - I think it might.</p>
               <p>Is it such a wound as will leave any mark? - I think the cicatrix will not be seen in a little time; the cicatrix is scarcely to be seen now; I don't understand it to be a slit of the nose; it was lacerated.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. I can very plainly see a mark on the nose.</p>
               <p>Court. How long do you suppose it will be before that wound is so healed as not to be visible? - There was a month elapsed last Saturday; I suppose that in a fortnight, or a month, it will not be visible; I can't well say what time it will take to obliterate the mark.</p>
               <p>Will the mark ever be erased during the man's life time? - I can't say; there may be some little mark of it discovered upon a close examination.</p>

The buck would come and rub his head against any body; the doe was shy to strangers. They were left out in the barn-yard on Christmas-eve; the next morning the buck was missing. There are pails round the yard; I saw them in the yard that evening; sometimes we locked them up of a night. When we missed the buck; we found a great deal of blood at one end of the barn-yard; and there was hair and blood upon the wall where it had been taken over.</p>
               <p>Describe the buck? - He had a dumpty horn; and he had torn his car; and the shepherd cut it half off; it was of a brown colour. The prisoner lived about a quarter of a mile from my master's.</p>

               <p>I lived with the prisoner; upon Christmas-eve Adams and Tickner came home together, between twelve and one at night; upon opening the door, I saw a dead deer lying at the door; it had been stuck; its throat was cut; it had but one horn; they brought it into the house, and both of them skinned it; they kept all the flesh for their own eating, except one haunch, which my mistress carried for a present to London. The skin and the head (except a bit which was given to a dog) were buried in the garden.</p>

               <p>This deer struck my man on the ribbs; he told me of it; we looked over the wall, and the deer ran at him again; he said, he wished I would kill it; I struck it across the throat with my knife, and it lay some time on the ground. After I had killed it; I could not tell what to do with it. Tickner took it up, and carried it to my house, and threw it down at the door. The servant maid came, and asked what we had got, I thought it was a pity after it was dead to let it lie, so we carried it in, and skinned it; and we put the skin under ground.</p>

The bundle contained the things mentioned in the indictment [repeating them], which I had to wash; he was stopped, and carried to the Justice.</p>

               <p>JOHN - sworn.</p>
               <p>As I was coming out of the stable-yard, I heard Mrs. Edwards call out stop thief; I saw the prisoner and another man running on the opposite side of the street; some other person threw the prisoner down; I laid hold of him, and kept him till Mrs. Edwards came up, which was in two minutes; she was in sight when he was taken; she said that was the person; I saw nothing upon him.</p>
               <p>HENRY - sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 22d January, about eight o'clock, I heard the cry of stop thief; I took my hat and ran out; when I came to the end of the street, I saw the prisoner stopped there, and Mrs. Edwards by him; I asked if the prisoner was the man who took the things; she said he was. I saw nothing then upon him; I went to a neighbouring magistrate, after that to Justice Welch's. I then went home, but as I went back, I saw in the place where the boy was stopped a taller man idling about there; I thought this might be one of his accomplices looking for the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177802180023"/> things; seeing nothing there, I thought they might be thrown into some of the areas; I desired the people to look there, and at the fourth house from the place she said she was robbed at, the bundle was found down the area. I afterwards carried, the bundle to Justice Gretton's where Mr. Edwards was going, as Justice Welch was not at home; there the bundle was examined, and delivered again to me. I have had it in my custody ever since.</p>

               <p>Was it light or dark? - Very moonlight.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the prisoner before? - I cannot say I had, unless he was the man I met before; he gave me a crooked shilling back, and said, here is a shilling to carry you to London; I told him I had paid the turnpikes; but I took it, and thanked him; it was, however, a bad one; I remembered I had a bad crooked shilling some time before; I told him it was a bad one; he took it again, and gave me another; I asked him to give me the bag again, that it was a bag I had had some time, and he gave it me; he shook me by the hand twice, and bid me a good night; I was as near to him as I could be; he turned back, and I came strait on for London; when I had got about ten or fifteen yards from the place where he robbed me, I turned my head and thought I saw him hold rather off towards the common; I thought he would not go back towards Acton, as I suspected he had robbed the coach I met, but that he would turn off towards town; as I thought I might meet with him at Hyde Park-gate, I gallop'd my horse all the way as hard as he could lay legs to the ground, till I came to Tyburn-gate; then I turned down Park-lane to Hyde Park-gate; I jumped out of the chaise, and I told the man at the gate that I had been robbed; I had a grey horse in the chaise; I took it out and put it behind the house, left if he came up he should know it; I had a large horse-man's great coat on; I went into the little hut at the gate, and laid it down on the table; I had not been there above two minutes before the prisoner came up to the gate; I said to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177802180024"/> man at the gate, I believe this is the man that robbed me just now; I think this is he; the man flung the gate open, and I walked close up to the horse's shoulders and looked him full in the face; I saw he was the man that had robbed me; the moment I saw he was the man that had robbed me; I struck him with my hand on the face; he fell backwards a little on the horse's hips; I catched hold of him by the collar with my left hand, and pulled him down; when he was down, I struck him, I believe, a time or two in the face; I knocked him down, I believe, two or three times; in the struggle, I observed him put his hand to his pocket; I clapped my hand upon it, and found something hard; I d - d him, and said he had got a pistol there; I catched hold of him with my left-hand, and struck him in the face, and he fell down, and I took the pistol from him; he had not quite drawn it out; I searched him, and found another pistol in his pocket; I took them both from him, and then I led him by the collar into the house.</p>
               <p>[The pistols, which were very small pocket ones, were produced in court.]</p>
               <p>Did you not observe the colour of his horse when he robbed you? - Yes; a dark brown horse with a large white snip in his nose; I did not take so much notice of the horse as I did of his face; when he robbed me, I looked in his face all the while; before I led him into the house, I called out for assistance to the turnpike men, but they refused assistance and d - d me, and said they thought I had beat the man enough; I led him into the house, and tied his hands together with a silk handkerchief; I then brought him out and put him in the chaise, and brought him home to my own door; I gave a gentleman's servant a shilling to ride the prisoner's horse home; coming along the street, he wanted me to let him get out and run away; and said he would give me my money back again.</p>
               <p>What money? - He said he would give me my money back again; the three guineas he robbed me of; I told him if he did not sit quietly, I would tie his legs together; in short, I brought him home to my house, and sent for a neighbour to know what was best to do with him; he said, go before a Justice by all means; two or three neighbours came in, and saw me take him out of the chaise; we took him in a coach to Sir

               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I am very unfortunate in retaining a counsel who does not attend; therefore, I beg leave to ask the witness a few questions:</p>
               <p>I should be glad to know what dress the person was in who robbed you? - He had a brown coat on; I did not take so much notice of his dress as his face.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether you did not swear, before Justice Addington, that he had a great coat on with a cape buttoned up to his eyes, and a large flapped hat? - I cannot say; I said that he had a large flapped hat, and a long pig tail under his great coat that was not taken out when he came to the turnpike.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Had the person who robbed you a cape buttoned over his face? - He had a cape buttoned up under his chin, and his queue in behind.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you swear it was buttoned up to his nose or eyes? - I did not say so; it was not so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What conversation passed at the turnpike? - I have told the Court as near as I can possibly remember.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether you did not tell me if I would go quietly, you would never prosecute me; but would take me to my friends, and would never hurt me? - No; my Lord, he begged very hard for it, and said he was a merchant's son.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You never promised me you would not prosecute me if I would go quietly with you? - I never promised you any such thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether you are not exceedingly near sighted? - I am very near sighted.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether you are not so near sighted as not to be able to know persons that pass you in the middle of the day? - I can see better in the dusk of the evening when the light is not very glimmering, than<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177802180025"/> in the middle of the day; my ball is too large for my sight when the sun is too glimmering; my eye-sight is very bad; I can see better in the dusk than when the light is very strong.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether I was not the first man that came up to the turnpike after he complained of the robbery? - I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether from the time you took me at the turnpike, till you found the pistols upon me, you did not say, you only believed I was the man? - No; I was positive to him as soon as I went up to his horse's shoulder and looked at him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether you ever said you was sure I was the man, till you found the pistols upon me? - I should not have struck him, if I had not been positive he was the man when I looked at him.</p>
               <p>Court. Whether you ever positively said he was the man, till you found the pistol upon him? - When I saw him coming, I said to the turnpike man that I believed he was the man.</p>
               <p>Court. Whether you ever said to any man before you found the pistol upon him, that is the man who robbed me? - No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I believe he has said that after he did find the pistol upon me, he never said if I would go quietly with him he would not prosecute me. Was there any other conversation at the turnpike? - I do not recollect that there was; I was alarmed when I found the turnpike men would not assist me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told him I was the son of a Mr. Dare, and that one of my trustees was Mr. Watkins, in Newport-street; the prosecutor said, Young man you have very good friends, if you will go home with me quietly I will not prosecute you. - I deny that any such conversation passed; he said he was the son of a Mr. Dare, and had good friends; that he was a merchant's son in the city.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You did not mention that you would take me home to my friends, and would not prosecute me? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You choose to swear that positively? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Who were at your house when I came home? - The persons are here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How many were there of them? - My house was pretty much crouded.</p>

I had the key in my hand; Mr. Lucas said, I believe this is the man. I went and opened the gate; Mr. Lucas followed me close. As the prisoner came through the gate, I asked him for the toll; he said, he had paid me in the morning. Mr. Lucas came up directly, and catched him by the coat with his left hand, and struck him; he was then rather behind the prisoner; I was standing at the horse's shoulder; he repeated his blow twice; he struck him as hard as he could, and made the horse reel; then he pulled him down on the ground, and beat him unmercifully, and he called out to the turnpikemen to assist him; I was by him all the time; I said you don't want any assistance to beat the man; let him get up on his legs, and take him to the toll-house; he then dragged him across the street on his back; when he was down he had his knees on him, and kept beating him in the face; I said, what signifies beating the man? let him get up, and take him into the toll-house. At last he got him to the toll-house, and the prosecutor was there with him, I believe, twenty minutes; he tore the skirt of his coat off, and would have beat him in the toll-house, if we would have let him; he asked us for something to tie the prisoner's hands. The prisoner then called Mr. Lucas by his name several times; by what means he knew him I don't know, though, I believe, he had told him that his name was Lucas; when he had tied the prisoner's hands, he asked him who he was? The prisoner told him his name was Dare; the prosecutor said, you are but a young man.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner say where he lived? - I don't recollect that he did. Mr. Lucas then said, I will take you home to your friends, young man; he repeated that several times, and that he would shew him mercy on that account; he asked him for the three guineas; the young man never confessed having the three guineas, or that he had robbed him, or any thing of it. Mr. Lucas took him in the chaise, and Sir

               <p>I keep a fruit shop. As I was standing in my little shop, at the back of the turnpike, I heard a great noise; I ran round to the gate; Soker was then taking the toll of the gate; I said for God's, sake, what is this gentleman beating the man so for? Soker said, he says, he believes he is a highwayman. I begged of Mr. Lucas not to beat him so; Mr. Lucas was standing over him. I desired him to get off, for he was repeating his blows as fast as possible; I got him up, and Mr. Lucas went to repeat his blows again. The prisoner staggered up against the wall; he again attempted to strike the prisoner, and several blows came upon my shoulders and arms; I said he should not beat him so; I kept him off; I asked him if he was sure that the prisoner was the man; he said he believed he was the man; I said he should not beat him so, if he was not sure, he might kill the man; he said again, he believed he was the man, but he was not sure that he was; then he wanted the prisoner to strip; I said, No; I had got him safe in my hands, and he should not; I said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177802180027"/> if you think he is the man, why don't you search him? Why do you stand damning and swearing here? he is as quiet as a lamb. Then Mr. Lucas put his hand to his right-hand pocket; he found something, and said, here is a pistol here; he took hold of his coat with both hands, and tore the stap intirely off; I said to him, Sir, why do you so? you might blow one's brains out, taking such a sudden jerk as that; why don't you search his pocket? then he put his hand into the prisoner's pocket, and took out a pistol. Now, says he, I am almost sure that you are the man. Mr. Lucas then d - d and swore very much, and tried to repeat his blows upon him; I told him he should not strike him, nor no man should while he was in my care; he d - d me for a rascal, and asked me who I was? then he took another pistol out of the prisoner's pocket. Mr. Lucas did not seem to be positive throughout the whole that he was the man. Then the prosecutor stamped and swore, and tore about very much, and said, that he was a better man than him. The young fellow (the prisoner) stood very quiet; he made no resistance in the world. Mr. Lucas took out a handkerchief, and tied his hands. The prisoner called Mr. Lucas by his name. Mr. Lucas asked what he was when he came a little to himself? The prisoner said, that his name was Dare, and that his father was a timber merchant in Long Acre. He begged very much for mercy, and the prosecutor said he would take him home to his friends, and would shew him mercy, and not hurt him, he repeated that seven or eight times; we were then very happy within ourselves, to think that the young man had fallen into such good hands that would not hurt him, after beating him in the cruel manner he had done; then we conducted him to the chaise, and Mr. Lucas said, he would take him home to his friends, and would not hurt him, but would shew him mercy; therefore we took no more notice of it.</p>

               <p>From the Prisoner. Did I make any confession at the turnpike? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Because the word mercy might convey tan idea as if I had made a confession; was not the word mercy relative to his beating me?</p>
               <p>Court. What did you understand by the word mercy? - From his beating him.</p>

I think the evidence of the prosecutor much contradicted by the rest of the witnesses. I desired mercy when he was beating me. I never made any confession at any time. The prosecutor is so very short-sighted, that he did not know the turnpikeman the next day, though he was with him in the toll-house for half an hour; yet he swore that he never saw him.</p>

On the Wednesday following (the 28th) he brought me another pair, the fellows of them, and asked me to lend him two pounds upon them; I had taken down before where he said he lived, which was No. 1, Clerkenwell-close; I asked him, as before, how he came by them; he gave me the same account; I asked him if he had a bill and receipt; he said he had; I said I would keep the candlesticks till he went and brought it; he went, and returned in half an hour, and said he could not find it, but if I had a doubt about their being his, I might go to his lodging; I would not, but said if he would call in half an hour, I might let him have the money; he wanted the candlesticks; I said I would keep them till he came again, and would speak to my master about it; he went away, and I went to Sir

I went on the Tuesday as he appointed; he was gone on board a ship, and I have never heard of him since; I kept the box till after Christmas, before I knew what was in it. In the middle of January, I was distressed for money; I opened the box, as he owed me money, and I could hear nothing where he was; I found the property; I took two candlesticks to pawn; I never took the paper off; I did not see the whole of the things then; I only saw the candlesticks; I pawned them in my own name, in case he sent for them, to take them out again if he paid me the money; I did not know but they were his property; they were nailed down in a thin deal box; I broke the box as I was getting it open, so I put them into a box I had by me; when I kept the tap, I was a single man, and the porters and coachmen brought parcels into my cellar; I never took any charge of things that were brought in my life; my cellar is open to all the coachmen that go on the road; this Jones used to mind my business for me when I wanted to go out to order liquors, or see a friend, which is very well known; I expected witnesses; I wanted my trial put off; I employed a counsel who is not here.</p>

I answered, matter enough; then he flew to the fore-part of the cart, and said, stop this minute, or I will blow your brains out; he clapped a cutlass to my breast.</p>
               <p>Was it light enough to see the cutlass? - Yes; he was close to me; his hand partly touched my breast; he said, blast your bloody eyes, if you offer to turn your head, I will cut it off; I said I had a large family, and begged he would spare my life; then he holoa'd out two or three time, come on, come on; upon which two other persons came up; one came on the off-side of my cart, and the other got into the cart. The prisoner stood over me with a cutlass, with his back to the horse, and his face to me, about a foot and half from me; he held the cutlass</p>
               <p>to my breast; he again blasted my bloody eyes, and said, if you offer to move your head, I will cut it off; I kept begging he would save my life; he made use of such wicked expressions, that I was afraid he would kill me. They took the hempen bag that contained the tea and sugar; the prisoner helped it down out of the cart; the man in the cart took the leather trunk, and gave it to the man on the off-side. The deal box was taken out by the same person. The basket with the earthen-ware was taken out by the same man; the prisoner stood over me all the time with the cutlass; he only helped to take the sack out; they likewise took an empty sack which was found in the prisoner's stable; when they had taken the things out, the prisoner called to one of them, come here, and take this pistol; and, if he stirs, blow his brains out, and I will go and see if all is got off. The man came and stood at the horse's head, and the prisoner went away, and returned again, and said, they were all off, all clear. The man he placed at the horse's head replied, now you may go on; the prisoner replied, No; d - n his eyes, he shall not go on yet; we will cut his reins, otherwise people will think he has not been robbed; the prisoner cut the near horse's rein, and the man who was at the horse's head cut off the horses reins close to their heads. I asked them to let me get down, and tie the horses together; they did, and I tied my horses together, and went home.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is one of the three persons? - Yes; it was a dark night; I know him by his make, being a square thick made man, and bigger than the other.</p>
               <p>You had never seen him before? - I had not to my knowledge; I was robbed on the Saturday night; on the Sunday morning, I tracked a cart from the end of a lane just by where I was robbed; as I was going home, after I was robbed, I stopped, at a gentleman's, to deliver a message, a little cart went by me in the morning; I enquired if any body had seen a cart; I heard nothing of it till I came to Kingsland.</p>
               <p>When did you hear of the cart? - On Tuesday the man at the Basing-house informed me of the prisoner and the cart. I had before given a description of him; upon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177802180033"/> this information; I got a search warrant from Mr. Wilmot, and went to Cock-lane with Lee and another, and in the house of the prisoner we found an hempen sack; he said he did not know how the sack came there.</p>
               <p>[The sack was produced in court by Lee, and deposed to by the prosecutor.]</p>
               <p>Was there any body in the house besides the prisoner? - I did not see the prisoner in the house when we made the search; he was taken up on the Thursday. There were two women in the house; I was ordered to go to Mr. Wilmot's, and look at the prisoner; I did, and I said he was one of the men that robbed me.</p>
               <p>How many people were in the room at the Justice's when you went in? - Six or seven. I knew him immediately.</p>
               <p>You got none of your things again but the sack? - No; there were some earthen plates at the Justice's, which the prisoner said came out of my cart; he wanted to be admitted an evidence.</p>
               <p>From the Jury. How long was you detained on the road before they let you go? - I believe a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Did no carriages pass you? - No; it was out of the main road beyond the church.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Did Lee say any thing to you about there being 40 l. reward? - No; he said nothing to me about it.</p>
               <p>Had the prisoner a round hat on when he robbed you? - I cannot say; I could not distinguish his cloaths, only the make of the man; he was stouter than the other two.</p>
               <p>And that is all the reason you have to know him? - By the glimpse of his face, and his changing so many words with me.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect one Wale or Wade, or any body pointing this man out to you? - Nobody pointed him out; I found him out myself.</p>

               <p>the 22d of January last, I believe it was, our house was broke open; it was done about one in the morning; I locked the doors that night myself; I heard the watch cry all the hours, and every half hour, except the hour one, and half past three; from thence I conclude that this fact was committed about one, or half past three; I got up at about seven in the morning to let my husband out, who is a military man; I did not perceive but that the lower part of the house was in the same situation I had left it in the preceding evening, for the persons that had stole the things had got in at the one pair of stairs window; I had at eleven o'clock the preceding night put a quantity of linen on the lines to dry, in the one pair of stairs room; I went to look for this linen at about eleven in the morning; then I for the first time perceived that the linen was gone, and the sashes were thrown up; I am certain I had put down those sashes the preceding evening; I had come out of the room without putting the shutters to, and I returned afterwards and shut them, but without fastening, and I am well assured that the windows were down. I missed all the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) they were, together, of the value of 5 l. the prisoners were taken on the Monday three weeks afterwards, and were carried before Justice Welch; a great quantity of linen was found in their lodgings. Having information of their being taken up, I went to the Justice's; I saw there a couple of neckcloths of mine, which were found in the prisoners lodgings.</p>

            , which house was taken care<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177802180040"/> of by a Mrs. Robinson, the prisoner came into my chamber; he locked the door, and sat himself down in a chair, and said, he was come to do my business, or to some such purport; I then asked him to let me get out of bed, and I did rise; then he took two pistols out of his pocket, one larger than the other; he returned the larger one into his pocket again; I went towards the door with a view to open it, and to get out; he stood with his back to the door; I asked him to go out, and eat some breakfast with me; he answered, he would have no breakfast, he would give me a good one. I then called out very loud to Mrs. Robinson, that the man had a pistol; upon this, the prisoner pulled off his great coat, and I saw him cock the pistol which he held in his right-hand; I went towards my bed, and said, pray don't kill me, and I bid him put away his pistol, for that if any one saw it he would be hanged; I drew up as close to the curtain as I could; the prisoner then stood at about the distance that the counsel is from me (about two yards); he ran up towards me, and fired the pistol which he held in his right-hand at me; I fell against the wainscot; I was sensible of the stroke of the ball; the prisoner threw himself across the bed, and I heard another pistol go off, but I did not see the second pistol in his hand. Upon this, the washer-woman came up, and broke the lower pannel of the door of the bed-chamber, and dragged me out through the hole; the prisoner followed me through the same hole, and then went out.</p>

               <p>I live in Mr. Draper's house. Between ten and eleven in the morning of the day the pistol went off, the prisoner came up the garret stairs; I was upon the landing-place; he enquired of me for some person, but I did not rightly understand the name; I said I did not know the person, but Mrs. Robinson was below in the two pair of stair's room; the prisoner went down stairs again, as I believe, to Mrs. Robinson; but I saw no more of the prisoner; but I heard Mrs. Robinson in three or four minutes call to me, that there was a man about to murder the lady, and she desired me to call the washer-woman; I went down, and did so; I came up stairs again, and heard two pistols go off; in going down stairs I met Mrs. Robinson running up; she said the man had murdered the lady; then I came down stairs, and saw Mrs. Knightley standing at the door; her breast was naked, and the blood was running down, and I helped her to a chair.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I have the care of Mrs. Draper's house; I was in the fore-room of Mrs. Knightley's apartments, between ten and eleven in the forenoon, on the Queen's birth-day, the 18th of January; the prisoner came into this fore-room; I asked him what he wanted? he asked for some person; he mentioned a name; I told him that no such person lived there; he then ran to Mrs. Knightley's bedchamber door; he went into the room, and I heard the key turn; I tried to open it, but found the door fast; I called to the prisoner to open it; he answered, that he would not, for that she was his wife; Mrs. Knightley cried out, that it was no such thing; I said, that if she was his wife he should not be there; Mrs. Knightley again said, she was not his wife; I heard many other words between them, which I did not understand; I said, if he did not come out of the room, I would call Mr. Robinson; Mrs. Knightley desired me to call him, and said you know what I mean.</p>
               <p>What did you understand by that? - She afterwards said she meant a constable. I desired him to open the door, or I would alarm the house; he gave no answer. Mrs. Knightley cried out, Christ Jesus, he has got a pistol! I went to the window and cried out, fire, murder, thieves, to alarm the street. I went up stairs to call some one, and heard the report of a pistol; the chairwoman broke the pannel of the door, and called to me to run after the prisoner. As I was coming from the garret, I saw Mrs. Knightley at the door of the fore-room, upon the landing place; she said, see how the villain has murdered me; she opened her handkerchief, and the blood was running down. I had never seen the prisoner at the house before; I had never seen him before any where to the best of my knowledge; I have lived in this house near a year and half; Mrs. Knightley<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177802180041"/> has been there somewhere about three months.</p>
               <p>Mr. WILLIAMS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon; I was called on the 18th of January last, between eleven and twelve o'clock, to see Mrs. Knightley; I have attended her ever since; I found her sitting in a chair with a wound on her breast; the wound was through the breast-bone; it appeared to me to be a gun-shot wound; it had something of a burnt appearance; at first, I thought she was in danger; she is now recovering; here is the ball I extracted (producing it.)</p>
               <p>Court. The degree of the wound is totally immaterial; the offence by this Act of Parliament is maliciously shooting at any one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Williams. The ball passed through the cavity of the thorax, and lodged about eight inches distant in the side; I apprehend it missed the lungs; the ball passed in at the left-side into her right, at the distance of about eight inches, and lodged in the integuments; I made an incision upon the part where the ball lodged, and extracted it.</p>
               <p>Does any of the linen or wadding remain now in the wound? - There was a little piece of linen I took out after I had enlarged the wound.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Cross is the landlady of the house where I lived ten months before with this lady (Mrs. Knightley); she can speak for the lady, and for me too. This lady, after living with me ten months, and had promised me marriage, removed from this Mrs. Cross's house to Mrs. Robinson's, and cohabited with a Jew, a Mr. Leverman; he is an artificial flower-maker; she removed her lodgings, and cohabited with a Jew, because the master this Jew worked for would not let him be in Mrs. Cross's house; so the Jew took that lodging at Mrs. Robinson's, and I followed her there, and she even the day before promised me matrimony, and promised me a sum of money, that she always told me she had; she succoured me with money at many times; I went with an intent to kill myself before her, and not to kill her; I appeal to her myself, whether I did not go with an intent to shoot myself.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutrix. What do you say to that? - I do not know what he meant to do, but he shot me with a pistol.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any reason to believe that what he suggests is truth, that he came with intent to kill himself? - I do not know whether he might, or might not, with the other pistol.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Three nights before this happened, I attempted before her to shoot myself, and hit my head against the wainscot; and she asked me if I was mad.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you seen him three nights before? - He did not come three days before as he says; it was a fortnight.</p>

               <p>I am a German; I am very sorry to say any thing; the prisoner and the gentlewoman lodged in my house both together, and very happy, I believe; they came there in the beginning of last summer; they staid there till a month before this unhappy affair happened; but she spoke to the prisoner in my house but two days before this affair happened; she called several times.</p>

               <p>Court. Mrs. Robinson speaks of her being at her house three months.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Robinson. She came the fortnight before Christmas.</p>
               <p>Cross. She left him in my house with me; he was exceedingly fond of her, till she wanted to get shot of him; she did not like to stay with him any more; they behaved very quiet both of them; she then told me that she was not his wife; but before that, she had the receipts given her in the name of Mrs. White, which she said she did that her relations should not know she was married to a foreigner; it was after she went from my house that she told me she was not married to the man; before she went, I understood that she was; and they both lived very happy together; she called upon him several times, and two days before this accident happened; she called upon him the Friday before this happened upon the Sunday; I had much trouble with him, for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177802180042"/> he said he would hang himself, would kill himself, or would shoot himself; so I made him leave my house, because I was frightened. On a Friday, two days before this happened, both this gentlewoman and he came together to my house, and he told her he would buy, or had bought, pistols, or something of that sort; and he would go into her lodgings and shoot himself in her presence, and if one pistol would not do, he would have another, and he would lay his dead bones on her side; and the gentlewoman was very angry that he should be so foolish; he said he could not live without her, for he would kill himself; and I told him he was a fool, and he should not come any more into the house.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prosecutrix. This woman says, that you and the prisoner came together to her house on the Friday preceding the day on which this happened? - That is not true.</p>
               <p>Was you at Mrs. Cross's house the Friday before this happened? - No; it was on the Saturday week before this happened; the prisoner told me, Mrs. Cross wanted to speak to me; I saw him in the street; I went to Mrs. Cross's that same day about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner with you? - No; I came just by the door, and saw him coming up the street towards me.</p>
               <p>What happened? Did he talk about shooting you? - No; he never mentioned a word,</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear him say then, or at any other time, that he would come and shoot himself, and die by your side? - He told me about ten days before, that he would come and shoot himself, and me first; I met him then accidentally; he did not say any such thing at Mrs. Cross's house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have no other witnesses here; but I could prove what Mrs. Cross has asserted by twenty people.</p>

               <p>I was constable of the night, and watch-house keeper of Clerkenwell; there was a riot on Sunday night the 8th, in Allan-street, before Foster's, which is a horse-flesh yard; the watchman and one of these young men came to the watch-house; we went and brought Faucett and another man down to the watch-house; when they had been at the watch-house about a quarter of an hour, Gostick, the patrole of Goswell-street, came down to the watch-house, and asked if the young man was there who had lost a horse; I told him he was; he said it came out of the yard, and was gone to the turnpike; we went, and found the horse at Goswell-street turnpike; and then went to Allan-street, and searched Foster's yard, and found a bridle in a loft over the stables where they kill the horses.</p>
               <p>[The bridle was produced in Court, and deposed to by Holmes.]</p>

               <p>I am coachman to a gentleman. I saw the prisoner on the 20th of January; he was dressed in a thickset frock with a red cape, but I don't know whether there was any lace upon it; and, I believe, he had on a thickset waistcoat and boots; it was between three and four in the evening, as near as I can recollect; the cloaths he used to wear were like those produced, but I cannot positively swear to them; I asked him, if he was gone to his place, as he had told me he had got a new place; he said, Yes; groom to a single gentleman who was going soon to Bath; I asked him, if he had heard what had happened at Chiswick; he said, No, and asked me what had happened there? I told him Foubister was robbed, and Susan almost murdered; I said, as he had lately come from the family, he would most likely be suspected.</p>
               <p>From the Jury. Did you observe any alteration in his countenance at that time? - I cannot say that I did; I asked him to go with me to Lady Morton's, and let them know he was in place, and then he would be clear of suspicion; he said, he would go with me at any time; I was just come in with my carriage; I got a young man to help me to take the horses out, that we might go directly to Lady Morton's; the prisoner desired me to go into a public-house, and call for a pint of beer, while he went to deliver a message in Bond-street, which was just by, and he would come to me; I went, and had a pint of beer, and waited for him ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour, but he never came.</p>

               <p>I attend at Sir John Fielding's office; Mr. Bond and I went in pursuit of the prisoner, on the 21st of January; I enquired at several inns to see if I could trace his going off into the country; I had a description of his person; at about ten at night, on Wednesday the 21st, I heard at the Bull and Mouth-Inn, that such a man had gone on the outside of the Worcester coach on the night before (Tuesday night.) Mr. Bond and I set off at about eleven o'clock that night; we got to Oxford at about six in the morning; we waited for the book-keeper getting up, and then enquired whether he had gone any further; the book-keeper told us such a person was gone into Worcester; we went into Worcester; we got there at about six o'clock on Thursday night; we staid there till about four o'clock on Friday; when we found that the prisoner had hired a horse to go to Ludlow, we traced him from Worcester to Ludlow, from Ludlow to Bishop's-Castle, and from thence to Montgomery, where he had changed his horse; at about seven in the morning I found him at his mother's house at Kellhull; on Saturday morning at about seven o'clock I rode up to the door, got off my horse, and ran into the house; I met his mother; I asked where her son Tom was? she said he was in bed; I went into the room where he was, and said Tom, you must get up; he said,</p>
               <p>"O Lord! O Lord! have mercy upon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177802180049"/> me;" he got out of bed directly; I asked him where the things were that he had stole?</p>
               <p>From the Jury. Did he make that exclamation before you accused him? - Yes; I had been informed, that he had a saddle-bag; I asked where it was? he said it was not there; in searching about the room, I found a little closet under the stairs; there I found the saddle-bags; I opened them, and found that some of the things in the bags tallied with those that were described to me as lost; I then told him he might as well tell me where the money was, for that there was evidence enough against him, or I would not ask him to take any advantage of him in any shape, and it was no use to keep it from the poor man; he asked me whether the man would have it again, if I found it? I told him he would; the prisoner then told me it was in a purse in the cupboard in the other room; I found there thirty-six guineas; I never saw a prisoner behave so well as he did in my life; I brought him to London with the things I found there; I believe there is every thing that was lost, except twelve guineas; this shirt (producing it) he had on, and the laced hat hung upon a nail in the room; he put it on to come to London.</p>

On the 18th, I think it was of October, the last day of the sessions (it was very late at night before the sessions ended) I had engaged to go to Mrs. Reynolds at Richmond, supposing the sessions would finish early; I ran to Goldsmith's-hall; my carriage was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177802180050"/> waiting for me; I did then as I commonly do, put my keys, money, and rings in an inner closet; I put this ring on an upper-shelf in the corner of the closet; I returned to town on Tuesday morning; when I went up to dinner, I saw this closet door open; I asked the meaning of it? Mrs. Reynolds said, the closet had not been cleaned out a long time, and she had employed this woman (the prisoner) to clean it, and that she had removed all the papers and things into a drawer; I turned over the papers, but could not find the ring; I called up the prisoner, and asked her what she had done with my ring which she had taken off the top shelf; she denied knowing any thing of it; I enquired of my other servant in town; then I went down to Richmond, and enquired if the servants had seen any thing of it there, or if it had been dropped in the chariot, but could hear nothing of it. On this day was three weeks, as I was going to the play, a young man came to Goldsmith's-hall to see if there was any notice left there of a ring being lost; I told him I had lost one myself; I described it to him; he said, a woman had left such a ring, and was to call again in the afternoon. I desired him to stop the person that brought it; in consequence of which, the prisoner was stopped.</p>

On the Wednesday I found the prisoner on his coach-box; I asked him where he drove the fare to on Saturday afternoon, he said to Temple-bar; I asked him if he did not drive a fare to Hoxton-square; he said yes, he drove two ladies there; he admitted he had the bundle, and said the person should have it; he went to his father, who was at a stand of coaches, and had some conversation with him; then he took the glass of the coach out which had been broke, and said he would go and fetch the bundle; he went away; I waited a great while, till I heard there was a bustle at a pawnbroker's, and the prisoner was stopped offering the things to pawn.</p>
