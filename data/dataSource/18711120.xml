I hereby acknowledge that I have, whilst in your employ as traveller, appropriated various sums of money belonging to you, amounting to upwards of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I had col<lb/>lected on your behalf, and I hereby further acknowledge that I was not driven to commit this fraud by being inadequately paid, as I was in receipt of a salary of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and all expenses, not exceeding one guinea a day, and I hereby authorise and empower you to publish this acknowledgment of my guilt, and to use the same in any manner you may think proper so to do; at the same time I beg to acknowledge your kindness in not prosecuting out of consideration to my wife and family, Charles Nutley.")—On consent<lb/>ing to forego the prosecution the prisoner signed that statement—his ser<lb/>vice then ceased with us—some time afterwards I heard that he was spreading reports about our firm, and I had that statement printed, and sent copies to various customers—he still continued to annoy us, and in 1861 I instituted proceedings against him at the Greenwich Police Court, and he then entered into an undertaking not to molest us, which was in these terms—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "I beg to express my sincere regret for the annoyance to which I have subjected you by the publication of certain scurrilous and libellous placards, letters, &amp;c., and for which you have commenced a criminal prosecution against me; I now confess that my statements in those publications reflecting on your character are entirely false and without foundation, and hereby retract and publicly apologise for the same, and I authorise you to publish this if you think proper to do so. Charles Nutley, April 1st, 1861.")—In consideration of that being given I was willing to stay any further criminal proceedings, and I did so—after that He entered the employ of Messrs. Cross &amp; Gordon—he remained' some little time there, and afterwards I was not molested for three or four years—since that time I have received, I should think, between fifty and sixty post-cards, all of a similar character to these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—before he was sum<lb/>moned before the Magistrate at Greenwich his house was placarded from top to bottom with documents of a similar character—these are some of the cards I received—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Sept, 1871, James and Isaac Batten, 126, Lower Thames Street, London, E.C. Your books will prove you to be two of the greatest liars, rogues, and villains in the universe;" "I Charles Nutley, having made for you a lucrative trade of nearly 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, do hereby call on you to pay for the injuries you have inflicted on me, for which the sum of 50,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be an inadequate compensation, caused by your printed circulation amongst my former business connections and friends, wherein you have falsely accused me of embezzling 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of your money, and accused me of the same in courts of law, whereas your books, which have not been examined in courts of law, contain a debtor and creditor account between us created by your not having paid me my salary, and entered all moneys to my account at the expiration of my two months' journey, crediting my account with the sum of 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. twice charged, 56<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., of my salary, and some journey expenses, which more than cover your advertised balance, to which you made no application to my guarantee for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

How recently have you again attempted to cause my ruin for life by this false accusation?" "Inquire of a Magistrate what you can do with a family you have utterly ruined by falsehoods.

Withdraw your scandalous printed false-hoods in circulation against me. You have robbed me of my home and all our clothing by falsehoods. Produce a just statement of my accounts, as any honest man would do, Charles Nutley. You had better have taken my life at once with a hatchet, or anything else, than starve my family to death by falsehoods."</p>

                  </hi>. I was an able seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Star of Peace</hi>, which left Melbourne at the latter end of last July—I shipped at Melbourne to come home—one night, about a month after, while off Cape Horn (I don't remember the date) the captain (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>) sang out to shake a reef out of the mizen topsail—I was on the deck-watch that night—I had come on at 8 o'clock, and our watch would be over at 12 o'clock—there were six or seven of us in a watch—I was in the closet at the time, but I don't think I was two minutes after the men got on the poop—I came aft just as the men got on the topsail halyards—the captain said "Evans, what is keeping you last?"—he did not speak too slow, and he did not speak too high—I said "My God, do you want me to fly"—he said "For the future I will keep my eyes upon you"—says I "All you can do to keep your eyes upon me"—he then sang out for the mainsail to be loosed—I went up the rigging to loose it—others went up with me—there were two to each side—I got half-way up the main-rigging, and the captain sang out to the second mate "You send that fellow up"—I sang out "I am up"—directly I got on the main-yard I loosed the sail, and I came on the midships of the yard and sang out to those below for the bunt-line to be let go—the captain said "If you don't shut up I will fix you"—the boatswain said the bunt<lb/>line was all gone—I took another pull on it, and could not get it, it was still <hi rend="italic">taut</hi>, and I sang out again, and it was then loosed—I did all that was wanted, and came down, and went on the poop to the captain, and said "What is the meaning of your trying to shut my mouth up when I am singing out for a rope to be let go"—he said "I will let you know I am half owner of the ship," And he mentioned something else about a superior ship, or a Government ship—I said "That's nothing, if you were full owner that does not say that you are going to stop my mouth"—he said "You are a blackguard"—I said "Well, you will be the means of making me one"—says he "Get off my poop," And as I was going down he said "Here, here, stop there," And then he sang out for the boatswain to fetch the irons out—when he said "Get off my poop," I said "Perhaps it is only very lately that you have had a poop"—the boatswain brought the irons aft, and gave them to the captain to put them on me—I told the captain I would not allow him to put them on me—he said "Who will you allow to put them on"—I said "I will allow the boatswain," And the boatswain did put them on—the captain then said, pointing up the mizen-rigging, "Now up there you will go"—I said "I will lose my hands, if you put me up there"—it was about 10.15 or 10.30 at night; the wind was dying away, and it was a regular sharp, cold night, the moon was bright—I told him I would not allow him to put me up there; with that he stamped his foot, and <hi rend="italic">crunched</hi> his teeth at me, and said "You will have to go," And he got hold of me round the body, and pulled my shirt outside my trousers, and tore my shirt, and I held my hands with the irons on them like that, and shoved him, and he fell down—I told him I was willing to be put in any place except being triced up in the rigging—he said "You will have to go"—the boatswain said to me "Well, Evans, it is best to go on quietly, you will not be stopped up there long"—then I went—I went to the starboard side of the mizen-rigging, and they triced me up there—my two hands were</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187111200013"/>
               <p>triced up like that above my head; I had to lay my head on my arm so; I could not sit down, my breast was up against the rigging—there was a piece of rattling-line in the middle of the handcuffs—the boatswain fetched that—I had my feet on the deck—I could not sit down or incline; if the ship rolled, I had to roll with her—I was kept for two hours in that position; it was 10.15, and when I got down in the after-cabin it had just gone four bells, 2 o'clock—I could not account for the time, because I was in such agony with the cold—I was there when the next watch came up—when the captain fell I did not fall also—just as I shored him I fell up against the poop-rail—I did not fall on him—I did not fall on the deck—all this took place on the break of the poop—the men came aft, but I know nothing about that, only I heard them growling at the captain—I heard someone come aft, and put a screw of tobacco in my pocket, and one in my mouth, and said "You will not have to wait long there, the captain has found a place for you?"—when I was loosed I was taken down to the sail-room, and was kept there till 2.30 next Sunday afternoon—I had the irons on all that time, and for a fortnight after—the carpenter and cook cleared out from where they lived, and went forward in the forecastle, and I was put there; it was a deck-house; it was fitted up as a prison for me—I was kept there eight weeks and two days, till the vessel arrived in the port of London—I was kept in irons day and night for fourteen days—after that the irons were taken off during the day, and put on at night—during all the time I was in the deck-house I made no effort to break out or escape; it was no use—I am not sure of the day of the month that we arrived in the port of London; it was on a Saturday—I had the irons on as usual, from 5 o'clock in the evening till 9.30 next morning—I was shut up in the same place on the Sunday—I had the irons off till 6 o'clock, and then I was kept there with them till they were taken off by the officer, on the Monday afternoon, when I was taken away by a warrant-officer, and taken before Mr. Paget—I was convicted, and sentenced to one day's imprisonment.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SEYMOUR</hi>. I was put to steering the ship about a week after we left Melbourne—I said I could steer—I could do it, but I had the headache, I was sick; they would not allow me the wheel any more—the captain said I could not do it—that was about two or three weeks before I was put in irons—I did not say to a seaman named Man<lb/>hood "The b——, (referring to the captain) said I could not steer; I have a good mind to go aft and do for the Scotch son of a bitch"—I don't think I spoke over a dozen words to that man—I did not say to him "If you were of the same mind as I am, you would go after the Scotch b——now;" nothing of the kind—I never said in Manhood's hearing that I would do for the captain—I never uttered any threat against the captain before the night that I was put in irons—I never said that if the captain ever said anything to me there would be a row—I never said so to James Brufort—I never said that if two or three would join me I would make a different ship of it, nor anything to that effect—three or four days before I was put in irons I had a dispute with a man named Miller—I got a belaying-pin to frighten him—I did not strike him with it—I hit him with my fist first; I and then, to frighten him, I struck the side of his bunk with the belaying-pin—I did not strike him on the body several times, nor try to do so, or threaten him—I had been in prison, in the hulks, for fourteen days, before I left Melbourne; that was for knocking off duty; that was the only time I was in prison—I was in Calcutta for four hours, for being drunk, that was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187111200014"/>
               <p>a few months before—I had left the hulks just before I joined this ship—I was four weeks ashore—I had not been sent there for following the mate of my previous ship with an open knife—I did not tell Manhood and Shields so—I was imprisoned for knocking off duty—there was no charge of threat<lb/>ening personal violence to anyone—on the night in question I sang out as loud as I could to let go the port bunt-line—I sang out bard enough to let them know below—I did not shout out louder than was necessary—when I sang out the second time I shouted at the pitch of my voice; not louder than I need have done—there were two boys and me and another man at the starboard side of the yard—the men I sang out to were about as far from me as this man (<hi rend="italic">the foreman of the Jury</hi>)—the captain did not tell me not to call out so loud; he never spoke—he did not tell me to shut up; he said he would fix me—he said "If you don't shut up I will fix you"—I might have said "I will not"—I don't remember saying it—I had no busi<lb/>ness on the poop at the time I went to the captain—I went to ask him why he told me to shut up when I was singing out for a rope to be let go—he said I was not to let him catch me again on the forecastle—I told him I was not in the forecastle—I did not say to the captain "I will give you a better chance to fix me yet"—I did not say so in Brufort's presence—I did not raise my arm, threatening to strike the captain—I went up to him with my arms folded, so—I called him an old woman, not an old wh—,—, or a son of a bitch—I told him to p—up his leg; that was when I was up the rigging—I shouted that from the rigging—I did not at the same time shake my fist in his face, and say that I would rip his puddings up and do for him—I was ten minutes on the poop, and my knife in my pocket at the time, and if I had had any ill-feeling towards the captain—it was not after I had called him an old woman that he sang out for the boatswain—he told me to get off his poop—I know Joe Senna, he was examined before the Magistrate—it is not true that after I called the captain an old wh——, he called the boatswain to bring the irons, and said "You beat all the men I ever saw"—I did not tell the captain before I was put in irons that I was only waiting for the fine weather to do for him—he did not say "If you don't keep quiet you will compel me to put you in irons"—he said he would let me know he was half-owner, and he would 'put me where I could not see him—after the irons were put on me, I shoved at him to stop him from tricing me up in the rigging; not several times; twice; it is not true that he fell undermost and I on him, on the deck—I did not fall at all; the captain fell himself—I did not fall on him—I know the second-mate, he attended to me during his watch, when I wanted to go to the closet—he did not take off one of my irons a day or two after<lb/>wards, nor did I point towards the captain, and say "I should like to shoot the b——"—I did not use any expression of that kind—after I had been three days and a half on bread and water, the steward brought me some coffee and biscuits; it was not the morning after I was confined—I did not say to him "Take your b——coffee, you d—son of a bitch;" I was too glad of it—I did not, that same afternoon, while I was being removed across the deck, turn round and shake my fist at the captain, and say I would do for him yet—I said "You will pay for this"—I did not shake my fist at him; I was in irons when I came out of the cabin—I did not say I did not care to be put in irons, and that I would go home as a pas<lb/>senger—I was twice offered to go out and walk about the deck—I did not refuse to go—I went outside the door, but the boatswain and mate were</p>

               <p>out there with a big bur, ready to hit me with it—I went so far as the door—I refused to go further than the door—on one occasion I threw my soup about the place—I refused to clear up the mess when I was told to do it—I did not threaten the mate with violence—I said "You have been torturing me in my grub all the time"—he said "Me! you are a pretty b——"—I said "Perhaps I am as good as you," And with that he swung the door in my face, and I never saw him till next morning, when I got my bread and water—I did not say I would do for him yet, as well as the captain, nothing of the kind—some beef was brought to me one day and I said I preferred bread and water, when I saw what grub it was—I was not told it was beef that all the crew were eating—my grub was brought to me about an hour after all the rest had had their meals; and it was not fit for a pig to eat, let alone a Christian—I persisted in taking bread and water for fifteen days—I told the mate I was quite content with that, before I would eat such grub as that; it was as black as ink—it was not the same that they got forward; I don't know that it was, I was locked up at the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There was soap in the soup that I threw down; there were two pieces of soap in it, a little piece and a big piece—I got a piece in my mouth, and I threw it down at the door in a passion—there was nobody in this place on deck but myself; it was solitary confinement—I did not hurt Miller with the belaying-pin; I struck the side of the bunk—he did not complain of my hurting him; he was in the watch that was to have relieved oars, and until he turned out I could not turn in—I went down, and called the watch—I struck him with my fist, but not with the iron—I struck him because he told me to ax his—there was no complaint made about it—I was ten minutes on the poop with the captain, and had my knife in my pocket, I did not threaten him in any way, I could have killed him in less than ten minutes, if I had wished, there was only him<lb/>self there, and the man at the wheel.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Star of Peace</hi>, a British ship, sailing under the English flag—I joined at Melbourne for the homeward voyage—I was in the same watch with Evans—on the night of 26th August I went to the wheel from 10 to 12 o'clock—about 10.15 the captain, who was on the poop, ordered a reef to be taken out of the mizen topsail—all the men came aft—Evans was the last—the captain said to him "Why are you always the last man coming to your work when you are called?"—Evans said Why, what do you want me to do, to fly?"—the captain said "No, I want you to come to your work when you are called"—Evans did what he was called for, and the captain afterwards gave orders to loose the mainsail—Evans went up the rigging to loose it—after he got up in the main-yard he loosed the sail, and sang out "Let go the main bunt-line, and then he sang out a second time rather loud—the captain said if he did not shut up he would have punishment for it—Evans said to the captain "Why don't you do what you mean, not always nagging and growling"—he then came down from the mainyard, and went on to the poop where the captain was standing—I was at the wheel all the time—he stood before him, and said "Well, captain, why don't you do what you mean, not always growl<lb/>ing, anything you want to do, fighting, or anything; I have been waiting for the fine weather to come, so I will have a talk to you"—the captain told him to go off his poop, he did not want to have anything to do with him—Evans said "It is lately since you had a poop of your own"—the captain said "You beat all the men I ever saw" And he ordered him off the</p>

               <p>poop again—Evans began to use very insulting language; he told the cap<lb/>tain to go and p—up his leg, and play with the smoke, and called him a wh——, the captain then called the boatswain, and told him to fetch the handcuffs, and put him in irons—the boatswain brought them, and at first he refused to be ironed—the captain said "If he don't let you, I will put him in irons myself"—Evans said "No, I won't let an old son of a bitch put me in irons, I will let the boatswain put me in irons," And he did so—they were iron handcuffs—the captain then ordered the boatswain to trice him up in the rigging, two rattlin lines above the rail—the boatswain went to fetch a piece of rattlin line, and put it on the handcuffs—Evans refused to go in the rigging, so the captain said he would take him in the rigging himself, and he went to catch hold of him, and with his two hands Evans shoved the captain, and they both fell on the deck—I can't say who was uppermost—the boatswain and the second-mate came, and helped both of them up, and then the boatswain took him, and triced him up to the rigging—the line was fastened to one of the shrouds of the rigging, and his hands were like that (<hi rend="italic">above his head</hi>)—he was fastened, and left there—the night was fine, very little wind, but the air was very cold, it was freezing—I re<lb/>mained at the wheel two hours and ten minutes—the other watch relieved me about 12.10—the two watches then came aft together—I came aft myself after I had been relieved—the mate asked what was the matter, so we told him, and he called the captain up in his shirt sleeves—we told the captain that we wanted the man off the rigging—he said "What do you mean, do you want him out of the irons altogether?"—we said no, we wanted to take him off the rigging because the weather was unfit to keep a man fastened to the rigging like that—he said he should not take him off the rigging before he found a place to put him in—we asked him to take him off because it was not right to keep a man in such cold weather—he said "Well, if you like to see him off the rigging, I will take him off, and put him in the cabin"—he then gave the mate orders to take him down from the rigging, and to place him in a cabin, which was done—that was about 12.30 or 12.45, as near as I could judge—I don't know what time he was taken off the rigging, because as soon as we heard the captain give the mate orders to take him off we went forwards, and went below—next day he was put in the carpenter's house; that was a place where the car<lb/>penter and the cook had lived; they used to sleep there—he remained there all the rest of the voyage, till we got to London—for the first few days he used to get bread and water—I don't know for how many days—the door used to be looked, and there was a piece of wood across the door, fitting in with rings and a padlock—I never saw him outside taking exer<lb/>cise, to my knowledge; I saw him come out to go to the closet—I never heard him violent in any way while he was confined in the deck house—I did not see him do anything, or attempt to break out—we were supposed to have twelve or fourteen able seamen, and a couple of ordinary seamen in our forecastle; there were seven able seamen to each watch—after the bread and water I sometimes saw the food he got, not very often—I never took much interest in it—I saw him get coffee and bread when it was bread day, and pea soup and meat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He got the same food as the rest of the crew—I never attended upon him—I heard him sing out to let go the bunt-line—he sang out rather loud, not in the usual way—the captain told him not to call out—I don't know whether the captain did right in reprimanding him for</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187111200017"/>
               <p>it, perhaps he did not like to hear him sing out loud; some men might, perhaps, like to hear them sing out loud—when he first came up on the poop I was looking at him; I could not be always looking at him, because I had to steer the ship, and watch the compass—I could hear everything that was said, but I could not look at everything—I did not see whether or not he raised his hand as he approached the captain—I heard the cap<lb/>tain say that he wanted to have nothing to do with him, and that he had better go off the poop—he said "Go off my poop"—Evans said he had very lately had a poop, and the captain then said "If you don't go off the poop I will put you in irons"—he did not go then—he called the captain an old wh—, and used other language—one day before this when we had rather too much work to do I heard Evans say "I try to go along quiet in his ship, but I see I can't do it, being humbugged like this; I will kick up a row, and get put in irons, and go home as a passenger"—he told me that he had been sent to the hulks at Melbourne for chasing the mate of a ship round the deck with a knife; he did not tell me alone, he told all the watch on the forecastle—he said he was there eight weeks—I never sailed with the captain before this—I sailed with him from Melbourne to London, two months and twenty-five days—I have no complaint to make against him—I don't know about another man—he always treated me well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It was about two or three weeks after we left Melbourne that Evans told us about chasing the mate with a knife—I did not mention it to the captain; it was not my way to tell anything I heard—he did not say what he meant by humbugging on board this ship—sailors are always saying something when there is too much work to do, or when the weather is bad—it was bad weather when he said this, rough, and blowing.</p>

I was an able seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Star of Peace</hi> on the voyage from Melbourne—Evans was a shipmate—two or three days after leaving Melbourne he was at the wheel—the captain told the second<lb/>mate to send him aft—Evans came aft, and the captain asked him what was the matter with him, and he told the captian he was sick—the captain said he was nothing but a d—<hi rend="italic">loafer</hi>, and it would be best for him to go about his duty—I heard Evans say "You can do it as soon as you like"—on the night of 26th August I was in Evans' watch—I was one of the men called to reef the topsail—I was in the forecastle with Evans at the time, we went aft together—we were the two last—I was before Evans, he was just behind me—the captain said to Evans "You are last again, you are always last"—Evans said "Do you want me to fly?"—the captain said "No, I expect you to be here with the rest of the crew"—the captain told the second mate to loose the mainsail—Evans went up aloft—when he got up he sang out "Let go the bunt-line" In rather a loud tone—the captain told him to shut up—the second mate went toward the bunt-line and sang out it was all gone—Evans told the captain he should not shut up when there was anything to be done aloft—the captain said "I will fix you," And Evans said "I will give you a better chance of fixing me than this"—after the mainsail was let go, Evans came down and went on the poop to the captain and said "Fix me now, as you talk so much about fixing me"—the captain called him a d—blackguard—Evans used very abusive language to the captain, and the captain told him he would put him in irons, and called the boatswain to fetch the irons—the boatswain went—Evans was abusive to the captain—the captain was going to help the boatswain put the irons on Evans—and he said "I won't allow you to put the irons on, I will</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187111200020"/>
               <p>let the boatswain," And then the boatswain put them on—the captain said he would seize Evans up to the rigging—Evans said "No you won't,"—Evans was then standing quietly on the poop—the captain said "I will," and Evans said "What, would you seize a sick man up to the rigging?"—the captain sent the boatswain for a piece of rattlin line, and when he brought it, the captain went to take hold of Evans and Evans up with his hands and struck the captain, and they both fell on the deck—Evans was uppermost; after that the boatswain was ordered to trice him up to the rigging, and he was triced up—his hands were placed about six inches above his head—it was a cold frosty night—Evans was tied up there about an hour—I was there when the next watch came to relieve us, and I asked the next watch to go aft and ask the captain to take Evans out of irons—Evans was standing quietly up against the rigging at the time, saying nothing—he had his head down—all hands went aft and told the mate that we wanted the man out of the rigging, and we did not intend to do any more work in the ship until he was out—the mate went down and called the captain—the captain came up, and I told the captain I did not consider it a fit place for a man to be in the rigging such weather as that was, and if he wanted to punish the man he was to leave it for the law to do—the captain said he was perfectly aware of that, he would take the responsibility on his own head, all we had to do was to look after ourselves and not trouble our heads about him—we still refused to do any more duty, and the captain said he would take him out of the rigging—I was not there when he was released, it was my watch below then—it was about 1.45 when I left the deck—he was still in the rigging when I left the deck—I know that he was afterwards released and put in the carpenter's house—during the time he was in the deck house I never heard him use any threats or make any attempt to get away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He could not very well create a disturbance when he was in there—I did not attend to him—when he went on the poop I was below it, about 8 ft.—I could not see all that passed—I did not see him put himself in a threatening attitude to the captain—I did not see when he did, but I heard—I heard the captain say that he would keep him in the rigging until he got a place ready for him—I did not hear him say "If you don't go off the poop I will put you in irons"—there were several remarks between his speaking of the irons and the irons being brought—the man was still standing on the poop, and using abusive language to the captain—I know a man named Miller who was on board—I saw Evans strike Miller with a belaying-pin—I don't know whether it struck him; it caught on the edge of the bunk—it is true that I said "I saw him fetch an iron belaying-pin, and strike Miller with it twice on the body"—one blow indented the bunk—that was two or three days before—it was either on the morning of the 26th, or the day before—I heard Evans say if the captain ever said anything to him he would have a row—when Evans was called away from the helm he said "You can do it as soon as you like"—I did not hear the captain say to Evans that if he did not reform his ways that he would oblige him to punish him—all I understood was that the captain would punish him in some way or the other; what the language was I did not get hold of—the captain said he would punish him for his neglect of duty, and Evans said "You can do it as soon as you like."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Miller had to relieve Evans on the watch, and Evans went down to arouse, him—Miller used abusive language to him, and Evans</p>

               <p>pitched into him—he did not hurt him at all—he struck the bunk with the iron belaying-pin, but I thought it was more to frighten him than anything—Miller got up out of his bunk directly after that, and relieved him—I was close to the poop when I heard the conversation between Evans and the captain—I could see on the poop—I did not see any threatening attitude on the part of Evans to the captain.</p>

I was an able seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Star of Peace</hi>—I joined at Melbourne on the night of 26th August—I had to go on the watch at 12 o'clock, and when I came on deck I found Evans tied to the rigging—he could just touch the deck with his toes, and was tied up in the starboard mizen rigging—he was in a poor condition, crying with cold and pain—I was one of the men that went aft to remonstrate—I asked the captain what he was going to do with the man—he said "He will have to remain until to-morrow, when I find a place for him"—the captain had him sent down below afterwards—during the time Evans was confined in the deck-house he did not use any violence, and I did not hear any disturbance—he was always quiet—I had a quarrel with Evans a couple of days before he was put in irons, when he came to turn me out of the bunk—he struck me with his fist in the face—he did not hurt me to speak of—I did not make any complaint till a couple of days before we got in, and then I would not have spoken about it only the second mate came and asked me about it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He told me the facts upon which he had acted, he told me the whole affair—he told me that he had had reported to him threats against his life; that Evans had threatened his life, and that he was afraid of his life—I had noticed Evans constantly, just as a man would who has nothing to do on board, and my opinion that he was the man was confirmed by the observations I had made of him—I did not know who the man was, but I picked him out—I did not see any violent conduct on his part, but he always had a sulky, sullen appearance, and when the captain told me what had occurred, I said "Was it such a man,"Describing him, I did not know his name; and I afterwards found that was the man in custody—the captain consulted me afterwards, five or six times, about the course he was taking, whether I thought he was acting right, or too harshly, or too leniently—my advice was to keep the man there, that it would not be for the safety of the passengers or the property on board to let the man go, and I myself demanded it of him for the safety of my family—I have frequently seen the deck-house where Evans was confined—I have seen the door left open—he had much more room there than I had in my cabin, and mine was supposed to be the best in the ship—I never saw any unseemly conduct on the part of the captain in any way—I never heard him use any un<lb/>seemly language, and I never wish to sail with a better man as a captain.</p>

He was not tied up with his hands over his head to the rigging, merely as high as his chin, with a slack rope about a foot to spare. I then consulted with my officers and passengers as to his being kept in confinement, and they agreed with me that it was not safe to allow him at large. He had the same food as the others; he was attended to three times a day by the chief officer, and occasionally by the doctor. I never had occasion to place a man in irons during the five years I have been a master."</p>

At to the Counts charg<lb/>ing an unlawful imprisonment after the arrival of the vessel in port, some argument might be urged; but the evidence showed that the captain had taken the earliest opportunity of releasing himself from the responsibility of the man's custody. With respect to the imprisonment during the voyage, the man's insolence and insubordination fully justified it; and as the acts of the crew in demanding his release amounted in reality to mutiny, the captain was fully justified in retaining the man in confinement for the protection of the lives and property entrusted to him. With regard to the tricing up, it was limited in point of time, and was not shown to have caused any pain or injury; it was a punishment for a very grave offence, but not such an abuse of authority as to justify the indictment.</hi>

I am warehouseman to Mr. Alexander Ochterloney Greig and others, army clothiers, of 17, Coleman Street—the prisoner was in their employment up to about the end of September last as an occasional porter—he was then discharged because there was no work for him to do—he had a week's notice—there is a portion of our premises called the dock: at the left hand side of White Horse Yard—I believe this plan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be correct—this dock, or dust-bin, is in fact a square room shut out from the body of the warehouse, but under the same roof, and is used for refuse, and to put a truck in—a little door opens from the warehouse into the dust-bin, and it is occasionally opened to throw in the dust from the count<lb/>ing-house, and other refuse, and there is an outer door through which the rubbish is taken when the place is full—a plank had been missing from there for some little time, and a truck stood against the door—on the evening of 20th October, about 6.30, my attention was called to the dust<lb/>bin, and I found the whole of the paper in it on fire—my son and I got water and <hi rend="italic">doused</hi> it out—we had the rubbish kicked out, and then found a mass of fire, quite at the back, all burning down beneath where I thought it was extinguished—in my opinion the fire had originated behind that door—it could not have arisen by accident; there was no light, or anything, from the premises that could have caused it—the dust-bin was covered over, and was under the warehouse; the missing panel left a space quite large enough for anyone to get through; anyone could put their hand through that, and apply a light—there is a water-closet there, but that is kept locked—there is no other convenience there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lighterman, living in Grundy Street, Bromley—on the night of 22nd October, about 12.30, I was in the Com<lb/>mercial Road—I heard cries of "Father! Mother! Murder!"—I ran across and saw a little girl running; and the deceased walking behind her towards a coffee-stall which he, the prisoner, keeps—the prisoner came into the middle of the road and met him, and said "Have you been insulting my daughter?"He said "I did not," And with that the prisoner knocked him down and hit him while on the ground, and kicked him about the neck or face; the deceased fell on the stone tramway—whether his head fell on the stones or not I can't say—the prisoner struck him five or six times with his right fist while he was down—he did not kick him more than once, to my knowledge—I never saw the deceased move afterwards—I went and fetched a doctor, and he was taken to the hospital.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It all occurred in two or three minutes—he was down and the blows were rapidly struck afterwards—I had not been in five different public-houses that night—I would not say whether it was three or four—had not been turned out of any—there was a little disturbance at one and we were cleared out—I don't think the place where the deceased fell was forty-five yards from any lamp—it was not very dark, it was betwixt and between—I mentioned the kick when I was first examined, but it was not put down—I said the constable must have seen it if he had been looking—Henry Walker was with me at the time—a woman struck the deceased and she was taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical officer of St. Mary, New<lb/>ington on the evening of 18th September, between 10 and 11 o'clock, I accompanied Meecham to 2, Arundel Grove, and saw the deceased child and the prisoner, who was only partly clothed, and in a very excited state of mind—I could not form a judgment of what caused the excited state, perhaps it was her temperament—I have no distinct recollection of what she had on, but it was very little—we had to knock once or twice before we got in, and I inferred that she was going to bed—the child had a cotton nightgown on, and appeared very much emaciated, and in a state of very great debility—I listened to its lungs with my stethoscope, and looked at its tongue—I could discover no organic disease, and therefore I was led to infer that it had been badly nourished—it was removed from the prisoner's care, and I saw it some days later in the care of Mrs. Wells, where it was properly cared for and nourished—I saw it there twice—it died on 13th October—I made <hi rend="italic">a post mortem</hi> examination; there were no marks on the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187111200040"/>
               <p>body, but it was very much emaciated, and there were excoriations on the thighs and buttocks—on opening the body all the organs were healthy, except the left lung, which was in a state of inflammation, and the brain, which was slightly congested—the excoriations arose from the child wetting its clothes, and the acid nature of the foeces and urine—the immediate cause of death was the inflammation of the lungs, which I have no doubt was accelerated by bad treatment and bad nursing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> When I had had the child three weeks she had an abscess formed on her right breast, and another on the bottom of her stomach, and breakings out on several parts of her body, and she had a gathering in her head, it ran from her ear; I sent for her mother, who came on the night the abscess broke. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> There was no mark on the right breast, or any external marks except the excoriations—if there had been such abscesses as the prisoner mentions they would have left marks, especially when they were so recent.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my husband at 1, Gardner's Cottages, close to Newington Green—the officer came to me on Monday evening, and I went to the prisoner's house on Tuesday morning, and I asked her what she intended to do, and told her to look what trouble she had got herself into, and what was I to do—she said, "Do what you like"—I immediately took the baby to the aunt, as I thought, but she appears to be the mother—it was up to its neck in its own dirt and wet—it was so stinking that I burnt the coloured clothing, and this blanket, as we call it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) has had to be washed half-a-dozen times and bleached—I took the child home, and, being a mother, treated it with a mother's care—its bones were through its skin, and it only weighed 5 1/2 lbs.—I only wish I could have <hi rend="italic">rose</hi> it—we knew that it was being starved four months ago, and I gave information to the aunt when I met her—I saw it sometimes four months ago—it was dreadfully dirty, and I went in and washed it and put it to bed—it was neglected at that time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I always kept the baby well fed, as much as it could eat; it was never taken to Mrs. Wells to be washed; it is a complete piece of spite; Mrs. Wells did not want the baby at first, because she thought she should not get paid for it, but when she found I was paid for it she wanted it. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I could have had the baby at first, but I could not take it, and I recommended the prisoner—the mother had rather that I should have had it, but I am not capable of nursing myself—I have not combed my own hair for six years—the baby was brought home first, and I saw its clothing—I did not say that I was afraid to take it, because I did not know that I should get the money.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I am resident surgeon at Whitechapel Workhouse—on 24th October the deceased was brought there, and placed under my care—he died on 6th November, from inflammation of the brain—he was paralyzed in his left side, while under my care—in consequence of the Coroner's order I made a <hi rend="italic">postmortem</hi> examination within thirty hours after death—he died from inflammation of the membranes of the brain, owing to violence or a blow—nothing else would cause that form of inflammation—there was a quantity of <hi rend="italic">pus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">lymph</hi> on the base of the brain, which is always a sign—there were no signs of fracture—I found all the organs healthy except the right lung, which was slightly adherent, and a little inflamed; but it had nothing to do with the death—I should not expect to find external marks if it was from a blow, as, if the scalp had been lacerated five months before, the scar would have healed—the blow was on 29th May, when he was taken to the London Hospital with concussion of the brain, and was an in-patient twenty-seven days—he came into the workhouse five months afterwards—concussion of the brain will leave effects for many months, especially with an intemperate person; and there was very strong evidence of his being a man of intemperate habits—a fall against a flag-stone, or any kind of blow, would do the same thing—it is impossible for me to say when the injury which caused death was received—it might have been some time before, or it might have been a second blow.</p>

               <p>"I carry on business as a stationer, at 5, Edgware Road. I know the prisoner Enever, and have done so for nine or ten months. I was anxious to dispose of my business; the prisoner Henderson introduced himself to me, and wanted to buy the business; this was from three to four weeks ago; a few days before the 29th I saw Enever speak to Henderson in the shop, and so I knew that they were acquainted; this was after Henderson had proposed to buy the business of me. It was arranged between us that Henderson should have possession of the shop, and that an agreement should be signed between us on payment to me of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by Henderson, on account of 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. It was arranged that the money should be paid on the 23rd August. The agreement was signed. On 23rd August the prisoner Hender<lb/>son came to me, but he did not pay me the money. The two prisoners and myself had drunk together after I had seen the prisoners speaking to each other in the shop. Between the 23rd and the 28th, Henderson made excuses for not paying the money—on the 28th, in the morning, Henderson and I were in the New Inn public-house, Edgware Road. He asked me if he might have some goods brought in on the Tuesday, the 29th; I said 'Yes,' believing he was going to have the business; he said that the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be ready in a day or two. On the afternoon of the 29th, some skins of leather and bundles of paper-hangings arrived at the shop; these goods</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187111200049"/>
               <p>might be worth from 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. The goods came at different times, and apparently from different places. After some of the goods came, I saw the prisoners together in the shop. In the evening, at 9.45, I shut up the shop, and went to have a glass of ale with both the prisoners. A few minutes after I parted from the prisoners, from what I was told, I asked Mr. Barnes to go back, and stop in the shop all night. About 2 o'clock next morning I was at the police-station, and I there saw the skins of leather, some silver-plated articles, some pipes, 14 packets of note-paper, 3 boxes of envelopes, 36 lead pencils, and 12 quill pens. I identify the note-paper, envelopes, pencils, pens, and 2 books, and 2 packs of cards, as my property. The prisoners had no right to take these things. I had given the prisoners no authority to come to my shop at night The articles which are mine are worth 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Enever came first to the shop as a customer; he occasionally bought a newspaper. Enever came into the shop in the afternoon of the 29th, but made no purchases; he did not say in the evening that he had bought plate-powder in the afternoon. I was in an inner room of the shop when the goods were delivered. I had nothing to do whatever with the ordering or obtaining of the goods. I have misted a latch-key; the key produced is it, to the best of my belief; I did not lend it to Henderson at any time, or authorise them to have it."</p>

I live at 24, Lothian Road, Brixton—I have known Weller ten or eleven years—I knew he was apprenticed to Mr. Creed—about eight months ago I left the service of the Brighton Railway Company—I went to visit Weller at his shop, in the Edgware Road, in a friendly way—T subsequently agreed to invest 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the business, and paid 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. deposit—I was to have an interest in the business—the agreement was not signed—I have not had the money back—I paid the 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. about three or four months back—the business was proceeding first-rate at that time—it con<lb/>tinued to proceed in that first-rate manner for a short time, and then it was neglected—I spoke to Weller in consequence, and he said he would dis<lb/>pose of the business, and pay me the money back—I knew Enever by sight, by coming to 5, Edgware Road, perhaps about five or six months ago—I have seen Henderson there once or twice the latter part of the time—on 28th August I was in the shop—Henderson and Weller were there—I had not seen Henderson and Enever in the shop together before that—on the 29th, the day before the paper-hangings were delivered, Henderson was at the shop—Weller was there as usual; and in the latter part of the day Enever came in—that was after the goods were delivered—Henderson was there at the time the goods were actually delivered—I saw the goods delivered—they were directed to J, R. Glennie—I was at the back part of the shop, a kind of partition, when the paper-hangings were delivered—Weller was with me—when the carman brought the paper-hangings, Henderson left the back part of the shop—he came back and asked for a pen and ink—the carman was waiting in the front shop when the pen and ink was being looked for—I did not see what Henderson did with the pen and ink—there was no one in the shop at that time but Henderson, Weller, myself and the carman—it was between 3 and 4 o'clock—Enever got there between 5 and 6 o'clock—Henderson did not tell me how he had paid for the paper-hangings—just before they were delivered, we were all three together, at the back of the shop, playing cards and drinking beer—I asked Weller the meaning of goods being delivered at the shop in the name of Glennie—I can't remember what reply he made—he evaded it in some way or other—I can't give you any more detail of it than that—after the paper had been delivered, Henderson, Weller and myself, went to a public-house, about 9.45—some other goods had been delivered besides the paper-hangings—I made a communication to my</p>

On Sunday night, 24th October, I was on duty, in the Caledonian and Camden Roads—I passed the Hollo<lb/>way Congregational Chapel, which is at the corner of those two roads, about 12.30—I saw the glimmer of a light in the chapel—I waited a short time and then I saw it again—I jumped over the wall and tried the south door, opened it and went in and saw the three prisoners—they ran back in the church—I ran after them and collared Goodrich—I was then hit by Ward, with a life presever or a wooden stick, I could not say which, and Goodrich and I fell—McKenzie and Ward then dragged me into the church-yard—I called out "Come round here, here they are"—McKenzie threw his <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> at me and ran away—I got the assistance of another constable and took Goodrich to the station—I found on him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a knife, and ten keys—I went back to the church with Samuel Green—I found a bottle of aqua fortis, this centre-bit and this holland cover and towel, by the vestry door—and these wedges and the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> were afterwards picked up where McKenzie flung the the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> at me—I examined the chapel door and found marks on the inside—entrance had been gained by a window, about 10ft. from the ground—it was pulled out—the vestry door was burst open and also the door where I went in—I found the chalices in the cellar of the vestry" Which had been burst open—one of them had been used for drinking wine out of—they had been taken out of the bag—I went to Marlborough Street Police Court, last Monday week, and saw McKenzie—I indentified him as being one of the men who were in the chapel—I saw Ward in custody and identified him as one of the men.</p>

I admit that I was with Saunders and another in Holborn. The young woman who has got away got the prosecutrix under the arms, and made a snatch at her side, and I saw her chain rush out, and she said "Oh! my watch."She could hardly walk; they very nearly had to carry her. I went to the station, and they asked me what I wanted. They did not say that I was the girl then. The policeman told me I need not come back, but I did, and went into the waiting-room, and this woman said "I think that is one of them."I said "Do you think if I had anything to do with it</p>

Pickford and Co.—about 6.30 on Wednesday evening, 15th November, I was with a van in Houndsditch—I was standing on the pavement, close to the van—McGrath spoke to me, and said "That cellar is very dangerous, I nearly slipped down"—I had not said anything to him—I shut down the cellar-flap, and I saw the other prisoner jump off the shafts of the van with a truss on his shoulder—I went to run round to catch him, and McGrath caught me by the throat and stopped me—I struggled away from him, and halloaed out "Stop thief!"—I ran after the man with the truss, and he dropped it against the kerb—I saw a gentleman, whom I know now to be Mr. Linnell, run after Edwards—I went back to the van, and Edwards was brought back by Mr. Linnell—I have seen both the prisoners together in Hounds<lb/>ditch before—McGrath had a round hat on—I was taken to the police-station, and showed a number of men, I think five or six—I was asked which was the person, and the one that held me, and I picked out McGrath—he had his cap off then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Doctor of Medicine, and live at 22, Caledonian Road—about 12.30 on the morning of 14th November, I was going home with a friend—I went into the Peacock, near the Angel, Isling<lb/>ton, to have a glass of ale—as I came out I was surrounded by four men; my hands were pinned to my side, and my hat was knocked over my head—I felt my watch go from my pocket—I saw the prisoner run away, through an alley—I was speaking to a man on the pavement, and the prisoner came back through the alley right into my arms—I held him until Detective Dudley came to the rescue—the three other men came up, and I thought Dudley would be overpowered—a policeman came up then—Dudley asked the prisoner for the watch—he denied having it—they took him to a lamp-post—he was very violent, and they threw him on his back—I saw the watch taken from his hand, under the lamp post—this is the watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was about 12.45 when I went into the public-house—I had not been drinking before—I did not see any of the men in the Peacock, to my knowledge—I am quite certain there were four men—I was completely surrounded, and my arms pinned down, and my hat was crushed on my head—I don't know which of them did that—it was all done momentarily.</p>

On the night of this occurrence I saw Dr. Spurin come out of the Peacock—four men fell on him as he came out—the prisoner was one of them—the prosecutor had not got four yards from the door when the four men jumped on him, and I saw his hat smashed on his head—the prisoner got hold of his watch, and ran away with it up a passage called Field Place into High Street again, turned to the left into Chapel Street, Clerkenwell, and there he crossed the road and ran through the passage again—he ran against the gentleman, and they went across the road together—I got hold of the prisoner's right hand, and the other officer got his left—as I closed on him he pulled his right hand out of his pocket—I seized his hand—we conveyed him to a lamp-post—I got hold of his fingers, and the gentleman took the watch out of his hand and gave it to me—I had asked him to give me the watch, but he would not—he squeezed it so that the glass broke in his hand—I took him into custody.</p>

I have been eighteen years under one employer, but he cannot come to give me a character. I have had thousands of pounds in my hands to pay men, and never stood before a bar before. Hicks is connected with Taylor, and they want to get this plot of ground from me without buying it, and they injure my character in every way they can. I worked all day on Friday, and nothing was said about this till Saturday, when I was having my dinner, they then took me, and I could not get bail, and had to lay in the station all Saturday and Sunday. There was loose straw in my yard, because I have pigs and fowls, and give them beds nearly every day. I do not notice whether I drop a straw in the yard.</p>
