I am an assistant in the Detective Depart<lb/>ment of the General Post Office—on October 13th I was with James keeping observation on the prisoner, who I knew well—he left at 5.15 p.m., walked to the Bank of England, and got into a tram car for Fins<lb/>bury Park—I got in and sat on the same side, and James got on the top—the prisoner got out at Seven Sisters Road—I got out immediately behind him, and followed him to the post-office, about 15 yards off, where he filled in the name of the office and S. Steel—he was paid 2s.—James was stand<lb/>ing outside the shop, but near the counter—the prisoner left, and I spoke to Mr. Miller, who gave me this order (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I reported the matter.</p>

I am a clerk in the General Post Office—I was instructed to investigate with regard to Holloway sorting office—on October 14th I saw the prisoner and said, "You changed that order at the Hornsey Road Post Office last night; where did you get it, and why did you cash it in a different name than your own"?—he said "This is the first I have seen of it"—I called in Davis, and asked him if he knew him: he said "Yes"—I said, "Did you see him go to the Post Office last night, and cash this</p>

               <p>order?"—he said "Yes"—I asked if he had anything to say he said "I have nothing to say"—before October 28th arrived Mrs. Houghton had communicated with the Post Office, and I saw the prisoner again and said, "I have received an application from Mrs. Houghton posted on October 12th; have you anything further to say?"—he said "No; I can prove I was in the Cattle Market at five minutes to six"—the distance took me nineteen minutes, and coming back part of the way in a trend fourteen minutes."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My husband is in the East Surrey Regiment, and he sailed on October 20th; he left home on the 17th—the prisoner and Dennis and I and other friends saw him off—after he went the prisoner had been drinking up to the night of this occurrence, but Dennis had been at work—my husband is a corporal—when I met Dennis on Waterloo Bridge he said, "If father starts on me again to<lb/>day I will do him in, and this is the article I will do it with"—the prisoner did not like Dennis sleeping in the same room—he said it was a shame for a man like him to be sleeping in the same room, instead of getting lodgings—Dennis had been in the Army—he left it because he struck his colour-sergeant—he only got discharged; nothing else—he was a strong man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a french polisher, of 3, Gumming Street, Pentonville—about 1.15 on the morning of October 22nd I was passing Cressy Street, and opposite a turning into Stephen Street—when I was opposite 1, Stephen Street, I heard a noise as if someone was falling down<lb/>tairs—the street door was shut—I heard a voice say, "Father, you have got something in your hand"—I heard another voice say, "So have you"—the first voice replied, "No, I have not; I will strike a light"—I cannot say for certain whether a light was struck—then I heard the first voice say, "You call yourself an Irishman, you have one hand behind your back"—then I heard a rush and a scuffle down the passage and behind the door; just afterwards the deceased rushed out into the road way, about three or four yards from the pavement and fell down; then the prisoner rushed out and dropped down on one knee by the side of the deceased, and struck him several times—the deceased was still on the ground, lying partly on his side and partly on his stomach—I could not see what the prisoner struck him with; he was using the right hand and striking him downwards; I cannot say how many times, but several times—I should have put it at a dozen, but I know now that it was not so many—the deceased cried,</p>

               <p>"Oh, father! oh, my God!"—that was all I heard him say—then the prisoner stood up, and as he was getting up he said: "That is what I have got"—he turned to look at me for an instant, and then turned back and kicked the deceased on the head; he then ran indoors into No. 1—I had a whistle which 1 blew, and P.C. Nicholls came up—I afterwards went to the Police-station, where I made a statement as to what I had seen—the prisoner was present—he could hear what I said.</p>

I was on duty on the morning of October 22nd, a little after 1, in Tottenham Court Road, and, hearing a whistle blown in Stephen Street, I ran there, where I saw Mr. Wilding, who spoke to me, and pointed out a pool of blood in the road opposite I, Stephen Street—in consequence of what he said I went into No. 1—I met the prisoner on the stairs, coming down—I said to him, "Where are you going? Are you the father?"—he replied, "Yes"—I said, "Where is your son?"—he said, "I don't know, nor b—y well care"—there was blood on his hands and clothing—I said, "How can you account for this?"—it was wet—he said, "My son upset me, and I gave him some<lb/>thing in return, and another thing, I don't b—y well care how or where he is"—Constable Emery then came, and we went upstairs into the second-floor room; we took the prisoner up, too—he made no state<lb/>ment about the room—then he was taken to the station by Emery—I went to the Middlesex Hospital, and saw the deceased being examined by the house-surgeon—I searched the pockets of the deceased—I put my hand into his right-hand, trousers ppcket, where I found this clasp-knife (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—my hand was covered with blood when I took it out of the pocket—the knife was closed, as it is now—I opened it—the handle and the blade were smeared with blood—the pocket was saturated with blood—I went back to 1, Stephen Street, and examined the passage from the streelf<lb/>door to the staircase—on the right side of the street door, outside, I found some wet blood—inside on the left, as I went in, there was an impression to a hand, and that was covered with blood—on the floor there were spots of blood, and at the back of the door, close to the hinge, there was a small pool of blood—on the wains<lb/>costing opposite there were streaks of blood—the prisoner appeared to be sober—the same evening I took the coat which the prisoner was wearing, and showed it to Dr. Wills.</p>

I am House Surgeon at Middlesex Hospital, and about 1.30 a.m. on October 22nd the deceased was brought in in a collapsed condition, hardly sensible and bleeding freely—there was a great deal of blood on his clothes—Nicholls searched his clothes, and in doing so his hands got very wet with blood—I saw him pull, out this knife from the deceased's pocket—the deceased's trousers were taken away, and as they were in too dirty a state to be used again, they were destroyed—the jacket and vest are in Court—I treated the deceased, but he died about six the same morning—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> on Tuesday, the 24th—the cause of death was haemorrhage resulting from the wounds—the body was in a healthy condition—he was a powerfully builtman—I found 10 wounds; they might have been caused by this shoemaker's knife—the first wound was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189911200025"/>
               <p>a superficial wound on the angle of his left eye, another below it, a third in front of the lower part of the left ear; the direction of that was back<lb/>wards and upwards; it was 2 in. deep and about 3/4 in. long; it divided an important vein of the neck; a fourth on the right of the middle line of the neck, 1/2 in. long, passing upwards and downwards, and 2 1/2 in. deep; that also divided a large vein in the neck—the fifth was a superficial wound on the left hand; another, an incised wound 2 1/2 in. long, at the back of the head—the next, a similar one, 23/4 in. long, cutting through the scalp, and just above the last wound; it was a punctured wound, and had gone through the scalp—on the back of the body there were three wounds; one a superficial wound at the top of the shoulder<lb/>blade on the left, another punctured wound below the left shoulder<lb/>blade, which penetrated into the chest on the left side, and wounded the left lung; that was a very serious one—on the middle line of the back there was another punctured wound, about 3 in. long, which nearly penetrated the right side of the chest—there was a breaking of the skin on the bridge of the nose; that, I think, was not caused by a knife; it might have been caused by a fall or a blow with a blunt instrument, such as a boot—I did not form any opinion as to the sequence of the wounds—I think they were caused within a very short time of each other—I think the wound just below the left ear might by itself have been fatal—I have heard of the position in which the prisoner and the deceased were; that wound might have been caused while they were in that position—the wound on the middle of the neck might have been fatal alone, and also the wound in the back, which injured the lung; that could have been caused by the prisoner while the deceased was in the position described, and I say also the same thing in regard to the wound on the right side of his neck—severe hemorrhage would result from the wounds on the face—I did not go to 1, Stephen Street.</p>

I live in Shepperton Road, Islington—on October 16, at 11.15 p.m., I was with William Burke—we went into the Variety public-house, in Hoxton, where I saw the three prisoners—I knew them previously—Burke called for a glass of bitter and a glass of sherry—Connor said to Burke, "Are you come for a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with me?"—Burke said: "I want nothing to say to you"—while Connor was speaking to Burke Horrigan and Berry went outside; then Berry came in with a chopper—he did not say anything, but he hit him on the side of the ear with the chopper, and made his ear bleed—Burke had a hat on, and it cut his hat—there were about six of them altogether, and they all went away together, and I and Burke came outside—I asked him to take a cab, but he said he would not, and we went towards Brunswick Place, to go home—he was not in<lb/>sensible</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189911200026"/>
               <p>then; we came out shortly after the men left—Brunswick Place is about two minutes' walk from the Variety—just before we got to the King's Arms I looked back, and saw the prisoners and some others follow<lb/>ing us—I said "Go in here," meaning the King's Arms, to get out of the way—he went in—I went up to Connor, and asked him not to cause any <hi rend="italic">more raw</hi>, for the sake of me and my children—he said, "He has asked for it; now he will get it!"—while I was speaking to him the others rushed into the King's Arms—then I saw Connor go in, and I rushed in after him—I saw Burke struggling with Berry and Horrigan—Burke was bleeding from the head—I saw Connor strike Burke—I cannot say whether it was with a hammer or a chopper, but it was some instrument—Burke fell on the floor insensible—while he was on the floor I saw Horrigan and Connor strike him on the face—I picked up a glass, and told them that if they hit him any more I should aim it at them—they did not hit him, but they said if I did not put it down they would make me eat it—I had known them for years—the prisoners went away—the publican blew a whistle, and the police came—Burke was taken to the hospital, and I went with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have made an additional statement to the police—when I first saw the prisoners in the Variety bar I believe they were standing against the partition, when I came in with Burke—I expect they had some whisky by their side—I did not look<lb/>—I do not think it was more than three minutes from the time that we ordered our drinks till Connor came and spoke to Burke—Connor did not cross the room; he stood in a corner, and Burke was quite close to him—while Connor was speaking to him the other two prisoners went outside—they went out when Burke was calling for the drinks—when Connor spoke to Burke, Burke said he did not want to have no "say" with him—I did not see a knife at that time in Burke's hand—he never had any knife, I can swear it—he did not say, "Don't speak to me, or I will serve you the same as Volkes"—Volkes' name was not mentioned—I know a man named Volkes—I do not know whether Burke had seen him lately—I do not know if he is a friend of Burke's—the prisoners are supposed to be Burke's friends as well—the two other prisoners rushed in, and Berry struck Burke on the head with a chopper—they came in, and without a single word struck him on the head, and knocked him on the floor—he got up, and went outside, and the prisoners went away—the blow hurt Burke—I gave evidence at the Police-court—I said there, "Berry hit Burke on the head with a hammer or something; he had a hat on, but it did not hurt him"—I also said that Burke said that he did not wish to hurt the prisoners—I said that because Burke told me not to say any thing—I have had a conversation with Burke about the evi<lb/>dence I was to give, and also one since I gave evidence at the Police-court—I live with him—he said I was to tell the truth—I did not tell the truth before; I did not have the chance—this is the proper evidence that I give now—the police came to my place on Saturday night, and told me to tell the truth in this case—they knew that I had not told the truth—I did not see the prisoners after we left the Variety bar till we were going down Brunswick Place—after Burke had gone into the King's Arms, I did not see anybody else go in before the three prisoners—I said at the Police-court, "Three men ran in"; that is false—I did not say, "I followed them</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of 47, Shepperton Road, Islington—I have known the prisoners for years—on Monday, October 16th, I was with the last witness about 10 p.m., in the Variety bar, in Hoxton—I saw Connor there—he said to me, "Here, <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>, I want to speak to you"—I said, "What is it?"—he said, "Is that right you are going to have a row with me?"—I said, "Certainly not; I want nothing to say to you"—I walked away—I did not see the other two men; then I was struck on the right ear from behind; my hat was, cut right through—I did not see who assailed me—I did not see the weapon with which I was struck—it must have been a weapon and not a man's hand, because I was knocked in<lb/>sensible—I fell down, and after a time came back to consciousness—I was in pain then—I asked the last witness who had done it, and we went out<lb/>side—<lb/>before we went out I saw that Connor had disappeared—we went into Brunswick Place, and I saw the three prisoners coming up behind us—I went into the King's Arms—Horrigan came in first, then Berry,. and then Connor—Horrigan was carrying a small chopper, Connor was carry<lb/>ing a decent-sized chopper, and Berry a plasterer's hammer—they did not speak to me—Horrigan struck me with his chopper on my head through my hat—it cut my head—then Berry struck me—I fell against the par<lb/>tition—I tried to close with them, and Connor came and hit me on the left side of the head with his chopper—there was a struggle—I was hurt and became insensible—I fell down and remembered no more—everybody who wants to do anybody an injury carries a chopper about in this neigh<lb/>bourhood—they carry it in their coat pocket or up their sleeve; that is the ordinary thing among them in Hoxton—the next time I remembered myself I was in the hospital, where I remained three weeks, when I dis<lb/>charged myself—I have been an outpatient since—I had no quarrel with the prisoners—two years ago I had a few words with Berry, and he threatened me with a revolver—it is true that while the Police-court proceedings were going on I told Shore that I did not wish to hurt the prisoners.</p>

               <p>developed into an argument—I call an argument talking against one another, nothing more—Volkes struck me in the mouth all of a sudden—he said he had had 15 boxing competitions, and lost every one—he struck me because he wanted to win one—the idea was that he and I should have a boxing competition, because he thought he could beat me, as I had just come out of prison—we wrestled instead—there were several glasses on the bar—I had had a drop of sherry—I did not throw any drink on the floor—I did not smash my glass on the counter, or strike Volkes on the neck with it—when we had finished wrestling he fell against the bar, and knocked several glasses down—then Brooks came and pulled us apart, and said to Volkes, "Don't do such a thing as that again," and sent him outside—the governor came and asked me what was the matter, and I told him—a barman came up and spoke to me, and we went out—when we went into the Variety bar it was crowded—I did not threaten Connor—I did not advance towards him and say, "Don't speak to me, or I will serve you the same as Volkes"—I did not mention Volkes's name to Connor—I did not make a blow at Connor with a knife—I saw him at the Police-court—I did not notice a bandage on his left arm—I did not rush at Berry in the Variety; I did in the King's Arms—he did not strike me in self-defence—I rushed at him to get the instrument out of his hand—I did not see a soul in the King's Arms when I went in, except the governor of the house—I was in there by myself about 10 seconds—Berry and Horrigan came in about the same time, only by different doors—one of the doors into the bar is not kept locked—I have never had a fight like this before—I was once charged for hitting a policeman on the head with a bottle—that was five years ago, and another charge for attempting to pick pockets—I have been a criminal for the last five years, and amongst ourselves we often have fights—I have not had any conversation with the last witness with regard to our evidence since we gave evidence at the Police-court—I told her I was going through with the case—when I lay in the hospital I did not intend to give evidence; I did not dare—there are over 100 people outside the Court now—what the last witness said about her evidence at the Police-court is untrue—before Worship Street Police-court I did speak to her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a director of Messrs. Waring and Gillow, Limited, furnishers, builders, and decorators, whose chief office is at 181, Oxford Street—we have other factories, one being during the past seven months at Cambridge Road, Hammersmith, where Mr. John Dunkin was our manager and buyer, and the defendant Howe, the foreman—Howe's duty was to make out a requisition showing the amount of timber he pro<lb/>posed to buy, and the person or firm of whom it was to be ordered—he would probably initial the requisition, but he would send it to the clerk for entry in the book—the requisition would then be filed—the order-book is perforated, so that the duplicate made by carbon paper can be taken out—that is sent to Mr. Dunkin, the manager, for his approval and signa<lb/>ture—every order has the date and the signatures of a director and the manager—Mr. Dunkin has authority to sign for Mr. John Waring—he uses an india-rubber stamp—for an order over £106 Mr. Dunkin would consult the directors—the order is then posted, or, if urgent, taken to the firm supplying the timber—we do not recognise verbal orders—each order bears the note, "Orders are not valid unless signed by a director"—the prisoner had been in Waring and Gillow's employ<lb/>ment</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189911200032"/>
               <p>about four years—he was foreman joiner at the Hammersmith factory, which has been open since April—up to August last his salary was £156 per annum—we increased it to £5 a week—this is the requi<lb/>sition to C. J. Wade, of Great St. Helen's, for two standards of first pine, at £24 perstandard—that would mean 60 planks, 12ft. long and 11 in. by 3 in., or 180 boards first quality per standard, each plank being cut into three boards—" R.H." are the defendant's initials upon it—it has been "spiked" or filed—I produce the order-book used at the Hammersmith factory—I find the duplicate of the order, addressed to Messrs. Wade, of September 23rd, 1899, in every respect the same as the requisition, except that instead of two it is 22 standards, and instead of £24 it is £24 15s.—it should tally with the requisition—the 22 and the 15s. are apparently written at different times—the requisition is in duplicate, and the terms would appear in a book called the requisition-book, the Foreman's Memorandum Book, and various names—there is also a counterfoil—this is the order sent to Messrs. Wade—it is for 22 standards at £24 15s.—it bears the signature of J. W. Waring, made by an india-rubber stamp, and it is signed by the buyer—such an order is abnormal—I have never given such an order—the most I have ordered is 4 1/2 standards, as appears from our order-books—we have not room to store 22 standards properly at Hammersmith—under no circumstances would it be in the interest of the firm to buy 22 standards—we use roughly eight standards per year—taking the cabinet factory under Mr. Dunkin, and the joinery, under Howe, 21/4 standards was sufficient on September 23rd—we had 18 months' stock, over nine standards—our liability upon the requisition was £48—it was increased by the alteration to £544 10s.—Howe would pass in the timber—our rules are against any commission or inducement to the buyer—I produce requisition signed by Howe, and the order, signed "McLaren," of September 19th, for the supply, amongst other things, of one standard of 3 by 10 first pine at £22, and one standard first yellow at £20 10s.—that is to T. Saunders and Sons, timber merchants, from whom we have bought timber—I also produce order to Messrs. Saunders, signed by Mr. Waring, a director, and by Mr. Dunkin, the manager, for six standards of 3 by 10 first pine at £32, instead of one standard as in the requisition, and 10 standards of first yellow pine at £20 10s., instead of one standard and the duplicates in the order-book, which should agree with the requisition—there was no necessity to order that quantity, although one or two standards might pass through at any time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Anyone whose attention had been called to it might notice the alteration, but you might turn over the order-book a dozen times and not notice that "2" had been altered to "22"—there is a dot between the twos—the invoice from Wade's would pass through two or three hands—Mr. Dunkin received it—Howe could have had the invoice sent to him—he could have altered the requisition—the alteration in Saunders's order is done in a different pencil—originally it was in blue; the alteration is in black—Wade's invoice was for 33 standards—looking at the press copy, I should say the "15s." was not filled in at the same time—it was in the specification—I now take the statement, "Not less than half the parcel," to be a concession—cash paid on the 20th of the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk at the Hammersmith factory—part of my duty is to enter the orders in the order-book from the requisi<lb/>tions signed by Howe—I made out this order of September 23rd in duplicate by carbon paper—I tore out one form and sent it to Mr. Dunkin to sign—it was for "2" standards of pine—it came back with Mr. Dunkin's signature upon it—Howe told me to put another "2," and make it "22," and to put "15s." on to the £24—I did it in both the forms—Saunders' order is in my writing, but I do not recollect anything about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been manager of Messrs. Waring and Gillow's factory at Cambridge Road, Hammersmith, since it was opened about seven months back—I am also the buyer—the prisoner was foreman joiner—I bought without consulting my principals, but not more than to the amountof £100—the prisoner made out a requisition of what was re<lb/>quired, which was entered by the clerk in the order book—I signed the order, but not the requisition, which was filed; in writing or by an india-rubber stamp—the director's signature is affixed by a stamp—both stamps are under lock and key—the order is passed to a clerk, who registers it—it goes back to the foreman or his clerk—the foreman checks the delivery—this order of September 23rd with the stamps upon it was not in this form; a "2" has been added—the price of 22 standards at £24 15s. would be over £500—the 15s. has also been added since I stamped it—on the evening of October 5th I opened an envelope containing an invoice from Messrs. Wade—invoices usually come by the morning poet—the large amount of 33 standards attracted my attention; also the purchase price, over £800—I immediately sent for the registration form—I found it was "2 standards"—I then sent for the order book, and found the duplicate in our book had been altered from "2" to "22," and the price from £24 to £24 15s.—I sent a telegram at once to Messrs. Wade to stop delivery and come and see me at once—I pinned the registration form to the order, and put them in my desk—the registration is to ensure no orders being issued without the director's signature, which is on them when</p>

               <p>registered—the registry is kept in the ledger room—if the prisoner had asked for the form it probably would have been shown to him—Howe, jun., was the invoice clerk who would check the invoice with the order and the registration form—I believe the word "passed" is his writing on the invoice—the whole entry on September 23rd was in one writing—the specifications tome to me—I open all letters, or my clerk for me—I first saw this specification of August 4th on the morning of October 6th—I went for my holiday from September 4th to 18th—it would not be out of order for Howe to examine the specification and write out the requisition without consulting me if the timber was required, but it would be his duty to consult me as to price—I authorised two standards at £24—anything above that was wrong—the alteration was without my authority—I do not accept the order for 22 standards as my order—I saw Howe in my office or in his office, which is next to mine, the next morning, October 6th—Burleigh was in my office, and I sent for Howe—I said, "There has been some mistake here"—Burleigh said he called in answer to the telegram—Howe said, "I bought" or "ordered 22 standards, being half of the 44 standards which I marked on the specification," and brought the specification from his office, and said, "Half of that," pointing with his finger to the "44"—I was surprised, and said, "Well, I never heard of this before; it is a much larger quantity than we require"—Howe said he never intended it to be all sent in at once—I said that Wade had sent in some small stuff from 7 to 10 in. wide, and it was much shorter than the usual length, some about 6, 7, and 8 ft.—that was the fact—Howe said to Burleigh, "3 by 11 was what I bought"—Burleigh said it was not 3 by 11, but it was his idea that Howe had bought half the parcel on this specification, which was not all 3 by 11, and that it was usual for timber merchants selling pine to make up the specifica<lb/>tions with short and narrow—I pointed out the price was now £24 15s. on the order—Howe said that was a mistake, and it was that which caused him to bring the specification in to show me—I then first saw the price £24 15s. on the specification—the prisoner had no authority to buy without the signatures—it was a serious breach of discipline, and I wanted to know what Messrs. Wade had to say—I had no knowledge of the order having been increased till it then came before me—we had not accommodation at Hammersmith to stack 22 standards of timber in the way it should be stacked, in addition to other woods—we had no re-quirement for so large a quantity—from October 6th I was in communi<lb/>cation with Mr. Burleigh and Messrs. Wade by word of mouth and by letter—I declined to accept delivery of more than the two standards I ordered at £24 per standard—I reported the matter to Mr. John Waring on the evening of October 17th—I wrote Messrs. Wade on October 18th—I returned home from a holiday on September 18th, and came to business on the Monday morning, 19th—I made a farther examination of the order-book, and found the order had been increased in two instances, a "1" being altered into "6" and another "1" into "10" to Messrs. Saunders, without my knowledge or authority—I first knew of this on October 18th—I ran my finger through the book and made a note of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> In both cases the alterations are obvious—I did not hand this specification to the prisoner to deal with—we have dealt with</p>

               <p>Messrs. Wade since February last—if this specification had been sent by post I cannot explain why I did not see it—I do not think I was at the office on the August bank holiday—that might be the explanation—letters are left over bank holiday for me to open—my shorthand clerk would open letters in my presence—he might open a letter, but would not hand a specification to Howe without my authority—Howe selected wood—he bought subject to my approval—I have not raised objections to price—I know something about price—I have had timber offered as low as £24 10s. per standard—I did not suggest to Mr. Burleigh that the price was excessive; 1 said it was not the price agreed—there was a dispute between Burleigh and Howe, who stuck to it that the order was for 33 standards, or half the parcel—at the Police-court I heard Mr. Wade say that he was going to do something, but I did not listen, I was coming away—it would be impossible for Howe to keep secret the fact of large quantities being delivered—I said at the Police-court, speaking of Burleigh, "I said, if I take the amount, would you like the order spread over two or three years?"—that is probably what I said—that was to show that as they were anxious to get their money on the 20th of the month it would be too ridiculous to wait for three years, and therefore for him to accept the order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The defendant was responsible for the quality, and the invoice clerk for the quantity of the wood delivered—I should look at it and pass an opinion upon it—Messrs. Saunders' pine at £22 was the same quality as Messrs. Wade's; the difference in size reduced the price about 30s.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189911200037"/>
               <p>is fair for that time for a large quantity—prices keep steady or sometimes advance bv leaps and bounds—within a fortnight I sold similar wood at £25 10s. per standard—it was part of the parcel out of the same ship—the price is to a merchant who has to sell it again—I sold two and a-half standards to a builder about three weeks ago at £27 15s., we are now quoting at £28—when our traveller reports an order it is entered—sometimes business is done by telephone—sometimes a dock order is required by the buyer—this order was entered for 33 standards through our traveller, Mr. Burleigh, which was half the parcel of 64 1/2 standards—at that time I would not have sold two standards at £24 15s., except as a sample to a regular customer—Waring and Gillow's have dealt with us since April 1st—Mr. Burleigh must submit the bar<lb/>gain to me before it is ratified—I had a communication from Mr. Dunkin about the beginning of October—I saw him on or about October 17th at our office—Mr. Dunkin said that Howe had altered the "2" to "22," and the price from £24 to £24 15s.—I told Mr. Dunkin I could not acknowledge any onder for two standards at £4 all 8 by 11; that what I wanted was an order for 33 standards, or half the parcel, broad and narrow together, at £24 15s.; the altered order was shown to Mr. Duukin, and I showed him this book—I asked him, as a man of business presum<lb/>ably knowing what he was talking about, whether he would expect me to execute an order for all 3 by 11 pine at £21—I told him I was not such a fool as to do it, and I would not do it, and that he must take the specification fairly, or not at all—ultimately he said if I would consent to deliver all 3 by 11 he would pass the order, but I ended the interview by telling him I would do nothing of the sort; it was picking out the cream of the parcel and leaving us all the refuse—by doing so I should have lost, probably, £50 or £60 by the bargain—I am now retaining half this parcel for Messrs. Waring to make terms—the due date for pay<lb/>ment not falling due till November 20th, I have not yet attempted to carry it further—there is absolutely no foundation for the suggestion that there was any bargain, corrupt or otherwise, between me and the defendant with reference to this purchase.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 95, Halle Road, Forest Gate, and am a. sorter in the General Post Office—on November 3rd I left Liverpool Street Station by the 12.30 a.m. train with two friends, Mr. Needs and Mr. Holmes, who are both employed in the Post Office—the station before Stratford is Coborn Road, and just after the train left, our attention was. attracted to the fearful screams of a woman in the next second-class com<lb/>partment—just before we ran into Stratford the screams stopped—we were going on to Forest Gate, but, in consequence of the screams, we got out at Stratford—as we got out I saw two men get out of the compart<lb/>ment where the screams came from—I said to them,"Wait a moment, you must have your names and addresses taken for this"—I looked into the carriage, and saw a woman apparently in a faint—when I. told the men they would have to have their names taken, they said what had it to do with me, and who was I?—a porter came up. and said, "You must put your names nnd addresses in a book." and he handed the prisoner a book—I looked over the prisoner's shoulder, and saw him write "William," but I cannot say what the other name was; he<lb/>finished with "Walthamstow"—I saw that plainly—he wanted to fight me, so I did not take any notice of the other man then—I did not answer the prisoner, and he pulled out a handful of sovereigns and said, "Will you tight for £10, £5, or £2?"—I did not answer him; I and my two friends went out of the station, and walked in the direction of Mary-land Point, on our way home—there was also another man with us who had been a passenger, who took up the case; he was a stranger; I do-not know who he is, or his name—we were all four walking along the road, when the prisoner and his friend came up behind, shouting at me,. "Ain't you going to fight?"—we went along till we got to a coffee-stall, when the stranger tuined round to the prisoner and his friend, and said, "We don't want any fighting; have a cup of coffee?"—I do not think the prisoner answered, but all six of us had some coffee, which was paid for by the stranger—then I and my two friends started to walk home—the stranger remained at the coffee-stall, and also the prisoner and his friend</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189911200044"/>
               <p>—we had gone about 200 or 300 yards when the prisoner and his friend caught us up; the stranger was not there—I did notseeany more of him that night—the prisoner's friend rushed at my friend Needs, and said, "Now you have got to fight for nothing"—I walked a couple of yards along to see where Needs had gone, because the electric hight was going out, when I got a whack across the back and side of my head with a crooked stick—there was only the prisoner there; he had a stick in his hand—I Turned round and caught the prisonby the throat—we had a struggle, and I threw him to the ground—he still had the stick, and I tried to take it from him—I was on my right knee, leaning over him—then I pulled him out straight, and pulled him quite two yards along the pavement; he was swearing at me all the while—when I got the stick away he said, "Do let me get up! Do let me get up!"—I said, "Get up," and he got up, and I said, Here is your stick; in future act like a man, and go away"—there had been no one near us while the struggle was going on—he walked away, and then I put my hand to my stomach, and one of my fingers went into a wound which I had there—when I pulled my fingers out they were covered with blood, and there was blood all along the pavement—I had on a pair of trousers, a pair of drawers, and two shirts, one of which was flannel; they were all stabbed through—I called out to Needs, "Jack, I am stabbed!"—(<hi rend="italic">The trousers were produced, with a large cut on the right side</hi>)—when I called out I could not see the prisoner and his friend; it was dark—my two friends went after them—I did not see my friends again, but a cabman spoke to me—I remained still for a little while, and then fol<lb/>lowed my friends slowly—I met a policeman, and we found the prisoner and his friend—the policeman said, "Which one done it! "and I said, "This one," pointing to the prisoner—I was put into a cab and taken to the West Ham Hospital—after my wound was sewn up and dressed I went with a policeman to the station and charged the prisoner—the wounds in my stomach and in my ear were both sewn up—I was perfectly sober—I should not like to say if the prisoner was sober—he seemed to be in a very excited condition; he seemed in a temper—I have not gone to work yet but the wound is healing beautifully.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross<lb/>examined.</hi> I knew I had got a hit on my ear, but I did not know it was bleeding till I got into the cab—my friends and the stranger were grown-up men—I looked over the prisoner's shoulder at the railway station to see what he was writing; the stranger did not; he was not tall enough—I had never seen the prisoner before—he did not say at the coffee-stall, "Have a cup of coffee and settle it up "; the stranger said so—the prisoner did not ask us to go and have a drink at some club—the prisoner was holding on to the stick when we were struggling—I dragged him along the pavement—he was lying down when I got the stick—the light had not quite gone out when the struggle finished; it was dark—before we got out of the train I had not knocked at the prisoner's carriage window—the stranger did not challenge Wilburn, the prisoner's friend, to fight—the prisoner did not say to the stranger, "We don't want to fight in the station; let us go outside, where it is light, and he shall fight you, and I will fight one of the others"—I did not say, "Why, I could fight the two of them"—I think the prisoner did say,</p>

               <p>"You are big enough to eat the of us"—that was before any below was struck—wilburn and Needs began to fight I did not say, "That is right, Jack; go on"—the prisoner did not say, "Don't you interface; he is plenty big enough for him; let them have a fair fight"—I did not then say, "You had better have one," and give him a smack on the head.</p>

I live at 4, Church Road, Little Ilford, and am a sorter in the General Post Office—I went home with the prosecutor by the 12.30 train on October 2nd—on the way we heard a woman's screams in the next compartment—a stranger who was in the carriage opened the door to see what was the matter, but we pulled him back again, as it was dangerous—when we got to Stratford we all got out, and I got into the carriage in which the woman was—I found her in a state of collapse—the prisoner and another man got out of the carriage—I called the attention of the railway officals to the woman, and she was taken out and placed on a seat on the platform; then the train went off—a porter came up and produced a book for the purpose of haveing their names taken—I did not see what was written—the proisoner and his friend wanted to fight anybody for £5 or £2—I did not take any notice, but went out of the station with the prosecutor and Holmes—the prisoner and his friend followed behind us; they still challanged us—at the coffee-stall the stranger who was with us proposed that he should supply coffee for the whole of us, and settle it up—we all stopped, and had some coffee—then Turner and Homes and I started home—when we had gone some distance I saw the prisoner and his friend following us; they caught us up at Maryland Point Station—Wilburn got in front of me, and snatched my pipe out of my mouth and struck at me—I wash too occupied with my struggle with him to see what took place between the prisoner and tell him to act like a man, and I saw the stick back to the prisoner and tell him to act like a man, an I saw the prisoner walk away with his friend, and immediately Turner called out he was stabbed—I went after a policeman at once—the prisoner and his friend were stopped about 300 yards away—I did not see anybody at Maryland Point except Turner, Holmes, myself, the prisoner and Wil-burn—there was certainly nobody near where the struggle took place.</p>

Spencer and Co."; that is my signature, but it was my wife's business—I am quite sure that, with reference to Cottenham Road, he said nothing about being an undischarged bankrupt—I did not tell him that in consequence of that, I must have the payments made in advance; I told him I had no more work for him without I had some more money, as his account was too big already, and then he came down to my yard, and we went right through the bill—that was on April 9th, 1899—he did not tell me before I did any work in Cottenham Road that he was id difficulties and was un<lb/>discharged, and I must have payment in advance—I quite contradict that; it is untrue—here are the payments I re-ceived from the starting of the job, seven or eight of them—September 17th, 1898, was the first payment, and I started work three weeks previous to that—he did not owe me a penny when I started the Oottenham Road job—up to January 20th I had done £110 worth of work for him, and a lot more—I supplied the stone he sent for—I have done the door-caps and other work up to January, 1899—Mr. Mayhoe had the accounts—when I had done my work I sent in an account, and did not make a copy of it—I cannot tell you what was due to me on January 21st, 1899, because there were little slips which the foreman put down in the shop, and we reckoned them up, and the slips were destroyed—I cannot say whether it was £1 or 1s. or £100—this is my receipt of February 21st, 1899, with a printed heading, "Received of Mr. Mayhoe, £23 5s."—we destroyed the papers on the settlement of the account—there was also a cheque for work which I had done in the Oottenham Road—that was paid into my bank, and was dis<lb/>honoured—the prisoner did not come to my office before March 11th and pay me tho whole of the amount in cash of the dishonoured cheque—I did not see him at that time—neither I nor my wife received £23 on account of the dishonoured cheque—my wife was in the hospital, and I was ill at the time, and did not see him for over a month—I thought it was still unpaid, and returned it to him because it was taken into account in the two dishonoured bills—here is in my ledger, "Mayhoe, February 21st, £23 5s." to my credit, but I swear that I have not received that—I do not keep clerks to keep my books—the prisoner has a paper showing how</p>
