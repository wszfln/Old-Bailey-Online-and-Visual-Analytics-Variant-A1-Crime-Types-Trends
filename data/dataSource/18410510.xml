                  </hi>. I live in George-street, Richmond. I know the prisoner James—I first knew him living at Kew, and afterwards at Rich<lb/>mond—about the 12th of January last he came to me with some duplicates of saddles, which he said his son had made while he was out of work, ill, and in distress—he said he wanted to make up a sum of money, and asked me to purchase the duplicates—I said I was not in the habit of doing so, but the first time I went to London I would take them out and bring them home, and if I could agree with him as to the price, I would have no objection—I took the saddles out of pawn, and about a week after he came to me for the money—I asked him what he wanted for them—he said he did not know, I was to give him what I thought a fair price—I gave him 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for one, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each for the two others—I gave him the balance, after deducting what I paid at the pawnbroker's—he came again, about a week after, with some more duplicates, for three gig-saddles and one stanhope-pad—he told me the same story as before, that he brought them from his son, who wanted some money to get him out of difficulties—I went to town to get them out—he came again, on the 23rd of January, with some more duplicates, for which I paid him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on the 27th he brought a saddle itself, which I purchased for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Ashman's was the only pawnbroker I went to to redeem the articles.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did you first know the prisoner James? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Twelve months previous—I knew him when he was master of the Queen's Grammar-school at Kew—I always understood him to be a very respectable man—on the 12th of January he said he came at the instance of his son—I knew the son was in the business—he was apprenticed at Twickenham—there was nothing secret in our dealing—it took place in my shop—I gave him a fair price.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in St. John's Grove, Richmond. I know the prisoner James—he came to my father in my presence—he said his son had been very ill for some time, and was out of work previous to that; that he had made several saddles, during his illness he had been obliged to pawn them, and he had the duplicates; if my father would take them out and keep them till he brought the money and paid for them, or allow him a fair price for them—these five gig and three hunting saddles were the ones given for the duplicates—I showed them to Mr. Buist in my father's counting-house—I was present, at about four different times, when my father saw the prisoner James—I got some of the saddles from Ashman's myself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> By what mark do you identify them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A mark I put on them in the shop as soon as I had shown them to Mr. Buist—they were redeemed, I believe, about the 9th of January—I made the mark on the 12th of March—they were in my possession all that time in the shop—I swear these are the saddles I brought from Ashman's—I made no mark on them when I redeemed them—we sold one hunting and two gig saddles—I have known the prisoner James two years, and never knew any thing wrong of him—there was nobody present at the transaction besides me and my father—we always do business in the counting-house—he said his son had been out of employ some time, and made the saddles himself, and being afterwards taken ill, was obliged to pawn them—my father was to pay him a fair value for them, or keep them till the father brought the money paid to the pawnbrokers—my father afterwards told him what he thought them worth, and he con<lb/>sented to take that, which was a fair value.</p>

I travel in the tea line at present—some time since I was in Whitecross-street for more than two years—I bad a situa<lb/>tion there the greater part of the time as crier and messenger—I remember Antrobus being there—I bad some conversation with him—he said if Norris would satisfy him he would go out of the way, and the prosecutor should not find him—he said he would certainly prosecute and transport him if he could, that be had suffered the punishment himself, and if he would pay him he would be off out of the country, and the prosecutor should not find him—he afterwards said that the prosecutor bad been there, and offered to pay his debt and liberate him from prison if he would give cer<lb/>tain evidence, for he was determined to get Norris transported if he could—I saw Antrobus a few days before he left—he said he had made ar<lb/>rangements with the prosecutor, and it was too late now for Norris to say any thing—I cannot say that he told me he bad given his evidence on his return from the Insolvent Court.</p>

On Wednesday night, the 7th of April, I was at the Black Bull public-house, Holborn—I had been cleaning the paint—after I had done it I had some bread and meat and porter—the prisoner came in, and asked for relief—I gave him some of the bread and meat and beet—he then went and sat down by the fire, by the side of which was a cupboard, containing my coat, with some letters in it—he sat a bit, and then went away—in half an hour I missed my coat—I did not know who had taken it, but seeing the prisoner come in without a bundle, and go out with one, I went in search of him—I found him on Saffron-hill—the letters which had been in my coat were found in his pocket, but the coat was gone.</p>

On the 12th of March I went, by his direction, to No. 2, Cooper's-court, Rose-mary-lane—West, Thompson, and Barnes were with me—I went into the room on the ground-floor, where the prisoner lodged—I did not see him at first—we made a distress on his goods, and had a warrant—I saw two or three females there—I believe one was the prisoner's wife—I told them what I came for, and showed the warrant—an inventory was made—I left Thomp<lb/>son in possession, and went to a room up stairs, in the same house, and while there, I beard a noise in the prisoner's' room—we had not seen the prisoner then—hearing a scuffle, I went down, and found Thompson out<lb/>side the prisoner's room—West was with me—I asked Thompson who had turned him out—West said, "Push the door open, and go in and take possession again"—we spoke loud enough to be heard inside, as the door is very thin—we asked the people in the room to open the door, and I heard a man's voice, which I afterwards found was the prisoner's, say, the first person who opened his door he would split his head open, but with what I do not know—we pushed the door open immediately, and in an instant I was struck with an axe on the forehead—it did not injure me much—it cut a place in my forehead, which bled a little—it cut through my hat—the axe had a short broken handle, as it has now—my forehead did not bleed a great deal—the mark was about half an inch with the graze—it cut through the skin, but was a very trifling cut—we called for a policeman who came—I afterwards went and got it strapped up—I was not stunned.</p>

On the after<lb/>noon of the 12th of March the prosecutor was brought to our shop—he had a cut of about a quarter of an inch, and about half an inch graze on his fore-head—it had cut through the skin and flesh, but very little below the surface of the skin—the edge of this axe would make such a wound—I do not think the back part of it would.</p>

Twinings, my bankers, on the Monday—it was returned in due course, saying, "No account"—I then went to Mr. Tucker's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Michael Saul, a cabinet-maker. Between ten and eleven o'clock at night, on the 12th of April, I was in the Robin Hood and Little John public-house with some friends—I was talking to my sister-in-law, and found the prisoner's band in my pocket—I had a purse in my pocket, and 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it, in half-crowns,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184105100043"/>
               <p>shillings, sixpences, and fourpenny-pieces—I detained the prisoner's hand there as long as I could—it was not out of my pocket when I seized it, but by a deal of exertion he got his hand out, and part of my purse and money came out with it—I seized him, and held him as tight as I could—I called for assistance—I have sworn that 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was out of my pocket.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, your sister talking to yon, and he having his. hand in your pocket, how long did you hold his hand in your pocket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As long as I could, some two or three minutes—my sister saw the struggle, decidedly, but she did not see the hand in my pocket—I accused another man of re<lb/>ceiving the purse, not of stealing it—I do not know how many persons were in the tap-room all this time—I did not count them—I know of five persons being in the tap-room, at the time of the robbery, besides my sister—none of them are here.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you reconcile this with stating that he had gone to the door, and that you only saw the hand of a man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not see the man—it was passed into the hand of a man apparently standing by—the prisoner left the tassel of my purse in my pocket, in his struggle—I had not been in the house half-an-hour—we had one bottle of ginger-beer and one pint of half-and-half between five of us—I did not go home with my sister that night—when Mr. May got into the room, I suppose he saw her—I paid the people honourably who crowned me Que of Kensall-green—I paid 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that was all—we are neighbours, and we live as neighbours—it is merely inhabited by cottagers—I dance to oblige them when I think proper—I don't dance in public-houses, and not very often on the green—we have a room there.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Sheep-lane, Hackney, about forty-eight yards from Clark's. On Wednesday, the 13th of January, about a quarter to two o'clock, I and my wife were standing at our door, and saw three men lurking about the garden in front of Clark's house, in a very suspicious manner—one of them, who was dressed in a light jacket, opened the garden-gate, went in, and walked towards the house—he stopped about as long as it would take a person to receive an answer, and returned again—I cannot see Clark's house from mine, only the garden—when the man re<lb/>turned to the gate, the other two joined him, and all went towards the house—they then returned again into the lane—they then went into Clark's garden again—I could see their backs when near the house, but no more—two of the three then left the garden together—the prisoner was one of those two—he was dressed in a dark rough Petersham coat—the one in the light brown jacket came out after the other two, in about half a mime—he had a bundle under his arm—he joined the other two in the lane—he handed the bundle to the man in a green coat, who took off his neckerchief and put it partly round the bundle, so as partly to con<lb/>ceal it—he then handed it to the prisoner, who put it under his arm and walked a little way with it—he then handed it to the man that brought it out of Clark's garden—they then walked down the lane, past the footway leading to my house, together—my wife then started to go to Mrs. Clark's, and inform her what we had seen—she called me, and I pursued the three men down the lane—as soon as the man who had the bundle under his arm saw the running, he ran away with the bundle—he turned into Waterloc<lb/>terrace, and I lost sight of him—the other two walked on—I pursued them about three-quarters of a mile down Hackney-road, as far as Warnerp<lb/>lace—when I got to the top of Warner-place, they were about a dozen yards before me—they turned round and looked very hard at me, and made as if they would come into Hackney-road again—I directly said, "I shall not leave you two gentlemen till I see a policeman"—they said, "What for? I don't know what you mean"—I said, "I will explain my meaning directly I see a policeman"—they walked down Warner-place—I kept close to them, and they still said, "What do you mean?"—I said, "I will satisfy you in part, I have seen a person in your company with stolen pro<lb/>perty; he has made his escape; if you take my advice you will call that party to restore the property to the lawful owner, and you will get into no further trouble; but if you do not, you will"—with that they took to their</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184105100054"/>
               <p>heels and ran away—I pursued them, but they escaped—I saw no more of the prisoner till the 7th of April, when I saw him in the Kingsland-road walking with another young man, between twelve and one o'clock in the day—I said nothing to him, but got a policeman and had him taken into custody—the prisoner was quite a stranger to me—I never saw him before the 13th of January—it was broad daylight when the robbery was com<lb/>mitted, and I spoke to him face to face—I was with him some minutes in Warner-place, and I have a firm recollection in my own mind that he is the man.</p>

I thought you were miles on the road to Brighton"—he said, "I am going by the night coach"—I bad got the bill—he gave it me when I advanced him the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went to his house on the following Saturday, and saw him—he said, "What do you want?"—I said, "I thought you were to call on me at seven o'clock on Friday evening, and pay me the money you owed me, what you were to receive from Brighton; "for he had promised that—he said, "I have got the money, d—your eyes"—I said, "Give it to me"—he said, "I have got the cheque"—I said, "Show me the cheque?"—he said, "It is at the banker's, I shall have the money af ten o'clock on Monday morning, d—your eyes—I will bring it to you," bet he did not bring it to me—when the bill became due, I took it to the banker's—it was not paid.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Spiller, an attorney in Retreat-place, Hackney. On the 4th of May, I served George Isitt with a subpœna at the Blue Anchor public-house, London-wall. I have seen him before—I knew him passing as Captain Isitt, about twelve months—I had occasion to call on him respecting a bill which came into the hands of Mr. Salomon, of Leadenhall-street—it was a bill accepted by this Capt. Isitt—he did not pay it.</p>

I worked for Mr. Stevens, and live in Dock-street—I saw Flynn take out some soap in a rosin-mat—I could tell it was soap, as one of the ends was open—the mat did not appear to be fastened by any cord<lb/>ing—there were two transactions—on the 7th of April I saw Flynn come down with the soap, and go to Barnes's house, about half-past six o'clock—this is the matting he took this last time—I was about twelve yards from Barnes's house—I did not see Barnes go in or out after I saw the soap car<lb/>ried in—if he had gone in, I must have seen him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Hardwick, in New Bonds street—he is in partnership with his son. On the 27th of April, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoners came into the shop, and Williams asked for some mouslin-de-laine—I showed her some—they purchased two yards and a half, which came to 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Williams then asked to look at some lace, and had two yards cut off, at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard—I observed her laying some whole pieces of lace towards Davis—they sat close together—Williams then asked the price of another piece of lace, holding it up away from Davis—when I looked back again I missed some lace off the counter, as she had drawn my attention in the direction she was holding the other piece, and when I looked again I missed some lace off the counter—I could not tell whether it was one or more pieces—she laid the lace aside two or three times, and it was taken off—after doing this once or twice, she made another purchase of two yards more, at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she did it again a third time, in the same manner, handing pieces of lace towards Davis, and then drawing my attention to another piece, by asking me the price again—they sat facing each other—Williams had her back to the window, and Davis her face to the window—she held it up towards (he window—I then cleared the counter of all the remainder of the lace, and requested them to walk with me into the counting-house—Davis asked what I wanted in the counting-house—I told her I should let her know when we got there—they got up from their seats, and Davis dropped a quantity of lace on the floor—I heard it drop, but did not see it—it was not on a card, it was in par<lb/>cels—I came round the counter, and saw it on the floor—I walked with them to the counting-house—I called Simmons, a policeman, leaving them in charge of Mr. Hardwick—Simmons took them into custody, but be<lb/>fore he left the counting-house, he pointed out two pieces of lace under the desk there—I took it up, and gave it to Simmons—we do not keep lace in the counting-house, and it was all squeezed into a heap, not as it is kept—the cut lengths are kept on cards, and the whole pieces as we have them in, not wrapped round any thing at all—one of the young men picked up the pieces of lace in front of the counter, gave them to me, and I put them in paper—I saw him take them off the ground before I went into the counting-house—he said he gave me the same pieces—he is not here.</p>

I know the prisoner—I let him some horses and <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>—I cannot specify the day he first began to have them, but the last was on the last quarter-day—he had them about six weeks in all, before he took them away—we entered into a verbal agreement—when he came to me first he wanted four horses and two <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>—I said I would let him them for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—that was agreed to—he was to pay a week in advance—he was not able to do it—he only paid 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I then said as he could not raise the money, he might have them by paying every morning a day in advance, which would be 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day; if he did not pay that, the bar—gain was to be at an end—he paid me that money every morning for six weeks, till the 7th of April, when he made off with the property—I never sold these things to him—I never signed a receipt for 78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., selling them to him—I went to Mr. Robinson's Repository on the 7th of April, and there found my three <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>, four horses, and two sets of harness—I had only let him two <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>, but there was another on the premises, which he took away at the same time—I did not allow him to take it away—he told me he had let it to a gentleman at 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.;. a week, and he had planned for the gentleman to have it that morning, but I found it at the Repository—he also took away another horse besides the four, under pretence of putting it to grass, because he had hurt his knee—I have never found that horse since.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you had the name of Barnes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Since I came to London—I formerly kept the Golden Lion public—house at Ipswich for twelve months—my name there was Creesey—it was kept by a widow, whom I married—she was 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in debt when I married her, which I had to pay as far as I could, and when I came to London I took my mother's name that they might not know where I was—the widow had kept the house seven years, and the debts were contracted before I married her—I paid 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was in a respectable farm under the Sheriff of Ipswich before that—the Sheriff was my landlord—I paid him what was due to him—when I left the farm he was in my debt 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for insurance, which I forgot to take off my last rent—I owed him nothing—I was a free man then—I married the widow, thinking to get something, instead of having anything to pay—I came away from Ipswich in a hurry on the 18th of October, and left the widow—she is not with me now—I have tied up so much a year to her for life—the house went for half, and after she was acquitted from all the debts, I left that to her—I have not got rid of all the debts yet—I was sued at Ipswich several times, and had executions against me—I took to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> line when I came to London about a fortnight before the 11th of October—I went to live at No. 711 Seymour—place, when I first came to London—from there I went to Homer—street for about ten weeks—I then went to No. 20, Oxford—street, for a month or six weeks—I then found a stable more convenient for my horses in Henrietta—street, Brunswick—square, where I am now —I moved from the other places, because the stables did not suit me, as I first had two horses and then four—I had no stable in Seymour—place, in Homer—street, or in Oxford—street—while I lived at those places, I had a stable by the side of the Edge ware—road—I have now moved, horses and all—I had other horses and <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> besides those I let the prisoner, which went in the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184105100083"/>
               <p>same rank—another horse and <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was let in the same way to a man named Ball—I lived on the profits—I am not in debt now, only for the widow—I have not cleared off all her debts yet—I bare been in trouble several times since I have been in London—I have been threatened to be arrested, and have had declarations and copies of writs after my goods as well as my person—I did not put away these things on that ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your oath, had you not executions against your goods before I you made this arrangement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never saw it till the prisoner told me so—I never parted with my goods—there was no execution till eight or ten weeks after I came to London, and that was a false one—I was told by the prisoner, when my horses stood in Edgeware-road, that there was a countryman backwards and forwards at the stable—I had told him the situation I was placed in, and he told me this to frighten me—I was going into the country, I was afraid somebody would be there after me, and I said to the woman up stairs, "I am going into the country, these things are Hockey's," merely that nobody might interfere with them while I was gone—I have never told anybody else so—I swear that, and I only said so, that the things might be safe till I came back—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>)—I cannot tell whose handwriting this is—it Is something like mine, but I would not swear it was my writing—I shall not say anything about it—I write different to that often—I always write one hand—I am not confident about this being my handwriting—it is something like it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at another paper</hi>)—this is not my handwriting—I swear that—I would not swear to the other one, there is a difference in the hand—they are not like each other—I always spell William with two 1's—it is impossible for me to say whether I sometimes sign with one 1—I do not know the Prince Regent public-house, in Seymour-place—I know different houses there, but not their names—I was not in Seymour-place with the prisoner on the 18th of March last—I was elsewhere—wherever I was in the habit of settling any business, and wherever he paid me, he always called for pen and ink, and took a receipt for what he paid me—I might have been in a public-house in Seymour-place with the prisoner when pen and ink was called for—he has called for it in twenty different houses in London, but on the 18th I was engaged buying a horse of a man in the street—the prisoner took a stable for these horses and <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>, by the side of the Edgeware-road—it was the stable I had—he moved from there to one in Sloane-street, of his own hire—the prisoner took away the other horse and <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> a fortnight before he took them all away—he had given me leave to put it in his yard, and said he would let it for me—he told me so at different times—I do not know when the first time was—I should think about three weeks after we had made the agreement—he kept telling me every morning that he would let it—I went to Robinson's Repository on the 7th of April, the things were to be sold on the 8th—I authorized a friend of mine to buy them in if they were sold very cheap—I paid a deposit of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and have left the remainder of them there ever since—I brought an action against Mr. Robinson before I paid the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave him notice first that the property was stolen, and was mine—I went before the Lord Mayor, and told him there was an order not to sell the property—he said he would sell it, which he did—he was nearly giving it away, and I said to a friend of mine named Austin, "You may as well buy it in"—Austin paid the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. after I brought the action—I paid the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by my attorney's advice—he said the property might be bought in as well</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184105100084"/>
               <p>by me as anybody else, it would not make any difference in the action—I don't know whether I was ever in any public-house at the corner of Regent-street—I don't know whether any money passed between me and the prisoner—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the second paper produced, called a receipt.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear you did not see that paper in a public-house in Regent-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is no mark on this paper—I cannot swear to it—it was a Mrs. Pearson I told about the horses and <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> being the prisoner's—that was very near six weeks before the 7th of April, I should say—he had but just taken the stable then—it was soon after the agree<lb/>ment was made—I thought it would perhaps make the things safe while I was gone, as he said there was a countryman after me every morning—I told Mrs. Pearson I was going down into the country, by the mail, that night—I asked Mr. Desborough, at Robinson's, if I paid the money would they let me have the things, but I did not offer it (Mr. Robinson had advanced 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on them when the prisoner took them there) Desbo<lb/>rough did not tell me I could—he said nothing to it—he did not say, I might see have them for that sum provided the prisoner consented—he said, "They must be put to the hammer"—I went to the Repository again and again, at different times, after my property, to see what was done with it—an appointment was made for me to come at a certain time, that I might see the prisoner, and I went with a policeman—there was not more than one appointment made—I went to a public-house opposite, and watched at the window for him, and told the policeman to watch for him—I did not tell the policeman I lived in the Edgeware-road—I told him I lived at No. 20, Molyneaux-street, Oxford-street, which is close by the Edgeware-road, not fifty rods from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not, in the presence of Desborough, sign your name twice over, for the purpose of enabling him to say whether the receipt was ge<lb/>nuine or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> signed a paper, but I do not know whether that is it or not—I signed a paper, to show my hand-writing—this has no mark on it to prove it is the same.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Robinson, who keeps a Repo<lb/>sitory in Little Britain. I know the prisoner—on the 7th of April he brought some <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> and horses, which he said he wanted to sell on the fol<lb/>lowing day, which was our auction day—he wished to have 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on ac<lb/>count —I asked whose they were—he said they were his property—Barnes afterwards came and claimed the property—when the prisoner came again</p>

               <p>I told him Barnes had claimed the property—he said that was all nonsense he had got his receipt for them, and he produced this paper—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"18 March, 1841. Received of George Hockey the sum of 78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for five brown geldings, and three street <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>, with two sets of single harness. Signed, William Barnes."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you known the prisoner before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he has been in the habit of buying and selling horses there—he came in his own name, and signed the entry in our book in his own name—Barnes afterwards bought the horses and <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>, and paid 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit on them—he has never since cleared them—he has taken away part of them—he paid 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more the next day—he has left one of the <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>—we were compelled to sell two of the horses by auction—he took away two horses and two <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>, and asked us to retain the other till he could get money—he wanted us to take some corn of him, and pay for the horses out of it—the remainder, which he did not clear, was sold on the Thursday follwing—I did not see Barnes sign this paper, but I have seen him write his name, and believe this paper to be his writing—the prisoner left the receipt with me—I be<lb/>lieve Barnes did not come to meet the prisoner by appointment—he pre<lb/>tended coming several times, saying he would give him in charge, but never did so; and Mr. Robinson said, "We will make an appointment ourselves; he is coming on such a day, you come"—he did come, and he was taken that very day—that was the only appointment I know of.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carriage-broker, at the corner of Homer-street, New-road—I know the prosecutor and prisoner well. On the 15th of February the prisoner called at my sale-yard—he asked me if I was agent to a person named Barnes, who had <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> to let on hire—I told him I was—he asked me the conditions—I told him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week each <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, in<lb/>cluding a set of harness and the duty—he paid me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. deposit—he was to go out with the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> on the following Monday, but could not find the money—he has said so much about Barnes, that it would take me two hours to tell all he said—he came one morning in February, and asked what I considered the worth of the whole of the countryman's property—Barnes went by the name of the <hi rend="italic">countryman</hi>—I told him I could not give him an answer to it directly—nothing more passed at that time—he re<lb/>peatedly called on me, and once he said he had stent that "the countryman" was in difficulties—that led to conversation, and he said, "I think, myself, the man is an insolvent, and that you will very soon see the Sheriff have the whole of his property"—some days after, he came and said, "I have got the right side of "the countryman" now, and he has made the whole of his property over to me"—I asked him why—he said he was in diffi<lb/>culties; that when he came down to the stable he <hi rend="italic">blowed him up</hi> for not grooming the horses in the usual way, and he (the prisoner) said, "Oh,</p>

               <p>some one else will have you before long"—and then he said, "Next day I <hi rend="italic">gammoned</hi> him that they were Sheriffs' officers that were after him"—I said, "Were they?"—he said, "No, but I <hi rend="italic">gammoned</hi> him that, to keep him from the stable"—he said he had told him so to intimidate him—he called on me on another day, very much excited, and spoke very ill and disrespect<lb/>fully of "the countryman"—he said he did not care, he would <hi rend="italic">serve</hi> him out before long, that he had already planned it, that he should have two or three respectable witnesses present at the stables in Burwood-mews, and he afterwards told me that they were all ready—he told me he bad previously seen "the countryman," and told him there was a Sheriff's officer after him, and if he was not taken, his property would be, and be had planned for them to be present, to hear him admit that it was his property, and not the countryman's—I do not remember any thing else that he said that day—there were many other times—once he came to the yard, looked at a whip, and asked the price—I said 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said, "Will you credit me?"—I said, "No"—he then said he bad paid "the countryman" within 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or something very short of the money, and that was all the money he had—some time after I was with Barnes in Chapel-street—we caught sight of the prisoner—as soon as he saw us he ran away as hard as he could—that was the day the horses were sold.</p>

I instantly broke the door open—he was very violent—another officer was with me—we overpowered him and took him into cus<lb/>tody—the prosecutrix wrote her name, "Ann Eliza Pattman," at the station, and I heard her give that name at the police-office, in the prisoner's presence.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 25th of February, I was in the service of William Orr—the prisoner was occasionally in his employ as a labourer, for nearly twelve months—I was told to watch him, and about quarter after six o'clock that evening, he came to do up the horses as usual in the stable—he locked the door, and went away with a bundle under his arm—I said, "Lack, what have you got there?"—he said, "Why, don't make a noise, I can put them back"—I then said, "If you have got nothing you are ashamed or afraid of, come round with me to the governor? I have his orders to watch you, and have done so"—he said he would not go round, he should be obliged to see him in the morning—we walked down the yard together, and as he would not go with me, I took the parcel from him, and took it to Mr. Orr—I opened it in Mr. Orr's presence, it contained fifteen brushes—I left them at Mr. Orr's—I left the prisoner at the end of the gateway, talking to Perry the car<lb/>penter, and when I returned in a quarter of an hour he was gone.</p>

I had written to a friend for, I bad no other intention than to redeem them. I might also urge my wife's illness, but, however, must throw myself entirely on the mercy of the Court. The only explana<lb/>tion that it appears necessary to trouble the Court with, regards the dates on which the articles were <hi rend="italic">actually</hi> pledged, and those on which they <hi rend="italic">appear</hi> by the tickets to have been pledged, which are wholly at variance; for instance, the spoons and a table-cloth were pawned about five weeks ago, and the table-cloth taken out three weeks after, when a fresh ticket was issued for the spoons, by which means it would appear by the tickets that the spoons and sheets were pledged on the same day, whereas they were pawned at intervals of a week and fortnight. The same remark holds good as to several other articles. I have been induced to enter into this explanation from a remark made by the Magistrate's clerk to the effect that the sums received on certain days were more than my absolute wants required, and therefore distress could not have driven me to the commission of the offence."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private in the 54th regiment of foot. On the morning of the 6th of May I was in company with Adams, another private—he had a girl with him—he was before me with her—I was going along Sudley-street, that leads to Nelson-place, and from there to the City-road—as I was going along I saw a woman, and the prisoner in her rear, coming from the City-road—the prisoner had two small parcels under his arm, and one in his hand—when I came up the woman said, "Here is some person coming"—there was a small lane at his right hand—he wheeled down this lane, but before he wheeled he dropped these packages—he dropped two first, and then dropped one—I picked up one, to see what it was—he went on a little further, and it appeared to me that he went into a house—that lane is the first turning on the right-hand in going down Nelson-place from the City-road—I went on after Adams, called him back, and told him what was going on—he went on with his woman—I went on, and applied to the policeman—I gave him a description of the person who dropped the packages—I after that found a truss in Nelson-place—the prisoner must have passed near that package in coming along —saw the truss about half-an-hour after—I saw the prisoner when he was taken by the policeman—I am sure he is the man that dropped them—it was as bright as day—I have no doubt about him—I saw him again in half-an-hour.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 815.) I was on duty at the bridge at Great Ilford on the 14th of April, at half-put five o'clock in the morning, and saw the prisoner at the back of a cart, with three horses to it, loaded with straw—he looked at me very hard, and 1 looked at the top of the cart—the tilt did not appear to lie flat on the top—I went up to the prisoner, and asked what he had got on the top of his cart—he scratched his head, and said, in a muttering tone, that he had got food for his horses—I told him I suspected he had got more than he ought to have, and or<lb/>dered him to stop his horses—he made no observation—I got on the load, removed the tilt, and saw two sacks, one of chaff, and one of mixed com, a truss of hay, and a bundle of green rye—he had five nose-bags hanging on the side of the cart—four of them were full of corn, and the other three-parts full of turnip-tops—I saw a bundle of hay in the hind ladder of the cart—the sacks had "George Biggs, Longbridge, Barking," on them—I then told the prisoner to turn his horses' heads round to the station-house gates, which he did—I took the property off the cart, and put it into the yard, went to the prosecutor, and he came to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer at Barking. The prisoner was my horsekeeper—on the day in question he was allowed three nose-bags of corn, and about a bushel of mixed corn, to supply them when empty, but no more—it is not long since I had a case here before, and I gave very particular instructions that they should take no more than one tack, and a small bundle of hay, to feed the horses, and I took off part of the allow<lb/>ance of hay, because they had green meat cutting at that time—he had no right to have the truss of hay which was found on the top of the cart, nor to have so much at the back—he had no right, to have more than three nose-bags, nor to have two sacks of mixed corn—he was going to Clapton that day, I believe, which is about nine miles from Barking—he would have been back that same day—he would not want any thing like that quantity—the horses could not have eaten it in three or four days—I repeat<lb/>edly forbad him taking more than I have stated—I saw the property at the station, and knew it to be mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sexton to the parish of Woodford, in Essex—the prisoner was grave-digger to the parish—he has been to ever since he was a boy. On the 2nd of May a young woman named Charlotte By-water, was buried in the churchyard—she was the daughter of poor people—her father is a basket-maker—her grave was four feet two inches deep—it was properly filled up after the funeral—I saw it again on Monday af<lb/>ternoon, the 3rd of May, about five o'clock—it was then apparently in the same state as on the Sunday—the father of the young woman watched the grave on the Sunday night, and on the Monday night—on Tuesday after<lb/>noon I was walking round the churchyard, and noticed the grave was in a deranged state—it had been dug up, and the earth removed—I went to the prisoner's house—he was in bed—I desired his wife to call him—I asked him how the grave came to be in that state—he seemed much con<lb/>fused, and said he had dug it out to put the child in—(a child of the same family, which had been buried six months before, was taken up to bury this body, and ought to have been put in again)—I told him it was no such thing, that the grave never was dug out in that way to put a child in—we had then gone to the grave—I desired him to dig out the earth that I might see the coffin—he was very much agitated, and wanted to dig at the foot of the coffin—I insisted on his digging at the head—he did so, but was very much agitated, and could not throw the earth out—he went for a pickaxe, and while he was gone, I removed some of the earth, and to my horror, when I had taken hold of a piece of wood, the face of the body laid quite bare—I saw the coffin had been opened—when the pri<lb/>soner came back, 1 said to him, "Dick, you villain, how could you do</p>

               <p>such a thing as this?"—he said, "I did not do it, I know nothing about it—nobody can say I did"—I sent for the churchwarden, and afterwards had all the earth dug out—I found a portion of the lid of the coffin loose—it had been cut off about the shoulder, and the head of the lid was at the foot—this chisel—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—is mine—it had been about my place—it had been used in scraping chairs, and so on—the prisoner had access to it—I compared this chisel with the marks on the coffin, and am quite sure this chisel must have made the marks on the coffin—the body could have been removed in a very few minutes.</p>

On the morning in question, I was disturbed by Lovell—I got up and saw these articles which I can positively swear to—the greatest part of them are branded with the mark of the Union—they are the property of the guardians—the prisoner was formerly a pauper in the workhouse, and was employed in the kitchen as a cook, for about eight months—he left on the 26th of March—he had no business on the premises after that—his employment as cook would give him an opportunity of knowing where every thing was kept—the inner door is not kept locked—it is left open for the convenience of the men who have to work early in the morning—if a person got over the wall, he could get into the kitchen, but no further, as all the other part is locked up—I saw the prisoner's shoes compared with the marks, and they appeared to corre<lb/>spend exactly.</p>

On the evening of the 25th of April I was in a public-house at Woolwich, about eight o'clock—the prisoner came in, and I gave her a glass of gin—I was then going to my bar<lb/>racks—she came after me, and asked me to go to her room with her—I went there—she put her arms round my waist, and I found her hand in my pocket—I lost a half-sovereign and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had it in my pocket as I went up to the room, and no one could have taken it but her—I came out and found a policeman—the prisoner could not be found for some time—I found her in the public-house again, and gave her into custody.</p>

On Friday evening, the 23rd of April, I saw the prisoner's great-coat on a nail in the bed-room occupied by him, myself, Withers, and Craig—I looked into the pocket of it, and found three pieces of lace—I looked into the pocket in consequence of a young man telling me he had found some lace there—I put them back into the pocket, and informed Mr. Shields—I locked the coat up in the state it was in, in my box, and kept the key till Mr. Stagg came home—it was in the same state when I took it out, and it was hung on the same peg as before—I remained in the room when Mr. Stagg and the prisoner left it to go down to tea—nobody came into the room till Mr. Stagg and the prisoner returned—I saw nobody put any lace into the pocket, nor did I put any in myself—the lace Mr. Stagg took out, was what I had found in the coat—I believe them to be our patterns, hot could not swear to that lace—on the day before, the prisoner had the box of thread lace on the counter, and was saying what a good stock of lace we bad—I saw him se<lb/>veral times with the box on "the counter—he appeared to admire one par<lb/>ticular</p>

The prisoner came into my service eighteen months ago as needle-woman, and afterwards to take charge of the empty hoube which I had taken it Pensbury—I had taken the house, but it was not ready for my reception—I removed my things there last March'twelve months—they consisted of clothes, plate, books, and various other things—I was in the habit of using part of them, the others were kept locked up in different rooms in the house—the prisoner knew where—the keys were placed in a bag—I kept my plate in a tin case under my bed for some time, and after that in a room where my niece was—I have frequently inquired of the prisoner for the keys of different places in the house, and they were lost in basket when I went to Brighton—I had seen it a very few weeks before I found it at the pawnbroker's—I asked her about this tea caddy when I returned home, on the 17th, or a few days afterwards, and she said, "Is it not there, Maam?" meaning on the drawers, where it was usually kept—I said, "It is not"—she said, "Then it is in the closet"—I looked in, and put the closet to rights entirely, and it was not there—she then said, "It must be in the glass case"—I said, "That is impossible, it is not its place"—she then said, "It roust be in the tin case"—when she went to the empty house she said her husband must go with her, and a man, whom she represented as her husband, came to live afterwards in the house where I was residing—there is no pretence for saying that any impropriety ever passed between me and him—he was a most horrid fellow, swearing and drinking continually—the prisoner left the house on Easter Monday, without giving me any notice—I did not know where she was gone to—I expected her to return that night—I never saw her till she was in custody—after I found she had left in this manner, I sent on the Wednesday for the police and the locksmith—when the policeman came, I asked him to go up stairs and look into her room—the door was fast, and as I did not wish to break the lock, the locksmith got in at the window—he found the door was not locked, but fastened by a night bolt and the tape—he unfastened it, and let the policeman in—when the policeman got in, I found a small box belonging to the prisoner—several of these duplicates Were found in it, five or six between the bed and mattress, some in a bottom drawer, one or two in the finger of her</p>
