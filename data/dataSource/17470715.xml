            </rs>.</p>
               <p>Attorney-General. My Lord, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, the Prisoner at the Bar, stands indicted for the Breach of a late Act of Parliament, made in the 19th of his present Majesty. And it was, Gentlemen , an Act of Parliament, the Legislature found necessary to be made, in order to prevent a Practice grown to that Height that cannot be borne in this Kingdom, and that is the Practice of smuggling, and a Practice attending smuggling; and that is an armed Force, by which this Kingdom is put into great Distress; by which they act in defiance of the Laws of the Country; that it became absolutely necessary, for the Legislature to consult some Method more effectually to suppress them; for these are Crimes of too high a Nature, to be admitted of in any Country where Laws are made. In the 19th of his present Majesty, it is enacted, That if any Persons shall go, to the Number of three, with Firearms or other offensive Weapons; shall from, and after the 24th Day of July 1746, be assembled in order to the assisting in carrying away uncustomed Goods, or Goods liable to pay any Duties; every Person so offending, being thereof lawfully convicted, shall be adjudged guilty of Felony, and shall suffer Death without Benefit of Clergy.</p>
               <p>And, Gentlemen, for the more easy and speedy bringing the Offenders against this Act to Justice; it is enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if any Person or Persons, shall be charged with being guilty of any of the Offences aforesaid, before any one or more of His Majesty's Justices of the Peace, by Information of one or more credible Person or Persons , upon Oath by him or them subscribed; such Justice of the Peace, before whom such Information shall be made as aforesaid, shall forthwith certify under his Hand and Seal, and return such Information , to one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174707150003"/> of the Principal Secretaries of State of His Majesty, who is thereby required to lay the same, as soon as conveniently may be, before His Majesty in his Privy-Council ; whereupon it shall, and may be, made lawful, for His Majesty to make his, or their, Order, in his or their Privy Council, thereby requiring, and commanding such Offender or Offenders , to surrender himself or themselves, within the Space of 40 Days, after the first Publication thereof in the London Gazittes , which Order, the Clerks of His Majesty's Privy Council, shall cause to be forthwith printed and published, in the two successive London Gazettes , and to be forthwith transmitted to the Sheriff of the County, where the Offence shall be committed , who shall within 14 Days after the receipt thereof, cause the same to be proclaimed, between the Hours of ten in the Morning, and two in the Afternoon, in the Market-Places , upon the respective Market-Days, of two Market-Towns in the same County, near to the Place where such Offence shall have been committed; and a true Copy of such Order, shall be affixed upon some publick Place, in such Market-Towns; and in case such Offender or Offenders, shall not surrender himself or themselves, pursuant to such Order of His Majesty, or escaping after such Surrender, shall from the Day appointed for his or their Surrender, as aforesaid, be adjudged, deemed, and taken to be convicted and attainted of Felony, and shall suffer Death, (as in Cases of a Person convicted and attainted, by Verdict and Judgment, of Felony) without Benefit of Clergy .</p>
               <p>The Prisoner at the Bar, has (for a long Time ) been conversant with a Set of Smugglers, and has been one of the principal of them, whose Business was to go to the Water-side in Gangs, with Muskets, Pistols, Blunderbusses , and all other Sorts of Arms, to protect themselves in that illegal Practice.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner was one of the Gang that went by the Name of the Hawkhurst Gang , where they have made themselves pretty famous, by the Terror they have spread in the Country: The Prisoner with about 40 others, met together in a Place called <placeName id="t17470715-1-crimeloc3">Folkstone</placeName>

               <p>These Facts I have now stated , comes within the Words of the Act of Parliament ; but in order to have an Opportunity of trying of him or them in a proper and speedy way, there was an Order made by the King and Council, pursuant to the Direction of the Act of Parliament, in order to have the Proclamation made (as hath been beforementioned) but it happen'd by the Mistake of the Sheriff , that he did not cause the Proclamation to be made at the precise Time that it should have been done; the Consequence of which is, that he cannot be try'd upon that Proclamation; but the principal Fact itself we shall lay before you, which is, That he was one of the Number of above forty , who joyn'd in the very Act of Smuggling.</p>
               <p>If (Gentlemen) the Fact appear in the Manner I have stated, you will find him guilty.</p>

            , I was carried away in the Year 1744 by a Gang of Smugglers down to Hawkburst ; and we were carried down to the Place were the Prisoner at that Time lived, and he did prevent a great deal of Mischief that would have been done. I believe he was the chief Instrument of saving our Lives at that Time.</p>

               <p>Bolton. He oftentimes prevented their Striking; he often laid hold of them. He discover'd their Plots in order to send us over Sea to be Galley-Slaves.</p>

             , Constable. What have you to say against the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Morris. The Prisoner at the Bar I had got a Warrant for, concerning some Scales and Things that were lost in the New Market. At almost twelve o'Clock on Sunday , the 28th of June there were three or four People came running, and said, there was the Man that you have a Warrant against. He was soon to sell the scarlet Cloak in our Neighbourhood; and they said they watch'd him into a Twopenny House in Chick-Lane. So I went directly and found him there. He had the Tea-Chest and Tablecloth before him. The Bonnet he had sold. There were three or four Women with him. I told him he might stay to drink out his Gin. He would have thrown the Bundle from him, but I prevented him. I told him I would take Care of the Bundle. I said you must go along with me, I have got a Warrant against you, so I had him before Justice Poulson; where he own'd he had sold the Cloak in Field-Lane for 2 s. He said it was near the Gullyhole , and I went there and found it; and the Woman brought it before the Justice.</p>

               <p>The Prisoner in his Defence said, that he found this Bundle near Holborn-bars , and he open'd it, and pull'd the Cloak out, and offered it to every one as he came along; and some bid him 1 s. and when he came to this Woman in Field-Lane she gave him 2 s. for it. <rs id="t17470715-2-verdict9" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>As the Prisoner could lay no Claim to the Goods they were ordered to the Owners thereof; and the Prisoner desired and claim'd the Benefit of his Majesty's Act of Grace.</p>
               <p>One Ambler, an Officer, appear'd in Court , and gave the Prisoner an exceeding bad Character ; and said , that he had a great many Writs against him at that time , and begg'd leave of the Court to arrest him. There were Counsel employ'd against him, who began to expatiate upon his Wickedness: a marrying several Women with three or four hundred Pounds Fortune and ruining them . But the Court refus'd hearing the Counsel, as the Offence the Prisoner was then charg'd with came within the Limits of the Act of Grace .</p>

               <p>Akens. I can't say positively as to the Time, but it was shut about nine o'Clock. I have a Kitchen next my Shop. I had left the Shop but a few Minutes , but I heard the Sash go up, it might be about ten o'Clock. I came into the Shop, and miss'd the Stuff, and cry'd out I was robb'd.</p>
               <p>Q. What Sort of Stuff was it?</p>
               <p>Akens . It was a brown Cloth Sattin Stripe, twenty eight Yards, it cost me 1 l. 12 s.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see it before?</p>

             . I live opposite to Mrs Akens's , and I heard an Outcry of Thieves; and I saw the Witness, who was an Accomplice, come up Wapping, and I was the first that laid hold of him, on Saturday Night, and carried him to Mrs Akens's House, and went with him the next Day before the Justice. He said he was in Company with two more, with Studder and Newman . He said they flung up the Sash, and took out this Lace and a Piece of Stuff out of the Window, and they went down the Yard and came up again, as it was no Thoroughfare.</p>

             . I was upon the Watch. I was sent to to take up Goodwin the Witness. So I sent out the Watchman, and he took up the Piece of Lace in the Street, and Mrs Akens own'd the Lace, but the Witness would not confess that he was concern'd till the next Morning, that he was brought before the Justice.</p>

So, says she, walk in; so she brought me into her House. I thought it was a Publick House . When I came into the House I saw a great many People, so I was afraid. I was going back again, and the Woman that invited me in came to me, and said, Don't be afraid , walk in; so I followed her, and went up one Pair of Stairs , and set myself down at a Table. So they ask'd me what I wanted to drink? I said I did not care for any Thing. I said, if you want to drink you may ; so they brought up some Stuff, Gin, or something. So while they were drinking this Woman took hold of my Neck, and robbed me of my Stock-Buckle . So they called me so many Names; so they wanted me to go out of the House. I said here is a Shilling if you will let me have my Buckle again , so she sweared very much.

I heard a Disturbance in the Alley; when I came down there were four or five Fellows in the House, and the Gentleman said, if he knew of any Constable he would charge her. I did not let him know what I was. This Woman, the Prisoner, was out of the House. I heard him say, he would give a Shilling for it. This was a noted bad House, and it is routed since.

I took hold of the Gentleman that had lost the Handkerchief, and ask'd him, if he had not lost an Handkerchief? And he said, he had. And the Gentleman that laid hold of the Prisoner was thrown down by the Prisoner's Accomplices, while we were carrying the Prisoner along to the Watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What said the Prisoner, when he was apprehended?</p>
               <p>Pugh. He was very bullying, and said, he would take us up for an Assault. There were two or three Men attempting to rescue him from us.</p>

As my Brother was to go out of Town the next Day I desir'd he would stay . I being call'd up, he removes of his own accord to a Seat the other side of the Compter. There was one Servant in the Warehouse backward , and coming in, as he says, he saw him put a Cannister under his Coat . I was then call'd down Stairs, and he was then walking off , and he search'd him, and found the Tea upon him.</p>

            , we lost a Carpet, seven Cups and Saucers, and three Prints; all lost the 7th Day of May. There was the Print of the Duke of Cumberland , another of Mr Handel, the other of Mr Hebden. I lost these Things that Night the Fire was at our House . I have nothing to say against the Prisoner, but I found the Goods in his Apartment the 13th of June.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is his Apartment?</p>
               <p>Brown. In Prince's-street, Cavendish square .</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to his Apartment.</p>
               <p>Brown . Because I had a Servant that went into the same House to lodge, and she told me she saw our Carpet upon his Floor; so I got a Search-Warrant, and found the Things there. The Carpet was on the Ground, two of the Prints were on the Chest of Drawers. The Cups and Saucers were set out in the Closet.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Seal . I saw the Carpet in his Lodgings. I can't say directly the Day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you live with Mr Abraham Brown?</p>
               <p>Seal. Yes, Sir, I liv'd there almost two Years. I saw the Carpet through the Door, and I told my Mistress of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other Thing?</p>
               <p>Seal. No, Sir, not till they had a Justice's Warrant, then I saw the Prints and the other Things. My Mistress ask'd Mrs Laurence , how she came by the Things? And she did not know any Thing of them. When we came before the Justice he said, he went out of Town, and he desired his Wife to inquire about the Things, and deliver them. Part of one of the Frames was left in my Master's House.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any Thing before the Justice, how he came by those Things?</p>
               <p>Seal. He said a Person brought them. Mrs Laurence was before the Justice first; and when he came home and heard where she was gone he went before the Justice; so the Justice took him and discharg'd his Wife.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. Now is your Time to make your Defence.</p>
               <p>Laurence. I was at my Lord Harcourt's to dress a Dinner, and stay'd late that Night the Fire was; as I was coming Home a Gentleman's Servant came to my Door; for God's sake, says he, a Fire is at our House, take these Things, and I'll call To-morow . I says, do you know me? My Name is Laurence .</p>

             . I live in Clerkenwell close , I am a Tenant to Justice Hole . The young Man, the Prisoner, was Apprentice to me, and I never desire a better than he was. He has work'd Journey-work with me ever since, except about a Twelvemonth . I was the most surpriz'd to hear this, he was so sober a Man, I thought he would not have done this Fact . Whilst he was an Apprentice he belong'd to a Religious Society, and received the Blessed Supper; but when he gets a little Liquor he is like a Mad-man .</p>

They tell me, you came in two or three Times ; that you popp'd up and down several Times into the Room, and play'd the Gambles before them ; yet for all that the poor young Man would not touch you. Now this is a different Sort of a Story you told in another Place. Pray explain this Story, of his getting you up Stairs; you say he pull'd you up, Did any Body assist him?</p>

             . What have you to say against the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Norton. I was at Dinner when the Thing happen'd, and I heard a Noise over my Head.</p>
               <p>Q. What Sort of Noise was it?</p>
               <p>Norton. I heard this young Woman cry out Murder, and I went up Stairs directly by myself. When I went up Stair I push'd the Door open.</p>
               <p>Q. When you broke the Door open, did you go into the Room?</p>
               <p>Norton . Yes; and I saw them both a-top of the Bed.</p>
               <p>Q. In what Posture were they?</p>
               <p>Norton. She with her Coats up; and his Breeches were down, and a-top of her. As soon as ever I came into the Room I took hold of him, and draw'd him off from the young Woman, and never spake a Word to him, good, bad, or indifferent.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you not to speak to him, when you heard the Cry of Murder?</p>
               <p>Norton . I never spake to him, but took her down Stairs directly, and never chang'd one Word with him at all.</p>
               <p>Court . As you went down Stairs with her, Did she say any Thing to you?</p>
               <p>Norton. She cry'd, and said, she would fetch a Warrant for him , and have him before the Justice.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174707150017"/>Court. When she went into the Kitchen , what did she say before the Company there?</p>
               <p>Norton. I can't say.</p>
               <p>Q Who was in the Kitchen ?</p>
               <p>Norton. There was the Cook, the Gardener, and this little Lad.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else there?</p>
               <p>Norton. No, Sir, not as I know of.</p>

               <p>Norton . I believe they were in the Parlour .</p>
               <p>[Cross examined.]</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you when you went up stairs?</p>
               <p>Norton. Neither of them went up with me.</p>
               <p>Council. How came they not to go up, when they heard such a dreadful Cry of Murder; you say there were three in the Kitchen at the time of this out-cry, and none of them stired.</p>
               <p>Norton . I had her off the Bed, before I saw any of them.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you whether you did not swear they were at the stairs-head , when you forced the Door open?</p>
               <p>Norton . No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you never any Discourse with any body, that you wanted 100 Guineas to make up this Matter ?</p>
               <p>Norton. No, not to my Knowledge , I did not.</p>
               <p>Council . I will put you in mind, whether you did not say so to your Mistress.</p>
               <p>Norton . I don't know that I did, not to my Knowledge, I did not.</p>
               <p>Council . Did you or did you not?</p>
               <p>Norton . I did not as I can remember .</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the Prisoner's Master, had you any Discourse with him upon it?</p>
               <p>Norton. Yes, Sir, and he would have had me have made it up; he asked what the young Woman would have to make it up; I said I did not know what she would have to make it up; I was ordered to go by Mr Cooper .</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you did not tell the Prisoner's Master, you would have 100 Guineas ?</p>
               <p>Norton. Not to my Knowledge, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was to have been your Share of the 100 Guineas; what would you have got so much and you have nothing of it; supposing they had entrusted you with the 100 Guineas , what would you have done with them?</p>
               <p>Norton . She was to have them; Mr Cooper came along with me, to see if I could make it up.</p>
               <p>Council. You are sure she cry'd Murder?</p>
               <p>Norton. I heard her cry out Murder once or twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this before you got up Stairs, or after ?</p>
               <p>Norton. Before.</p>
               <p>Council . And when you had brought her down, I ask you whether you did not insist upon it, that she should swear a Rape, and she refused it before the People?</p>
               <p>Norton. No.</p>
               <p>Q I ask you upon your insisting upon this, whether the Cook did not take her into the dark Room?</p>
               <p>Norton . I never saw the Cook take her into this dark Room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the Cook and she go somewhere?</p>
               <p>Norton . I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Council . Recollect whether you miss'd her for any Time.</p>
               <p>Norton. Yes she might, while I was out about my Business .</p>
               <p>Q. What, did you leave this poor Girl in the same bad Company that would not come to her Assistance?</p>
               <p>Norton . Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you that he had beat her?</p>
               <p>Norton . She did not tell me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you pulled her off the Bed?</p>
               <p>Norton. Yes.</p>
               <p>Council. Then you do not agree in the Story that she was in, that she was off the Bed when you came up Stairs.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner . What do you say for yourself?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am absolutely innocent of what I am charged with; I had rather be excused speaking if your Lordship pleases .</p>
               <p>Q to - Potter. Do you remember this Girl's going up Stairs?</p>
               <p>Potter. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went up with her?</p>
               <p>Potter. The Prisoner followed her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you apprehend she was up , before she was down again?</p>
               <p>Potter. To the best of my Knowledge about 5 Minutes.</p>
               <p>Council. During the Time that you was at Dinner in the Kitchen, did you hear any Out-cry of Murder ?</p>
               <p>Potter. I heard her Cry out William, I heard her laugh at the first .</p>
               <p>Court. You did not think there was any Force of Violence.</p>
               <p>Potter. No; I heard no Cry of Murder, but William , William, upon which William went up-stairs ; and I followed him up-stairs, and went directly into the Room.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see there?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174707150018"/>Potter. I saw the young Woman upon the Bed, upon her Knees , with her Cloaths under her.</p>
               <p>Council . So then her Cloaths were not up.</p>
               <p>Potter. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the young Gentleman's Breeches down?</p>
               <p>Potter . No.</p>
               <p>Council . Then you say upon your Oath, his Breeches were not down, nor her Petticoats up.</p>
               <p>Potter . They were not; Norton abused the Gentleman, he was in a great Passion, I thought he would have struck him.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you whether the young Woman complained of being beat, or any other Injury.</p>
               <p>Potter. She told before us all in the Kitchen, that the Gentleman had never meddled with her, and what should she go before the Justice for.</p>
               <p>Court . Who urged her to go before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Potter. Norton, he said she should go before the Justice, and if she wanted Money, he would supply her ; she declared that the Gentleman had done her no manner of Harm.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present in the Kitchen or in the dark Room, when there was some Conversation past between Lucy and the Cook.</p>
               <p>Potter. Mr Cook took her into the dark Room, and Norton flew into a Passion , and insisted upon her going before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Council. I would ask you how you came to follow the Hostler up-stairs, when you heard no Noise but the Cry of William .</p>
               <p>Potter. Only because he flew into such a Passion, upon her crying out William , William.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to be so jealous?</p>
               <p>Potter. He was very intimate with her.</p>
               <p>Council. Do you think he had Conversation with her ?</p>
               <p>Potter . He had as often as they could.</p>
               <p>Council. I have heard Stories of Haylosts , and Stables , &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Potter . She bears the Character of a very loose debaucht Girl, in the Town.</p>

I was at the House at this Time, the young Man was a little drowsy after Dinner, with that the Maid was called to let down the Bed, they ran up and down stairs, one after another ; I thought one to be as willing as the other ; by-and-by the Landlord came into the Room, and said there was something a doing above-stairs , for Nan was crying out; when I went into the Kitchen, the Girl was come down ; I said you don't seem to be hurt, she seemed very lively and pert, and said she cry'd out that she might not be hurt; but the Hostler was very forward to prosecute , she did not seem to have any Inclination for it herself.</p>

             , and Norton, and an old Woman, came to me and informed me, that there was a young Gentleman at the George and Vulture , that had attempted to commit a Rape ; I asked her how he behaved; Lucy said he behaved well for a Day or two , but that Afternoon he had some Complaint , and he wanted to have his Bed let down; she said he attempted to lie with her, she said he took up he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174707150019"/> Coats ; I said if they come to me , she must tell the Truth ; she said he did put his Hand up her Coats\ and took hold of her private Parts ; I said did he lie with you, or did he not; and the Girl declared he did not lie with her; I says, do you know this Gentleman; she said she did not; I said, if the Hostler could find out his Friends, and get something of Satisfaction . I found, upon enquiry, this Girl had but an indifferent Character ; I went to the Prisoner's Master, and told him, I thought it most adviseable , to go down and endeavour to make an End of it, and the Hostler asked 200 Pounds ; I said to them, I believed his Friends would be willing to offer some little Compliments for Incivilities ; they applyed to me to carry on the Prosecution, if they could not make it up with the Prisoner's Master; upon my refusal , they applied to one Mr Moore, of Holborn.</p>
               <p>This Solicitor or Attorney, was called upon several times, and sent after, but could not be found, in order to be brought into Court, to answer for his undertaking such a Cause .</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr Cooper . Do you know any thing of this young Woman's Character ?</p>
               <p>Cooper. She has a bad Character in our Neighbourhood, I had it from my Father and her own Mother.</p>
               <p>- Walker. This Lucy and the Hostler, came to me some Time after this Affair happened , and the young Woman told me her Mistress had turned her away; she said this young Gentleman had pull'd and haul'd her about ; I said, what he has run up and down-stairs after you; she held down her head, and said, there was something more than that; I said, has he lain with you; and she said, no Madam he has not. The Man was without, so I call'd him in, and I said, what have you to say in this Affair , concerning this young Spark; I don't know (says he) Madam, he has used herill ; I said you have an honest Wife, and what Business have you with it; he said it was hard; I said here she stands, she says he has not lain with her; I said I fancy you make a Mistake , 'tis you that have lain with her; for he owned to me, that he had lain with her .</p>

               <p>Moulds . Yes, Sir, I have known her for about half a Year.</p>
               <p>Q What Character does she bear?</p>
               <p>Moulds. A very indifferent one .</p>
               <p>Q. What Character did she bear before January last ?</p>
               <p>Moulds . A very bad one .</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs Jaques . She says when this young Gentleman exprest an Inclination to go and lie down , you bid her go and turn down the Bed ; and she expresses something , as if you incouraged these Freedoms; did you use such an Expression , that it would be an Honour for her to lie down by a young Gentleman.</p>
               <p>Jaques. Upon my Oath I did not ; the young Gentleman said he was very sleepy, and he wanted to lie down; I said to him, yes, you may lie down, there are Beds enough in the House, you may lie down upon any; so the young Gentleman went up one Pair of Stairs; she went up I believe to turn the Bed down , so she run backward and forward, but I did not imagine any thing of this Affair; afterwards I went to her, and asked her what had been the Matter ; she said he frighted me a little bit, but he has not done me any Harm; I said if he has not done you any Harm, don't take any Notice of it; I heard the Hostler say he would have a Warrant for him; I said if you should have any Warrant, you shall got out of the House directly; I asked her if the young Gentleman had lain with her, (and she sat down and eat her Dinner) and she said he had not.</p>
               <p>Q And what past after this?</p>
               <p>Jaques. So I took the Prisoner into the Yard, and talked to him, and said I was surprized ! Could not he let the young Woman alone?</p>
               <p>Q. Was she present at the same Time?</p>
               <p>Jaques . She was in the Brewhouse , and he was at the Door; and he declared to me, that he had not lain with her, any more than put his Hand up her Petticoats ; so they wanted to fetch a Warrant, and I turned them both out of Doors directly ; I was but a Stranger to them, and the House; I had not been in the House above three Weeks by myself; this Girl has had a bad Character from 11 or 12 Years of Age .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear of that before ?</p>
               <p>Jaques. No, if I had I never would have had her in my House.</p>

               <p>Archer. She is a bad disorderly Person , that's her general Character ; I have an Apprentice that has kept her company for a considerable Time . There were several more Witnesses in the Behalf of the Prisoner , and against the Prosecutrix , but the Court did not judge it at all necessary to examine any more.
