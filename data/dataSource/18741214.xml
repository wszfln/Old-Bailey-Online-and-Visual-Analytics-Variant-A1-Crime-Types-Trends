On Thursday, the 19th November, between 10 and 11 o'clock in the morning, I was in Chatsworth Road, Priory Fields, Hackney—I saw Rogers there—there was a grey horse and a roan mare there—the mare was hobbled—Rogers stooped down in front of her legs and did something to her—he then walked away—between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon Rogers and Roberts came to the same place and looked at the mare; they went away again, and I hid in a shed—between 8 and 9 o'clock that night the prisoners and two other men came there—at that time there was a cart behind the shed and some harness—the cart was the same which was afterwards identified by Mr. Shackleton—Roberts brought the roan mare up to the cart, which was close to the shed where we were—the other men harnessed it; Rogers had hold of the bridle and put it on, and they led it away—as they led it away, I went out with Chapman and Howsden, the constables, who were with me—we commenced to on after the cart, and the prisoners and the others ran away—I stopped the horse and cart—I afterwards saw Roberts brought back by Chapman—next day I went to Smithfield, where I saw Rogers, and took him into custody, and told him it was for being concerned with others in the unlaw<lb/>ful possession of a horse and cart, he said "All right, let me walk in front, I don't want to be shown up to my <hi rend="italic">pals</hi>"—the night of the 19th November was a bright moonlight night.</p>

I am single, and live at 1, St. James's Court, West-minter—on 24th November, about 1.30 a.m., I went home and found the prisoner in my room—we had a quarrel, and he fastened the door, pushed me backwards on the bed, and slit my nose—it must have been done with a knife—I was taken to the hospital and it was sewn up—I was there for a week—he was sober; he never drinks, but I aggravated him greatly.</p>

               <p>him at his place of business at Leicester, and after a long bargaining about the price he gave me an order for two tons, which came to 209<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the sample bundle was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the terms were a four months' acceptance from 1st March—they were not all American fleshers, there were five dozen calf kids included—I saw a great many goods there, boots and shoes, especially Bluchers, for which article he said he used these American fleshers—he showed me several invoices for similar goods—I am not quite certain of what firms; it was either Messrs. Kitchens, of Leeds, or Messrs. Bevington &amp; Morris—I afterwards received from him this memo<lb/>randum, claiming for short weight; it is on a billhead "Bought of Arthur Cooper, Manufacturer"—I knew him as a manufacturer of goods—I did not know that he was selling unmanufactured leather—this is my invoice—the goods remain unpaid for—I had another transaction with him on 29th January, 1873—he called on me in London and examined my stock; no one was with him as far as I can remember—he came next day and gave an order for thirty-three dozen patent calf, amounting to 185<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was not quite ready to offer him the same terms, and he was quick enough to see that, and said "It does not matter, I don't want the same terms, I, have not done sufficient business with you and you don't know me sufficiently; I will pay you for this transaction cash on 1st March," and I agreed to that, with the usual discount of 2 1/2 per cent.—this is the invoice of those goods—I believed that he required the goods for his own trade; if I had known they were going to Brown &amp; Rintoul I would not have parted with them—they remain unpaid for—the total amount of my claim is 397<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Brown &amp; Rintoul were occasionally customers of mine—they would not have bought these goods any cheaper—I am a creditor for the whole of the re-opened account—in the beginning of March, 1873, I was at Leeds, and called at the warehouse of Mr. William Hall—I have sold goods to Mr. Hall at some time, I don't remember whether I did at that time—I can't say exactly that I saw a case of my goods there—I spoke to Mr. Hall about the prisoner's affairs—the prisoner was a good buyer, and an acute judge of the value of articles.</p>

Cooper, Leicester, to George Chamberlain: "Sell certain, I depend on you for what I said"—on 31st January: "Price must be no consideration whatever; wire me at once what you are doing, you know I entirely depend"—that is from Arthur Cooper, Leicester, to George Chamberlain"—there is one more which seems to be without date, from Thomas Jones, Leicester, to George Chamberlain, Glasgow: "Send to-night all oil possible, or the machinery will be completely stopped, depend on for Monday, and can't take any refusal"—there are three or four others which I am not certain about.</p>

On the last day of November I was with Reed, the carman, leading a horse on the Charlton Road about 9 p.m.—I felt a weight on the back of the cart, and found a-man there—I should not know him—I told him he must get off—he went to the other side of the road, and I never saw him afterwards—I put my hand to the back of the cart and felt part of a sheep—I then brought Reed to the back of the cart, and we sent for the police, and gave them the sheep—while the police were at the Spell<lb/>thorne Inn the prisoner came up, looked at the sheep, and said "If you want me you know where to find me."</p>

                  </hi>. On 30th November the boy who was with me coming home spoke to me, and I went to the back of the cart and found the hind part of a sheep—we went on to the Spellthorne Inn, and going along I saw a man following us; he kept at one distance behind us, and when we stop<lb/>ped at the inn he came up, and it was the prisoner—I asked him whether he was the man who put the sheep on the cart, he said "No"—I said "It is very strange, you are the man who followed me"—he said "Don't you know me, Joe?"—I said "No"—he said "Don't you know John Green?"—I said "Yes"—he said "That he was at home if he was wanted"—I sent for the police, and gave them the sheep—it was about a mile from Feltham where the boy showed me the sheep in the cart.</p>

I am a wine merchant of Lime Street—my office is on the left hand side as you go in and it is divided by a glass partition railing off the clerks' part and next to that there is a swing door with a flap on the top for receipting accounts—I saw the cash-box there after Mr. Bell had placed there—there is another office downstairs where a clerk named Simpson sometimes works—I remember Bell going out on the afternoon of 19th September, and Simpson came up to take charge—the prisoner who I had never seen before came into the office and began speaking about a pipe—I was busy and I told him I knew nothing about it, he must call again when Mr. Bell was in—he left and had had time to get to the front door when he came back and said "Would you give me a <hi rend="italic">wet?</hi>—I felt annoyed and told him if he had any business to see my clerk, Simpson, downstairs—I had sent Simpson down to copy some letters before the prisoner came in and there was nobody in-the office—I told the prisoner to go away and he did so—Mr. Simpson afterwards missed the cash box—nobody could have taken it except the prisoner, nobody was there after Mr. Bell left but Simpson and the-prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Anderson—about 5.20 I went down to the lower office to copy some letters leaving the cash box on the counter—I was about six minutes copying the letters and had to come up for some stamps out of the cash-box and it was gone—I did not see the prisoner.</p>

I went in and if there had been any cash-box there then I should have seen it; there was free ingress and egress to everybody, and there is no telling who goes in. Mr. Anderson was out of temper and answered me as if I was a dog. I may have asked him for a <hi rend="italic">wet,</hi> which is not unusual when we are working for wine merchants. I do not believe the cash-box was there when I went there. It was not impossible for a person to have gone in and taken the cash-box, and because I went in next I am the victim.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Alfred Oliver—I keep a wardrobe shop at 59, Great St. James Street, Lisson Grove; it is one door from the Grove—I have known the prisoner about two years, he has lodged with me just upon two years, at that house—he was married, and his wife lived with him, they occupied the second floor front room, they only had the one room, it was more of a living room, there was a bed in the room—he is a shoemaker by trade—he used to work in his room and take the work home, to his master, Mr. Bosher—his wife died a little over three months ago, about four</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187412140041"/>
               <p>months now I should say, as near as I can remember—she died in that room—I did not know the deceased, Emma Bellamy—I had never seen her with the prisoner—he had spoken to me about her; about a week before the crime he told me that she was very respectable and a nice young widow—I saw her come out of the house one morning near upon 12 o'clock, and having no female lodger I wondered where she came from and I went up and asked the prisoner if he had bad a visitor—he said it was a visitor of his, that she was very respectable and I need not be afraid—he gave me to understand that he was keeping company with her—I did not see her again until this matter occurred on Saturday, 17th October—up to that day the prisoner did not keep much to his work, very little, but he was very-quiet with it always, I seldom knew when he was at work or not—he was a very sober man, I never saw him the worse for drink—on Saturday, 17th October, somewhere about 2 o'clock, I was in my parlour—I heard some faint screams of "Murder!" and "Help!"—I thought at first it was in the Grove and I ran out into the Grove with one of my little boys; seeing nothing there, I returned and I heard it again; I opened my parlour door and then heard that it came from the prisoner's room upstairs—I ran up stairs and knocked at the door; I tried the door, it was locked, I ricked the handle about and knocked at the door very loudly and said "Cranwell, what are you doing to that woman?"—after a few minutes I heard him repeat once to her "You have deceived me," and I heard the woman say once "Oh, spare my life!"—that of course alarmed me more, and I told him if he did not open the door I would break it open, but I had no answer; the woman said "Break it open"—I then broke the door open somehow, I pushed my foot against it very violently in my fright and the door flew open and I went into the room—the woman was lying across the bed, not in the ordinary way, but" across it—I did not see her face the first minute I went in, I went close by the side of the bed to look for her face—the prisoner was kneeling on the bed, very near to her—the woman's face was covered with blood—I said "Oh, Cran<lb/>well, what have you done?" or something to that effect—he did not say a word, he never spoke to me—I saw a knife lying under the pillow as I was coming out, it was a small shoemaker's knife—I then flew down and called my husband—I then ran down to a little boy who was minding the shop, and from that I ran across the road to speak to a neighbour—my husband had followed me down and he sent the little boy for a policeman—when my husband returned from the shop doorway we opened the parlour door and-were going out with a view of going up to Cranwell's room, when we saw the deceased come running down the stairs—my husband caught her at the bottom step and while he was laying her down in the passage Cranwell came running down the stairs as if going to see where she was—he never spoke a word to me—I then shut the door and left it to the police and the rest; I believe the prisoner returned upstairs again to get his hat or something and I afterwards saw him run up the Grove for the doctor; that was imme<lb/>diately after he had run upstairs; be seemed as if he had come to himself and went for a doctor, and Dr. Brisbane came and attended to the woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner and his deceased wife had lived on very affectionate terms—during the last fifteen months of her life she was in a very distressing state of health—she had been attending a dispensary", there was a blow up of the gas and she was very much injured—she also suffered from some internal complaint—the prisoner was very kind and attentive to her, and most considerate, I saw a deal of that—from my experience of Him</p>

               <p>during the two years he was with us he was a man of very humane dispo<lb/>sition and temperament—I think it was only a week before this Saturday that I had the conversation with him about the woman having been to his room, it may have been a little longer, it may have been a week or ten days, I could not say; I had never seen her before that day, she was then leaving the house about 12 o'clock—I can't say whether she had slept in the house that night—the prisoner was the only lodger we had—whether she had come in with him overnight I can't say, I know nothing of that—from the time of his wife's death he seemed in a state of great despondency and melancholy at times, and he repeated several times to me how he missed his poor old lady—I don't know whether he was in the habit of sitting in his room doing nothing; I never was in his room after the funeral day—I dare say he was not so regular in his work during the last fortnight, or three weeks prior to this occurrence, he seemed unsettled; he. seemed very unsettled from the time of the funeral; he did not seem to get more settled—it was not more than ten minutes from the time I heard, the first scream till I got up to his door; I don't think it was more than ten minutes from first to last, I really could not say, but it was all done very quickly, a very few minutes—I was very much excited and frightened—I only heard the expression "You have deceived me" and once I heard the woman say "No, no"—when I called out to him he made no reply—when I burst open the door he was on his knees on the bed—he looked at me—I said something to him, he made no reply, he remained kneeling on the bed—I did not notice whether he had anything in his hand—I said before the Magistrate "He appeared to me like a man in a fit"—when he went to fetch the doctor he seemed as if he bad come to himself—when he was kneeling on the bed he looked as if he did not know, me, he looked mad, scared—his eyes were full of a very peculiar looking expression, he stared at me in a very wild way—I went up to the bedside, he remained kneeling on the bed, he never moved while I was in the room—I was a very short time in the room, only the, moment I spoke to him, when I saw her face I rushed off directly—she did not speak—I did not notice any matches lying at the foot of the bed or near the fireplace, or whether the fire was just lighted, I never looked, I was too frightened—I did not go into the room afterwards—I remember his coming in on the Saturday, my husband was at home—we occupy all the house but the top room—we were in the parlour behind the shop at dinner; the lodger coming in from the street would pass the parlour door in the passage and go upstairs; the door was shut, he would not see anything of us—I merely heard him with his latch key and walk upstairs very quickly,—he had a latch key to come in at any time he liked—I know that the woman came in with him on that occasion, I looked round and just caught sight of her dress as she was going upstairs.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 30, Lisson Grove—I am a Doctor of Medi<lb/>cine—on Saturday, 17th October, about 2.30,. the prisoner came to my house, he beckoned me and told me to come at once with him if I wanted to save a life—I asked him what was the matter, I received the same answer, "Come at once if you want to save a life"—I then went with him, he took me to 59, Great James Street, it took us two or three minutes to get there—I went into the passage and found a woman lying there with her throat cut, bleeding profusely—I examined the throat, it was an incised wound between 3 and 4 inches long and 1 1/2 deep, none of the large arteries were cut—the windpipe was cut but not severed—I did what I could to stop the bleeding—while I was examining her the prisoner said "It is not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187412140045"/>
               <p>the throat alone, but there are scalp wounds as well"—I then examined the head and found there were nine scalp wounds, five on the left side of the head and four on the right, varying from 1/4 inch to 1 1/2 inch in length, and all of them in point of depth were down to the bone—they were such wounds as might have been inflicted with a shoemaker's hammer or any other blunt instrument—I heard the prisoner say that he had done it—afterwards Mr. Mansfield, the Magistrate, came to the house with his clerk I thought the woman was sinking when I saw her first—I did not see the prisoner taken away by the policeman, I was too much engaged in attending to the woman—it was about half an hour after I got to the house that the Magistrate came—I heard the woman make a statement to the Magistrate which the clerk wrote down; she was exceedingly exhausted at the time from loss of blood; my opinion was that she would sink at that time—I don't remember that I said anything to her as to her condition—the state<lb/>ment took about ten or twelve minutes, after that I had her removed to St. Mary's Hospital, I went to the hospital with her and left her in charge of the house surgeon, I did not see her afterwards—at that time my opinion as to her life was exceedingly unfavourable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said before the Magistrate that when the prisoner cam to my house he was in a state of the greatest excitement, "wild" is. I think father too strong an expression; he was in a state of great excitement, he first of all beckoned to me with his finger and then caught hold of me by the arm and dragged me towards the door, using the words I have stated—I have been in active practice fifteen years and a half—in the course of my experience I have come across a good many cases of diseases of the mind—insanity has different phases and different shapes, you can hardly find two cases exactly alike—I have read a good deal on the subject—there is imbecility, which can be detected at a glance; there are many maniacs who are insane upon particular points and quite sound" upon others; they may go through life discharging the ordinary business of life and yet upon one particular subject be quite out of their mind—there is a form of insanity known as "impulsive insanity"—I have read of cases of a man being to all appearance of sound mind down to the commission of an act and after the act, and yet at the time of committing the act being insane; that would be a case coming under the class of impulsive insanity—all these medico<lb/>legal questions are I think to a considerable extent matters of opinion—in forming an opinion as to whether a person was insane at the time he com<lb/>mitted an act, I should decidedly take into account an heriditary taint of insanity in his family—I have seen it stated by writers on insanity that where insanity is shown in the father it most frequently shows itself in the sons, and where it is shown in the mother it more frequently shows itself in the daughters; I have not observed it myself in my own experience—I think it is a matter worthy of attention that after the commission of an act the person does not attempt to evade justice; that would depend to some extent upon where he was at the time—the exhibition of his bloody hands and saying "I have done it," is a circumstance that I should take into account; it is certainly peculiar—these circumstances taken together I would say are significant—the commission of an act without apparent motive, and towards a person with whom he had been upon affectionate terms, would be an important matter for consideration and would strongly weigh upon my judgment in coming to a conclusion whether the person was of sound mind or not.</p>

The woman was lying in the passage, and he was stand<lb/>ing at the bottom of the stairs when he said "I did it"—I think he used the expression that there were scalp wounds before he said that; that was while I was examining the throat, to call my attention to other wounds—I observed nothing' extraordinary or particular in his conduct or manner during the whole of the time after I went with him until he was taken away by the policeman; when he came to me he was in a state of great excitement, but after that I did not observe him very closely, because I was too much engaged in attending to the woman to pay attention to him.</p>

On Saturday, 17th October, about 2.30, I saw a crowd outside 59, Great James Street—I went inside, and found the deceased lying in the passage—at that time the doctor had arrived, and was attending to her—I went upstairs to the second floor front room—the prisoner had then been taken away by the constable—I examined the room—there was a table in the centre of the room, on which I found this shoemaker's knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there was blood upon it—by the side of the bed, on the floor, I found this short-handled shoemaker's hammer, with apparently some hair upon it; it may not be human hair, it is some short hair—the bed was saturated with blood—I found nothing else on that occasion—I locked up the room, and kept the key—on Monday morning the 19th, about 9 o'clock, I went to the room again, and on the top of the cupboard I found this other shoemaker's hammer; it has blood and hair upon it, both on the handle and the hammer—it was on the top of a very high cupboard, six or seven feet high; a tall man could reach it—I took charge of it—I saw the prisoner at the station on the Saturday afternoon, about 5 o'clock—I took the charge—he was charged with felo<lb/>nious assaulting Emma Bellamy, with intent to murder—I read the charge to him, and he said "Yes"—I noticed nothing in his manner or demeanour, he was quite cool and collected—I am not quite sure whether the room door was locked when I first went to it—the constable went with me—I was able to lock it.</p>

               <p>demeanour to lead me to believe that he was otherwise than a perfectly sane man—I have had very large experience in cases of insanity since I have been connected with the goal of Newgate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined,</hi> The opinion I express relates to what I have observed of the prisoner since he has been in Newgate—I believe he was a week in the House of Detention before he came here. I have gone into the question of insanity more than most men—I do not of course refer to those gentle<lb/>men whose particular province it is—I have no doubt that on some few occasions I have found myself in conflict with other members of the profes<lb/>sion in the view I have formed—I have no experience of such a form of insanity as impulsive insanity unpreceded by symptoms of insanity or fol<lb/>lowed by evidences of insanity—I should expect to find prior indications of some sort of insanity, or subsequent ones, one or the other—I think in most cases there are delusions, although they are not always manifested, for instance, in the case of Melancholia, you cannot draw them out, they are taciturn, they will not speak, hence you cannot tell what they are pro<lb/>bably impelled by—I should give full value to hereditary taint in judging of insanity—it would be a circumstance of importance that a man's brother, or father, or cousin, had indications of insanity—it is a significant circum<lb/>stance that an act is committed without motive, and that there is no effort to escape after its commission, and that there is a voluntary surrender to justice—the difficulty as far as my experience goes, and I believe it will be confirmed by every man' who has had any great acquaintance with insanity, is that the forms of it are most intricate, and I think it is pretty much a matter of opinion—there are some cases of course, in which you can have no moral doubt whatever, cases of Melancholia for example—there are maniacs who are profound melancholia—many persons have come to this bar who I have deposed to as being insane; but there is great difficulty sometimes in detecting insanity, even by the most skilled—I have no expe<lb/>rience of insanity in the father being transmitted to the son, and from the mother to the daughter—the same type of insanity is apt to be transmitted—a melancholy and desponding condition is worthy of consideration in a matter of this sort.—I have not observed that the prisoner has been wakeful at night since he has been in Newgate, because I have not seen him at night—he told me that he had, and I instituted inquiries about that and he did not appear to be quite confirmed; I think it came to nothing—I said to him—"I think you sleep more than you think, because your symp<lb/>toms do not show it."—insanity is frequently attended by epilepsy, that is to say, there is very often insanity associated with epilepsy, but it passes off with the seizure more frequently than not—an insane father and an epileptic mother might most assuredly lead to some dangerous results in the offspring—I should consider they would be very susceptible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have several times spoken to the prisoner upon the sub<lb/>ject of this inquiry—I examined him with a view to test the state of his mind—from beginning to end I found no trace whatever of insanity—I was present when Dr. Tuke, Dr. Maudsley, and Dr. Rogers examined him on Friday last—they came on behalf of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>there was no unusual dilitation of the pupil, not more than in many persons—they are not always alike as to size—his pulse was very often accelerated—he is rather an excitable man—I found his pulse frequently from seventy to eighty; it is rather quick than not as a rule.</p>

D. and Fellow of the College of Physicians of London and Edinburgh—I have been in Court during the hearing of this case—I have heard the whole of the evidence and have listened to it with attention—last Friday I had an inter<lb/>view with the prisoner—there is a form of mental disorder known by the name of impulsive insanity—it is also called homicidal mania and sudden impulse—I made a careful examination of the prisoner's physical condition—I found him to be of a highly nervous temperament with a pulse persistently at one hundred, which is a high rate, and very highly dilated pupils—it was mentioned at the (time that the light in the room was insufficient and I took him to the window and with another physician present we found that the dilation of the pupils still continued and I see it is even so now—his state now is one liable at any moment I should fancy to an attack of mental alienation or a fit of some kind or another.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From your experience are you of opinion that a man may commit an act of violence without any indication of insanity beforehand or afterwards and yet be insane at the time he commits it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never saw such a case, but it is in my experience and reading and knowledge that such cases have been—I agree with Dr. Gibson that almost all the cases I have seen have shown some indications of insanity beforehand or afterwards—I should take the instance of the hammering at the wall such as has been described as one index, and also the tendency to lowness and depression—that is an element worthy of consideration—then I should take as a very important one indeed in this or in any case a very strong hereditary tendency to insanity, and epilepsy and insanity are most frequent concomitants of homicidal mania—epileptic mania is a most dangerous malady in reference to the lives of others and themselves, and it is frequently hereditary the motive<lb/>less nature of an act is an important consideration also, also the fact of no effort being made to escape, and the showing of hands covered with blood—if I may also given the account which the prisoner gave me of the deed, it was upon that I form my opinion to some extent—I think the whole mass of circumstances taken together indisputably prove that at the time the prisoner committed the act he was of unsound mind—I especially lay stress upon the epileptic character of his appearance at the time the deed was committed, the staring eyes, the fixed expression and after<lb/>wards a sudden recovery—those are exactly the characteristics of an epileptic sudden mania; also being comparatively cool and collected within a short time of the occurrence would be in favour of the view I am now putting forward—it is quite consistent with his having been under the influence of this impulsive attack at the time he committed the deed—I also think that the dissipation, I don't mean drunkenness, but the tippling and general excitement to which he had been exposed for four or five weeks before, is another element which I would lay stress upon, and his peculiar nervous organisation rendering him liable to such an attack—it is also a very material circumstance that he was to all appearance on affectionate terms with this woman down to the time of her death; the general former history of the prisoner, his gentle manner and demeanour and the whole history of his former life as an affectionate man suddenly terminating in this horrid crime seems to me to be another element in the case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw the prisoner last Friday in company with Mr. Gibson, Dr. Rogers, and Dr. Maudsley—Dr. Maudsley is a well known and accomplished physician, and has written works upon mental disease—I was with the prisoner rather more than an hour—that is the only time I have seen him except to-day in Court—Dr. Maudsley is not here as a witness—I should not like to say that the prisoner is of perfectly sound mind now; I can find no indication whatever that he is not, not the smallest—I should say that he knew he was going to be tried for murder, and that he knows now that he is being tried for murder—before forming an opinion as to hereditary taint, it would of course be so much the better to know the cir<lb/>cumstances of the insanity of the different members of the family—if a man became mad from drink, it might very possibly be from an hereditary taint—I do not believe drink would produce insanity unless there was a strong predisposition to it in the individual; it would produce <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—I would except that—there is insanity known as <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> produced by drink—it is unquestionably important to know the kind of insanity the members of a family suffer from before forming any real estimate of the</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. It is stated in' a book of authority that with regard to impulsive insanity or irresistible impulse, the doctors who present that theory should be able to form a distinct conception between impulses that are irresistible and impulses that are unresisted—I think the only way in which such a line can be drawn is to take the physical concomitants, and if I find that the man who commits the crime is at the time in a state of physical suffering, with staring eye-balls, in a state of great excitement, and has at the same sine a tendency to epilepsy, which in' this case, from the brother's evidence, I believe, I should put that down probably, not certainly, as an irresistible impulse—if I should not find the physical symp<lb/>toms I should distinguish the case; here there were no physical symptoms till after the crime was committed, but they continued—it is quite possible that he would be in a state of excitement, being caught in such an act as this.</p>

It is not the result of my experience to expect previous fits of epilepsy before that spoken to, of knocking his knuckles against the wall—there comes a time when it reaches a climax; it does not necessarily follow that it should come on at an early period of life, it would depend very much upon the habits of the man in the preceding months—he does not appear to have been following his work in the same manner as formerly and he had given way to an unnatural description of despondency at the death of his wife, I mean despondency that caused him to neglect his work and not to lead the regular life that he previously did, that would lead on in a man</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor's salesman at 31, Leopold Buildings, Hackney Road—I was in the prisoner's service in the beginning of Decem<lb/>ber, 1873, as salesman, and I managed the place—Goldstein was the cashier—I attended to the cash after he left, and made the daily entries in the takings book—if we had had a good day the prisoner would say "We have put down enough now; there has been sufficient taken, don't enter any more;" and then I did not enter in the book any more of the takings that day, and the money I took I put in the till with the ticket which came off the clothes that were sold—that happened two or three times a week—I remember one particular day, that was the 31st January, there was a little over 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. taken, and a sum of less than 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was entered—I don't remember any other particular day—it happened several times—it went on up to the 20th March, when the execution was put in, two or three times a week—some days were busy and some were slack—I entered about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the busy days, and we took about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't know anyone that he did business with of the name of Johnson—I never heard of him while I was there—about a fortnight before the shop was closed I was directed by the prisoner to pack some clothes; several coats for himself—there were two or three coats for the prisoner, and I think two other coats, and the remaining suit to go to a customer in the evening—they were worth about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took them to his residence, 3, Maxwell Street, West<lb/>minster Road—the prisoner went with me—shortly before the shop was closed Mr. Gibbs, an accountant, was there, making up the books—after the shop was closed I met the prisoner and Howsham and Gibbs by appoint<lb/>ment at the European Tavern, opposite the Mansion House—that was about the 23rd March—they went in, and had some coffee—I went with them, and then we went to Bishopsgate and then to Shoreditch, all four together—Gibbs had a bag with him—he asked me to carry the bag—I</p>

               <p>don't think the bankrupt was there then—he left us in Shoreditch, and then Gibbs asked me to carry the bag, and he went in to get a cigar I be<lb/>lieve, and during that time I walked slowly on as far as the Griffin—I stopped there some time, and the bankrupt came in—he said "You have got Gibbs' bag there"—I said "Yes"—he said "That is what I want, my books are in there;" so he took the bag from my hand and took out what he required, the daily takings book and a roll of invoices—that is all I remember, and they were given behind the bar to be taken care of by the landlady or the landlord, I can't swear which—Howsham was there when that was done, and I have not seen anything of them since—I could not swear whether Howsham or the bankrupt gave them behind the bar—I saw Mr. Gibbs and gave him his bag back—he said "My books are gone," or something, and I did not answer him one way or the other—I said "You have been drinking, and there is your bag"—the takings book was something like a copy book, a limp" book—I could see that the invoices were the same I had seen before at 12, High Holborn; sometimes they were filed there, and sometimes put in a clasp—they were invoices of goods purchased by the bankrupt.</p>

I am an accountant, and have offices in London and at Littlehampton—at the latter end of February, or the beginning of March, this year, the prisoner applied to me to make out some accounts for the purpose of liquidation—I went to the premises, 12, High Holborn, for that purpose five or six times, and books and papers were handed to me—I had access, first of all, to the cash receipt book in which the daily takings were entered, also to two rolls of invoices, one of stock purchased, the other of cash paid—I also saw a banker's book and large order book—I did not use that—I have no recollection of the amount of the weekly takings from the commencement of the business—I took the cash receipt book and opened out a supplemental ledger, and posted against that the cash he had paid—I had not completed my account at the time the shop was closed on 20th March—the daily taking's book and the invoices were then in my pos<lb/>session, and had been for four or five days—I had taken them with me away from the place—I did not take the order book away—I saw the pri<lb/>soner the day after the shop was shut up—I made an appointment to go through the books with him at Howsham's house on the Saturday—I went there with the books, he was there, and we made a further appointment on the Monday at the European—I went there with a bag and a paper parcel—the bag contained six books, the cash receipt book, the two rolls of in<lb/>voices, and the supplemental ledger—the prisoner, Howsham, and Beckett came there together—we went from there to Camomile Street, Bishopsgate, and had a cup of coffee—the prisoner said that he had an appointment to go to Old Ford—we walked to Shoreditch, and the prisoner left me about 6.35 in the evening, and appointed to see me at 8 o'clock at Shoreditch Station—he had asked me for the books and papers while we were having the coffee—I said "I shall not deliver them up to you because they are incomplete"—I was to be paid 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my labour—I was not paid—after he left me 1 gave my bag to Beckett, and went into a cigar shop, and when I came out I could not find him—I kept the 8 o'clock appointment, but did not see the prisoner at Shoreditch Station—I saw him at Howsham's house—I saw Howsham before I went there—I had not seen anything of my bag then, but it was given back to me about 10 o'clock the same night by Beckett; the papers and cash receipt book were not then in it—I said to the prisoner "The bag is returned empty"—he said "No doubt Beckett and Howsham have got them, and I must go in pursuit"—I met him two days after, and he asked me about the books—I said I knew nothing about them—he said "Beckett or Howsham have no doubt got them, for the purpose of extortion, and getting money from me"—I have never seen the books since—I have no trustworthy recollection as to the aggregate re<lb/>ceipts as shown in the cash receipt book.</p>

I am a solicitor of 40, Chancery Lane—Mr. Baggs is a wholesale clothier and he was my client and trustee in this bankruptcy—he left it to me in the usual way to get information from the defendant as to his affairs—on 3rd June I wrote the prisoner this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This requested the defendant to attend at Mr. Stokes's office on 4th June with his books of accounts and any money in his hands.</hi>) He did not come and I wrote to him another letter on 10th June to the same effect—he came after that with a solicitor's clerk, the same person who is instructing Mr. Willoughby now—they came over to Bow Street where I was engaged—the bankrupt said that he had no books and that he did not mean to answer any questions, and the clerk said "I have advised him not to answer any questions, he is not bound to come to you," or words to that effect, and the prisoner said he should take his advice and not say anything more—in con<lb/>sequence of that he was summoned before the Bankruptcy Court on the 25th June—he was subpoenaed in the usual way—he swore in that exami<lb/>nation that he did not refuse to answer questions; that is not true, for if he had answered questions to me I should not have wanted to take him to the Court—he has given no other information about his afiairs except what appears in his examination—he was ordered to file cash goods and deficiency accounts—he filed a banker's book which showed his payments in and out from the opening of the account to the end of the year, and he also filed the two accounts which you have already had—there was also an amended account up to the 24th January, 1874—that shows 503<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid into the bank from the 3rd December till the 24th January—he has never given any account of any money coming to his hands except that—I have never had his books or seen them—I went to the premises after the shop was shut up, but there were no books and papers there relating to his affairs—I wrote to Edwards who was supposed to owe 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. but the letter came back—I have not had a penny piece of assets in this case—I have a set of accounts which were produced at the liquidation meeting which he called—that shows unsecured creditors 1,216<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that document was produced to him in his examination in the Bankruptcy Court—I examined him myself—I also examined him as to the debts of the two Cohen's from that paper—I attended the meeting of creditors called by him, he was there and the same clerk was in the room, the person behind Mr. Willoughby—this statement was produced as the statement of the would be liquidator—I asked him questions on that occasion as to the assets and debts and what had become of the assets and money received, and a variety of things—that meeting was on the 14th April at Victoria Tavern, Morpeth Road, Bethnal Green—those proceedings were not put on the file, as no resolution was passed and it was not regis<lb/>tered—there were eight creditors I think present—I asked the prisoner what the 1,216<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for, and he said for goods and for cash lent and so on—I asked the questions from the list of creditors marked "A" which I had in my hand—Mr. Goldstein was put down for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he said that might or might not be correct, and he was not certain as to the amount, and so we went through the list, and then we came to the assets—there was an asset</p>

I conduct the business of the Crown Tavern, West<lb/>minster Bridge Road—my father is the proprietor of the Duke of Clarence, public-house opposite—I saw Barrell once or twice prior to the 24th October—on the 24th, about 3.30 in the afternoon, he came in and asked me to cash this cheque for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., signed "Belcher &amp; Rogers"—I told him I could not—he said my father had cashed a cheque for him before, and and I told him to go over and see him; but thinking his statement was true about my father, I subsequently cashed the cheque—I afterwards went to the office of Belcher &amp; Rogers, 43, Fish Street Hill—I only saw their name written up; I did not see them described as shipping agents—I subsequently gave the cheque to my father.</p>
