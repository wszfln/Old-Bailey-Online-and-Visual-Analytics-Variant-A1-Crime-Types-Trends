                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Shadbolt of Brompton. About 1 o'clock in the afternoon of 22d April I got into an omnibus in Shoreditch—I had 2 children with me—when I got in there were several persons there—when we got between the Bank and St. Paul's the prisoner got in—she first took her seat opposite to me—I was sitting at the farther end of the omnibus, close to the back—no one could sit on the other side of me—the prisoner sat opposite me—but in 4 or 5 minutes she came and sat next to me on my left—while I was in the omnibus I put my hand in my pocket to get a biscuit for my little boy, and my purse was quite safe—I had in it somewhere near 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., amongst which were 2 fourpenny pieces, 1 sixpence, 2 or 3 shillings, and 2 half-crowns—it was a dark purse, and it had a key belonging to a tea-caddy in it—when the prisoner sat beside me she seemed to look first on one side, and then the other, as if she wanted to get out—I had the presence of mind to put my hand in my pocket, and my purse was gone—I accused the prisoner of picking my pocket—she was still sitting next to me—from the time I put my hand in my pocket and felt the purse safe till I charged the prisoner with stealing it, she had never left my side—this is it—when I charged her with stealing it, she denied it, and said I must have dropped it, and she offered to hold my baby while I looked for it—I looked and found it close to her feet while she was holding the baby—there were other persons in the omnibus, and other females, but no one sat near me but the prisoner—I called the conductor, and told him I had been robbed, in the prisoners hearing; a policeman was called, and the prisoner was removed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the conductor of that omnibus—I remember the prisoner getting in about the Bank—the prosecutrix got in at Shoreditch—the prosecutrix put her head out at the door and said, "A woman inside has robbed me of my purse"—the prisoner could hear what was said—she charged the prisoner with it, and she said, "You had better cull my hus<lb/>band, who is outside the <hi rend="italic">buss"</hi>—I called a policeman, and saw him search the bottom of the <hi rend="italic">buss,</hi> and find some money amongst the straw—I did not hear the prisoner make any answer when the prosecutrix said she had stolen her purse.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman,</hi> 345). I was called to the omnibus in Fleet-street—I found Mrs. Shadbolt near the door, going to get out—she told me she had been robbed, pointed to the prisoner, and said that it was her that robbed her—the prisoner heard it—she made no answer—I told her to come to the door—I told the conductor to hold her whilst I got in—I found 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. amongst the straw—I conveyed the prisoner to the station—she gave an address which was false—when she was at the station she put this piece of paper in her mouth—I put my fingers to her lips, and told her to open her mouth, and took this paper out.</p>

I keep the Admiral Keppel in High-street, Hoxton Old Town—on Monday, 9th May, about 11 in the morning, the prisoner came and asked for half-a-pint of porter—he put a counterfeit half-crown on the counter—I saw it was bad—I said "You are aware it is a bad half-crown"—he said he had been out on the drink on the Sunday and took it somewhere, but he did not know where; and he did not know it was bad—he felt about his pockets and took out a penny and tendered it to me—I asked why he gave me the half-crown when he had a penny—he said he picked it up off the floor in the bar—I said, "That cannot be, for you never stooped" I am sure he did not—he then asked me to return the half-crown—I said, "No; I shall keep the half-crown, and you too"—he said, "It is no use locking me up"—I said, "I shall do it"—I turned for half a minute, and he ran out—I went and fetched him back, and gave the bad half-crown to the officer.</p>

On the 31st May, in consequence of instruction, I placed myself where I had a view of the Fleur-de-Lis public-house in Blos<lb/>som-street, Spitalfields—I got there soon after 6 o'clock in the evening—an officer named Elliott was with me—I gave him some instructions, in consequence of which he went into the house—I remained watching on the outside, accompanied by Inspector Bryant, and other officers—I observed the prisoner Davis come to the door frequently and go back, and in going hack he disappeared from the front of the bar, apparently to the back part of the house, and on each occasion I saw different parties go in, and appa<lb/>rently hold some conversation with him—that took place several times while we were watching—after that I saw Haddon go in the house, and he and Davis appeared to me to be in conversation, and at that time Davis again disappeared towards the back part of the house—he returned again to where Haddon was—after that I saw Elliott seize Davis, and on his being seized we rushed across from where we were in view of the place, and I saw Davis throw from his hand a paper parcel into the bar—it went under the beer engine—I picked up 5 counterfeit shillings in the sink, and under it one on the floor—they were all wrapped up separately in paper, except the one that was loose on the floor—I found a portion of the paper in which they were inclosed, and some of the coins came undone—Bryant picked up a piece of paper which contained coins under the sink where the shilling laid—I saw another officer take Haddon by the hand, and take from his hand a packet which contained 4 counterfeit shillings—we pushed the prisoners into the back part of the place, and I said, "Well, Mr. Davis, I have received instructions from the authorities of the Mint to look after you for dealing in counterfeit coin, and this is the fourth public-house I have traced you to during the last 18 months"—he said, "Very well, Sir"—they were then taken in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many persons were there at the <hi rend="italic">Sunday Times</hi> office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Twenty or thirty—I was about two yards and a half from the prosecutor when I saw the hand drawn from him—there were four or five men on one side of the prosecutor, and seven or eight on the other, because he was at the back of the whole body of the people; but there was nobody so close to him as the prisoner, I swear that—they were so close that I could only just keep on the kerb without going into the road—the prisoner may have been a foot from the prosecutor; I do not think it was less.</p>

               <p>insolvency was in 1852—from that date to June, 1857, I was assistant to a grocer—I commenced the present trading in June, 1857, with borrowed capital, having nothing of my own—the rent of the house I took in Holborn was 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—my family there consisted of five and sometimes six members—I had two children partly at home, partly at school—they were occasionally at home at other times than ordinary vacations—one is 12 years old, the other 22 years—the eldest is, and has been for the last 18 months, in a situation as a governess—I had one assistant (Richardson)—I paid him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum—I had a boy at 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week, and one female servant; that was the whole of the family—I occupied the whole of the house—I let no part—I kept my own accounts entirely—my business was perhaps chiefly a cash business—I put down what I received and paid each day in a book—that was first entered sometimes on a paper put in a cash<lb/>box—I entered at night the receipts and payments of each day—I counted the money from the till each night to shew receipts—immediately I made a payment, I entered it in a cash-book—(<hi rend="italic">book produced</hi>)—put down each pay<lb/>ment, as I made it, in that book; and at the end of each day I counted the money from the till, and wrote it down the other side of that book—the takings I call receipts are nothing more than the money counted from the till each day—if I received any money for a debt contracted on credit, I wrote that down in the book—I can't say 1 did so always—that book repre<lb/>sents all I took and all I paid—that is not the first cash-book I handed to the official assignee (<hi rend="italic">another book produced</hi>)—the book now produced is the one I first produced to him—I am sorry for it—that book is all in my own handwriting—I made up that book the night before my bankruptcy—it was after I had determined to become a bankrupt—I was bankrupt on my own declaration of insolvency—the book was made up after I had signed the declaration of insolvency—the figures there as receipts are less than the sums entered as receipts in the real cash-book—I felt myself in confusion, and felt much anxiety at not being able to account for a large deficiency—I thought it (<hi rend="italic">the book</hi>) would enable me to do so—it was written in an hour or two—I had the real book before me, and copied it, making the alter<lb/>ations in the receipts—it was entirely my own idea—when I first went to the official assignee's office, I was told it could not be a true book, as it appeared to have been made up all at one time—I said in answer that each page was written at one time—I do not remember whether it was urged that all was written at one time—I afterwards brought the other cash-book to the official assignee—there were no entries made in that after I determined to become bankrupt—no pages have been torn out of it—I have had the real book the longest, but the other for some time—they were not bought at the same time—the fictitious book was bought five or six months before my bankruptcy, at a stall in Holborn, in High Holborn, somewhere in the neighbourhood of King-street—I do not know the name—I bought memorandum-books at the same time—it was bought some months before my bankruptcy—the proper cash-book shows a deficiency of 349<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received more than it shows I have paid away—I am ready to inform the Court what has become of that money."</p>

On Saturday, 7th May, about half-past 7, Clouter came into my uncle's shop and had something to drink—I can't remember the amount of it, but it was very small—he tendered a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in payment—I gave it to my uncle, and in consequence of what he said I wrote this on the back of the note—this is the note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I gave the prisoner the change—the barmaid asked him his address, and he said "48, Judd-street."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a green-grocer, residing at 3, Howard-road, Newington, next door to the house where Martha Page was servant. On the afternoon of 5th May, between 3 and 4 o'clock, I was standing at the door of my shop—when I came to the door of my shop the prisoner was standing at the door of No. 2, talking with somebody at the door, which was on the jar—I could not see from the position in which I stood who he was talking with—I saw him there ten minutes—I heard him swear at her, and ask her where his wife was—I believe he called the person he was speaking to a d—b—I could not catch what he said about his wife no more than asking where she was; that was all I heard about his wife—I saw the servant,</p>

               <p>Page, Mrs. Reynolds, and her daughter come out of the house, and walk away from the house—they turned to the right when they came out, in the direction of St. Matthias' church, they crossed a road—the prisoner followed them from the door—he was walking about a yard behind them for about twenty yards)—he then came up to the deceased—I could not see from the distance I was that he spoke, but he closed in with her on the left hand side—immediately after that I heard some screams—I saw him plunge at her with his right hand three times—on hearing the screams I ran towards them—Martha Page ran into my arms, and I brought her back to the door of my house—she said, "For God's sake let me come to your shop, that wretch has stabbed me"—I could not swear that the prisoner heard that; he was close by—she leaned against the wall at my door—the prisoner followed close behind me, and came and stood there, and I stood between them—the prisoner swore at her again as she was leaning there—he called her a d—b—, and said, "You decoyed my wife away to keep a whore's shop"—Page did not make any observation to that—he said nothing more to her that I recollect—I assisted in taking her to the hospital—after the prisoner made the thrust at her, I saw him put something into his left breast pocket—he was taken into custody by a policeman near my door, and I saw the policeman take a shoemaker's knife from his breast pocket, the same pocket where I had seen him put something.</p>

I am a labourer in Spitalfields—I knew John Howard—on 10th April, between 1 and 2 in the morning, I was with him and some other persons at the corner of George-street—there was a dis<lb/>turbance with the prisoner and a lad named William Hartley, who is called Fairboy as a <hi rend="italic">nick-name</hi>—there were two girls, lodgers of the prisoner's, there—they had a part in the row—I saw the prisoner take up a part of a brick and heave it at Fairboy, and it hit Jack Howard in the front of his head—he fell down senseless from the blow—we picked him up, and strapped up his head with a bit of strapping, and he came out again a short time after<lb/>wards—he took no more notice of it then—he fell backwards, I believe—the back part of his head was cut—I saw it—it was bleeding a little at the part where he fell—the brick was a three-quarter brick—the prisoner was about three yards from him when she threw it—I saw Howard three or four days afterwards, and he said he had been fighting again outside the Bells, in Brick-lane—he said he had got pretty well from what the prisoner had done—he took no more notice of that until about three weeks after—he said when he was fighting outside the Bells he was struck down again.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you not see the young man make a blow at me before I took up the brick? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Fairboy had made a blow at you, and called you a good many names—I believe he said that you had given him in charge to the police, and had him taken to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was Fairboy sober? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I can't exactly say whether the prisoner was—she did not appear exactly sober—if she had heaved the brick with the intention of hitting Fairboy, she might have hit him, as she was only three yards from him—she might have done it to frighten him, or she might have done it to hit him, I can't say for certain.</p>

                  </hi>. I was surgeon at the London Hospital when Howard was brought there—it was some days before 23d May—the cause of his death was abscess in the brain, in the upper part on the left side—I attribute that to an injury in the front part of the head, some what on the right side—there was some diseased bone—I could not tell from the appearances how long before the injury had been inflicted—I could tell that it had been for more than two or three days—there was a small external opening on the head; it would not heal—it went down to the skull bone, not into the bone—the cause of death was the abscess on the top of the brain—I don't mean exactly on the surface, it was in the substance of the brain—I don't think it could possibly have been caused by a fall—it might have been, but not from the collateral circumstances—such a thing may have been, although I have never seen anything like it—I could not say it might not be so—I think it is more probable it was caused by something thrown—it was consistent with the appearances that the injury might have been caused as long ago as 12th April—he died on 1st June—he was tre<lb/>phined twice—he died from the effect of the disease—trephining was his only chance—it was skilfully done by one of the first men in London.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Petticoat-lane—I know the prisoner and prosecutor—on Tuesday afternoon, 24th May, I saw Sullivan and his wife—she was wanting to take him upstairs, and he would not go—he was not drunk, and he was not sober—I asked him to go up—he told me to mind my own busi<lb/>ness, and he caught hold of me, put his hands on my shoulder, and pushed me, and I fell with the push—Leary came out of his apartment and stopped in the passage, and Sullivan was in the passage with him—this was between five and six o'clock—the two went out to the door together—Leary went out before Sullivan—he pushed out, and Sullivan said, "Leary, push out and don't hurt me"—the door-way is narrow—Sullivan sat in the passage, and</p>

               <p>Leary went out to the end of the court, and Sullivan eat in the passage, and then went over to Donovan's and went upstairs, and about twenty minutes afterwards a boy brought him down on his back—I did not hear Leary say anything to Sullivan as he went out—I did not notice anybody else go out about that time—I am deficient in my sight—I don't know whether they did or not—I do not know Moore.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Penge, in Surrey, and am in the service of Messrs.

On 10th or 12th June he called again, and requested a further loan of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I took a cheque to their place of business in Skinner Street for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave it to James McClean, and he gave me this memorandum, "We O U, Mr. Bigg, one hun<lb/>dred and fifty pounds sterling. J. &amp; T. C. McClean"—in the following October, towards the latter end of the month, I applied for my money to James McClean, and he wrote me a letter to say that his brother was out of town—this is the letter—it is in the handwriting of James McClean (<hi rend="italic">read:</hi>) "Skinner-street, Nov. 6, 1857. Dear Bigg: I cannot at present appoint a day to let you have the needful, as my brother is not at home yet. I expect him on Monday, when I will write to you, but I fear we will not be able to let you have it till very near Christmas, as he has been buying largely in Dublin, not expecting you would require payment for some time yet With kind regards to Mrs. Bigg, believe me yours truly, J. McClean."—In a few days afterwards Terence called upon me—he said he could not let me have the money at present, but he would in three or four weeks' time—I re<lb/>quested him to give me a bill of acceptance for the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on the 21st November he brought me this bill accepted, dated 18th Nov. 1857—it is drawn by Samuel Bowles Bigg, and accepted by J. and T.

Six months after date I promise to pay to Mr. Bigg 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Ann Southgate."—I believe the body of it is James McClean's writing—the note is drawn at six months, and Terence McClean said it was drawn at a long date for this rea<lb/>son, that Mrs. Southgate was very fidgetty in money matters, and she did not like to accept a bill unless she was sure to be provided with the means of payment, and in order to that she had to give notice to her trustees—he requested that I should give him a letter to Mrs. Southgate before I received that note, as a collateral security for the payment of the three bills, and I did so—I wrote it at the time, and gave it to Terence McClean.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Humphreys &amp; Co.—I served a notice to produce a letter on each of the prisoners.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BIGG</hi> (<hi rend="italic">continued</hi>). This is a copy of the letter I wrote—"Dec. 21, 1857. Dear Madam,—I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your note of hand for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated this day, as collateral security for the due payment of three bills of exchange, accepted by J. &amp; T. McClean in my favour, each for the sum of 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., dated this day, and payable at one, two,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185906130049"/>
               <p>and three months.—Obediently yours, S. B. Bigg.—To Mrs. Ann Southgate." After receiving the three bills and the promissory note, I returned to Terence McClean the acceptance for the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the first of the bills would be due in January, 1858; and about the 21st January I received this letter, signed J. &amp;. T. C. McClean—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>) "To S. B. Bigg, Esq. Dear Sir,—Finding that we cannot pay our acceptance due on the 24th inst., may we request that you will use the enclosed, if necessary, to pay the amount? Let us know the expenses, and we will hand it to you. We date this at three months, and trust we will be able to take up all the bills when they fall due, as we are happy to inform you, and know you will be glad to hear it, that we pretty well see our way, having got over the difficulty of which we told you. "The letter enclosed a bill for 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for three months—I returned that acceptance—the other bills were presented, and not met—James McClean called on me some time before they became bankrupts, and told me they should be obliged to suspend payment—he told me that I should ultimately get my money, and I received a letter from him after that, expressing a hope that I should not oppose him in the Bankruptcy Court—I have lost that letter—the prisoners became bankrupts about February 4th—I did not oppose them—the promissory note became due in June—it was not presented in consequence of my hearing that Mrs. Southgate was away from London—on 17th June I received this letter which is the writing of James McClean—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>) "Elberie, Normandy, 15th June, 1858. Dear Sir,—I regret to in<lb/>form you that it will not be in our power to pay your bill due the latter end of this month, and I think it better to let you know so now, so that you will not be disappointed at the last moment. It is with much reluctance I make this communication to you, after having told you at the time we got your money that there would be no disappointment in the payment, of it; but things having turned out since then so contrary to our expectation, there is no alternative left me. In trying to ward off the evil day we unfortunately have involved Mrs. Southgate to a very large amount,—indeed, far beyond her present means of payment; so that she will be compelled to remain on the Continent for some time, to enable her to pay a composition of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound, which two out of the three creditors whom she guaranteed for us have consented to take, giving two years to pay it. The other creditor would not give the time; so she is compelled to set him at defiance, and I expect he will soon be glad to come to the same arrangement as the others. We did not wish I her to bring you under this agreement, as we hope to be able to pay you in full ourselves, now that we have secured our business and commission without the assistance of our many pretended friends. We have certainly proved the old adage that a friend in need is a friend indeed. When you have got whatever small dividend there will be from the Bankruptcy Court, my brother will see you, and I hope will be able to make soon arrangements with you as will be satisfactory for the payment of the balance of your claim. I will send this letter to Old Change, so that you need not make the contents known to your friends, unless you think it necessary; as the fewer people know of such matters the better. Hoping Mrs. Bigg and yourself are quite well, I remain, Dear Sir, Yours truly, James McClean. "To S. B. Bigg, Esq., at Messrs. Leaf &amp; Sons, Old Change, London, England." After this I instructed my solicitor to take proceedings against Mrs. South-gate to recover the amount of my promissory note—that was in June or July—about the middle of September Terence McClean called on me—he said he had come to make some proposition with reference to this promissory note for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he proposed to give me bills payable every three months</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185906130050"/>
               <p>respectively at 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each for the payment of the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him I had had enough of bills, and if he meant to pay me to give me money down—he said he could not do that, and the fact was it was essential that this pro<lb/>missory note should not come to the knowledge of Mrs. Southgate, for she was not aware of its existence—I said, "How is that?"—he said, "She signed it, believing she signed a receipt for rent;" and he said, "If this comes to her knowledge she will no longer continue to reside with us, and we shall then be deprived of the means of paying you—she herself can't pay you; she has only a life-income, and is already embarrassed"—I told him that I could not take those bills, nor listen to any terms, unless they could pay me some money—he said he would see his brother, and let me know further about it—on the next day I received this letter, which is the handwriting of Terence McClean—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>) "To S. B. Bigg, Esq. Dear Sir,—Having nothing to add to what passed yesterday, I deem it useless to take up your time. I expect my brother will wait on yourself and Mr. Dignum to-morrow or next day. I am, yours respectfully, T. C. McClean. Sep<lb/>tember 21st." I told Mr. Dignum, my solicitor, and left the matter in his hands.</p>

               <p>September I saw James McClean—he said he called respecting proposing terms for the settlement of the debt—he spoke of the writ—he said he knew it had been attempted to be served, and he proposed to pay 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year by quarterly payments—he said that was the most he could do—I told him that had been proposed before by him, and that Mr. Bigg had declined it—he said Mrs. Southgate would be unable to pay it, as she had only a life income under her husband's will, and that had been reduced, and she was under engagements—I said I should proceed in the action—he then said it would be useless to do so, for Mrs. Southgate did not know that she bad signed a promissory note at the time she put her signature; for at the time she put her signature it was a blank paper, and she believed it to be a, receipt for rent—I shook my head at that—I could not believe it—I don't know that I said that, but I shook my head, and he replied immediately, "It is a fact"—what I did after that was by the advice of counsel.</p>

I keep the Island Queen public-house in Hanover-street, Islington—it is my dwelling-house, and in the parish of St. Mary, Islington—on 14th May I went to bed about half-past 12 o'clock at night—before I went to bed I secured the house—the door that leads into the bar was bolted—the kitchen window was closed—I can't say whether it was fas<lb/>tened—the house was closed as usual—about 3 o'clock I was disturbed by a noise on the stairs—I got up and went down to the bar—I found the pri<lb/>soner there—he was the police constable on duty—he said to me, "I have found your place open as usual"—I had been called up by the prisoner twice previously, and found the place open—I said the place was secure when I went to bed—just at the time I got to the bottom of the stairs the police sergeant was passing, and he asked the prisoner how he came in there—he said he came in by the kitchen window—he said, at first, that he found the side door open, and after that he said he came in by the kitchen window—I am sure that door was bolted when I went to bed, I bolted it myself, and the window was shut down close—when I found the prisoner in the bar the window was open sufficiently to allow a person to get in—that kitchen win<lb/>dow opens into a yard, and that yard communicates with the street by a gate—by going through the gate you could get to the kitchen window; and that gate is only fastened by a string—the sergeant desired me to look round, and I missed from a cupboard 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and about 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in copper; and from the till I missed a few coppers, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver—these two bottles (<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>) are mine—I can swear to them—they have my name on them—when I went to bed I left them in the bar empty; now one of them has rum and the other peppermint in it—I had rum and pepper<lb/>mint in my possession, and they were near where these bottles were—I had some cakes, similar to those which are now produced—I saw all these things taken from the prisoner—these bottles were in his coat pocket—this money was in his trowsers pockets and his coat pocket—these cakes were in his hat—there is a dust-hole outside my house—when the prisoner was taken he passed by the dust-hole, and had an opportunity of putting anything into that dust-hole—I afterwards found 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper there.</p>

I am a tailor of Long-alley, Moorfields—on 30th May, about a quarter to 9 at night, I met the prisoner and a companion of his, whose name I do not know, in Bell-alley—I asked the other man who was carrying a box, where he was going to—I never spoke to the prisoner, but he turned round and said that he was a better man than I was—he was rather intoxicated and perhaps he mistook my words—I said that very likely he was—he swore that he was a b—y sight better, and knocked me down and kicked me on the forehead—I got up and told him I would give him in custody—he turned back to strike me again; I stepped back to avoid it, he rose his leg, kicked me in the lower part of my person, and knocked me down—I got up and endeavoured to hold him till a constable came, and then gave him in custody—I went to a doctor next day—I was unable to work for the first week in consequence of the injury I received from the kick—I never gave him the slightest provocation whatever.</p>

I am a cab proprietor of 7, Warwick-street, Golden-square—on 7th May, Rouse entered my service as driver, and on the 9th about 6 o'clock in the evening he went out with a cab and horse belonging to me—his time to return was 6 next morning—he did not return, and I did not see him till I found him in custody on the 15th—the cab, horse, and harness, were worth about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw the cab in Rosemary-lane I think on Monday 16th—I went down to Stratford that day with an officer, and saw Through good at the Three Pigeons—the officer asked him if he had purchased a horse; he said that he had not, but he had exchanged a pony and given 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to boot—he afterwards took me to a field and showed me my horse—I saw Jackaman the same afternoon, and told him that he was wanted inside—he came in and the officer asked him if he had bought any harness, he said yes he had, and a pony of Rouse, and he asked him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the harness, that he knew nothing himself, but if we wanted to find out, we were to go and get somebody to find it out—I afterwards took him in custody.</p>

I am manager to Mr. John Reynolds, a builder of 16, Red-cross-square—the prisoner was employed by him as a bricklayer on 23d May—I saw the prisoner's jacket hanging up in a shed—a policeman searched the pockets of it in my presence and found two pieces of lead in separate pockets, weighing not more than two pounds each—I cannot say whose property it was—Mr. Reynolds did not give him lead to work on, but there was lead on the roof of the house and on the cistern—I afterwards told the prisoner that I had looked in his pockets and found two pieces of lead flushing—I examined the roofs, and accused him of having taken lead from the roofs of 7, and 8, Red-cross-street, where he was at work that morning—I missed about 3ft. 6in. from the two houses—</p>

On Tuesday evening, 3d May, about half-past 8, from information I received I went to the prisoner's premises—he is a blacksmith and locksmith in Whiter-row, Baker's-row, Whitechapel-road—they adjoin some chemical works—there is a large rag-warehouse on the opposite side of the prisoner's premises, and there are some inhabited cottages bounding his premises near White's-row—at the bottom of the yard there is an oil and colour manufactory—I went into Miss Hatton's chemical works for the purpose of observation—I have seen this plan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); it is correct—there is a wooden partition, eleven feet high, which separates Miss Hatton's chemical works from the side of the prisoner's shop—I put a ladder against that partition to look over into the prisoner's premises—you can look over the partition—there is a space of ten feet above the partition to the roof of the building; an opening—there was no one in his shop at that time—against the partition, on the side where I rested the ladder, there was a great number of carboy baskets; large open baskets—they were placed one within the other—next to the partition, on the left-hand side, the shop-door opens from the entry, and next to that there were stages erected—the door is about four feet wide—there are two doors standing together, one appears to be a fixture; they are made of wood—there were two stages running along against the wall, just beyond the doorway—there is a wooden partition running along, and the two stages were fixed against the partition—one stage was a sort of wooden shelf supported by upright pieces of wood underneath it, and underneath that shelf were some baskets; I can't exactly state the number—there were some shavings in them—there were a great number of baskets—in some places they were one within the other, and in some places they were single—there were two shelves one above the other—there were three baskets on the first shelf—there was straw and shavings in all three—there were several baskets</p>

               <p>on the upper shelf—that upper shelf was apparently made of a cooper's old truck, open in the middle—it is a kind of carriage; the same as brewers use—the baskets on that were upside down, and there were some Venetian blinds in them, they came through the bottoms of the basket, and rested on the truck—the baskets had no bottoms to them—there were several other baskets upon a grindstone—I saw no fire about the place at this time—I went to his place between 7 and 8 next morning—I did not see the prisoner at that time—I did not go into the shop—I apprehended him two days afterwards—I told him that I came to apprehend him on suspicion of setting his place on fire—he said he came early that morning; that he blew a piece of candle out, and threw it on a board that rested over a carboy basket, and it fell in among some shavings, and set the place on fire—I said nothing else to him—he told me that he was not insured—that was in reply to a question that I put to him—I asked him whether he was insured or not—he gave me as a reason for going to his shop early that morning, that he had to repair a blind for Mr. Hall—I looked over the property that was there—it consisted mostly of iron tools and bellows, very old, an anvil, and several other tools, and a desk, containing memorandums.</p>

               <p>chemist, carrying on business next to the prisoner's workshop—from some information that I received from an assistant I watched the prisoner's work<lb/>shop on Tuesday night, 3d May—that was the same night that the police<lb/>man was there—I watched from Mr. Brandon's gates—we had to go from our gate to get to the prisoner's gate—we watched during the night from Mr. Brandon's gate, from somewhere about 10 o'clock until the prisoner came, about half-past 3 o'clock in the morning—I saw him come in at the front gate about that time—he came to our front gate—there are two gates, an outer and an inner—the prisoner went into his shop—we waited for some minutes at Brandon's gates—I then rushed forward to the prisoner's gates, and took hold of him either by the collar or sleeve—I saw into his shop before I took hold of him—I could not see into his shop from where I stood at Brandon's gates; I had to go up to his gate before I could see into his shop—I had not seen the state of his shop that morning—his gates were closed—I had seen from over the partition the night before—I then saw some carboy baskets placed; in some of them were shavings—there were also bundles of shavings made up by bagging, loosely held or stitched together with twine round in some parts—some of the hampers were stand<lb/>ing upon a temporary stage erected across one part of the gate; it was a stage that I had never observed before—I frequently had occasion to go there on business; the prisoner was our smith, and did work for us as a black<lb/>smith—some of these baskets were also inverted upon these stages with shavings in them—they were on the two stages; one I call a temporary one, the other, I expect, was a permanent one, as I had seen it before; that was the upper one—I should call this truck the permanent stage—I am certain that some of the inverted baskets were upon that stage; I could not venture to say as to the other, but my impression is that there were some there—in connexion with these baskets were also pieces of stave and parts of an old Venetian blind or blinds, and the bottoms of the baskets were some of them out, or nearly out, and the blinds came right through—they were placed in the shavings, in the baskets, and lodging against the wooden door or gate—a number of rags were hanging from various parts of these stages—I saw some of the rags afterwards, bat did not examine them—at the time I was watching I had two assistants with me, after the policeman left—Gas<lb/>coigne was one and Neave was the other; he is in Mr. Brandon's employ<lb/>ment—Gascoigne is my assistant—in the morning I saw the prisoner come down the place towards his shop, and saw him enter—he seemed to come in a very stealthy manner, on tiptoe, treading very lightly, so as to pro<lb/>duce no noise, or as little as possible—I saw him enter his shop—I waited at Brandon's gate until I saw the flames issuing through—it was partly flames and partly reflection, sufficient to inform me that there was a fire—it came through some crevices or openings in the gate—between the time of the prisoner's going in and my seeing the flames coming out, was not, I should say, more than six minutes, any way under ten minutes—when I saw the flames I said something to my assistant and went forward into the pri<lb/>soner's shop, and took hold of him—the door was partially open—I do not think I was the first to enter—Gascoigne and I were close together—he was following close upon me—I scarcely know which was the first to enter, I may say we entered pretty well together—I had just to throw the door back to admit myself—the first thing I saw was fire burning in various places, three at least; three distinct fires—there was one close by the entrance on my left—I should imagine they were shavings burning; I will say shavings, in a carboy basket on the ground—I should say that was not an inverted</p>

               <p>basket; I (should say it was in its natural position—the second fire was burning in the corner on the same side, the left-hand side, over a grindstone—that was above the ground—the flames extended from the grindstone upwards—they proceeded from shavings in a basket under the truck—the stages were above—they came across—there were baskets on the stages, and staves of casks—there was a large body of fire—the flames extended up to the stage—over the truck there were pieces of stave in a basket—I could not say in what position that basket was—the third fire was nearly at the further extremity of the shop—that seemed to me to proceed from a gallipot—it seemed to be a body of fire—the gallipot was on the ground inside a basket; the basket was over it—I did not observe any shavings there—when I went into the place the prisoner had his back to the gate—he was appa<lb/>rently coming out backwards—the fire was on each side, and he seemed to be drawing from it towards the yard—we rushed upon him at once—he turned round when we came upon him; and we then took him by the collar or some part of his person, and we brought him out—he seemed very much confused and surprised—I think he spoke first; but of course I felt very much excited—when he saw us he seemed surprised, and he said, "Fire! the place is on fire!" in a very low voice, as if he had lost his voice for the mo<lb/>ment, as if he was hoarse from sudden emotion—I said, "You scoundrel!" and "You have done it!" or "it is you that have done it"—he hesitated for some time—as we were taking him out we began to shout "Fire!" and "Police!" and he said, "Don't make such a noise; don't make such a noise; let us put it out; let us put it out"—I had not been into his place for perhaps two or three weeks before—I saw the property that was there—I am not well acquainted with the value of these things; but I should not have given more than 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them myself—the fire was speedily put out by water that we had pro<lb/>vided for the purpose the night before, which we kept in Mr. Brandon's shop—the prisoner was not taken into custody until the Friday—he was at his place of business several times during that time—he was there from the time of the fire until he was apprehended; at least he was backwards and forwards—I heard him come in frequently—I do not think I saw him; I heard somebody, from which I inferred that he was there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You heard some one backwards and forwards in the place after the fire, and before you were before the magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and my inference was that it was the prisoner; but I would not swear it, not seeing him—in fact, I did not like to see him; I did not like to be watching him in and out—I avoided him as much as possible—I did not direct him to be given into custody—I never measured the size of the shop where the fire took place—I should say it was not so large as this dock; not so wide, it might be longer; it is a small shop—there is a workshop, a continuation of that shop, an inner shop, that may be double the length of the other—it is not nearly so long as this court—it does not lead close up to our furnace; there is a wall—his forge abuts on the wall—the place where our furnaces are comes up to his workshop—the forge is at the end of the long room—the side of the shop runs alongside our premises—there is a partition between our place and his shop, which goes up to a cer<lb/>tain height, and then there is an opening—that opening does not go on all the way—there is no opening above the partition to the inner shop—by getting up a ladder, you can look from our premises into the front shop, where the fire was, but not into the inner shop—you cannot look into that at all, the open partition does not extend so far—there is an inner door leading from the one shop to the other—I should say that is the only access</p>

               <p>from the front shop into the workshop—when I was watching at the gates, Gascoigne and Neave were with me—we had water ready inside Mr. Brandon's gate—it is about twenty or thirty feet from the gates where we were watching to the entrance to the prisoner's shop—it is at the extremity of the yard or covered way—it may be forty feet; I never measured it—when I saw the flames I said, "Come on, I see the flames"—I don't recollect saying, "it is time"—I certainly was very much excited—I had been watching very intently before that—it did not occur to me to move up further towards his gates when I had seen him go in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has the prisoner complained of your premises at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he has occasionally found fault with the chimney—I was not aware of his com<lb/>plaining to the magistrate until I heard it mentioned at the police-court—I was aware that a complaint had been made, because the inspector of nuisances came from the Board of Works—that was some considerable time before this—he came on more than one occasion—I only saw him twice; nor am I aware of his having been more than twice; because he made certain sug<lb/>gestions upon his first attendance, and I made such alterations as he advised; and he came a second time with the medical officer, who suggested some further alterations—I did not see him a third time—the last time I saw him was perhaps two months or more before the fire—I am not aware that another complaint was made after that—we have had no wish to increase our premises by taking in the corner occupied by the prisoner—the police came up when we gave the alarm—I then declined to charge the prisoner—I was not asked whether I made any charge—I was asked by the police if I would prosecute him—I believe the words were, "Of course you intend to prose<lb/>cute;" and I said, "No"—he was not taken into custody that night—I am an Englishman—my parents were French, but I was born in England—I consider myself an English subject.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATKINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been asked about the prisoner finding fault with the chimney—was that the chimney of your place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The chimney is in his premises—perhaps he would not use his chimney for four or five days together and it would become full of foul air, and when we made a lire the smoke would sometimes go from our side into his chimney, and come out at the hole near his forge—we have a common right to the shaft—that has nothing to do with my evidence in this matter—when the complaint was made I did all in my power to remedy the grievance, and I think satisfactorily.</p>

I said, "Not that I know of"—he said, "Will he be in by leaving off time!" I said, "For anything I know"—no one sleeps upon our premises—I remember giving the prisoner some carboy baskets some time ago—I can't justly say how long ago, they were quite useless to us—I should say it was two months before the fire, or not so much—he said he could burn them up at his leisure in his forge—they were quite empty when I gave them to him—I never gave him any straw or shavings—the morning before the fire, I saw the prisoner on a ladder looking over into our premises—I did not take any notice of him, I kept on with my work as usual—I don't think he saw that I noticed him—I was watching with Mr. Bourdon on the morning that the fire took</p>

                  </hi>. I am an oil and colour man in the Whitechapel-road—I have premises adjoining Miss Hatton's, for making vegetable black, and I have oil stores there—the morning before the fire I saw the prisoner—he was standing with his back to his own door surveying his premises, looking at the roof—it is the joint roof of his premises and mine—I stood for a few minutes looking at him, and he turned round, and said, "Oh, you are just the man I wanted to see, Brandon; will you lend me a ladder?"—</p>

               <p>I said, "Yes, Mr. Scanes"—he said, "I have got a job at Hall &amp; Clagg's, the linendrapers, to mend their blind"—about nine o'clock that evening Mr. Bourdon called me into Miss Hatton's premises—I went in and looked over the partition—that was before the policemen came—I saw three tiers of bas<lb/>kets, one on the ground, one in the middle, and another up above, three shelves; there were three or four on each shelf, and each of them was filled with shavings and straw, and staves and Venetian blinds stuck on the top, leaning out of the baskets, up to the partition closing the premises where the gate is—about ten o'clock next morning the churchwarden called on me and asked me about the fire, and I went with him into the premises—I saw some rags hanging from underneath the top baskets to the middle baskets—I pulled them down and smelt them—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the one I pulled down—I left the others hanging—I smelt them, and found they were oily—they look like calico rags.</p>

I am a warehouseman, and live in St. Helen's-place—on Saturday evening, 21st May, I was in St. Mary Axe, between 10 and 11 o'clock, on my road home—the prisoner Bartrum came up and spoke to me; she said she thought she knew me, and had seen me before—I told her she was mistaken—she continued talking to me, and said she knew some<lb/>body very much like me—she followed me to near Great St. Helen's—it was there a narrow part, and I did not like to go through that part with her—while we were there the constable passed, and he had hardly got out of sight when she made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at my watch—I seized her hand with the watch in it—she made a <hi rend="italic">hem,</hi> and immediately I was seized by another man, not the prisoner Macklin—he got his knee in my back and tried to get me down, and used very vile language—I called the police, and another woman came and held my wrist back, and Bartrum got the watch off the swivel and ran away—the man who had hold of me tried to stop my mouth—I struck him and he let me go—I lost Bartrum, and Macklin was standing by—Bartrum ran by him, and apparently put something in his hand, and he put his hand in his pocket—the policeman came and took Bartrum and I seized Macklin, and said I thought he had got my watch—he said directly, "That woman is my wife"—the other two that had had hold of me came up, and one seized Bartrum's arm and pulled her away from the policeman—she ran towards the square, and there is no getting out there—I seized Macklin, and the policeman came and took him—Bartrum was taken by another person—I am sure the prisoners are the persons—when we got to the station they both said they had not seen me.</p>

On 26th May, about 2 in the morning, I was on duty in New Oxford-street, received information, went into George-street, and found the prosecutor, who said, "I have been robbed by this man, "pointing to the prisoner—they were both standing in the street together, but Dwelly had not hold of him—it was at the corner of George-street and New-street—there is no outlet at the other end of New-street—I took the prisoner—Dwelly was sober.</p>

My husband is a costermonger of St. Giles's—on the night the prisoner was taken I went out to look for my husband at about half-past 1 o'clock, and as I was going up Russell-street, Bloomsbury, I saw the prosecutor and a woman coming down; they turned the corner of New-street, and wanted to get into the corner house, but it was closed—I then saw them struggling between the fruit barrows, and the woman was on top of the man—I did not see them fall—she remained on top of him for about five minutes—I went home, went up stairs, and I did not wait to see what they were going to do—as I went up I met the prisoner coming down—he said, "Good night, Ellen"—I said, "Good night, <hi rend="italic">Jack"</hi>—I then went up stairs—I had not gone many stairs up when I heard the prosecutor hollow out "Police;" that was about five minutes after I had spoken to the prisoner—I turned back, came down stairs, and saw the prisoner stand<lb/>ing at the White House, and the prosecutor at the opposite corner—a policeman came up, and the prosecutor gave the prisoner in charge for stealing his hat—about ten minutes afterwards the woman came saying, "<hi rend="italic">Harry,</hi> here is your hat"—I am the woman who told the constable that I did not think the prisoner was the man—when he got the hat he charged the prisoner with tearing his pocket out, and this policeman took him to the station—I went there, and I gave my evidence one day before the Magistrate—the prisoner lives in our house.</p>

I am a baker, of Beckenham—on Sunday morning, 29th May, between 1 and 2 o'clock, I was in a coffee-shop in the market-place, Woolwich, asleep—my purse was safe in my pocket before I went to sleep—it contained 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and these three duplicates (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I do not know what coins I had—the woman of the coffee-shop awoke me, and asked me if I had lost anything—I put my hand in my pocket, and said, "I have lost my purse and money"—I went out to see if I could find a policeman, and saw the three prisoners—I asked them to give me my purse, but no one answered—I went back to the coffee-shop, and the constable took them—the witness Matzelina told me something, after which I went out in the street.</p>

I am a servant to Mr. George Triggs, of London-street, Greenwich—on Friday, 13th May, a little after 3, I was in the passage of my master's house, which affords a view of his shop—I saw the two prisoners there, and the shopman, Watson, was fitting a pair of boots on Taossin—whilst he was so engaged the other prisoner was standing at the back of him, and I saw her take a pair of boots off the side of a desk, close to where she was standing—she then lifted up her cloak and put them underneath—I went upstairs and told my mistress, and in consequence of what she said I told the shopman what I had seen—he then desired the prisoners to go into the back parlour—I did not see my mistress come into the parlour—I saw Karppeamin standing at the bottom of the counter afterwards, at the time when Watson came into the shop, and then I saw Watson pick up four pairs of boots from the place where she had been standing—I bad seen that spot a short time before, but there were no boots there at that time—Watson picked the boots from the floor at the end of the counter.</p>

I am a guard in the service of the South-Eastern Railway—I was the guard of the train that left London for Reading at half-past nine o'clock on 4th November—it is my duty to be in the luggage van, and to receive and stow away the luggage—I did so on that occasion—I received three packages—there was a tea chest—there was no black box—I went to Beading, and on arriving I put the Reading luggage on the plat<lb/>form, and the tea chest was among it—soon after, Mr. Hazle, the station-master, came up, and said that a passenger wanted a black box from London—I said I had no black box—I pointed to the luggage I had brought from London, the three packages, and Mr. Hazle asked the passenger whether his box was among them—he said that neither of these belonged to him—he must have seen the tea chest—while this was going on, another person, whom I do not know, came up and claimed the tea chest.</p>

I am the wife of Henry Joshua Gill, a warehouseman, of Coleman-street, Surrey-place, Camberwell—on Saturday night, 21st May, about twenty minutes past 9 o'clock, I was in my kitchen, and I heard a noise in my front parlour—I had been in that parlour about five minutes before 9 o'clock, and left the windows fastened—my husband had fastened them—I did not go into that parlour after I beard the noise till about 11 o'clock the next morning—I then missed my cloak, my shawl, and vic<lb/>torine</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Mr. Joseph Lilley, a solicitor in Blackman-street, Southwark—the prisoner had been formerly in Mr. Lilley's employ for two years and a half—he left of his own accord to go to his uncle in the country—he was afterwards received back in a temporary way, and continued about twelve months—he was then discharged by Mr. Lilley—he afterwards obtained a situation in Mr. Pritchard's office, the High Bailiff of Southwark—On the morning of 13th May, I proceeded to my office as usual—there are two entrances to it; one in Blackman-street, and the other in Trinity-street—I was standing at the side entrance in Trinity-street at a quarter before 10 o'clock in the morning—while there, I observed the prisoner turning the corner and coming towards our door, I observed he had something in his right hand wrapped in brown paper—on seeing me he withdrew out of sight—in a minute or two afterwards I rang the bell and went into my office—I had taken my seat about a minute when I heard a ring at the bell, and a clerk who was present opened the door; and within a minute the prisoner entered the room and coming within half a yard of me, he produced a knife which had been wrapped in brown paper—he was endeavouring to get the knife out of the paper—the paper came off and he produced the knife; and he held it up towards me with the blade pointed towards my head—he exclaimed, "You have ruined me, you have been my ruin"—and imagining he was about piercing me with the knife, I withdrew to the other end of the table—he flourished his arm about and appeared to me to be very nervous, and, on observing that, I made towards him and seized his arm and the knife fell to the ground—I picked up the knife and placed it in my drawer—I then asked the prisoner what he meant, and if he intended to murder me—he said, "Yes I did;" and I think he added, "I wish I had had strength to have done it"—I sent for a policeman who took him in custody—he said to the policeman that he wished he had murdered me, that he came there to murder me, and he wished he had done it.</p>

               <p>children; I did not see her till we were at Greenwich police-court; I re<lb/>ceived a letter from her, the prisoner has it, his is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it was on 23rd January, last year; three or four days after she had gone away, she wanted to see her children, as she was going abroad—she took no steps against the prisoner till just before I saw her at Greenwich Police-court—I heard of her living with Crow, he was in Court this morning, and I saw him speak to her—I have seen Thomas Gayter, and Thomas Tillett, and Richard Turner.</p>
