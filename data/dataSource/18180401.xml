My pantaloons were taken from under my pillow, there were two 1l. notes and ten shillings, in silver, in the pockets; the rest of the articles stated in the indictment were taken off my bed-my clothes cost me above 4l. 15s., and I had only worn them twice.

            , a shipmate of mine, came to see me, I left my house about ten o'clock, and went with him to a public-house at the top of Butcher-row - We had been to one public-house before that; that was the last we were at, we only had a pot of beer, and remained there until about half-past eleven o'clock. When we got out of the house Ford stopped for a necessary purpose, I missed him, and went into the Sampson and Lion, public-house, to look for him, but he was not there. I called for a pint of beer, the prisoner, Perkins, who was there, laid down three pence, and said make it a pot; I took it up, and gave sixpence-the other two prisoners were with him. I joined them in drinking the pot of beer, they asked me, I did not know them before; I was about half an hour talking to them-there were several other persons in the house. I was perfectly sober. There was a candle over the box where we sat. I never saw the prisoners before. Elmhurst, in particular, conversed with me. When the beer was drank, Perkins said, let us have another; I said it was time to go home; he said he would go with me. When we got out of the door he took hold of my left arm, the other two followed; he said we will go and have a girl - I said I had only got three pence. As we went on I said, we have got too far - He said come a little further. When I got to <placeName id="t18180401-5-crimeloc25">Tower-hill</placeName>

One of them put his hand to my mouth to prevent my calling out, but I pushed his hand away, and called out murder, a second time. There were several lights but no watchmen. Twelve shillings and two sixpences were taken from my pocket, and my hat was also taken from me. I was very ill used, and received a blow on my left arm. I am sure I had all the money in my pocket when I left the public-house - I felt it in my pocket. I told the prisoners I had only three pence, because I did not wish any person to know what I had about me. Perkins had hold of my arm, and the other two were near enough to hear me say I had only got three pence; I do not know whether they heard me ask if they were in company - They went away. I was stunned with the blow I had received. The patrol came up, we went after them, and saw Singer in the public-house, standing against a box, about a quarter of a mile from the place where I was robbed-it was about a quarter of an hour after; he stood against the box, and Perkins stood by the fire; I pointed them out to the patrol, and told him that Singer was the man who knocked me down-there were several other persons in the house at the time, but I did not see the other prisoner there. I am sure they are the men, I knew them again immediately I saw them. I never saw my hat after. When I saw the prisoners at the public-house they had hats on, but not mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I left my house about ten o'clock. I stopped at a public-house, and stopped at three public-houses before we got to the Lion. I had a glass of gin at two of the houses, and a glass of gin and water at the other, and had a pot of beer between four of us, and a pot at the last house. I got to the Sampson and Lion about twelve o'clock, I had changed a 1l. note at a public-house before I got there, and another 1l. note at the first public-house. I had spent 2s.6d.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you change the second note - A. To shew my shipmates that I had plenty of money. I had 1l. 13s. in silver, when I left the Sampson and Lion; I had seventeen shillings in my fob, and thirteen shillings in my other pocket, which, with 2s.6d. spent, and sixpence for the beer, made up 33s.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any person calling upon you the next morning - A. A person offered me the money to make it up; he said I should not get my expences, and that I should sell the men for the blood-money.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How soon did you miss your money - A. As soon as I got to the watch-house, I found my pocket turned out and the money gone. I called out murder, and Burt, the patrol, came up.</p>

            . I am a patrol. About twelve o'clock I was going round my beat, and heard the cry of murder; three men passed me, walking, one was foremost, and the other two were following about forty yards from him - They were about 100 yards from where the cry was. I asked them what the cry of murder was on the hill? they said they were only having a lark among themselves, and one of them had called murder. I went up to the prosecutor, and found him just got off the ground, one side of him was all over dirt; he said he had been knocked down and robbed of his hat, but said nothing about his money; he said he should know the men again. I told him three men had just passed me. We went down East Smithfield, to the Sampson and Lion, and found Perkins and Singer there - He said they were the men; I and the watchman secured them and took them to the watch-house - They were not drinking, they were standing up. Several persons were drinking there; the prosecutor knew them immediately, and looked round for the other, but could not see him. I searched the prisoners, but found nothing on them. When the prosecutor got to the watch-house he found his pocket turned out, and missed his money - He had no hat on.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I saw no woman standing near the prosecutor; he did not know that he had lost his money until he got to the watch-house. Perkins went quietly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181804010005"/>with me. Nothing was found on them. The other prisoner was taken the next day.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was calling a quarter past twelve o'clock, when the patrol called me to his assistance; I went to the Sampson and Lion with him, and saw the prosecutor without his hat - He was all over mud on one side; the right side of his face was swelled near his eye, apparently with a blow - He said he had been knocked down and robbed, and the prisoners were the men. I collared Singer, he resisted, and said he would not be collared, and twisted out of my hand, but I caught him again.

            . I am constable of St. Botolph, Aldgate. I took Perkins and Singer to the watch-house on Thursday night, the 26th of February, about half-past twelve o'clock. The prosecutor described the other man to me, I knew him, and apprehended him on board the Apollo ship in the London Docks; I saw him on deck, and told him I wanted him; he took me below, and asked what for? I told him he knew what it was for; he then said,"Is it about last night? I never did so before-have you got the others in custody?" I said I had. He then said he would tell the truth, "that the tallest man knocked him down, and he went away and left them-that it was not him." I took him from the description I received. Perkins said he had hold of the prosecutor's arm, and two men came and knocked him down. I asked why he did not take them? he said he did not know it was any harm.</p>
               <p>JOSHUA COLLEDGE re-examined. Singer knocked me down. I did not see Elmhurst do any thing, he was with the others. Perkins had hold of my arm, I do not know whether he struck me, but it must have been more than one person that struck me. I was very much hurt.</p>
               <p>PERKINS'S Defence. I spent the night at my sister's, and met the prosecutor, intoxicated - He asked me where I was going; we went into the Sampson and Lion, he called for a pot of beer; I walked out with him, he turned round and asked if the other two were in company, I knew nothing of them-one of them ran up and knocked him down. I returned to the public-house.</p>

I immediately missed the articles stated in the indictment, which were in my shop when I went to bed. My till contained about twenty shillings in copper, and a few shillings. The two sides of bacon were worth 3l. 18s. About eight o'clock that morning the prisoner came to my shop for some pickles, and appeared confused, which made me think she knew something of the robbery; I got a constable, and told him the prisoner had been for some pickles, we went to No. 12, Little James-street, Lisson-green, to a room where she lodged, and found most of the property there. The constable took her. There was a T chalked on the bacon, by which I knew it.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 10th of March, at ten o'clock at night, I was at a public-house near the prosecutor's, the prisoner came in about eleven, with three or four men, one of them called for a pot of beer, the landlord refused drawing any, it being late, but he drew it at last. When they had drank it he told them he was going to shut up, and all went out; I followed them, the prisoner went into the middle of the road, and talked to a man named Cox. Next morning I heard of the robbery, and examined the house; I found the front door had been opened by lifting up the iron bar - They are folding-doors, and which might be forced open far enough to lift the bar up. The last time I saw the prisoner was about twenty minutes after eleven o'clock at night - She knew me very well to be a constable. I went to look for the men. In about half an hour the prosecutor said he heard the things were concealed in her room; I went there with Smith, to No. 12, Little James-street, in the one-pair back room, she lived in that room; I found the door padlocked - She was gone out; we forced the lock, went in, and found most of the property, covered over, some of it in the bed, and some under-part of the bacon had been cut off and fried - I found the remains of it in the room, the prosecutor claimed it. I went to look for the prisoner, and met her about a hundred yards down Lisson-street, and told her I wanted her, as she was suspected of the robbery. I took her to the watch-house and searched her, I found the padlock key of her own room in her pocket, and two shillings upon her; she said she did not take the bacon. She said she had been to the prosecutor's for some pickles, and went our again for some starch, and intended to tell him where his things were, but did not.</p>

On the 4th of March, about seven o'clock in the evening, as I returned home I saw the prisoner and three or four others, about my window-it was quite dark-the lights were lit, but the shop-door was open. I went up to the window, they went away; I crossed the street and watched them; I came across again, and caught the prisoner with his hand in the window - I collared him; he was in the act of drawing the thermometer out; he had moved it from the place where it was, but had not got it out of the window. I saw him with his fingers under it. The other boys escaped.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>The Court ruled, that the shop-door being open, the prisoner could not be convicted of breaking and entering.</p>

            . I am an upholsterer, and live opposite the prosecutor. On the 26th of February, about nine o'clock in the morning, I observed the prisoners on the opposite side of the street, and watched them; White went into Mr. Blizard's house, came out again, crossed over to the opposite side of the street, and talked to the other two-the outer door was open. They talked together about five minutes, then Young crossed, went in, and stopped about five minutes - He had a black apron on when he went in-he came out with something wrapped in it; the other two, who were waiting for him, joined him at the end of the street. I sent for a constable; we followed them all three to the New-road, to Crescent-place. I never lost sight of them. I seized Young, the constable took Smith, and White ran away, but was taken in Burton-crescent. Smith had the cotton - He dropped it.</p>

            . I am a blacksmith, and live on Earley common. I bred Elliot's pony, and sold it to him. I knew Marlow's pony too - They were both mares - I knew it five or six years. I can swear they were on the common between five and six o'clock in the evening of the 5th of March, I saw them there when I went to catch my own; I did not see them again until they came back from town, Mr. Elliot had them - They were the same - He brought them back about the 12th or 13th of March.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. They could stray if they liked; they could not come to town. The turnpike is about two miles from the common. There are turnings out of the road.</p>

            . I live at Shenfield, about a mile and a quarter from Earley common. I saw the prisoners go by my house together on the 5th of March, about the middle of the day, in company - I knew them before - They live on Earley common; they were on the Farnham road, going from the common. I know both the ponies - I have seen them here - They are the same.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 6th of March, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoners in Smithfield, it was horse-cattle day there-each of them had a black pony - They were both in halters, and several people were looking at them; the ponies were very dirty with country dirt, which made me suspect them - They appeared jaded, as if they had ran a great way. Horn asked 9l. for his, and Green 6l. for his. Horn was going to sell his, when I touched him on the shoulder, told him I wanted to speak to him, and asked him where he brought them from? he said he brought them from Hounslow-heath, and that he bred them there, and that he lived there. I asked him if he was a horse-keeper there? he said he was. He was asked, in my presence, if he lived near the Magpie, he said he did not know, for he did not use the house. I took both the prisoners, with the ponies, to the Bear and Ragged Staff. I told them I was not satisfied with what they had said, and wished to know the truth, or I should take them into custody; Horn said he would cut his throat sooner than tell me. Green said nothing about the pony that he had. They were shown to Elliot and Marlow, and they claimed them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I noticed their being covered with country dirt.</p>
               <p>Q. Might they not have collected that dirt within two miles of town - A. No; they were very dirty. I think if I had rode them forty miles I should not have made them so dirty; they appeared to have been rode very hard, and the prisoners appeared as tired as the horses.</p>

During this time, a lady and children came in - I went and called my mother-at that moment he ran out with the chain in his hand. I immediately pursued him, calling Stop thief! - He ran down Northumberland-alley - A person ran with me; the prisoner threw the chain down an area as he ran; he ran up a court where there was no thoroughfare, we took him, and brought him back - I never lost sight of him.

The prisoners, Rowley and Saunders, came into our shop on the 24th of March, about twelve o'clock, to buy some things; while my shopman was serving Rowley, Saunders stood at the end of the shop. Rowley could not suit herself-Mr. Dean desired the man to let them go and not mind them. I told Saunders to come lower down the shop - They both went away. In the course of the afternoon, an officer brought the table-cover, which is our property.</p>

On the 24th of March I saw the prisoners and another woman in company together at Aldgate, about one o'clock; they went down the Minories-Saunders and Rowley went into several shops, Reeves walked on before, went into Hamman-street, and sat on the step of a door, she appeared to have something under her shawl. Saunders and Rowley came up to her, and they all went down the street, into the Minories again. I went up, and asked Reeves what she had under her shawl? she said they were her own, that a man gave them to her. I pushed her into a shop - They secured her while I took Rowley and Saunders. I found the tablecover under Reeves's shawl.</p>

            . On the 17th of March, about seven o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner, Crouch, in Great Marylebone-street, and asked him if he had any thing to sell? I knew him before. He said he would take me where there were some things to sell. He took me to Marylebone-mews, and sold me the flute and other things. As I was going along Holborn, I went into a music-shop, to ask the value of it - A boy, who was there claimed it as his master's-"Wheatstone, Strand," was stamped on it. Bull was present when I bought it, and said he sold it to Crouch.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. King. On the 3d of February, Whitcombe, one of the scholars, asked me if I wanted to buy any knives? he said he bought them the day before at Thomas's, in Oxford-street for 1s., that he wanted a pen-knife, and this was not one, which made him want to sell it - A boy named Deacon produced another, and then Whitcombe shewed me another, which was a pen-knife. I took them away, and gave them to Mr. King. In consequence of what Whitcombe said, the prisoner was taken. We asked him where he got them? he said they were his own. Mr. King is not here.</p>

            ; I had given up business on the 29th of September, and removed the whole of my property to his house, and it continued there until the 19th of February - I lodged there before I went to Pimlico; the articles stated in the indictment were in his house on that day. I went to Wheatley's house at half-past twelve o'clock on that day - I was going to Islington with my daughter - We left the prisoner in charge of the house, and begged of him not to leave it until I returned. I left him with my grand-daughter, who is thirteen years of age. As I was going out I wanted a 5l. note, and sent my grand-daughter up for it. I then went out with my daughter, and told the prisoner not to leave the house, as I should return to dinner at three o'clock. I returned about a quarter before three, the girl said the prisoner had left the house about three-quarters of an hour after we left. One of the lodgers asked me to lend her two table-spoons, I sent the girl up to my trunk for them, she called her mother; I went up myself, and met her - She said that two notes were gone; I found my pocketbook open, and a 20l. and a 1l. note gone, and the rest of the articles stated in the indictment. The prisoner was my <rs id="t18180401-34-deflabel197" type="occupation">apprentice</rs>

In the evening I went to Bow-street and got an officer, we went to several houses in search of him-the last house we went to, when I was in the passage I saw him in the back room with his arms round a girl's neck-it was about a quarter past ten o'clock. I collared him, brought him out, and took him to the watch-house. I saw the constable of the night untie his neck-handkerchief, and between his stiffner and handkerchief, he found the 20l. and 1l. notes; we also found some silver money on him, but nothing else of mine. We found an instrument in the water-closet, which appeared to have been used to pick the lock. The plate and money were taken from a basket which was locked in my trunk; the girl found the box locked when she went to it. I do not know how they were got at. The 20l. note was mine, I had received it from Mr. Warner; the 1l. note was not mine, but he told the magistrate he had received it for part of the plate. I have not seen the property since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had not seen the 20l. note that morning, but I had seen it two days before. The prisoner has lived with his parents lately.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember charging him with an offence similar to this sometime ago - A. I do. I never charged any other person with it.</p>

            . I am in partnership with William Irwin, we both occupy the dwelling-house. On the 24th of February, in the evening, I was accidentally at Bow-street Office, the witness, Aldous, came and asked me if had lost any cloth? I said I did not know; he said he had detained a person with some. On looking across the room I recognized the prisoner, who was then living with us as a <rs id="t18180401-35-deflabel203" type="occupation">servant</rs>

Aldous is a pawnbroker - He came with the officer who took the prisoner. I had bought the cloth only the day before, and gave 14s. a yard for it; I lost three yards and a half-it was worth 49s. I had not been at home from the time it was taken. The prisoner left work that evening at dusk.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. On the 24th of February, in the evening, the prisoner brought the cloth to me, and offered it to me in pledge - He asked 30s. upon it. I asked him what quantity there was? he said there were fourteen yards. I asked whom it belonged to? he said it was his own. I then asked whom he bought it of? he said of a hawker in St. George's-fields, at four shillings a yard. I detained it, and gave him in charge. We took him to the Office, Mr. Kipps was there, and the officer asked him about it. The prisoner told who his master was. Mr. Kipps claimed it.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 24th of February I was in Mr. Aldous's shop, on business, the prisoner came in and produced the cloth - He asked 30s. upon it. Mr. Aldous asked him about it; he said it was his own, and that he bought it of a man in the Borough. Mr. Aldous told me I had just come in time. I asked the prisoner what he bought the cloth for? he said it was to make a coat or coats, I dotnot know which. I asked him if he bought it for himself? he said his brothers were to have half of it, and that there were fourteen yards-there was no such quantity. I asked him if he had a family? he said, yes, and that he gave four shillings a yard for the cloth, and 2l. 9s. in all. I asked him if his wife could cut it? he said she might. I took him to the office. Before the magistrate came he called me aside, and said he would tell the truth, I neither threatened or promised him; he then said a man named Gurney, who worked at the same place as he did, gave it him to pledge for him. I asked whom they worked for? he said for Irwin and Kipps, Great Marylebone-street; he pointed Mr. Kipps out to me in the magistrates' room. When I took the prisoner in I shewed Mr. Kipps the cloth and he claimed it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not know what I was telling the pawnbroker. My master came to the office, and I pointed him out. Gurney and Adams (Adams is my master's apprentice) asked me to go and pledge the cloth for them, for 30s., and to bring them the money next morning when I came to work - They said it was their own. I took it to Aldous; he asked if it was mine - I said, yes. I believe it was done to prevent my working there, as I had quarrelled with the apprentice; he said I should not work there longer than he could help.</p>

On the 24th of February I was in a room adjoining the shop, Mr. Mallard, who lives opposite to me, came over, asked if I missed any thing, and said he saw it taken; I then missed the carpet, which was worth 35s.; he told me which way the men went, and I pursued them-there were three of them together. I came up and looked at the one who had the carpet, it was neither of the prisoners, he dropped it; while I was picking it up he got away across the field - I pursued, but lost him. When I returned I found the prisoners in custody. The carpet was taken out of the shop, I did not see it taken.</p>

            . I am a glazier, and live opposite the prosecutor. I saw the prisoner, Jones, and the other man, who escaped, come down the prosecutor's steps, I did not see them in the shop, Jones had the carpet under his arm. I only saw Eastway in Pond-street when he was taken.</p>
               <p>RICHARD POULSON. I am a constable. I heard the cry, and stopped the prisoners. I saw the one who escaped throw the carpet down, the prisoners were in his company.</p>

I stopped on the Heath to assist an ass out of a wheel-ruck, and the other man joined my company, we walked on, he brought the carpet out, and asked me to hold the carpet while he wrapped it up. I went on, and hearing the alarm I tried to stop the man, but he escaped.</p>
               <p>EASTWAY'S Defence. Jones and I were together, we fell in with the man on the Heath; when he got to the shop he said he had an order to execute, he brought the carpet out and gave it to Jones to hold.</p>

She stood in the middle of the shop for half an hour while I was looking for it. While I was stooping, I saw a piece of muslin fall off the counter. Suspecting her, I called her to me - She came; I saw something under her cloak, and took the twelve handkerchiefs and a piece of muslin from under it - I gave her in charge. The muslin was just by her, she could easily have taken it-it cost 28s.; I know it by the pattern to be Mr. Taylor's property. I did not see her take it.</p>

            . I wanted a coach, but there was none-it rained a little; I sat on the step of a door, under shelter, to wait for one. In about a minute, the prisoner, with four or five others, and a girl came up - They spoke to the girl who stood with me; I did not hear what they said. The prisoner, and another man, insisted on my getting up, and laid hold of my arm. As I was getting up, I felt my watch being drawn from my fob; I immediately loosed my arm, and seized my watch; the prisoner immediately knocked me down - I am sure he is the man; I have known his person for two years, by seeing him loitering about the Theatre. I got up, and knocked one of them down - I was knocked down myself repeatedly. I knocked the prisoner down once or twice - He was in the act of taking my seals from me, he was pulling at the ribbon - He did not get it then. I do not know who got it at last; it was taken from me, and he was acting with those who took it - He did not take it himself. After a considerable scuffle, I felt my seals go with a sudden snatch. They knocked me down again, and ran down Tavistock-street. The young woman who was with me saw it all, and picked up my hat and gave it to me. I immediately followed them - They did not see me; they walked down Maiden-lane, and turned into a court which leads into the Strand; I followed them into the Strand, and saw the prisoner and the party standing together, I immediately collared him. The patrol, who was about five yards off, sprung his rattle, and the party ran away. I still held the prisoner - He endeavoured to get away, and struck me - I took him to the watch-house. I lost my seals from off my watch. They tore my trowsers down to get at them.</p>

            . I was with Mr. Pead. When we came to the end of York-street, he wanted a coach, there was none - He sat on the step to wait for one. I saw him struck, and an attempt made to get his watch. I saw the prisoner, who was one of them, knock him down - I am sure it was him. I saw something go from the prisoner to another man, who gave it to a girl. The prisoner knocked him down again - They ran off. I picked Mr. Pead's hat up, and gave it to him; one of them had knocked it off. We followed them into the Strand, where Mr. Pead took the prisoner, and went to look for the others.</p>

The prisoner was in the middle of the two. He placed himself on one knee, and began rifling the prosecutor's pockets. I saw him take his right hand from the prosecutor's pocket, and put something into his right-hand coat-pocket-his hand was immediately applied a second time. I ran across-the prisoner jumped up and ran away, seeing me near him; I called to Wade to stop him. He then threw several papers of no value out of his hand. Wade tried to stop him, the prisoner struck him in the stomach - He fell. I took the prisoner immediately. Wade recovered himself, and came to my assistance. The prisoner put his hand into his right-hand coat-pocket - I kept it there, to see what he had until I got him to the watch-house. The officer there took the pocket-book out of his pocket. He threw five duplicates out of his pocket, which fell on a bench in the watchhouse. He then said, if he could have taken the life of either of us two b-gg-rs he could have died happily for us. He was sent to the Compter.</p>

               <p>CHARLES CLITHEROW. I am an officer. On the 14th of March, at two o'clock, the prisoner came behind me, and looked over my shoulder for a minute. As soon as the prosecutor's cart passed along Gracechurch-street he made towards it. Several persons were standing at the corner of Leadenhall-market-the prisoner stopped also. As soon as the prosecutor turned his back, the prisoner got on the foreboard of the cart, and looked round, as if there was a parcel he wanted to take out. He took a black trunk from the cart, put it on his shoulder, and carried it a few yards. I turned round, and he dropped it by the window at the back of the cart. He ran through Peter's-alley; I called out Stop thief! and ran round the corner - I fell in with him on the other side of Cornhill. I made a blow at him with my stick, and struck him on the foot. He crossed Bishopsgate-street to the Black Lion, opposite the Old London Tavern. A coach came between us. He got through Crosby-square, and there I missed him. I was going to the Mansion-house, and found him in custody. I left the trunk in the care of a person while I pursued. He was taken on another charge. I am sure he is the man - I knew him before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I have seen him about several times before.</p>

On the 13th of February she returned from her place, and on the 17th I missed a pair of sheets. I sent her out to the pawnbrokers, in search of them - She returned, and said she had been to several, but could not find them. On the 23d I went out about eleven o'clock-when I returned I missed the articles stated in the indictment, and found several things laying about. I told her she should not go until I searched her. She put her hand into her pocket, and pulled out some things. I found two duplicates in her right-hand for my sheets and night-gowns, and one of my shifts pinned to her back, under her gown. She was very obstinate. I sent for the beadle, who found more duplicates of my property on her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I always keep my drawers locked. I have since heard that the prisoner is a married woman, and that her husband left her in great distress.</p>

On the 5th of March, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to our house, and presented this cheque (producing it). I examined it, and asked him for whom he received it? he said from Messrs. Smith and Co., distillers, at Bow or Bromley, I do not know which. Suspecting it to be forged, I took it to Mr. Toulmin, who is one of the partners. There was something in the body of the cheque, which induced me to think it was forged. Mr. Toulmin came forward, and asked the prisoner whom he wanted to receive it for? he said for Smith and Co. Mr. Toulmin said it was rather an odd thing that the cheque should not come through their bankers. The prisoner then said he had it from a person of the name of Thompson, who was clerk in Smith and Co.'s house. He said he got it at the Bird in Hand, public-house, at Bow. John Stephens, who is our porter, was desired to go with him in a coach to Bow. Mr. Fairlie keeps cash at our horse. The cheque is not his writing.</p>

I asked him for whom he received it? he said for Smith and Co. On my making some remarks about it, he hesitated, and said it was from a clerk of Smith and Co., distillers at Bow. I asked him where he received it? he said the clerk saw him passing as he was coming to London, and promised to give him 5l. for it. It appearing singular to me that almost a stranger should trust him to receive a check, made me send my porter with him to Bow in a coach.</p>

            . In consequence of directions which I received from Mr. Toulmin, I went to Bow with the prisoner in a coach. When we left town the prisoner told the coachman to drive to the Bird in Hand at Bow. When we arrived there he pointed to the King's Arms, and said that was the house-(he had before said it was the Bird in Hand). I told him to look round, and see if the person who gave him the cheque was at the door - He said, No. We went into the parlour and tap-room, but could see no person there who answered his description. The prisoner said, it was a tall man, with a brown coat and black waistcoat. The landlord was asked in his presence, if any person of that description had been there that day? he said there had not. I took the prisoner into custody, and searched him in the parlour of the public-house, and found a bill-case on him, with an old bill in it, which I produce - I brought him to the banking-house. He asked to speak to one of the partners-Mr. Rowland Stephenson attended him. I was present-neither threats nor promises were used; he wished to speak to Mr. Stephenson privately. Mr. Stephenson told him he must say what he had to say now, as it was public enough, and asked him how he came to obtain the cheque which he had tendered in payment-if he had it from Fairlie, the supposed drawer? he said, No. He asked him if he had found it, or if any body had given it to him? he said, No. He asked him if he wrote any part of it? he said that he wrote the whole of it, through distress. I locked him up.</p>

The prisoner asked for some brass wire. There were six eye-glasses on the counter, near to where he was - I had packed them up about an hour before; I was serving other customers - I told the prisoner I would wait on him when I had done with them. I turned my head, saw the parcel safe, and kept serving my customers. In about five minutes I missed one of the parcels. I immediately went to Edward Walker, and told him-the man who came in with the prisoner went out of the shop. Mr. Walker told me to follow him - I brought him back. Mr. Walker asked him if he had seen any thing of the parcel on the counter? he said he had not, and would be searched - He went away. The prisoner waited there sometime - I suspected him. Mr. Walker said, it must be one of them, as they were close to it, and asked the prisoner if he had any objection to be searched? he said he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181804010019"/>had not.

On the 4th of March, about two o'clock in the afternoon, I went out of my laundry, and bolted the door - I left seven shirts there. As I went through the passage the prisoner came to see a woman who lived in the parlour - She came into the laundry whilst I was there, and went out again; after that I saw her come out again - She must have pushed the bolt aside. I noticed her appearing more bulky than when she came in, and saw the sleeve of a shirt hanging down from under her gown, I went in and missed two shirts, she was searched and they were found under her clothes, round her body.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Duncan. I was going towards the front of the shop, and saw the prisoner, apparently tying up her shoe. I went back, and came to the front of the shop again, and saw her in the same position, and looking up as if to see whether she was observed. Suspecting her, I went behind the glass-case, and saw her tying something up. In a minute or two she went out with a bundle - I missed the coal-scuttle from where she was stooping. I followed her into Fleet-market, laid hold of her bundle, and found it was the scuttle. I brought her back, and gave her in charge.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 24th of March, I saw the prisoners and another woman together - I watched them down the Minories. Saunders and Rowley went into several shops; they went into the prosecutor's-Reeves walked on before, and went and sat on the step of a door in Hamman-street. Rowley and Saunders came out, and went up to her - They all turned the corner, and came into the Minories again. I went up to Reeves, and asked her what she had in her apron, under her shawl? she said they were her own, and that a man gave them to her. I put her into Mr. Haywood's shop, ran round, and met the other two. I found the scarf in Reeves's apron.</p>

I was in Leadenhall-market, and saw the prisoners there-one of them appeared to be looking about; soon after, I saw Blay run away with the head, which hung on Mr. Pitt's book-Lockwood followed down the passage immediately, they were together.

            . Mr. Stubbings sent me after the prisoners. I followed them down the passage, where Lockwood joined Blay, who had the head. I followed them into a door-way in Fenchurch-street - soon after that they both came out. Lockwood then had the head in a smock-frock, which Blay had on, before he ran into the door-way. They went as far as Paul's-head-court-Blay stopped at the corner, and Lockwood carried it up the court. While he was gone, Blay saw me watching them; shortly after, I saw them talking together at the corner. Blay passed the court with the head on his shoulder, without the smock frock. I fetched a constable, and gave them in charge. I am sure they are the men - I have known them a long while.</p>

On the 13th of February, about half-past three o'clock in the morning, I apprehended the prisoner's in Arnall's skiff, at Horsleydown - They were both in it, with the sack and sculls. I asked them where they were going at that time of the morning? they said, they were going to do a job at Scott's craft, at Horsleydown. I asked where Scott's craft were? Hastings said he did not choose to tell me. I asked him his name? he said it was Smith. I asked him if he meant to persist in that name? he said, Yes. Cummings refused to tell me his name-I took them both to the office. Hastings then said his name was Hastings; I told him I knew that. Arnall claimed the skiff-Hastings said it was Arnall's.</p>

When he tendered me the 1l. note to pay for the gloves, I had some suspicion of it, and asked him to write his name on it - He wrote, "Clarke, Kingsland-road," and returned it to me. I then asked if his name was Clarke, he said, "yes;" he wrote it himself.

I saw him searched; when I went into the room, I said, is your name Clarke? - he said, "Yes, sir, is the note found?"</p>

            . I lived servant to Mr. Dobree, a pawnbroker in Oxford-street. On the 13th of November, about half-past five in the evening, the prisoner, I believe, came to our shop - I will not positively swear to him - I believe him to be the person; he pledged a telescope, two seals, a watch, (by Underhill,) and two rings, for 2l.10s. I gave him the money for them. About half-past seven, or a quarter to eight, the same evening, he came to redeem them - He tendered me three 1l. notes; I did not like their appearance; I gave them to Bagaley, another shopman, who was in the shop, to look at, he did not like them, and took them into the parlour to Mr. Owen; he came out of the parlour, leaving the notes in the parlour, and expressed his dislike of them to the prisoner, and asked him to leave them till next morning, that we might have them examined; he made no objection; Bagaley was walking to the other end of the shop; my back was turned, during that time the prisoner left the shop, and has never come since, either for the goods or notes - They were never redeemed to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have some recollection of him, by what I can form from my belief; I drew up a description of him that evening, and from that description, I believe him to be the same man; it is not from what others have said.</p>

On the 13th of March, I was taking him to the House of Correction, in a chariot, he was double ironed-the moment the coach got to Elm-street, close to the prison, he seized me, and seized him; we were in the coach; he seized me in an instant, put a rope round my throat, drove me against the back of the coach, and held me round my neck - He hurt me considerably, and got me off the seat of the coach; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181804010025"/>seized him and called to the coachman as soon as I could; he slipped the rope round my neck, and prevented my calling out at first. During the struggle the iron fell off one of his legs; I held him fast, another person got up and held him on one side, while I secured him on the other. When we got to the House of Correction, I found the rivet of the iron of his other leg filed so as to come completely off-it came off in the House of Correction; the one that fell off in the coach was also filed. On his being taken out of the coach, a man found a knife on the seat, between the seat and his thigh, it was under him where he sat-there was a blood-mark on the cushion, and his hand had bled-there were no marks of blood on the knife. I saw the turnkey find two files on him, which he said, he had used to file his irons off - He said he was sorry for the violence he had used to me, but I must consider his situation.</p>

I sent my men to a currier's to enquire, if he had fetched it away for any purpose - He brought the prisoner back; it cost me 5l.; it was taken out of our shop, which is part of my dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. Giles's.</p>

            . I am a filecutter; I saw three men go by the shop where I work, two or three times-the prisoner was one of them; it was about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning. About two or three minutes after, I saw him come by with the leather under his arm. I immediately went out and followed the three; I took the prisoner in Whetston's park - I found nothing on him. As I returned another man dropped the leather, and ran away. I took the prisoner to Mr. George's. My master followed the man who dropped the leather, but lost sight of him. They passed the shop two or three times, as if they were watching; when the prisoner went by, I saw the leather under his arm - I am sure he is the man; the leather had been shifted to the other man, who dropped it-I picked it up.</p>

On the 30th of March, at six o'clock in the evening, I fastened all my doors and windows, and went out-my property was all safe then, it was dark, between seven and eight o'clock. I returned at ten o'clock, and found my house broken open - A pane of glass had been taken out of the window, by which means they unfastened the sash - They got up by a ladder. As soon as I got into my room I fell over a stick. I turned my head to the window and found my house was broken open. I then ran up stairs with the candle, and found my sheets and blankets taken off the bed, my great-coat gone, and my pocketbook taken from off the tester of the bed. I lost the articles stated in the indictment, which were worth 37l, together. There was one 10l. two 5l. and fifteen 1l. notes in my pocket-book, which I had concealed at the top of my bed at six o'clock that night, for security. I saw all the property safe that night at six o'clock-but I saw none of it after. I suspected the prisoner, as he had been in the habit of calling on me. I got the headborough and constable and we all went in search of him-there were four of us; we were looking for him all night - We knew he lived at Wilsden. We went to Sandford and there separated. I and the constable went to Isleworth-the other two brought the prisoner and his wife to me; he said he had taken a house at Hanwell Common, and had the key in his pocket. When he saw me he denied having any house there at all. We took the key from him and went to look for an uninhabited house - We found a small house, and the key fitted the door - We took him with us. As soon as we got in we found my pillow-case, two blankets, a cap, and a pillow there. The people said he had taken the house on the Friday before. The constable found one of my braces in his hat. I never found any more of the property.</p>

The prosecutor and constable went one way, and the other two went another way. I went to the house that the key fitted, with the prisoner. We tried the key to one house, which it would not open. As soon as we entered the house that the key fitted we found the property. As we were taking him to prison he said he had pledged the coat. He was apprehended the morning after the robbery, about ten o'clock.</p>

            . I am a plasterer. On the 17th of March, about one o'clock, I saw the prisoners lurking about the prosecutor's shop, I passed them about fifty yards, turned round, and saw them walking together, with the oil-cloth - I saw Boyce take it and carry it before him, Dover walked by his side. I sent my brother to tell the prosecutor, who came out, and the prisoners ran away-the prosecutor pursued; I ran down Stafford-street to meet them, but lost them; in the evening we took Boyce, in bed. I am sure they were in company-both went up to the shop and came away together.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Woodward, Great St. Thomas Apostle. On the 21st of February, about ten minutes before six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner in St. Paul's Church-yard, carrying the box, on the east side of the road; he was making great haste, and carrying it in an awkward way; I suspected it was stolen; I followed him into Foster-lane; he then put it off his shoulder into a narrow passage; I enquired for an officer, but could not find one-as I returned towards the court, the prisoner ran away, leaving the box in the passage; he turned down George-street, which being no thoroughfare, he returned and I took him. I am sure he is the man; he said, two men gave it to him to carry; he was not far from the waggon.</p>

            , JUN, I took the books up, intending to put them into my bed-room, but not having the key I left them by the door until I went up again. I was going up between three and four o'clock, and saw the prisoner going out of the house with them under her arm - I pursued, and caught her going into an old iron-shop in Old Bethlem, to sell them. I took her back - She said she stole them. I gave her in charge.</p>

               <p>JOHN MARCHANT. I am a shoemaker, and live in Field-lane. On the 1st of April, between eleven and twelve o'clock, the prisoner came and offered me a pair of shoes for sale; he said he made them himself the day before. I told him they had been made a long while, and had laid in some shop. I asked him who he worked for? he said for Mr. Ewel and Mr. Walker. I asked him if he worked for any other person? he said, No. I asked him if he worked for Gotch? he said, he did not now, but that he did sometime ago. I told him I suspected the shoes belonged to Gotch, and asked him to go there with me-he would not. I sent for Gotch - He ran out of the shop, I followed and secured him on Snow-hill - I am sure he is the man. Gotch came and claimed the shoes. The prisoner then said he bought the duplicate of them. He could not tell where they were pledged.</p>

               <p>ROBERT DRAKE. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Long-lane. On the 25th of March the prisoner offered me the pen-bearers, or pencil-cases, for sale - He said they were his town, and that he had them in exchange for some prayer-books - He offered the books for sale also. I asked him to wait, while I went out to get an officer.</p>

I took the numbers of them, they were as follows: No. 71,936, 27th May, 1814; 37,663, 27th July, 1817; 19,658, 27th Aug. 1817; and 36,173, 24th July, 1816. I delivered the letter to Mrs. Holt, the post-mistress of Twyford, and paid the postage to London, which was 1s.1d. On the 6th of December I received a letter from my wife (looking at a 1l. note, No. 36,173, 24th July, 1816)-this is one of the notes I sent her, it has my own hand-writing on it.

            . I am an inspector of letter-carriers. On the 29th of November the prisoner was employed to deliver the Crawford-street district. A letter for Shuldham-street would go to that district-(looking at the letter sent by Mrs. Ford)-it purports, by the stamp, to have been sent on the 5th of December.</p>

            . I am the wife of James Ford, and live at No. 31, Shuldham-street, Bryanstone-square. On the 29th of November last I received no letter from my husband at all, nor about that time. I expected a letter containing money for a fortnight, which I never received, in consequence of which I got a person to write a letter for me - I gave the letter into the postman's own hands on a Wednesday. I do not know what day of the month, or what month it was.</p>

               <p>THOMAS GARTON. I am a police officer of Worship-street; I had been looking after the prisoner for six months on another charge. On the 25th of March, which was the day after the robbery, I took him in Chiswell-street, and took him to a public-house next door to the office; I found a piece of linen and four caps on him; I had not heard of this robbery; I asked him where he got them? he said, they belonged to his child. The prosecutor and his wife came in at that moment, and saw me take them out of his pocket; she claimed three of the caps and the linen; the prisoner refused to tell where he lived, but afterwards said he lived in the Borongh. I went to his wife's mother's house, but found nothing.</p>

I lost 28lbs of mutton and beef, and a cheese, worth 8s.; I did not go to bed until twenty minutes after three that morning, as the family had been to the Opera; I was the last person up; the larder is attached to the dwelling-house-it is under the same roof, and part of the house. When I went to bed, I fastened all the doors - I bolted the larder door, the key was left in it. In the morning the cook missed the meat. They got over the area and dropped down, and then unlocked the door, and went in.</p>

On Monday the 23d of March, between ten and eleven in the morning, the prisoner came into my master's shop, saying that he had a friend going to Gibraltar, and he wished to look at a sample of men's shoes-that he should want five or six dozen; five pair were looked out for him - I went with him to the King's-head, in the Tower; he said, his friend was there. When we got there, he said, we should have to wait a few minutes; he called for a pint of porter - He went out before it was brought, saying, he was going up stairs to see for his friend - He returned to me in a few minutes, saying, I was to give him part of the sample and he would take it up stairs to his friend; I gave him two pairs. Suspecting him, I looked to see which way he went, instead of going up stairs, he turned out of the door and went up the rampart stairs, which were by the side of the public-house. I pursued; he turned and saw me, and he told me, not to be afraid, as he would be back in a minute. I returned to the tap-room for what I had left there. I then went up the ramparts, and saw nothing of him; I ran and caught sight of him in the Old Mint, about 100 yards from me - I pursued till he got to Tower-hill, and there took him with the property.</p>

I told her I did not. I put it in the till, and gave her the change. Gardiner then came in and asked for a pennyworth of pickles - I told her we did not sell so small a quantity, and she went out.

I said it was not the same that I gave her; she said it was, for she had no other. I then changed it, and she went out.</p>

            . I have been seven years in the Asylum-Allen has been there eleven years. On Sunday afternoon, the 22d of February, I went, in company with the prisoners. We took a ladder from the yard, and put it against the tailor's shop-window, about seven o'clock in the evening, it was dark. Allen went up, and opened the window, it was not fastened inside. Both the prisoners went into the shop, and brought out the two jackets and waistcoats - I waited under the Colonade; they were dressed in scarlet. Allen put the blue jacket over his scarlet one. Johnson left his own jacket under the Colonade, and put on one of the blue ones. They then took the ladder, and put it against the shoe-maker's shop-window; they afterwards went to the dormitory of another company to rob it. They were taken into custody in the 7th company's dormitory.</p>

            . I am a serjeant in the Asylum. On the 22d of February, in the evening, I called over the roll of the 6th of company, and found Allen was absent - I saw nothing of him until about half-past ten o'clock-about that time I heard a noise in the 7th company's dormitory overhead. As I was going to bed, I went up with a candle. The boys called out that there were thieves under the bed. The prisoners ran from the next room down stairs, out of the 7th company's dormitory - I followed, my wife stopped them - They pushed her down, and made their escape. As they ran away they threw away three gimlets, some halfpence, victuals belonging to the children, and a prayer-book belonging to the chapel. My candle went out - I followed Johnson, and took him at the bottom of the yard - He had blue clothes on. I brought him up. Allen had stopped on the stairs - We took him. I saw the tailor's shop-window open, and some marks on it-Allen and Eccleston were on the stairs-Allen had a blue waistcoat under his red one-the boys always wear red clothes. The blue jackets are what are given to the boys when they are apprenticed out. Allen said he got the jackets out of the tailor's shop.</p>

               <p>Q. Had she any visible wounds upon her - A. No; she could not stand, she could only move her fore feet - She was quite paralyzed, and groaning very much.

The prisoner's son was in my service until within four days, or a week before this. I had discharged him about the 12th or 13th of February; for, having ordered him to go and assist the shephered, he told me he would not. The prisoner applied to me to take him again - I refused. He asked me two or three times, but I still refused. He said nothing, but shook his head.</p>

I had seen her two or three days before that, she was very well then. On the 20th the stable-door was open - I was passing by, and saw the prisoner strike her violently twice across the loins with the iron part of a pitchfork. I said, "Gently, Plane, or you will break her back" - She flinched. I did not ask him why he struck her-this was about three o'clock in the afternoon. I saw her again in about half an hour, lying down on the litter. On that evening the prisoner came and asked me to come and help her up, as she was down, and he could not get her up - I went, and got her up; she dropped her hind-part immediately, she could not stand. The prisoner asked me to go and tell my master - I did so. The next morning I saw her again, lying in the stable in the same form. I am sure she never was up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.He sent you to tell your master on the Friday night - A. Yes. She was killed on Monday. I saw her flinch from the blows.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner say she was setting on her hannches, and he could not get her up - A. No; he struck her as hard as he could. She was not of a vicious temper.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How high is the roof of the stable- A. Ten feet- there is room for a man to swing a pitchfork.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH GILBERT. I am a farrier. On the 19th of February, the prisoner brought the mare to me, and said she was not well, and would neither eat nor drink. I bled her, gave her what I thought proper, and told him to take her home, and give her warm water and mashes, and to keep her warm in the stable. This was necessary.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Passingham. On the 19th of February, after the mare came from the farrier's, I saw her turned into the yard. There was a ditch there with plenty of water-the horses water there. The mare had no clothes on to keep her warm. I saw the prisoner in the afternoon, and asked him how he came to turn her out so? and told him she had been to the cold water. He asked me if the gate was open? I told him it was. She could get at the water if the gate had been shut-it runs through the yard.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you told him she had been to the cold water, did he walk her about - A. No.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Passingham. I saw the mare on Thursday, when he took her to the farrier's. I was thrashing in the harn - He brought her in to me, and said he was going to take her to the farrier's. He said she was swelled and not well. He then took her. On the next day I saw her, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, lying in the stable. I, and two or three of the men, tried to get her up - We could not get her on her legs - She neighed, and made a groaning. The next day I asked the prisoner how she was? he said she was down and very ill. I asked him if he had given her any thing to cat? he said that was of no consequence, for she would die. The mare was killed on the Monday. I skinned her-her back was mortified and putrified at the loins for a space as large as my hat. I opened her, and took a fine foal from her. She had about a fortnight or three weeks to go.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you judge from the wounds what they had been done by - A. It was impossible for me to say, when the mare was down, whether she was bruised, or whether she had bruised herself.</p>
               <p>Q. She was lying on the litter in the stable, how could she bruise herself - A. She was had across the loins. There was no skin knocked off the hip or shoulder.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. If you had seen the would, not knowing she had been struck, should you think she wounded herself, or any person had wounded her - A. She could not have bruised herself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Does not improper medicine, administered to mares when with foal, occasion death - A. The wounds she received would kill any animal whatever.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH SALMON. I am servant to Mr. Passingham. Sometime after the prisoner was discharged, I was walking with him, and talking about the mare, he said he knew the cause of her death. I did not ask him what it was.</p>

On the 1st of April, between four and five o'clock, I was in my shop, my family were at home; a person knocked at the door; I have only one house but two shops. A person came in and wanted something in the other shop, which is a brush-shop, the man wanted a set of brushes, and said he would call again. When I came into the other shop, I found the door half open, it was shut when I left it, and for some time before-it goes on a latch-both shops front the street; there is a door goes out of each of them into the street; I am sure I fastened the door of my tailor's-shop; I stood close to it until I heard the knock at the door-there is a door communicating between the two shops. When I found the door open. I missed nothing at that moment - I remained at the counter, until I was called in to tea. As I sat at tea, I observed a vacancy in the window where the kerseymore stood; this was about a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes after. I had never left the door, nor had any one come in after. About a quarter of an hour after that, a person came and asked if I had lost a piece of cloth or kerseymere, and said it was at St. Martin's watchhouse; I went there, and found it - I knew it to be mine. The prisoner is not the man who came for the brushes; I saw nobody with him - I saw nobody come into the other shop. The man who came for the brushes kept making a noise all the while, by knocking them on the counter.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live in Sherrard-street, Golden-square. On the 1st of April, in the afternoon, I was passing up Chandos-street; a man either passed me, or was before me, who excited my notice. I kept my eye on him for some time, and found he was looking for something behind me. I looked round and saw the prisoner on the other side of the street, with a piece of kerseymere under his arm. I kept my eye on him for sometime, and was induced to think all was not right-thinking he belonged to the other man. When they got to the narrow end of Chandos-street, the prisoner appeared to be making up to the other man - I felt convinced they belonged to each other, and I followed them - They ran - I could hardly keep up with them, the prisoner turned round, and saw me following him; he immediately quickened his pace, and turned up Bedfordbury. As soon as I turned the corner myself, I found he had thrown the piece of kerseymere down; a man picked it up - I took it from him, and pursued the prisoner; he turned round May's-buildings; I raised a cry after him; he was stopped in St. Martin's-lane - I am sure he is the man who had the kerseymere; I came up and took him to St. Martin's watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you lose sight of me - A. Yes, when you turned into May's-buildings - I caught sight of you again immediately.</p>

He went to an oil cupboard, and pulled out a dirty shirt of his own; I asked if he had left any thing else there, he said, No - I looked and found a new shawl there - I asked how he came to put it there, he said, he intended to pay me for it, and offered me a 1l. note for it; it was not worth above 10s.; I refused it, and sent for a constable, who came.

            . I am a mealman. On Sunday night the 22d of March, about ten o'clock, I was going with my brother to a neighbour's, about 100 yards off. As I went out of my gate, I saw the prisoner and two others pass - I suspected them; the prisoner had something under his great-coat, and was a few yards behind the others; the other two kept their faces hid from me as much as possible, which made me suspect them the more. I told my brother, that I thought they were after no good - We passed them again; I saw the prisoner very plain; when I got to the house where I was going to, I let them pass again, and saw them nearer together; I live about a mile from the prosecutor. About six o'clock next morning, I went to Shepherd's-bush and saw the prisoner; I told my brother he was the man that passed my house the night before; immediately as I spoke five pigs came into the road-the prisoner was driving them; I said, "Halloo, my friend, you seem as if you had drove those pigs a great way," and asked where he brought them from; he said, from Chertsey, and was going to take them to town; I got out of my chaise, and told him he was the man who passed my house at Drayton, the night before; he said, he was there once. I asked if the pigs belonged to him? he said, they were his and his brother's-that they bred them, and that they lived near Chertsey - They were overdrove; I told him they were stolen, and secured him.</p>

I left my pocket-book and six 1l. notes in the cabin cupboard. I went to a public-house, and found the prisoner there. I had left him in the barge - He asked me for some money, I refused, and told him he was in debt; he left the public-house. I returned in about three-quarters of an hour, found he was not there, and the pocket-book and money gone. I found him next day at the Magpie, public-house, at Brentford; he said he would not work for a master who would give no money. I told him he had money enough. I went to search him; he had a man with him who knocked me down. I sent for a constable, he found the pocket-book, and four country notes on him, which were mine; the other two were Bank of England notes.</p>

            . I am patrol of St. Giles's. About a quarter before three o'clock in the morning, on the 27th of February-it was not daylight - I met the prisoners going down Tottenham-court-road, with four pigs; I followed them to George-street, St. Giles's, into the Maidenhead, public-house yard. They put the pigs into the stable. I asked them if they were their own - They said they had brought them from Barnet for a man who was intoxicated, and that he told them to drive them into their stable. I thought they could not have come so far, as they appeared fresh. I secured the prisoners, and took the pigs to the Green-yard - I found they were the prosecutor's.</p>

About three o'clock I heard some persons walking up the tiles, and cutting the lead in the gutter; in about five minutes we came out; I stood at the gate while Roberts went on the tiling after them - He called out; I ran to the wrong gate, so that one of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181804010041"/>them got away. I went to Roberts, who had secured Summer, and found 27lbs. of lead cut, and moved off the building on to the adjoining roof - A hat laid by it, which I have frequently seen the prisoner, Green, wear - He was brought back again in a few minutes, without a hat. I told him he had ran away without his hat - He asked me to give it to him, but I refused. We had taken Summer to the watch-house. I found a knife on the premises, with which the lead had been cut. 40lbs. more had been cut. but not moved. Green said the hat was his.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Oxford-street. On the 21st of March the prisoner came to my shop, and asked me if I bought silver? I said, Yes. He said he had found a spoon in a ruinous building in Somerset-street, which he produced. I observed two crests on it - He wanted 1l. for it. I said I could not give above 15s., and would give him that, if he would let me go and find to whom the crest belonged. He said money was of more use to him than the spoon. I suspected he had stolen it, and offered him 10s. for it - He agreed to take it. I made an excuse to send for change and got an officer, who took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. He made no attempt to deface the crest.</p>

On the 16th of March, about six o'clock, I saw the prisoners, with another boy, go down the crescent - I suspected them; they had nothing with them then. I saw them return at seven o'clock-both of them were loaded with lead. I followed them to Poplar, and took Barrett with the lead upon him. They went to Mr. Edwards's shop at Poplar. Newman, and the other boy, dropped their load there - They ran through the house, and got away. Another person took Newman. I am sure they are the boys.</p>

            . I was in the road; the prisoner was driving the waggon with the malt to the brewhouse. I saw him take some malt out of two sacks, and put it into the nose-bag; I went up and said, "Can you not leave your old tricks off?" he said, "What tricks;" I said "Taking the malt out of the sacks." He told me not to say any thing, as it was the first time he ever did it, and he only took it for the horses; he asked me to drink. I came on before him to the brewhouse.</p>

            . I am a clerk to Messrs Hanbury and Co. About seven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner delivered the load of malt. Wilborn had given me information; I noticed the prisoner in the yard; he did not give the horses any thing to eat out of the nose-bag. I followed him to Brick-lane, and asked him what he had got in the nose-bag? he said, he had nothing at all. I found the malt one of them. He said, he hoped I would forgive him, it being his first offence; he then said, he was going to give it to the horses, and had taken it out of the sacks. The firm is rightly stated in the indictment.</p>

            . I am an officer, and keep a slopseller's-shop, in Upper East Smithfield. On the 29th of March, the prisoner came to my shop, and asked me to buy a watch of him; I asked to look at it; the moment I saw it, I knew it to be worth fifteen or sixteen guineas. I asked what he wanted for it; he said, 4l; I asked him how he could ask 4l. for such a watch; he said, it cost him nine or ten guineas, and that he bought it for gold. I asked him where he bought it; he said, in India, of a saior on board the Lord Kinnaird ship; I asked him where the chain and seals were; he said, he wore none; I asked him for the key; he said, he had sold it to Mr. Davidson. Knowing it was not got honestly, I took him into custody; he then said "Let me go, and I will prove who I bought it of." He sent for Mr. Davidson-it is a valuable watch.</p>

I pulled towards them, as soon as they saw me, they ran out of that barge into the cabin of another, where I found them. Goodacre was in the mate's bed, and the other prisoner, in the cabin close to him. I asked what they did there; they said, they came there for refuge; that they worked for Granger, and had come to put the beer on board the ship Cybele, at Blackwall; I took them into custody, and went on board the Maria, and found seven of the hogsheads fresh spiled. They had thrown down a can of beer, in running away - I found two kegs full; I also found two gimblets, and nine spile pegs.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM HIERSON. I am the prosecutor's son. On the 28th of March, at seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the endive roots growing in my father's garden, which is inclosed-there were six or seven hundred of them; next day I found they were carried away. On the 31st I found fourteen score of them at Covent-garden-market, I am sure they were part of those my father had grown. When the roots are planted, most people trim them; they were not trimmed, by which I knew them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. We did not trim them because they were very small-other people always trim them. I saw them safe at seven o'clock on Sunday night-it was not dark then-it was night - I missed them the next afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they not plants - A. No, roots.</p>

             re-examined. They are roots. When the prisoner was in custody, we neither threatened nor promised him; the prisoner said it served him right, and that Hudson was the man who brought him to it; he said, he wished he was hanged out of the way-that he took it out of my garden about nine or ten o'clock at night. I saw his house searched, and ten parcels found under his bed, which are mine - They are worth 8l.</p>
