                  </hi>. I am manager of the printing department of Messrs. Collingridge, printers and publishers, 148, Aldersgate Street—they are proprietors of the <hi rend="italic">City Press</hi>—in the course of business a large quantity of waste-paper is left in the warehouse—Payne was foreman of the warehouse; Yates is a waste-paper dealer—he has been in the habit of collecting our waste-paper for the last four or five years—it was Payne's duty to superintend the weighing and delivery of the waste-paper to Yates's vans, and to make out a delivery note showing the quantity of waste-paper that has been delivered—the delivery note is kept in the warehouse, from that the invoice would be made out to Yates—on Wednesday, 9th May last, I received instructions from Mr. Collingridge, in consequence of which I waited until Yates's vans were loaded—I saw the vans waiting to be loaded about 20 minutes past 9—when they were loaded I sent Mr. Alexander, one of the clerks, to ask Payne for the delivery note—Mr. Alexander brought me this delivery note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is in Payne's handwriting, and is signed by Yates—it is dated 9th May, 1888, and is in this form: "Received from W. H. and L. Collingridge 13 cwt. and a quarter shavings and 20 cwt. of rubbish"—that is all that is shown on the delivery note—we have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188807020009"/>
               <p>three classes of waste-paper, shavings, clean waste, and rubbish—the paper is used entirely in the printing department—some of the paper so employed ultimately becomes waste—the clean waste would accumulate day by day—Yates's vans collected about every five weeks—having got the delivery note I went to where the vans were—one van was a large one and the other a small one; they were both loaded—Yates was not there when I first got round—he came up two or three minutes afterwards—I said to him "We shall want this waste re-weighed"—he objected, and said he would not have it re-weighed, and asked what would pay him for his trouble and time—he asked why I wished it re-weighed—I said "Because I am not satisfied with the weight as given in on the delivery note"—he still objected to the waste being re-weighed, and he told the carman to drive away—I said if he did I should have to stop him—after I had said so he told his man to drive away, and the small van was driven up Clothfair—I sent a man named Spain after it, and told him to bring the van back, and if necessary to call a constable to compel him—I saw a constable come up shortly after—the van had got some distance down Clothfair, and Yates called after the van, and it was brought back—Yates said we might have our goods back, all that belonged to us—he said that only 18 bags on the small van belonged to us, and either 51 or 55 off the large one—he said the other bags had been collected from Pardon's and Judd's—I said the Whole had been collected from our premises, and I required them all to be thrown off—he threw off about 30 or 32 sacks from the small van—he afterwards drove away with the remaining sacks, seven or eight, I could not say exactly—those would be large sacks—I should think they were shavings, weighing about 1 cwt. or 1 cwt. and a half each, sack—all the sacks were taken off the large van—I then had the whole quantity re-weighed which had been left behind by Yates—I superintended the weighing—I found 4 cwt. 1 qr. and 24 lb. of waste among it, not entered on the delivery note—I also found 13 cwt. and 24 lb. of shavings; that was rather less than that entered on the invoice—the rubbish was 2 tons 7 cwt. 3 qrs. 11 lb., showing a difference of 1 ton 7 cwt. 3 qrs. 11 lb. of rubbish above the quantity on the delivery note—the price per cwt. of the waste varies from 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—at this time the rubbish was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a cwt., the clean waste 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the shavings 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.— that same afternoon I saw Payne in the presence of Mr. Collingridge—he was sent for—I heard what passed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BLACKWELL</hi>. Payne said this had been going on ever since Yates collected—I did not say that before the Magistrate—I did not mention the name of Yates—I did not recollect the whole of the conversation at the time—I have not been talking it over with Mr. Collingridge since—I remembered the reference to Yates immediately the Court rose—I may have stated then that Payne said "This practice has been going on for some years"—I heard nothing about averaging before to-day; I may have heard something of the kind from Yates—I have been manager of the printing department two and a-half years; previously I was a clerk to Messrs. Collingridge six years, at the same office—Mr. Rawley was foreman before Payne—it was Payne's duty to weigh, or to get somebody else to weigh; the foreman would make his own arrangement—I cannot of my own knowledge say whether, on this particular occasion, he had weighed or not; I believe the person is here who weighed on that day—Payne would be responsible for the weighing, if he did not weigh himself he would have to take the weights from the person who did—I believe he always weighed himself; I was not there—I have never been present when the weighing has been going on, except after these seizures from the van—some sacks were driven away on this occasion; I had received information that the vans were empty when they arrived—I saw the sacks in the van—I could not swear that they were Messrs. Collingridge's—there was about 4 or 5 lb. of shavings less in the sacks than was on the delivery note—it was about 2 o'clock when Payne was called into the office by Mr. Collingridge—Mr. Collingridge had previously sent for him, but he was out, I believe at dinner—when he came back he had apparently been drinking—Payne is at times very excitable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GEOGHEGAN</hi>. Yates supplies the bags and the vans to take the stuff away—the bags vary in size; some are large, some small—I believe whichever bags come first are used—the large bags would not represent one class of weight, and the small bags another—rubbish is the paper collected from the floors of the rooms—where materials are swept from the floors there is a possibility of other things getting in, but we have dust-bins—one of our witnesses may have said at the police-court that sometimes the sweepings would be composed of old boots and ginger beer bottles—I don't contradict it—Yates buys it as rubbish, not as paper—it has been understood that all the waste should be weighed—Mr. Rawley was manager for many years—in his time it was not entirely the custom to average the rubbish at so many bags to the hundredweight—I should very much doubt that out of 6 tons of rubbish there would be two or three tons of dirt—I don't know that it is the practice of Messrs. Bradbury's, Messrs. Spottiswoode, and other large printers to average the rubbish; I have not made inquiries; it took me quite by surprise on 9th May that such a practice should exist—the former foreman did not admit such a practice, not as a general thing—I have never seen the bags taken away; they are taken away early in the morning when no one is about—clean waste accumulates every day, the same as the other waste—probably Yates takes away clean waste every time his van comes—the boys fill the sacks—some of the sacks may have been filled a fortnight before—sucks were left by Yates ready to be</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188807020011"/>
               <p>filled—Yates does not depend upon our foreman for the weights until he gets to his own place; he has the opportunity of checking it at out place—I think he offered to allow Mr. Collingridge to inspect the stuff; that was after the small van had been driven away. Mr. Collingridge told him he would have to bring it back—it was brought back, but I not certain whether the same bags were brought back; I am under the impression that they may have been changed—I believe they were differently placed in the van—they had not the same appearance—probably an hour and a-half had elapsed before the van returned—Mr. Judd and Mr. Pardon are printers; I know nothing about their business—I went to them—I found out Pardon's that Yates' van had been there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I found that Yates' van had been to Pardon's between 8 and 9 o'clock in the morning—the vans were loaded at our place at 9.20; I was not there to see them—nobody but Yates collected this class of waste from us for the last four or five years—there might have been special matters that were cleared away from time to time by other people—he is the only person who came regularly for these classes of waste—the clean waste should not be mixed with the rubbish, they come from different floors—the sweepings come principally from one floor—the rubbish comes more particularly from the machine-room floor—it should chiefly consist of waste paper of some sort or other—we have a dustbin for refuse of all kinds, dust, dirt, bottles, &amp;c.—men are employed to clean the floors of such things—it is their duty to separate such things from the paper; if a bottle got into one of the sacks I should say that would be very rare occurrence; I am about the place continually, and see what is going on—I never saw a dead cat there—the men occasionally wear old boots in the office—what I said before the Magistrate was "Payne said 'This practice has been going on four or five years, and I have known as much 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth go n the same way.'"</p>

                  </hi>. I am partner with william Hill Collingridge, at 148, Aldersgate Street—Yates has been in the habit of collecting our waste-paper for four or five years—no other person has done so regularly for that period—occasionally there would be large parcels of accumulations of magazines and periodicals, which would be the subject of a separate contract for sale—clean waste, rubbish, and shavings would be collected by Yates—there would always be clean waste to be collected; there should be from 4 to 8 cwt. of clean waste every month; that would be the average accumulation—prior to the 9th of May I had received certain information, in consequence of which I instructed a watch to be kept—on 9th of May, about 11 o'clock in the morning, I saw Yates in my office—at that time the small van had not come back—Yates asked to see me, and, stepping into my room, he said "There is a lot of bother round the corner, Mr. Benny has stopped the vans and interfered with my taking it away"—I said "It is a very serious matter; I have received information that the waste is very largely in excess of that on the delivery note; it is a very serious matter indeed, and I can say nothing to you about it, except that you have driven away with some six or eight bags of shavings, and I must insist on your bringing that back"—he said they were all shavings he had collected that morning from Messrs. Judd and Messrs. Pardon—I told from if he did not bring them back of his own accord I should compel him—he then went away—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188807020012"/>
               <p>he came back in about two hours, and said "I have brought the shavings, come and look at them"—I said "No, I shall not look at the shavings, the affair is of a very serious nature, I will say nothing more to you, I shall send over and consult my solicitor"—between the time of his going away and coming back I had received further information—after he had gone I sent for Payne; he was not in at first, I saw him about 2 o'clock in Mr. Benny's presence—I said to Payne "What has occurred has distressed me very much, I have sent for you in order that you may give what explanation you choose"—he said "I have nothing to say, I could tell a lot, but I shan't in the presence of Mr. Benny"—I said "Whatever you say must be in the presence of Mr. Benny; I don't ask you to say anything, but I have sent for you to give you the opportunity"—he then said "I have been tempted to do it, more than tempted, it has been going on four or five years, ever since Yates cleared away the waste; I hope you will forgive me, I will serve you well in future, I will go straight, that I will"—I think that was all that passed, except telling him that what had occurred was so serious that I must ask him to put on his hat and leave the place—I told him that the waste-paper that had been delivered was so largely in excess of what had been accounted for in the books that I should send for Mr. Holder, our solicitor—he appeared to understand thoroughly what he was saying and what he was about.</p>

I do not think Payne has been in our employ quite so long as nine or ten years, I would not swear he has not—I should think he came with a good character or he would not have been accepted—on one occasion he took charge of my private house when I was away; I had confidence in him, he was for some time deputy under Mr. Rawley—I know now what Mr. Rawley's practice was—it was no part of Payne's duty to fill the sacks, that would be done by the boys and men in each department—there would be a certain amount of rubbish in each department—I don't think it possible for clean waste to get mixed with rubbish—I don't think the boys would mix all sorts of things in the bags; it is scarcely possible that rubbish could get mixed with clean waste—I do not deny that it might be so, but it would be very slovenly and a very rare thing for a pair of old boots to get mixed in the bags—I am not prepared to say that out of 2 tons of rubbish there might not be a pair of old boots—we have a man to sweep up—Payne knew very well what he was saying; he was not at all excited, he was calm.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GEOGHEGAN</hi>. I did not in the first instance instruct my solicitor to proceed by way of summons, I left the matter to his discretion—I think I said before the Alderman that the clean waste was invoiced once in about three months—I said that without reference to my books I could not speak as to figures—I say that clean waste must have gone out every month, because it was accumulating everyday, and it was missing—it was part of our servants' daily work to bag up the rubbish and pack up the clean waste; that would rest with Payne—I think Yates said it was not customary to weigh the rubbish; that was the first time I heard of that—I did not know that Rawley had done it—after Payne's statement that it had been going on four or five years I sent to Mr. Rawley that I should like to see him—he called, and he thanked me for giving him the opportunity of explaining the transactions while he was manager—he informed me that he had left the weighing to Payne;</p>

               <p>that he did not understand the scales; in fact, he must confess, although it seemed very foolish, that he did not understand the weighing of the machine, and could not have done it—he told me he had caused the large bags of rubbish to be sorted from the small, and that he then put some of the small bags on the scales, and found them average about a quarter of a cwt; that four of the small bags went to the cwt.—that refers to the small bags—that was brought to my knowledge for the first time when Payne said that was the way it done—Rawley told me according to his experience he was quite clear that averaging would be in favour of the firm. <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> First-class waste as a rule is invoiced once in every three transactions—I am constantly about the premises—if the clean waste is not taken away my attention would be Payne's duty to see that the clean waste was packed up and delivered—it would scarcely be in the boy's hands.</p>

I am a corn and flour factor and carry on business in co-partnership with others under the title and style of James Limmer and Son—we purchased the business from the trustees in liquidation of James Limmer, the prisoner's father, in 1883—I had been engaged in the old firm as a salaried servant—I took the prisoner as traveller on commission about twelve months ago—his duties were to call on customers and take orders, and we made an arrangement with him to fix a certain price, and he should have half the profits above the fixed cost price after deducting the working expenses—we have some credit customers, but the prisoner's business was to be for cash—he had no authority to endorse cheques on behalf of the firm;—in March last he was travelling for us—it was his duty to render accounts of the business he did; he always sent them in the same evening or the first thing next morning, so that we could deliver them—these are the return sheets he sent to me in the ordinary course of business from the 26th March to the end of May—there is no record in this of the receipt on 26th March of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Davey—this is the only way he accounted for the business in writing at the end of each day—there was no other way of accounting—he made a return of the orders he got; we sent out the bills if there was credit from them—on several occasions the prisoner has received money and would forward it on with the orders or let it run till Saturday when he came for his commission—he had no authority to receive money—the carmen were to receive money on the delivery of the goods—we drew his attention on several occasions to his receiving money—in consequence of what I heard I sent in my account to Mr. Davey, who handed me these two documents and this cheque—the endorsement to the cheque is in the prisoner's writing—in consequence of that I applied for a warrant and caused the prisoner to be arrested on the charge of forging the endorsement on the cheque.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Walter Lee, a cabdriver, and live at 53, Drummond Crescent, St. Pancras—we occupy the back room ground floor—we let the back kitchen to Mary Newman about five months ago—she and her two children occupied it at first—one of them was Jane Newman, about 13—the prisoner came there about four months and a half afterwards; I can't say the date—it was after she had been there a fortnight—Mrs. Salmon occupied the front kitchen with her son Edward, who is about 28—one night, about three weeks before this occurrence, I heard a screaming in the back kitchen—I went down, and saw Mrs. Newman bleeding from the mouth, and she had a black eye—the prisoner was there—I sent for a policeman, who came—the prisoner wanted to go into the front kitchen, where Edward Salmon was—the constable refused to allow him, and he took him to the station—I went with them, and Mrs. Newman too—she there refused to charge him, and he was released—he went back to the room, but Mrs. Newman went away—she remained away two of three nights—the prisoner remained there—in consequence of his state I gave information to the relieving officer and two doctors—they examined him, and he was taken to the workhouse the same day—after that Mrs. Newman returned, and at the end of the week the prisoner returned—several days before he went to the workhouse I heard him sharpening a knife on the step, and he said "I will cut her throat"—I did not see the knife—after he returned from the workhouse Mrs. Newman went away again for two or three days—on the Saturday before she died Salmon told me that the prisoner had given him a black eye—I did not hear anything of the quarrel—that night I would not let the prisoner in, because I thought there would be a disturbance—early on the morning of 16th May he came back and lived in the house</p>

               <p>with the deceased—on the evening of 19th May, about 7, I was in my room—as I was going from one room to the other I saw the girl Jane Newman crying in the passage—in consequence of what she said I went down to their room—the door was shut—on going in I saw the deceased lying on the bed bleeding, and the prisoner with his right hand under her head, and his left hand at her throat—he had something in his hand, but the palm of his hand hid the handle, but I am certain it was a knife—the deceased said "Mrs. Lee, he is killing me"—I caught hold of the collar of his coat and said "You murderous villain, you are killing her"—he turned round and looked very strange at me—he did not say a word—he had something in his hand, and was digging at her throat—I tried to pull him off her, but could not, and I ran upstairs and called Mr. Butcher, who was in the front parlour, and he ran down with William Mulford—I ran over to Mrs. Newman's sister, and when I came back I saw the prisoner scuffling with Mr. Butcher in the kitchen—I fetched Kelly, the constable, and I followed the prisoner, and he and Butcher and the deceased all came up together to my room—the prisoner then left—I followed him out—he went to No. 3, Charlton Street, which was not very far off—he stood by a butcher's stall there—Kelly came out of my house, and I showed him the prisoner—the prisoner went into the Coffee House public-house, and two constables took him to the station—when I got back to my house I saw Mrs. Newman in my parlour—she had a cloth round her neck, and Dr. Llewellyn was attending to her, and Mr. Butcher—she was removed to the hospital—she always went by the name of Mary Newman, and the prisoner as Latham.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not know till lately that they had lived together 14 years—he was at times in the habit of drinking to excess; that was not very often; mostly on a Saturday night after he had finished at the meat-stall—he was attached to the meat-stall—he acted strangely this last time—on 30th April he was so bad that I was frightened—on 19th May when I went into the back kitchen he did not appear to recognise me—he did not seem to take any notice of me—he looked strange at me—he did not appear to know me—he did not appear to notice anything—he did not appear the least to understand what he was doing, he took no heed of it—the deceased was a well-behaved woman—she worked very hard—there is no ground for saying that she misbehaved herself with young Salmon—as far as I know no man visited her—on 19th May the prisoner came up to the parlour, and asked me if I had seen his brother Charley—I said "No"—he seemed to think I had him concealed somewhere—he seemed quite strange that afternoon—his own name is Charley—at the time I heard him sharpening the knife on the step he was doing it quite openly; he was talking to himself—I have heard him do that on more occasions in the yard when he was strange—I have heard him talking about a policeman getting over the yard—I have not heard him say anything about young Salmon, only that night when he wanted to get into the room, when the policeman was there—on these occasions he appeared very odd in his manner—he went into the wash house in a state of nudity—that was before he went into the workhouse—I don't know the date.</p>

Kelly—I asked what the charge was—Kelly said "For cutting his wife's throat with a knife"—the prisoner said "Yes, for cutting my wife's throat with a knife"—I searched him, and told him I should have to detain him—he appeared to be very strange in his manner—he rolled his eyes about, and he was very flushed—from what I heard I at once went to 53, Drummond Crescent—I went down to the bedroom—it was in disorder; the bedding was all rolled up on the bedstead—I found this table knife doubled up between a pillow on the floor—it had on it marks of blood and hair, and about an inch of the point was broken off—there were three separate pools of blood on the floor—I heard that the woman had been taken to the hospital—I went to the hospital, and found that she was dead—I then returned to the station and charged the prisoner—Inspector Palmer read over the charge to the prisoner—it was for the wilful murder of Mary Newman at 53, Drummond Crescent—Palmer then cautioned the prisoner—he said "Any statement you might wish to make will be taken down by me, and might be used in evidence against you"—he then began to make the statement, which Palmer wrote down—he put no questions to him—he made it voluntarily—it was read over to him—he said it was correct, and he signed it, and I and Palmer also—this is it.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant H</hi>). On 14th December, 1887, about 6.30, I and another officer went to 140, Jubilee Street, Commercial Road, where the prisoner resided—I arrested him on a charge of smuggling, and I then found a bag containing 14 lb. of silk under the bed; the silk was similar to this sample, in skeins of various colours—he was taken to Arbour Square, and fined 116<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for smuggling—the silk was not then owned, and it was detained for 14 days—when I found the silk at his rooms I asked him about it, and he said "I refuse to give any account of it"—I took him to the station, and he was brought up at the Thames Police-court—on 8th March a summons came on for hearing; Sir Charles Warren for the Commissioners of Police was represented by Sergeant Jones from the Convict Office—the prisoner appeared, and Mr. Bayliss appeared—the matter before the Magistrate related to silk—Sergeant Jones took the silk away; it was given up afterwards—the prisoner went into the witness box, and made a statement—he said in my presence, but not to me, "I bought it off a stall in Petticoat Lane; I don't remember what I gave for it"—this occurred in Court—he said he could not remember the names of the parties he bought it of, or what he gave for it—the silk found at his house was afterwards shown to Mr. Bayliss, and was produced at Bow Street—some other property was found, but that is not here to-day—a pair of curtains was found—they were shown to Mr. Low, of 32, Romford Road, and he has identified them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first gave evidence before the Magistrate on 16th June, and was recalled on 19th—on the 16th I said the prisoner had</p>

               <p>been charged with unlawful possession of the silk, and that the charge was dismissed, and afterwards, on the 19th, I said it was not gone into—it was a mistake to say it was dismissed—the prisoner's father was tried here last Session for receiving stolen goods, convicted and sentenced to 20 months—when the prisoner was taken into custody the father was not in custody—at the time the prisoner declined to give me any information about the silk his father was not in custody—Detective Cross, of the City Police, is in charge of the case—I have been to Low's place of business—at the police-court it was sworn that this pair of curtains was found at the prisoner's house; that is correct—before the prisoner was sent for trial I knew the curtains belonged to Low—I saw Low's foreman, and asked him to attend at the police-court—the foreman said he would request Low to go there, but he did not come—I saw Low before the prisoner was sent for trial; I did not ask him to attend at the police-court—he said "I have got my property"—he got in the witness box; he did not decline, nor did he wish to prosecute—the Commissioners of Police did not put pressure on him to prosecute—Low did not say that one reason he declined to prosecute was because he knew the curtains had been stolen by the prisoner's father—the prisoner occupies one small room—I don't know that during the time he was locked up his father was in the habit of visiting there—I have never seen his father going there; I daresay he was friendly with his father—his father pleaded guilty to three indictments for receiving—the prisoner could not pay the 116<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and went to prison instead—Cross arrested him—the Magistrate heard about the silk found in his possession before he sentenced him; it was produced in Court—the summons was taken out by the Commissioners of Police calling on the defendant to show cause why the property should not be given up; it was an interpleader summons—when that summons was heard at Bow Street the prisoner's father was not then in custody; the police had not sufficient information to warrant them in arresting him, and his father not being in custody he declined to give the police any information as to how he got it—I believe the prisoner had been in custody before, besides for the smuggling; I have information that he was in custody two years ago at Clerkenwell—a friend of mine knows it better than I do; he is a man I have had a good bit of information from; he is anything—I don't say I know the prisoner has been convicted—I don't know who is the gaoler at Clerkenwell Police-court now—I have been to the police-court and the police-station—I have nobody here to identify the prisoner; I don't know the officer who had him; I cannot swear any officer over had him—I don't know the name of the person who told me he had been convicted before—I don't know that he has been convicted—I have met my informer in Petticoat Lane generally; he is not there with a stall—sometimes I meet him in public-houses—I meet him accidentally about 12 and 6 o'clock—I call him Joe; there are a lot of people down our way who don't know each other's proper names.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 33, Bramber Road, Fulham—I have two elder sisters, Johanna, aged 19, and Mary, 22—we all three lived together; the prisoner lodged in the house from August 1886, to March, 1887—he became engaged to Johanna—about November last the engagement was broken off—I saw him about a month or so before 12th April he called at the house and said he wanted to see Johanna—she was out, I told him so—he said he wanted to speak to her, he wanted his photo back—that was all that passed—he then left—I saw him next on 12th April about 9 at night; he knocked at the door and asked to see Johanna, he wanted to make it up with her again, as he was going away—he did not say where he was going—I told him she would have nothing more to do with him—he said he would not bother us any more—he asked me to go upstairs and ask her if she would come and see him at the door—I shut the door and shut him out and went upstairs, and saw my sister, came down again, opened the door where he was waiting, and said she would not see him—he said he was going away on a voyage and he would not trouble us any more—he asked me to go up and see my sister again—I said "No, she would not see him"—he said "Good bye," and went towards the gate as if going—as I was in the act of shutting the door, he returned, pushed by me and ran upstairs; I ran up after him—my sister's room was the back room on the second floor—he fired the first shot before he got up the stairs—I saw my sister Mary outside the room—I heard the shot fired—Mary screamed and went into the room and banged the door twice—the prisoner pushed open the door and rushed into the room, and then there were two more shots—I saw the prisoner come out of the room; I was then on the stairs—he rushed downstairs; I was in front of him—I went out at the street door and the prisoner after me; he got out first; I laid hold of him, he hit me on the shoulder and I fell down, and then he ran away—I afterwards found that my sister Mary had been wounded—I did not see the prisoner again till he was in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Flintoff, a civil engineer, of 6, Abbey Street, St. John's Wood—we formerly lived at 8, Northumberland Street, Strand, and left in October, 1885—on 11th April, 1885, the defendant took apartments at our house, and mentioned Mr. Lamb, a friend of ours, as a reference—he lived with us five months, and then became our tenant at 300, London Road, Bermondsey, at 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year rent—we had great difficulty in getting the rent, and were obliged on different occasions to distrain, but the brokers could not get in—the ground was that I had not given him a false receipt in the name of Garnet and Jones—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the original agreement—it is signed "A. Collingridge," and I objected to give the receipt in any other name—I know the defendant's writing—this post card of February 21st is his writing—I received it from Mr. Chadd, and also the other post card of September 30th, 1887, which is in the prisoner's writing, but disguised—I also received this postcard from Chadd: "Mr. Chadd, the crafty old bitch, as you called the woman Flintoff one day, has received her rent from the County Court, so if you want any rent look out"—I applied for the rent several times, and tendered my receipt, and asked for the money—he gave me three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and said "I do not require your receipt; you must sign this"—I said "I cannot"—it was in a dark part of the room—he said "Sign here," and I did not know till three minutes after wards that I had signed a receipt in the name of Garnet and Jones—I had a witness with me.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been an expert in hand writing going on for 43 years—I have seen post-card "D" and the other letters, and have compared them with specimens of the defendant's writing; they are written by him in disguise, and he has patched them up—I should say that the word "bitch" in "E" is in the same writing—this is my report, and these are the reasons I give.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Flintoff called on me, and showed me an envelope or letter marked "F"—to the best of my opinion "D" is not in a woman's writing—I do not generally disagree with Mr. Inglis; we are together very often—I used to disagree with Mr. Chabot on difficult points—I am certain the prisoner wrote this himself, and that no one has copied it—here and there the words finish with a dash; many men do that, as well as women—some of the letters on the post-card have been thickened off since they were written, and if any one wished to imitate his writing and succeeded so well why should they paint it?—there is no connection between the "a" and the "c" in the word back in letter "E;" the pen has been lifted.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an expert in handwriting—I was first Called into this case by Mr. Palmer, the solicitor for the prosecution, before Mr. Netherclift was called at all—all the papers which were laid before him were, I believe, laid before me, and I made a report upon them, but they went to another expert—I have since looked at the same documents again, and this is my report—I believe "D" is written by a woman, but there are points of similarity to the defendant's writing, which I should expect to find in a document which was intended to be a copy of his writing by another person—the general fine line writing on "D" is not in accordance with Mr. Collingridge's writing—the words on the address side and the dashes finishing the words "you," "bitch," and "Chadd," freely indicate a lady's writing—further examination shows that many letters have been thickened to take off the lady's styles which was too apparent—the word "look" on "D" is clearly a copy of the same word on "E" and the word "known" in "D" is a copy of the same word on "E"—the "Ch" in Chadd on "D" is a copy of the same word on the envelope of "E," and has been thickened to take off the lady's style. (<hi rend="italic">Pointing out other similarities to the Jury</hi>)—this "w" in watch is an imitation of the "w" in woman; there is a very fine point at the top of the "w," and I find that in Mrs. Flintoff's letters—an imitation must be stiff and not natural, not flowing; I pointed that out in the word "Bermondsey"—the double "ff" in Flintoff is a lady's formation of letter; I believe the face of the card is a copy of that—I have not altered my opinion since the matter was first laid before me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I sometimes make mistakes—in the case of Dr. Farmer, the Magistrate took a different view from me, and so the Jury did—I have been told the defendant is a foreigner—I have not had much experience of foreigners' writing, but I take his writing as I see it—I suggest that the face of the libellous post-card is a copy of the envelope "F"—I do not think it is a man's imitation of a woman's writing—I very seldom disagree with Mr. Netherclift—I do not suggest that Mrs. Flintoff wrote that post-card, but I say it is a woman's writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engine-driver on the North London Railway—I live at 71, Knapp Road, Bromley-by-Bow—on 9th June I was driving the 4.15 train from Broad Street to Chalk Farm—before reaching Highbury Station the train had to pass under a bridge on which is Highbury Corner—when approaching the bridge I saw the prisoner at the open window of a house which is upon the girders of the bridge—he raised his arm and threw a bottle at us—I was standing on the right side of the engine—the fireman Sheffield was with me—the bottle hit the engine in front of the observation glass—the observation glass is the glass through which we look for signals—it is longer than it is broad—it struck a pipe about three inches over the glass—we could clearly see anything within the line of our observation—the glass is in front of the cover under which we work—I subsequently went to the house which overlooks the line—I saw the prisoner—I said when he came into the shop "Will you take your hat off, please?" although I knew him with his hat on, but when he took his hat off I immediately identified him, and said "That is the boy," or "man that threw the glass bottle at me on the engine," and "I challenge you to deny it"—he said "I did throw a bottle," distinctly—I collected these pieces (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) off the top of the tank, close by the observation glass—the fireman and Perks, the inspector, and Constable Baxter were with me when I went to the house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> They were present when I saw the boy—the constable and our inspector went in first, about half a minute before I was called in—the prisoner appeared very much confused when I challenged him—this is a correct photograph of the scene—our train was on the left side—the train on the right would run to Broad Street, and between us there was the six-foot way—the row of houses are upon the girder that crosses the railway and comes up to an angle—the prisoner was looking straight on to us—he had the bottle originally low down on the window-ledge, but on our approaching the girder, as we ran under, he deliberately raised it and threw it at us—we had passed under the bridge, which I said was 40 or 50 yards away, but that is an error of judgment, it is 50 or 60—we were due at Chalk Farm at 4.39, and should pass under the bridge about 4.30—after passing Canonbury we were going about 20 miles an hour—I saw the prisoner when I was about 40 yards from the girder for about 10 seconds—the line is up hill—both the fireman and myself cover the same ground of observation—the fireman would see what I saw—we were not looking out for the prisoner, but looking to see if there was anything on the metals—I have been told that the window-sill slopes; I do not believe it slopes six inches—if a bottle had dropped from the window-sill it would not have struck the engine where it did—it was a hot day—the bottle did not slip down on us—the next station beyond was about a mile off—there is sometimes smoke as we pass under the bridge, but the steam was shut off—we were stopping at the station near the iron girders.</p>

I have no occupation—I live at 79, Tredescent Road—on 4th June, about five minutes to 12, I was at the corner of Chancery Lane and Fleet Street waiting to take a cab—I took out my watch and compared it with the Law Courts clock, and within a minute the prisoner and a female came to me, and the prisoner asked me if I could direct him to Clifford's Inn, and if I knew a Mrs. Smith who lived at 3, Clifford's Inn—I turned and pointed to it with my left hand, and during that time the woman departed and I lost sight of her—I watched the prisoner as far as Clifford's Inn, but he did not attempt to turn into it; he went straight past it—I then looked down and missed my gold watch and chain—I followed the prisoner till I met a sergeant and constable in Fleet Street, when I charged the prisoner with being concerned with a female in stealing my watch—the prisoner was within a foot of me when he was talking to me, and the woman about the same distance on the other side—the bar of my chain was visible in the button-hole—they both spoke to me at the same time—the woman said "Good evening," something of that sort—I made no answer.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Mrs. Phillips's house—on Saturday night, 9th June, about 1. 30, I heard a lot of glass smash—I sleep in the first floor front; Mrs. Phillips slept in the back parlour—I also heard a man singing downstairs—I called Mrs. Phillips—I looked out at the window, and could see a lot of glass, and I thought I saw somebody in the area—I went out with Mrs. Phillips, and called a cabman—I saw the prisoner as he was brought through the house—I thought he was drunk—he did not speak in my presence—I could not say if he was singing; the sound was very close to the house, and nobody was passing by.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cab-driver No. 10723, and live at 14, St. John's Terrace, Asplin Road, Tottenham—on this Sunday morning, between 12. 30 and 1 o'clock, I was in the City Road, and I was called by some lady, Mrs. Phillips, I think, but it was so dark I could not. be certain, into a garden—I got off my cab, and went into the house and down to the area, where I found the prisoner sitting in a kind of lobby between the area and kitchen—the area is between the garden and the wall of the house, and is open to the sky, with a railing round the outside of it—he was in a rec ess under the steps—he appeared sober—I closed the door on him, and went for a constable—I afterwards noticed a lot of broken china in the area.</p>

I did not hear him singing—the lobby or recess is under the steps that go from the hall door to the front garden, and is all enclosed, and has two doors, one leading into the area, and the other into the kitchen—to get to it I went downstairs into the kitchen, and then through the kitchen door, which was bolted, into the recess; I unbolted the door—the kitchen window, looking into the area, was thrown open wide enough for a man to go through, and a piece of the shutter was broken—the chair the prisoner was sitting in was just inside the lobby, outside the kitchen door—I immediately closed the door again and bolted it, and went for assistance—he was still sitting on the chair, and still asleep when the constable came.</p>

Early on Sunday morning, 10th June, I was on duty, and I was called to 286, City Road—I went through the house into the kitchen—I did not see the cabman—my attention was called by hearing some one shouting "Here he is"—I went through the kitchen door, and outside it I found the prisoner sitting in a recess under the steps—there is another door into it from the area—when that door is shut it shuts off the recess from the area—the roof of the recess is the steps that lead to the hall door—the area is open to the sky—the prisoner was awake—the door from the recess into the area was unfastened—there is a latch, but no bolts on it—there is an ordinary handle, which you turn to open it—any one can open it from inside or out by turning the handle; it is an ordinary latch—the kitchen window, which opens into the area, was open—the prisoner could not get through into the kitchen because the shutters prevented him—this half-panel of the shutter was forced out; a man could not get through that—this bolt was drawn from the shutter, and was lying on the bench just inside the kitchen window, both this half-panel and the bolt—the shutters were inside the house, so that to effect an entry you had to get through the window and force and break the shutters—I said to the prisoner "What are you doing here?"—he</p>

               <p>said "I was drunk, and came down here for a sleep"—he did not appear like a drunken man—he was steady; he did not sham drunkenness—he had no instruments on him—he gave his correct address—in reply to the charge he said "You had better charge me with being drunk."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner, and am surgeon to the B Division of Police—on Thursday, 31st May, about 9 o'clock, I went to King's Road Police-station, and saw Lewis in the yard—he was apparently just dead—I had known him professionally about eight years; I knew him before that—on 2nd June I made a post-mortem examination, in the presence of Dr. Egan and other medical men—I found a bruise on the right eye and about the nose such as might be caused by falling on the pavement in the yard—the body was well nourished—on opening the chest we found the lungs gorged with blood; also the pericardium, and there were two ruptures in the right ventricle of the heart—the left testicle was bruised—I saw no signs of disease; all the organs were healthy, the heart included—the walls of the heart were a little thinner than usual, but not diseased—the immediate cause of death was rupture of the heart—violent exertion would be likely to cause that—excitement or violent exertion would produce the state of the lungs—those appearances were quite recent—if a man were thrown or fell violently down on his back, that would be</p>

               <p>likely to cause rupture of the heart—violent struggling or violent exertion would cause it all—the injury to the testicle was recent—that would be caused either by a kick, a blow, or strain; that would tend to increase the pain—Lewis was a very slight, small man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The injury to the testicle was a somewhat severe one, such as would cause great pain, not such as would necessarily last for a considerable time, five or ten minutes—it would not necessarily incapacitate him for some time—there were two ruptures to the heart, one was an inch long, and the other an inch and a half—death would result from the filling of the pericardium with blood, and thus stopping the action of the heart—the rupture must have begun in a very small degree, and gradually gone on increasing—I don't think it possible that the heart was ruptured by the fall in the police yard, because he lived several minutes afterwards—I take it that the beginning of the rupture was the intense pain and tightness in the chest nearly half an hour before he was dead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner—I was present at the post-mortem—I have heard Mr. Daniel's evidence; he has correctly described the internal appearances—the cause of death was in my judgment rupture of the heart, arising from the congestion of the lungs, brought on by severe over-exertion—he was a healthy man—there was no valvular disease of the heart—the walls were slightly thinner than usual—there was no softening.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The heart was not enlarged—the congestion of the lungs was the primary cause of the rupture; excitement and over exertion might produce the congestion—I do not believe that the injury to the testicle could be caused by a strain or fall, unless he fell against a stone; it was a direct injury—the rupture of the heart would come on progressively—I have never had a case of rupture of the heart; I only speak from recorded cases, and from Taylor's Medical Jurisprudence—it would occur in an hour or an hour and a half; it depends on circum stances—I should say that the fall in the yard was caused by the completion of the rupture.</p>

I am a church-organ builder, and life at 26, St. Loy's Road, Tottenham—on Sunday night, 10th June, I fastened up my house securely, and went to bed at 9. 20 or 9. 30—I was aroused a little before 3 o'clock by a clicking noise, and saw Ashford with his hand extended over my head towards my watch; at the same time I saw Roberts clearly a few feet away with my wife's satchel in his hand—he stood in a glaring light between the open door and the kitchen window, there being no blinds—I immediately sprang out of bed, and gave chase to both prisoners—on leaving the house Ashford turned sharply to</p>

                  </hi>. I am a general dealer, of 11, Dacre Street, Westminster—on 15th April I was knocked down by a hansom cab and was after wards taken to the Westminster Hospital, where my friend George Codd came to see me, and spoke with reference to getting compensation for my injury—I authorised him to say proceedings should be taken—on a Sunday in May he came and saw me at the hospital—in consequence of that the prisoner came to see me on Tuesday, the 15th May—he said Codd had told him I wanted him (Jewell) to go on with the job; that he (Jewell) had written to Mr. Eatwell and had received a letter in reply in which Mr. Eatwell said he would like to meet Jewell and me (" me and my client" were the words used) to try and come to an arrangement—Jewell said 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be better than nothing—I agreed to that—he asked my name and produced a piece of paper of some sort and read it to me, and I put my mark on it (I cannot read or write), and he wrote something on it—so far as I recollect these are the words he read: "Self v. Eatwell. I hereby authorise you as my solicitor to settle this action on any terms that you may think fit in my interests. To R. V. Chillcott, Esq. Spong, his mark. Jewell, witness"—he read me Eatwell's letter—that is the sort of letter that he read. (This, dated May 10th, acknowledged the receipt of a letter respecting the injury, and said he should he glad to meet Mr. Chillcott and his client with a new to an amicable settlement of the matter.) I said "Get all you can," and he then left—I was discharged from the hospital on Friday, 18th—on the following Monday, Whit Monday, I saw Jewell again between 10 and 11 a.m. in Mr. Beach's public-house—he said "I have settled your affair, Spong, for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "All right, if it's done it is done"—he said "Do you want your money?"—I said "Yes, I want something on it"—he said "I cannot get a cheque changed before Wednesday"—I said "I want a couple of pounds"—he gave me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; no receipt was given—he said "I will meet you on Wednesday morning and give you the remainder, there is 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. lawyers' fees, and if you think I am worth anything; if you don't think I am worth anything don't give it me. Do you think I am worth three sovereigns?"—I said "Yes"—I left then—on Wednesday, 23rd, I met the prisoner again at the Queen's Head, Peter's Street; he gave me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I put my mark on something he put before me—he did not read it to me or say what it was; I thought it was a receipt I was signing for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot recollect what he said—nothing was said as to what it was—the document I put my mark to had on a receipt stamp—I cannot say whether this is the document or not, or whether this is the mark I made—if I had known that Mr. Eatwell had paid Jewell 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and not</p>

                  </hi>. I and my brother manage our mother's (Mrs. Eatwell's) business, she is a cab proprietor—on 9th May I received this lawyer's letter demanding compensation in reference to an accident which it was alleged had happened to Spong—I wrote back this letter of 10th May saying I would be glad to meet him and his client with a view to settlement—on Monday, 14th May, the prisoner came and served me with this writ dated the 12th—I said 1 wrote to Mr. Chillcott with a view to settling this matter, and that it was rather sharp practice to serve me with a writ; he said "It is only an ordinary writ and there are no expenses"—I said "What do you think the matter can be settled for?"—he said "I think about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he asked me to think over the matter and see him in the course of the week—then he said "I am glad the governor has put it in my hands; I can settle it as well as anyone"—I thought the "governor" was Mr. Chillcott, which was the solicitor's name on the writ—I then received this lettor (D.). (This was from Mr. Chillcott to Mrs. Eatwell, dated 15th May, saying Mr. Chillcott had instructions to treat for a settlement). On Thursday, 17th, I went with my brother to Mr. Chillcott in consequence of that letter—I had a con versation with Mr. Chillcott, the prisoner was not present—we did not come to terms—on Friday, 18th, I met the prisoner in Great Smith Street—I said "Good morning, I have been to Mr. Chillcott's office"—he said "What did you want to go for?"—I said "I have received a letter from Mr. Chillcott asking us to call upon him"—he said "I did not see the letter in the letter-book"—Arthur Bobbett was present—he said "Why don't you settle the matter?"—I said "We offered Mr. Chillcott 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—the prisoner said "Make it 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "No, we won't give you that, we will fight it first"—ultimately I made him an offer of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to cover all costs and expenses—Bobbett said "I think that is a very handsome offer," the prisoner said "I will get an official receipt and bring it round"—I said I would consult my brother—on Saturday, 19th May, the prisoner called round at my premises, bringing with him this receipt, dated May 19th—it was completed as it is now—I wrote out this cheque—he said "Make it payable to Mr. R. V. Chillcott," and I did so—our driver was summoned for negligent driving, and the case was heard before Mr. D'Eyncourt—my brother was present—between</p>

               <p>the Saturday when I gave the cheque and the next Wednesday the receipt was in my possession—it did not leave my possession till this prosecution was commenced in June, and then it was handed over to the chief clerk at Rochester Row—this receipt could not have been in the prisoner's possession on the Wednesday following the Bank Holiday, the 23rd—after I gave the prisoner the cheque for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he said Spong would have 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the other 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be for Mr. Chillcott's and Jewell's law expenses and costs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I first heard of a claim being made on us I wrote to Mr. Chillcott—Bobbett told me he had instructed Mr. Chillcott in the matter—he denied it—he did not tell me he was guaranteeing Mr. Chillcott's out-of-pocket expenses in the matter—Bobbett is in the same line of business as myself—there was a case of Cox v, Bobbett—I have had no litigation or law expenses with Bobbett—the prisoner said first "Make it 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I met Bobbett and the prisoner together on Friday, the 18th—I did not suggest to the prisoner at that time that if he got Spong to accept 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I would make him a present—I said on the Monday "If you can settle the matter I will give you a trifle"—the sum at which it was to be settled was not mentioned as 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the trifle was not mentioned as 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not say I would if my brother consented—I said I would consult him—25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to cover all costs, including the trifle to the prisoner—I think Bobbett heard that arrangement—the prisoner did not call my attention to the fact that I had includod his trifle in the compensation when I gave him the cheque for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not ask me to cross the cheque—I should not have given him a cheque in his own name—he asked me to make it out in Mr. Chillcott's name—5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not mentioned between the prisoner and me as a trifle—I did not say "If you can settle this matter for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was only mentioned when I offered him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he said "Make it 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—it was not then I said I would give him a trifle—I think he said "I hope you won't forget the little present you promised me"—I said "I will give you a cheque for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to cover everything"—20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be given to Spong, and the other 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to pay the law expenses—he told me Mr. Chillcott would have three guineas—as I understood 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to pay all the costs and the prisoner—I have seen Bobbett here to-day—I don't know if he heard all he conversation; he was present.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I gave the cheque on the Saturday nothing was mentioned about a trifle to Jewell—he accepted the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and gave the receipt, and I gave him the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—then he asked me to give him the little present which I had promised him, and I said "No; I think you have done pretty well"—he then said he was going to give Spong 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for the expenses—if I had known Spong had not put his mark on this receipt, and knew nothing about it, I would not have given my cheque for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

Eatwell—in consequence of that I wrote the letter of May 9th to Mr. Eatwell—I received this letter from him saying he would like to see me and my client—I issued the writ, enclosing it in a letter to the prisoner for service—I wrote out this authority of 15th May and gave it to the prisoner, who brought it back on the same day, I believe—my clerk wrote this letter of the 15th May to</p>

               <p>Mrs. Eatwell, and on the following Thursday Mr. Eatwell came, and I had a long conversation with him—next Saturday, the 19th, I went to Margate, and did not see the prisoner till the Wednesday in Whitsuntide Week, when I came up to town for a day—I neither signed this receipt nor authorised it to be signed—this cheque is drawn to my order—it is not my signature on the back, nor was it written with my authority—on Whit Wednesday, when I saw the prisoner, we had a long conversation about various matters, and I asked him if he knew any. thing about this matter—he said "Mr. Chillcott, that has been settled behind your back"—I asked for an explanation, and he said Mr. Eatwell, after leaving my office, had gone straight to Spong and tempted him with the sight of money, and, as far as I can remember his exact words, he said "You must write this matter off your books"—he did not tell me he had received a cheque from Mr. Eatwell for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to my order—he never mentioned a word about a cheque—I have only received 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which the prisoner paid me, and with which I issued the writ—I have never authorised him to pay that cheque away—I have a banking account—it is the ordinary practice of my office to pay cheques into the bank—I said to the prisoner I ought to make it my business to see Spong to ask him for something for costs, as the action had been settled behind my back, and my words were, I believe, "He ought to be seen now that he has some money"—the prisoner said "It is no use bothering about him; he is only a <hi rend="italic">coster"</hi>—I have never given the prisoner authority to give receipts in my name.</p>

On the 9th May I was on duty in Handsworth Road, Hounslow, about 12.45 at night—I saw the three prisoners riding together in a trap, Smith was driving—they went about 150 yards past me, and halted opposite some gentleman's house—they were 150 yards off, but they spoke rather loud—one said "Don't get down here"—they turned and went up the Green Lane leading to the Handsworth Road—I placed myself behind the pillar of a gentleman's house, and listened to the sound of the trap—they went 400 or 500 yards up the road, and stopped—I listened for about a quarter of an hour, and heard the trap returning—Burlington had come up in the meantime; we went to the bottom of the Green Lane, and saw White coming out driving the pony and trap; the other prisoners were not with him; he was alone—I asked him what he had done with those parties that were with him in the trap—he said "There was no one with me"—I said "Where are you going?"—he said "I am going to the Cut"—I said "Where did you come from?"—he said "I came from the Cut"—I said "Whose pony and trap is this then?"—he said "Mine"—I looked at the shaft and saw a name, on it, and said "What is your name?"—he said "Robert White"—I said "Is that the name on the cart?"—he said "Yes," he rather hesitated, and then said "Well, it is my master's, Mr. John Woods"—I said "Is that the name on the trap?"—he said "I suppose so, I have only been with him since last Tuesday"—the name on the trap was "J. C. Cook, 32, Portland Street, Soho"—I said I was not satisfied with his statement; I should take him into custody—I then had hold of the horse's head; I took the horse and trap to the station, and Burlington took the prisoner—Inspector Loveday examined</p>

                  </hi>. I am secretary to the Sun Flour Mills Company, 12, Devonshire Square—the prisoner was employed as traveller for the Company, and paid a salary of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year and something for daily expenses—it was his duty to solicit orders and collect the money—he was supplied with daily business sheets on which should be entered the name of the customer and the amount received, and there is a column for observations of anything the customer may say—on 23rd June, in consequence of something which happened, the prisoner was seen at the office, and after some conversation he volunteered that Johnson's money had been paid and he had not accounted for it, and that he had handed the money to his father—on the 25th he was again asked when his father was there, and his father was asked if he had received the money, and he denied it—the prisoner then said that he was proceeding from Johnson's to the next customer in a tram, and after leaving the tram he discovered that he had left his bag behind him, and ran after the tram and recovered his bag, and when he looked into it after the tram had gone he found his money was gone—he was asked if he mentioned it to the next customer he called on—he said "No"—he was asked if he mentioned it at home—he said "No, not till some time afterwards"—one or two other matters were spoken of, and he was then suspended—these three receipts from Bressle, Johnson, and Dugal are in the prisoner's writing—he has not accounted for either of those sums—these are the sheets for those dates—he has entered on the 30th "Bressle next time," and on the sheet of 13th June Bressle is again mentioned—there is no amount against Bressle on either sheet—on the sheet of June 15th is entered: "Johnson will pay next Wednesday or before," and on this third sheet: "Dugal will pay next time," in the prisoner's writing—the amount would only be entered if the money was paid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He came into the Company's employment in February this year, on a verbal arrangement only, as to the terms of payment and his duty—there was a bond of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the Guarantee Society—his father has been for a long time connected with the flour trade, and he was to introduce his son—we did not know till this matter arose that the father was paying his son's money into his bank—it occurred once that the father paid in his cheque to our credit, and we told him it must not occur again—the cheque came back not paid—that was about a week previous to 23rd June—it was a cheque for exactly 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., not 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I saw the prisoner about it, and he said that he had paid the amount to his father, and that was his cheque—the prisoner had not authority to pay into any of the branches of the London and County Bank, only to the Lombard Street branch—he resigned on 15th June, and on Saturday, the 23rd, he was told not to collect money again—he put in his notice; he was to give a month's notice to leave—when this affair came out, we knew that the father had been soliciting orders for us as well as the son,</p>

               <p>and endeavouring to push our connection in his son's interests—the father was asked to come before the directors, and told not to do so again, because he was not in our employ, and if he solicited orders he would most probably collect the money—I think the prisoner was taken in custody on 27th June—on 22nd June I believe he paid in 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—our instructions to him were not to allow discount at all unless he got cash in seven days, and then he might allow 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per sack, otherwise he was to take a month's credit and pay in full—my attention was not drawn to dispute with Dugal about flour not being delivered at the proper time—I never heard from the prisoner of other customers complaining that seven days was a very short term for discount—I may have heard it from one of our other travellers—the thing is not given in the trade; it was rather our gift—there was no question to my knowledge with a customer named Bryant of allowing discount over seven days—this letter is in my writing: "You must not allow Bryant discount after seven days; he must send the money if you do not call"—he had probably asked the question, and I said "No"—if he chose to allow discount of his own pocket and pay at the of the month he would be doing that which was wrong—they would not have to pay for a month if they did not get discount, but if he had the money he ought to pay it in at once—he had been called upon to resign—I only know one instance in which his father paid us his cheque—I am not aware that that was the practice, but I know it now—there is no trace of that in the cash-book.</p>

I am foreign flour merchant, of 59, Mark Lane—I have been 27 years in the trade—the prisoner is my son; he is in his 27th year—it was by my introduction that he was taken as traveller by the Sun Flour Mills Company—I called first on that company in January, and the arrangement was made in February—it was understood between Mr. Baker and myself that I was to do my best to get customers for the Company—there was a bond of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with the Guarantee Society for my son's honesty and integrity, and he paid the premium—I was aware of the Company's rule, by seeing it on the bills, that not more than seven days was allowed for discount—discount is usually given among millers within 28 days, and the customers who I was going to introduce were in the habit of receiving that discount—my son got an order from Dugal for 10 sacks of flour; there was a delay in the delivery, and I told him to report to the Company what Mr. Dugal said—I know that Dugal offered to pay within 14 days with the discount off, and I called on him on 30th May—this is the invoice, it is dated May 22nd, the due date was June 27th; it was paid on the 30th, I see by the receipt, but there is no stamp—payment on the 30th would not be entitled to discount—I told</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188807020072"/>
               <p>my son in May that in cases where the payments were not made he should allow the discount and pay over at the end of the month—I was in the habit of receiving from my son the money he brought home after bank hours, and I paid it into my banking account, and paid my cheque into the London and County Bank to the account of the Sun Flour Mills Company—that occurred about a dozen times—the money was in silver, gold, and copper—my son lives in the same house with me, and he went through his accounts with me every night when he returned—he was brought up to the flour trade—on 15th June he called on me in Mark Lane, and told me he had been ordered to give a month's notice; he was very much upset about it, and I gave him instructions—on Monday morning, June 25th, I first heard from my wife of the loss of the money in the tram car—no other communication was made to me about it—my son was very much upset on the 15th and subsequently—he has always borne a good character, and was always at home in the evenings, and is a thoroughly honest, respectable young man—he lived with me, and travelled for my firm, Hutchinson and Hopminster—that firm was dissolved in Chancery in 1885, after which he travelled for me alone—he reported to me that Mr. Dugal was angry with him about the discount, and told him not to call again—I said "I cannot allow you to lose an old customer, I know Mr. Dugal, he is an old friend of mine, you must tell the Company that you were told not to call again, but you are sure that if they will allow the discount you will be able to retain the custom"—on June 21st he gave me 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I drew a cheque for the amount, leaving out Dugal's account till it was settled—I paid in my own cheque, less 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and it was settled next day.</p>

I believe the bag was on the right hand side near the door—the car did not stop at all—he was off it five or four minutes—it stopped for the other car to come down—it is a single line, and we had to stop on the loop—I kept my eyes on him because he came in the middle of the road with his umbrella—he did not say to me he had lost any money—the we often have things left in the cars, and we give them up at the police-station—I did not see him after or hear of him till his wife came to me last week.</p>

I am a boot cutter of 13, Batty's Gardens, Back Church Lane—on 19th June I went to bed with my wife about 11.30 after fastening all the doors and windows—about 1 o'clock I heard a table under my window falling, everything on it broke, and it fell upon the prisoner—I picked him up and he tried to kiss me and said "Let me out"—I said "If you will tell me what caused you to come into the house I will let you go"—he said "I have got something to say to your wile"—I said "What have you got to say?—he said "I have brought you some lodgers from the ship from Hamburgh"—I said "Where are the lodgers?"—he said "I have not brought them here"—I said "How did you come into the house?"—he said "I knocked a few times at the door and nobody answered, so I started to knock at the window; nobody answered me, so I opened the shutters, and after opening the window I came in"—I called out of the window and sent for a policeman, who took him to the station—I do not know whether he was drunk—I do not take lodgers.</p>

I am in Mr. Pearce's employment—I Was walking arm-in-arm with him in Drury Lane—the prisoners met us—Payne laid hold of my friend by the arm, and turned him round, and Goody got between him and me, so as to disengage my arm from his and separate us—I walked two or three paces ahead, but my friend not following up I looked round and saw him in Goody's hands, and Payne came towards me—I tried to push by him, and saw Goody lay hold of my friend, and take him to the other side of the street in a stooping position, and put his hand in his pocket, and when he got to the other side the prosecutor stooped down, and I distinctly saw Goody's hands in</p>

                  </hi>. On this evening I was in Drury Lane, and saw Pearce and his friend linked arm-in-arm—the prisoners met them, and I should say it was Payne who parted them—Goody then hustled Pearce across the road, and I saw his hands in his pockets—I said "You are not going to rob a man like that," and caught hold of Goody—he struggled violently, and said "If you don't let me go I will knife you"—there was a crowd of roughs, who said "We will bolt him," and just as they were going to do it a policeman came.</p>

I was not drinking with you at 4 o'clock that afternoon, but I was in the same public-house, and was hustled, and my hands were held up, and a shilling was taken from my pocket by the same party who robbed the other man; that party walked out, and I did not say that I would charge you, but I watched you for four hours, and I crossed the road and got you by the throat—I never saw you in my life before the 23rd.</p>

On 22nd May, about 8.30 p.m., I was called and found the prisoner and two others in a passage in Upper Thames Street—the prosecutor pointed out the prisoner as the man who had struck him—I told him he would be charged with assaulting Mr. Higgs—he said "I don't know anything about it; I was set on by four men and dragged into the shop, and in the struggle my arm Went through a window in the door"—his arm was cut—he was drunk and did not know what he was doing—he kept repeating the same sentence over and over again—going to the station he said something about knocking the prosecutor's bleeding head off—he smelt very-strongly of drink.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He spoke in a rambling way, and did not seem to know what he was saying, and he was not steady on his pins—he bears the character of a quiet, peaceable young man—he was kept in custody three weeks before he was admitted to bail—he had a cut his arm about an inch long—if he had been pushed up against the window, being unsteady on his legs, I should expect to find no cut on his hand, but a cut on his arm, which I did find—I took him to the hospital, and he was kept there till his arm was dressed—he said at the hospital that he had had some wine—he did not say that he had been a teetotaller.</p>

I am a cook, and live at 17, Thomas Street, Burdett Road—the prisoner and I had been working at the same place in the City on this day—he has, I believe, been a teetotaller for some time—I have not seen him drunk for some time—he was offered some Australian wine, and took a tidy drop of it, and we were in liquor, and got larking among our three selves, and Goodwin, who was with us, got thrown out into the road in Thames Street by one of the shopmen, I believe—I do not know whether he had gone into the shop; he was a little in front of us and one of the shopmen, I believe it was the witness Brown, came and deliberately punched me on my nose.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 13, Third Avenue, Plaistow—I am a signalman of the London and St. Katharine's Dock Company—I have charge of the Bridge Docks, and control the swing bridge, which is worked by hydraulics from a lever in my box—the windows of the box are about 27 feet from the ground, and enable me to see the loopline which is used for ballast traffic—I cannot see the rails—I can see the top of the embankment, or a person standing on the rails, down to his knees—on 15th June, about 4 p.m., I was on duty at the signal box; my attention was attracted to four men playing about in the dock close by—the prisoner was one—he and another man were picking a piece of wood up, called a stage, being two long poles fastened together—it is used in painting a vessel in dry dock for the men to go from the quay to the dock by laying a plank on it—this is the stage (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—when not in use they lie about in the dock and are washed about by the water—I saw the prisoner and the others, two were carrying the wood along; they picked it up from behind my box—they were about ten yards off—I saw Fox's face—he was walking backwards—he had hold with one hand—he was facing me—the other two were playing—two took the wood towards the Y shed, and towards the fence of the loop line, and two followed—when they got to the top of the bank I called out "Do you want any help—Fox said "Go and f—yourself"—I said "If you want any help you can very soon have some, as you will be getting yourselves into trouble if you do not mind"—I was then looking out at the back of the box that looks into the Victoria Dock—the stage was token down the bank; Fox held one end—I then went to the north end of the box that faces Connaught Road and blew my whistle for assistance, or with the intention of frightening them—I then went to my window at the back of the box, and I saw three of the men at the top of the bank running away—about five seconds afterwards Fox ran away too in the same direction—my suspicions being aroused I went out of the box and looked through the fence on the top of the subway, and I saw the piece of wood lying across the line—I ran round to the gate to get into the Victoria Docks—I ran up the Victoria Docks past Nos. 3 and 4 granaries when I came up to Fox—I said "What do you mean by putting the timber on the line?—he said "It was not me, it was one of the others"—I told him it was him, and I should charge him with placing an obstruction on the line to endanger lives and property of the company—some person had put an obstruction on the goods line in January, and the bill produced had been put up by the Dock Company offering a reward of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the apprehension of the offender—Fox walked up the quay about twelve yards—I followed alongside, but could not see any assistance—the other three men were behind him—Fox ran round No. 2 granary; I ran after him—as we got back to No. 2 granary, west, he ran into the arms of a dock constable; I told the constable to hold him—I am not aware that these men had any</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police inspector, employed by the St. Katharine's Dock Company—on the afternoon of 15th June the prisoner was brought to me by Clayton—he was handed over to the Metropolitan Police after hearing Clayton's statement—Clayton said "I found him putting an obstruction on the line"—the prisoner said "I did not do it, but I know who did"—he was charged by the Metropolitan police-constable with placing this piece of timber on the line and thereby endangering life and the property of the Company—he replied, but I did not heed it—I went to tine loop line and examined the place—I saw this staging at the buttress of the bridge—one part was across the metal and the end of that was under the other rail about six inches from the chair that supports the rail—it was in a slanting position—an engine-driver might see it about 80 feet off—the radius of the curve is 6 chains, and the incline is 1 in 50—that would be a sharp curve and a steep incline—a train coming from the Albert Docks side would have to pass through the tunnel—I question whether the driver would see the wood at all—it has not been weighed; it is about 1/2 cwt., and 10 feet 10 inches one side and 8 feet 6 inches the other—it was heavier then, because it had been in the water and had become saturated, as much as two could carry—the height of the bridge where the obstruction was was about 15 feet from the rail to the girders—it is not an arched bridge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said before the Magistrates that I knew there were bird's nests in the arch, and that lads used the staging as a ladder to get at them—I did not hear the prisoner say they were taking it to get at bird's nests.</p>

I am an engine-driver, in the service of the London and St. Katharine's Dock Company; I have been with them four years—I drive the ballast engine between the docks and the loop line—my train consists of an engine and eight trucks—we get the ballast from the crushing machine, shown on the left of the plan—it is used by the ships—from 10 to 15 trains a day pass over the loop line—my attention has been drawn to where this wood was—I should be able to see the obstruction from my engine about 80 yards off coming down the incline, but we often go with the trucks in front of us, so that there would be about 30 yards between the trucks and the obstruction—I should not be able to pull up before coming against it, because we should not see it soon enough—the curve is sharp—if the trucks had been thrown off the line they would have been dashed into the bridge—three people are employed on the train, myself, stoker, and guard—the guard is shunter—coming from the dock we should see it about the same distance—we should not be able to pull up before coming against it so well, because it is a steeper incline than the other side—we travel from 10 to 15 miles an hour—we could not bring the train quickly to a stop at an angle of 1 in 50 at a place like that—the trains run at irregular times—our train went down the line about 4.40.</p>

About half-past 7 on the evening of 3rd June the prisoner came to Leytonstone Station and made to me this statement, which I took down in writing, and which she signed:—"I, Sarah Elizabeth Ruffles, gave birth to a male child on the 8th or 10th of May last, while staying at Mrs. Haynes', of 7, Forest View, Leytonstone. I did not hear it cry, and thought it was born dead. I took it away in box, by rail, to Bethnal Green, and put it over a wall—the name, of the street I don't know—and went into Bethnal Green Workhouse. I stayed there till the 22nd, and since then I have been staying at Croxford Road, Bow, and I give my myself up because I feel very unhappy.

I received information with regard to the burglaries at Forest Hill, on Saturday morning, 2nd June—on Sunday, the 3rd, I went to 14, Garsdale Road, Peckham, with Robinson and Bennett—Fenham Road runs at the bottom of Garsdale Road—I found all four prisoners living there—Robinson in my presence said to Shillingworth and the two O'Dells, who were in the back room downstairs, "You will all be charged with being concerned together in burglaries at Forest Hill and Sydenham"—they made no answer—I then went upstairs to O'Donnell's bedroom, and knocked at the door—she opened it—I said "I am a police-officer; you are wanted downstairs about some boots"—she said "I know nothing about any boots"—she dressed, and came downstairs—Shillingworth was taken into custody then, and the others afterwards—they were all taken to the station—I searched the room in which we first found Shillingworth and the O'Dells—on a sideboard I found this white petticoat—in a box in the O'Dells' bedroom upstairs, the front room, I found two bed-gowns and a white flannel petticoat, all of which Mrs. Deacon's servants have identified as their property—on the floor in the front room downstairs, the O'Dells' parlour, in the front of a chest of drawers, the top one of which had been pulled open, I found this silver salt spoon, which Mr. Kroeker has identified—I showed it to Sophia O'Dell, and, addressing Bennett, I said "This is one stolen from Sydenham"—she said "I picked this up at</p>

On 3rd June I went with the other officers to 14, Garsdale Road, where I saw Shillingworth with Mrs. O'Dell in the kitchen—Charles O'Dell opened the door to us—I told Shillingworth he could consider himself in custody on suspicion of breaking into some houses at Forest Hill and Sydenham—he said "You swine, you won't let me live"—I took hold of his arm and told him he would have to go to the station—Mrs. O'Dell said "You shall not take him"—she shoved me in the breast and prevented me from taking him out of the passage—Sergeant Winzer seized his other arm and he was taken to the Peckham station—later in the day he was taken to Sydenham and charged—to my knowledge he had been living about three weeks at Garsdale Road—the O'Dells had been living there to my knowledge very nearly six months.</p>

I am a jeweller, of 5, Langton Terrace, Blackheath—I was a tenant of the prisoner, under a lease of March 26th—after I entered into possession I had an unpleasantness with him—he had no business to grant me an agreement, because the property belonged to a building society, and the dispute continued at intervals up to the very last—on 15th May I received this paper from him, and wrote this letter in reply—on 16th May I had an interview with him in the presence of Mr. Young, an inspector of the gas works—about 1 o'clock I heard Webber and the gas inspector down in the basement, and I went down—the inspector said "I cannot remove the meter, because it belongs to Mr. Fitt"—Webber then said "If you cannot remove the meter I will</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> That was an indication to my mind that he had fallen with his head against the balusters; there is a projecting point—he appeared to be recovering from an epileptic fit when I went, and after he recovered consciousness he showed great excitement—he was telling me what had happened, and I believe he saw the defendant outside, and he went into another epileptic fit—epilepsy affects the brain at once, it is sometimes momentary, but it varies—all epilepsy does not terminate in insanity, but it is the result of some disorganisation of the brain—persons who have epileptic fits axe sometimes deprived afterwards of recollection of what happened immediately before the fit came on, but not always—the person commonly falls and would try to catch hold of something if he could; there is muscular activity in the earlier portions of the fit, a man will clutch at anything—he had not lost much blood, not enough to account for his enfeebled condition, that was the result of epilepsy—the marks on the throat were super ficial, and would not have caused such a state of things as I found—I attribute the state I found him in to epilepsy, how caused I do not know.</p>

I do not know of a case of a sudden blow causing epilepsy but being knocked down forcibly would be quite sufficient to bring it on—if the man was knocked down forcibly against the baluster rails that would account for the condition in which he was found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The injuries to his head were not greater than, in my opinion, would be caused by an ordinary fall, because if he fell down in a fit against the balusters there was a very sharp point, which had cut his head—it was an inch and a half long and it had been bleeding, that is where the blood came from which was on the floor, but it was not much—if a man 42 years old has a fit and has never had one before, there must be some cause—an assault would be a sufficient cause; sun stroke will bring on epilepsy, and so will fright or a shock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of the Friars, Old Charlton—on 19th May, between 3 and 4 p.m., I was called to see Mr. Fitt, and found a cut on the top of his head, an abrasion over the right eye, an abrasion on his right and left cheek, and bleeding abrasions on his neck—higher up on his neck were two scratches on each side—I have been attending him since; he is still weak and low.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I can hardly say that he is suffering from the results of epilepsy—my partner has been attending him as well—he has not had epileptic fits while under my care, nor lave I heard of them from my partner, but he has had three head attacks congestion of the membranes of the brain, that is the result of May 19th—supposing he had two epileptic fits on 19th May the congested brain might be accounted for by that—his brain gets confused, and he has throbbing pains in the head and suffers very acutely, and his eyes are bloodshot, they become suffused immediately, that is the result of congestion of the membranes of the brain, but what causes it I do not know—bloodshot eyes are an attendant of epileptic fits—epilepsy is congestion of the brain and results in unconsciousness—these attack stop short of that; anything which produces disorder of the brain is accompanied by sickness, and epilepsy is sometimes accompanied by sickness—I never knew individually of a</p>

               <p>person who became epileptic through a blow—in a person disposed to epilepsy a fit might be brought on by a sudden attack causing excitement and fear, and it might be brought on, I think, by excitement, worry, and annoyance—Dr. Cooper says that the second attack was brought on merely by Mr. Fitt seeing Webber, and that which occurred on that occasion might occur on many others—if a man is standing when an epileptic fit comes on, he falls: and sometimes for a moment or two before, the brain is becoming disorganised, and does not recollect events immediately preceding; the person struggles as long as he can against it, clutching at anything; I have known of persons clutching at themselves and inflicting injuries on themselves, and if I was teaching a class I should say "Take hold of an epileptic patient and prevent his injuring himself"—I found no bruises on his throat and none appeared afterwards—if he were clutched by a strong man so firmly as to strangle him and deprive him of consciousness, I should expect to find bruises—I said before the Magistrate "The abrasions on the throat were not serious, they might have been done in the course of opening the collar of a man in a fit—if violence was used, as stated by the prosecutor, I should expect to find more serious marks," but I do not consider serious marks a necessity in the case—all the other marks would be likely to be found if the man fell in a fit and struggled on the floor—the marks on his neck healed on the third day, but traces remained.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The marks on his neck were more serious than might be caused by quickly opening his collar—I have never known a case where an epileptic fit has been preceded by such an extraordinary delusion as it is suggested the prosecutor suffered from in this case—the attempted strangulation, accompanied by shock, might bring on an epileptic fit if there was a predisposition to it; or violence would produce it—he is a man of fairly good constitution, but not strong; it is impossible to state the amount of worry necessary to produce epilepsy.</p>

               <p>into the shop about 12.20—I was in my desk, and up and down the counter from 12 o'clock till dinner time—between 12.30 and the time dinner was ready Mr. Webber was getting goods ready for delivery; that was the Saturday before Bank Holiday, and an exceptionally busy day, and we dined a little later than usual—about 12.40 or 12.45 one of the little girls came and said that dinner was ready—I went down to dinner about 25 minutes past for half an hour, or a little longer—Mr. Webber and I went down together—he had been in the shop with his coat off from 12.30 till we went down to dinner—we always dine in the kitchen, me and Miss Kempster, and Mr. and Mrs. Webber—Mrs. Webber sat at one end of the table, and Mr. Webber at the other—the window is on a level with the area, where the beer is put—we were at dinner about half an hour—I did not go up till 2 o'clock, but Mr.Webber went up a few minutes before me, and said he thought he would have five minutes' rest—Miss Kempster left the kitchen at the same time as Webber—I saw him going up the staircase—the cheque-book is kept in the drawer in my desk—I had the key—as I was going upstairs I heard Webber call for the keys, and I met him coming down from their room on the first floor—I live in the house—there is no communication between the first floor and the next house—I gave him the keys, and he took the cheque-book out and gave one to the man, and then stayed in the shop and served customers all the time till Hopkins came.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Webber looked at the clock, and said "I shall hardly get five minutes' rest"—I was engaged during the day on the customers' accounts, but I could see all over the shop—the door down to the kitchen opened and shut as persons passed up and down—it being opened would attract my attention, especially when it was draughty—Mr. Webber was packing goods inside the shop ready for the van—we dine in the kitchen, and you can go from there to the back kitchen; the two kitchens do not communicate; there is a separate door to each—the back kitchen door is never locked—the front kitchen door leads into the passage, which leads into the area where the cellars are—I believe there is a door from the passage by which you can enter Mr. Fitt's premises—on leaving Mr. Webber's cellar door you get into the area, and from there you can get into Mr. Fitt's premises.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 66, Rowland Street—my husband is in the Army—I do laundry work—I was paying a visit to my sister on this Sunday night—about 11.30 I saw my sister come in—I saw James in the road with a white shirt on challenging people out to fight—I saw him go to Nos. 3, 4, and 5, and burst their doors open, and he said "Come out, and I will fight you," and they all rushed from their doors and struck him, and they fought and fell on the ground—Mr. James made the fifth man, and I saw Pinnager come up; his wife struggled to get him indoors, and said "Oh, George, do come in," and I went to him, and said "Come along, Mr. Pinnager, don't you have any bother; come along indoors with me, and think of your wife and child," and I got him indoors and left him in charge of his wife, and came out again and saw Mr. James still struggling on the ground with the fair man—I recognised Roberts; the people and their lodgers said he had burst their doors open, and</p>

               <p>James got up and cried, "Oh! my ear is bit"—I was then standing against the bother; that was after I got Pinnager in—I mean I was standing against the row, against the struggle, close against it—the bother was in the road, and I was standing against it—I was in the road while they were struggling on the ground together, about five or six yards from me, when James got up and said "Oh! my ear is bit," and his wife said "Who has done it and he said he did not know, there were so many men there—there has been a little spite between the prisoner and James.</p>

About 2.15 on this morning I was on duty in Roan Street, Greenwich, and saw the prisoner Coles coming out of Church Passage, carrying a large bundle of clothing—I shouted to him to stop, and he commenced running; I ran after him, overtook him, and asked him where he got the things from—he said "I picked them up in the passage"—I said "Very well, come along the passage with me"—I took him along it till I got to No. 3, Mrs. Shepherd's, where the prisoner Garland was sitting on the doorstep with this lady's jacket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) across his knees—I blew my whistle for assistance, he jumped up, and I took hold of him and held him till No. 354 arrived, and we took the two prisoners to the station, and the bundle in which were these things—I returned to the house, and found that a piece of glass had been cut out of one of the panes; part of it had been broken before, but the top part had been cut by a diamond, sufficient for an arm to go through—the rail, which was two feet from the window, was partly bare, the articles could be reached from outside—I asked Garland what he was doing there, he said he knew nothing about</p>

               <p>I had given him notice a fortnight before—about 9 o'clock at night he came with a barrow to move his things—he commenced moving them—I said to him "Mr. Pierrepoint, have you anything for me—he said "No, I have not"—I said "Oh my"—he said to the man who was helping him "Take the b——things back"—I said "We don't want them, Mr. Pierrepoint"—he said "You can have the b——bed"—we said if he could not get the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he could leave the bedstead, and when he brought me the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he could have it, and take it away—he then said "You can have the b——lot; I won't touch a b—thing," and he went away—the furniture was still upstairs—he sent the barrow way—he came downstairs and used most dreadful expressions to me—he had got the child in his arms carrying; it was dressed in the ordinary way with its hat on—he went out with the child on his arm, and he threw the key of the street door in the passage at me—this was about 10 o'clock as near as I could guess—people collected round—my husband sent Mrs. Pierre point for the man to fetch the barrow back to remove the things; we did not want to keep them—after throwing the key into the passage the prisoner went away, carrying the child—the wife afterwards came back with the barrow, and was allowed to take away everything—my husband brought them downstairs—the bedstead was taken away on the following Thursday—the prisoner had had a drop to drink on this night—he seemed to walk very well—I have seen him have more drink than that—he walked up the stairs and down, and in the passage—I believe he was very fond of the child—he had been out of work a long time, but I must say when he had work he would not do it—I heard of the child's death the same night.</p>

I went to 13, Pelham Road, on 4th June, the day after Collins was arrested—in the room occupied by Collins I found two bedgowns, one of which Evans identified and the other Mrs. Deacon; the first has the mark cut out, the other is marked Deacon—Collins, after being before the Magistrate on 4th June, was remanded—I afterwards searched the cell she had occupied while she was under remand I found this red flannel petticoat belonging to Mrs. Deacon's servant behind the heating apparatus—I saw Hope at the station on 21st June between 3 and 4; he made a statement in my hearing which I took down—I told him I should do so—I read it over to him and he signed it. (Bead: "I am only guilty of doing one job with Shillingworth, and that was at Honor Oak; that was where I left the boots what Sarah's brother Jack left behind at my house in Pelham Road. I did not get into the house, I asked Shillingworth to pass them out to me; the boots I could not see, they were underneath the table. He gave me the boots out and I put them on and walked home with them. He brought them out to the window and a plum pudding, and then came out and we went into the summer-house. I cut the top off and I eat a piece, he did not. We both left, and I went one way and ho another. It was on a Saturday morning. I did not see any more of Shillingworth till about 9 or 10 the same morning. Sarah and I had nothing in the house to eat, so I took the boots that were stolen over to Shillingworth, who was in O'Dell's house. I said to Shilling worth, 'These had better be pawned because they would do for some thing to eat.' Sarah came in about this time, and she took the boots away to pawn. She came back and put the money on the table. There was only Shillingworth and myself in the room at the time, the ticket was thrown on the fire, but I don't know who threw it. I said to Shillingworth 'We had better share it,' and I took, I think, about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I left, and have not seen Shillingworth since—I make this statement voluntarily to get O'Dell out of it, as he is innocent; he knows nothing at all about it.") He had evidently been drinking, but he knew perfectly well what he was about—he had in my presence a bottle of lemonade and some tea and a bloater—that was all he had in my presence—when Collins was brought to the station on 3rd June she was wearing this silk handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I took it from her neck; she said "This is mine."</p>

               <p>and the other two came out after me—I went towards Battersea Park Road, towards Wandsworth—I thought I saw somebody I knew, and I ran, and seeing it was not the party I knew, I turned round, and as I did so I ran into the constable 200, the prisoner—he turned round and slapped my face with his open hand—my uncle, George Baker, then came up from the corner of the oil-shop, and said to the prisoner "What did you do that for and he asked him if he wanted a charge—the prisoner said "Yes, and I will have one"—he then took my uncle by the arm and took him along—another constable, Lodes, caught hold of his other arm, they pushed him a little way down Lockington Road, and after that took him to the station—my aunt came up afterwards, there was a crowd, my aunt walked by my side, we followed to the station—on the way my uncle said "You had better go home and tell your grandmother to bail us out"—they took my uncle inside the station—I saw him standing against the gate, I then left and went to my grandmother's—first I went to the Rock House, I there saw Hare and Cowdery, then I went to my grandmother's—she went to the station later on—in the early morning of Sunday I saw my uncle and aunt, I noticed blood running down my uncle's face—he was sober, and my aunt also—I was sober.</p>

               <p>my head against the doorpost and injured my head and fell back—Gallagher, at Wandsworth, suggested I might have done so—he states now 1 did do so when he came and told me about the bail—it is not true that I knocked my head against the post and fell back and injured myself—my head was injured by the policeman striking me—when I asked the inspector about sending for a doctor, he said "Yes, you shall have a doctor," and then he said "No, you shan't have a doctor; you can have one when you get outside"—when I got outside I went to Dr. O'Neill's, next door; he saw me and dressed the wound in my head, and then I and my wife went home—I noticed when my wife first came into the station she had this basket, it was booked in the charge sheet—my wife brought it in, there was a tin of salmon in it—when I went with my wife to Mr. Butler's shop I was as sober as I am now, and my wife also; I never knew her drink nothing on the quiet unknown to me—Hannah Williams appeared to be sober as far as I could see, for I had not much time to see from the time the policeman took me in charge till I was locked up—when I was first charged I gave my name and address—when I left I signed this book; this is my writing, and my wife signed this, "Elizabeth Baker," it is her writing—this is my ordinary signature, I am no scholar, it is as well as I can write.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Before I wrote that signature I had been for three quarters of an hour alone in the cell—my wife went up to the counter in Butler's shop, and I stood half in and half out, on the step and nodded to Butler and said "Good evening"—it is not correct to say I went in with my wife and stopped there five minutes—I did not say to the policeman "Do you want a charge?"—if my niece says I said so as far as I know it is not true—I made no use of vulgar, abusive, insulting words to the police—I am not a saint altogether—I did not say to Butler in the hearing of my niece "I won't be talked to by b things like these;" if Butler and my niece say it, it is not true; I never saw Butler—Butler did not come up and say "Don't make a bother"—I don't believe I uttered such a word as "I won't be talked to by b——things like these"—I did not call the police b——things—if my niece says I did it is not true—if Butler says I did I should not believe it—I don't recollect Butler speaking to me—I don't remember a witness coming up and saying I had better go away or they would lock me up—I am not aware that he said "Why don't you go away?"—Hare or Cowdery did not come up and put his hand on my shoulder and shove me down the Lockington Road, and say "Why don't you go away or you will be locked up?" that is not true—when I got into the police-station there was a man standing in a jersey in the passage whom I now know as a constable—he never spoke a word to me—I had never seen him before to my knowledge; he was a perfect stranger to me—I never gave him any provocation or any reason to lay a finger on me—without the slightest provocation from me he hit me four violent blows on the head, without speaking to me; I swear that—the inspector wrote the charge down against me and took the charge against my wife in my hearing—I gave him my name and address—I had a conversation with the inspector, and tried to explain things; he would not listen to me—altogether it took perhaps more than five minutes—the blood trickled down my head; I have not my collar—I showed it to Mr. Montagu Williams—the wound was at the back of the head; the blood could have trickled down the</p>

               <p>back of my head without my knowing it for an hour—it might have been ten minutes, perhaps it might have been a quarter of an hour, after the blow was given before I found out my head was bleeding; I would not say to a minute, being a little excited over the case. I could not say—it was not a quarter of an hour before the blood trickled down my collar—I say the blood might have trickled down the back of my head and I not know it—when I found I was bleeding I went and sat down on the seat of the closet in the corner of the cell and held my head over into the pan—I was not three-quarters of an hour in the cell—it was three-quarters of an hour from the time I was locked up till I was let out—I was half an hour in the cell; it might be more or less—it was about three-quarters of an hour from the time the charge was taken—I said at the last trial about three-quarters of an hour; I meant that it was three-quarters of an hour from the time I was taken into the station till the time I was let out—we were there a quarter of an hour while bail was being taken—we might have been at least half-an-hour in the cell—the blood was not running fast; it was a small punctured wound; I was not bleeding like a pig; I was smothered in blood about the head and collar; I had not lost a quantity of blood—I admit I said last time II When I found I was bleeding I could hear my wife speaking; I called to her and said 'These policemen have cut my head open.' She said 'Where?' I said "I cannot tell where; I am bleeding like a pig,'" that is a common saying—"I held my head over the pan in the cell because I was smothered in blood; my scarf was smothered in blood"—I adopt the expression that when I called out to my wife I was smothered in blood—there was wet blood on my face when I went to the doctor's; it was still trickling out of this punctured wound; the doctor stopped the bleeding—I do not suggest that the policeman had a knife in his hand—I had a punctured wound on my head, from which the blood flowed—when the inspector took the charge I said the constable had assaulted me—I said another constable made indecent gestures to my wife—574, 496, and 200 were present when the charge was taken; the man who struck me was gone then—I say that in the presence of the inspector 496 made indecent gestures to my wife—she complained two or three times to the inspector, who took no notice; he was writing, and looked round, but did nothing more; he never answered the constable, and then the inspector, in the hearing of the three constables, said if I was not quiet he would charge me in my absence—naturally I thought he could do such a thing, or I should have kept on talking—I had my hat on in the dock—the inspector would not let me talk—I asked him if I was sober or drunk—he said in the presence of the constables "Any person is drunk who is brought in here"—I said "I must speak about what happened since I came in here," and he said "Hold your tongue"—there is a gaslight in the passage; there is a light in the cell; I could not say if you could read by it—I could see the cell and see everything in it; I did not notice the lock of the door, not when I went in or out; I do not know that it projects in the ordinary way—I did not notice the electric bell in the cell—when Gallagher came to tell me bail had come he came to let me and my wife out—he opened the wicket and said "Bail has come," and he opened the door at the same time; Mr. Butler will prove that—when Gallagher let down the wicket I did not scramble forward and come with my head against the lock—there was a stone in the ring I was struck with, and he</p>

               <p>took the stone ring off and wears a plain ring instead of it—I did not see it; I believe it; that is my allegation; 1 don't know that he had on a silver ring as well—I suggested, when I was before Mr. Montagu Williams, that the man had a ring with a stone in it; I did not suggest I had seen it; I have not seen it—I said he took off a ring with a stone; I am told that by people who say he wears the ring; I can fetch the people—a man named Light is one; he works in the gas works—he says Hester used to wear a stone ring—he must have had a ring on his right hand when he struck me; his knuckles would never have done what he did—I heard the doctor suggest that the only way that the puncture could have been caused on the top of my head was by a person wearing a ring with a stone in it, if it were done by hand—I told 200 and 496 I would go quietly to the station—it is not right to say the inspector went down the steps of the station and assisted me up; you are wrong; he states he helped my wife up, not me—it is not correct to say he helped my wife up the steps; he states so—he followed behind her into the station.</p>

I am the wife of George Baker—on Saturday night, 31st March, I went out with him—we went to Mr. Butler's shop about half-past 11 or a quarter to 12, I should think—I went into the shop, my husband stood outside—I had this basket with me—I was dressed the same as I am now, I had no shawl on—I took the basket in the shop, I saw Butler there; I bought a tin of salmon, paid for it, and it was put into the basket—I then left the shop, carrying the basket with me—when I came outside I saw my husband standing in the road with two constables, who had hold of each of his arms; he was a few yards from Mr. Butler's shop-door—I went up to him and asked him what was the matter—he said the constable had struck Hannah, my niece, in the face; and he said "I asked the constable what he did it for, and he told me to mind my own business," and with that they took him to the station—the prisoner was one of the constables, and Lodes the other—my husband was perfectly sober—I had been in his company that evening—we went out and came home again, and I think we went out again about 9 o'clock to get something for breakfast—I was perfectly sober, I had had nothing to drink—as my husband went to the station I followed with him—I put my hand on his shoulder as we were standing—Hannah Williams followed too—on the way to the station I did not pull him at all, or attempt to rescue him, or touch the policemen—I saw my husband taken into the station—I went into the garden in front of the station—I was carrying the basket in my hand—after my husband had been taken in, Gallagher came down the steps, took me by the arm, and kind of put his legs against me, and tripped me on the steps, and I fell and hurt my side; the basket fell out of my hand—Gallagher took me into the station—a policeman brought my basket in, I cannot say who it was—when I got into the station my husband was sitting in the dock—I was placed in the dock—I gave my name and address, my husband did likewise—as I stood in the dock Gallagher was standing by the side of me, and he made beastly motions</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> A man locked up in a cell by himself for half or three-quarters of an hour would probably have a sobering effect; a little bloodletting would relieve the head—the shock of being locked up would have a sobering effect—I had a cold, and therefore could not detect by sense of smell—they were not drunk; I could not swear whether they had been drinking; Baker was slightly drowsy—I have seen the cell in which Baker was locked up—the lock is about an inch and a quarter or an inch and a half raised from the door—there are four corners to the lock; two of them would go close up, and two would be left. (<hi rend="italic">The witness Baker and Police-constable Hester were called, and placed shoulder to shoulder</hi>.) Baker is an inch and a quarter the taller of the two—a man struck on the head with a signet ring might have caused the puncture—the direction of the wound proves this, that the man was struck from the front, and he must have been stooping—if the man was pinned down by his two hands and holding his head up it would be an impossibility for the wound to be given it would be going round the corner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. A man's hand, unless there was a ring on it, could not have produced the wound I saw, which was an abrasion ending in a puncture; it may have been caused by a fall against the edge of a lock in a door.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There was no other wound or mark except on the head—the quantity of blood that would follow from the wound would depend upon his condition at the time—in an ordinary cool condition there would not be much blood come from him; the blood would be mainly from the puncture, the abrasion would not produce any, a puncture would bleed—a portion of the blood had dried on the forehead, that must have flowed and settled there for some time, dried and crusted; I should say that the blood that was on the forehead from the first time till I had to remove it might be a quarter of an hour, all the blood came forward—I could not say whether any of it dried on the head—there was nothing in their manner or demeanour to indicate, all the time they were with me, that they were not perfectly sober.</p>

The man was drowsy, bleeding, and an hour's rest, and pain would tend to fetch a man round if he was the worse for drink; pain would not make him drowsy, it would tend to keep him awake—I came to the conclusion, as he said he held his head over the pan in the closet for some time, that that might make him drowsy—it might have arisen from the effects of drink; the direction of the wound was from before, backwards.</p>

On 31st March I was 156 W—on that evening I was gazetted in the orders for change, and was transferred from the one division to the other—on the evening of the 31st March I was on duty—when Baker was brought in I had been off duty an hour and a half—I was wearing a jersey—I was standing at the top of the stairs leading to the men's kitchen just about to go to bed, when Baker was brought into the charge-room I was at the charge-room door—I did not enter the charge-room, it is not true that I struck Baker, I had no provocation to strike him—I had never seen him before, he was a total stranger—it is not true that I struck him on the top of the head—the last time I was examined I produced a ring, I am wearing it now, on my left-hand, I always wear it on that hand for the last four or five years, it is a round silver ring, there is no stone in it, it is not a signet ring—I have never worn a signet ring, or a ring with a stone in it—it is not true that I have exchanged or given away a signet ring with a stone in it—I was four and a half years in the Hull police before I came here, I came up to the Metropolitan Police.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Baker offered me no provocation and I offered him none, I merely stood there as he was brought in—nothing at all passed between us—I was in plain clothes—there was nothing about me by which a person would notice that I was a policeman—I had nothing in my hands, no keys; I have some keys—the key of my bedroom door was not locked—I should say that Baker was drunk, if I had seen him in the street disorderly I should have taken him into custody for being drunk, if he was disorderly, I would not have interfered with him if he was not—he was so drunk that I would have charged him with being drunk—he appeared to be very unsteady in the dock, rolling about—I thought he was drunk from his general manner, from the way he was acting in the dock—I don't think anyone could make a mistake as to his state—he did not appear to stand steady in the dock—I should say that Mrs. Baker was drunk, she had a great deal to say, she was talking all the time, and was very thick in her speech, she lisped as it were when she spoke—I could hardly understand what she said—I did not</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Drunkenness in itself is not as a rule sufficient to warrant a constable in arresting a person, they must be either drunk and incapable or drunk and disorderly; if I had seen Baker drunk and disorderly I would have taken him; I only speak of my own opinion, in my opinion, these two persons were the worse for drink—the dock is about 2 feet 8 inches in height, and 3 feet by 21/2 in width.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector W).</hi> I have been in the Metropolitan Police 23 years and 9 months, beginning as a constable and rising up to my present grade—on the night of 31st March I was in charge of the Battersea Park Station—the two inspectors superior to me visit that station during the day, in addition to the superintendent—I should make a report to them if anything particular happened—on the night of 31st March my attention was directed to a disturbance in the street outside—I went out to see what it was, and down to the bottom of the steps—I saw the constables with Baker in custody—there were from 60 to 100 people I should say outside—it is a very rough neighbourhood, especially on Saturday night—I believe the constables had difficulty in bringing Baker up—no one was assisting the police as far as I could see—I went to assist them in bringing Baker into the charge room—he was placed in the charge room; I asked the nature of the charge, and Lodes told me that on passing the Rock he noticed an old woman outside with several people round her, that she appeared the worse for drink, and was making use of bad language; that they cleared some boys away, and requested the boys to move off, and that on doing so Baker came towards them from the opposite side of the street, made use of bad language, and asked them if they wanted a charge, and called them very bad names, b——monkeys, and b——bastards, that the prisoner told them to go away, and that they did not want to have anything to say to him; that he continued his abusive language; that they walked on to the extent of the ground they had to patrol (they have a limited beat on Saturday nights), that they then turned back and found Baker still making use of very bad language; that they requested him to move away; that he refused, and told them it would take a lot of such b——as them, and still proceeded with his bad language; that finding they could not get him away, and seeing that he was drunk, Lodes took hold of him and took him into custody, and that Russell went to his assistance—that was what was told me in Baker's hearing in the charge room—Baker made no statement in answer to that—a minute or two after Baker was placed in the dock Mrs. Baker was brought in—she called the police b white-livered s—ds, and made use of very bad language indeed, if anything, worse than Baker, in the charge room—in my opinion they were both drunk—when the men were coming through the station in the passage with Baker, Hester was standing just at the top of the staircase leading to the men's kitchen—I helped to bring Baker into the charge room—Hester did not hit Baker with his fist, he was not within three yards of him—that is absolute invention—Baker did not say to me "Do you think I am drunk, inspector?"—I did not say "Every person is drunk who is brought here"—I did</p>

               <p>not say "If you don't keep quiet I will lock you in the cell, and take the charge in your absence"—I could not take the charge in his absence—it is nothing unusual for drunken men to give their names and addresses, or sign the bail sheet; those who can write invariably do so—I took Baker to the cell at the end of the passage—the woman was placed in the cell nearest the office by Gallagher—outside the cell there is a strong gaslight; inside the cell is an electric bell, and the prisoner who desires to communicate with the inspector presses the bell, and in front of my desk a bell rings and a red disc comes—the prisoners were locked in the cells; after Baker had been in some time he asked for bail—I sent Gallagher to Mrs. Williams—when Mrs. Baker said "Do you see that, inspector? "Ilooked up several times—I did not see Gallagher make any indecent motions to her—Gallagher has been 14 years in the force, not with me, in another division—Mr. Butler came in a minute or so before Mrs. Williams—I had a conversation with Butler—then I sent Gallagher to the cells to bring out Baker and his wife—when he came up to be bailed I noticed a small portion of blood on Baker's forehead—I said "You have some blood on your forehead; how do you account for it?"—he said "That was caused by a policeman in a jersey, who struck me"—I said "That is not so; I helped to bring you in myself, and you had no signs of blood on your forehead when I put you in the cell"—he said "It did not begin to bleed till afterwards"—he did not ask me to send for a doctor—just on leaving he said "I will go and see Dr. O'Neill next door, and see whether I am drunk or sober"—Gallagher was present when the conversation took place about there being no blood when he was put in the cell—Gallagher said the prisoner fell down in the cell, and he had no doubt that was how it was caused—he said in Baker's presence, "The injury was caused by his blundering up against the cell door."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I was assisting Lodes and the prisoner to bring Baker into the police-station Hester was present in a jersey at the end of the passage by the door; he took no part in the matter at all—he did nothing that could provoke Baker, or provoke any ill-feeling at all against him; he did not assist at all—I swear Baker did not say to me "Do you say I am drunk"—when Mrs. Baker complained to me I said "What is it you want?"—she told me he was making faces at her and laughing—I looked several times, but I could see nothing of it—I looked each time she applied to me—then I asked her what she meant—my memory is clear as to what occurred when the prisoners were brought from the cells after Butler and Mrs. Williams came—to the best of my recollection there was a minute or two interval between them when they were brought in from the cell—to the best of my belief the woman came in first, and the man followed a minute or two afterwards; I cannot say positively—Gallagher brought them—I don't think Gallagher came in with the female; she walked in, and I think he walked back, and unlocked the cell—I did not suggest that the man might have fallen down when I saw the injury on his forehead—I did not say before Gallagher mentioned it "Why, you must have had a fall; "I said nothing of the kind—I swear Gallagher gave an explanation of how the injury was caused that night in the Bakers' presence—Butler was in the charge room when they were brought in; I cannot say whether he remained till they were discharged or went outside; he might have remained in—the prisoner stated the</p>

               <p>charge—after saying that Baker continued his violent language and seeing he was drunk they took him into custody, the prisoner said they were set on by Mrs. Baker, who followed and attempted to rescue—I am positive they spoke about clearing boys away—when they were in the dock Mrs. Baker used very bad language; I recollect some of the words; I heard distinctly what she said—I say she was drunk from her general appearance, from her way of speaking, and the very violent language she used, and before she was in the dock she was very unsteady in her gait—I noticed nothing beyond her violent language when she was in the dock—Baker was drunk also from his general manner in the dock; he smelt very strongly of drink; I said that last time; if not then I did at Bow Street—to the best of my recollection I said it here—Baker was staggering inside the dock—she was not steady in the dock—I saw the basket with a tin of salmon inside taken from her—they were brought in from the cells, and discharged after an interval of 50 minutes—the man had considerably recovered then; he was not sober on leaving; he appeared drunk then, but not so drunk as when he was brought in—Mrs. Baker was still under the influence of drink strongly—she was not sober, but had partially recovered; I should say she was drunk—both were still drunk; that is what I said before—I did not notice her breath; I was not sufficiently near to say she smelt of drink.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have mentioned about Baker's breath before, whether the clerk took it down on the notes or not—the cells are about 5 yards from the charge-room door, as near as I could say—to the best of my recollection Gallagher brought the woman, left her at the charge-room door, and went back 5 yards to where Baker was—at the very most that would not have lasted over a minute—I believe the woman was first to the best of my recollection—last time Mr. Poland put to me they were staggering and reeling drunk, and I said yes—they were not sober when they left—I have seen people worse drunk able to give their names and an account of themselves, and sign; in fact, some can write better when drunk—I noticed a small abrasion and a small portion of blood on Baker's forehead when he was released, no lump.</p>

I have been twelve and a half years in the force—on this night I was on duty outside Battersea Park Road Station—about two or three minutes to 12 I saw a crowd coming towards the station, and I saw Baker in the custody of Lodes and the prisoner—Mrs. Baker came up behind her husband, caught hold of him by his coat collar, and said "You shall not take him unless you take me"—the prisoner pushed her off; she then caught hold of the prisoner by the arm and said "You b—, you shall not take him unless you take me"—the prisoner on that caught hold of her—as far as I could see she was obstructing the police—there was a great crowd of people after them—no person assisted the constables, just the reverse—I went to their assistance and took hold of Mrs. Baker after the prisoner had taken hold of her; he handed her over to me—she struggled—we put her inside the station gate which leads from the road into the garden—there are railings there, and persons outside can see what takes place in the garden—when we got her inside I shut the gate and then let go of her—afterwards I took hold of her and brought her into the station assisted by Dallow—when I got her into the station Baker was then in the dock—he said to his wife "You must have been a fool, you might have gone home and got me bail"—when she was placed in the dock she said "You white-livered b, I should like to swing for you"—while the charge was being taken she said "Have you seen," or, "Did you see that, inspector?"—I had not made any indecent gestures to her—I was in the presence of my superior officer and liable to be reported for misconduct by him—when the charge was being taken not a word was said about Williams's face being slapped—when I came in with Mrs. Baker, Hester was standing close to the stairs leading to the kitchen—when she was placed in the dock he came to the charge-room door and had a look through—he never came inside the charge-room—no complaint was made by Baker to the inspector of his being struck in the station, when he was charged—when Baker was being taken to the station the inspector came down the steps—I could not see if he caught hold of the prisoner, but he walked up behind him—I was sent for bail, which came a little before 1—there is a kind of wicket made of perforated iron in the cell door—I was on reserve duty that night, and went the rounds—drunk and disorderly persons frequently attempt suicide—we use discretion how often we go round and look at them when they are locked up—I went to Mrs. Baker's cell and looked through the wicket, and asked her if she was all right—she said "I am all right," in a very abrupt manner—I went to her husband's cell, and asked him if he was all right—he said "Yes, I am all right"—I then went for bail and came back, and then went to her cell first, and unlocked the door—I did not pass by Baker's cell to do that; his cell was at the end of the passage; he was No. 2 and the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bookbinder, of 69, Henshaw Street, Walworth—on 5th April, 1887, I was at the Henshall Arms—the prisoner was there with a man named Greenwood and Mrs.Smith, who lodges in my house, in the top room, alone—I left about 10.30 and went home, leaving them there—I went to bed about 11.15, and shortly after 1 o'clock I was awoke by a loud knocking at the street-door—I had not locked it, but Mrs.Smith had lost her key—I went down and opened the door, dressed only in my trousers and slippers—I found Mrs. Smith, Mr.Greenwood, and the prisoner there—I let Mrs. Smith in—the two men wanted to come in, but I told them they should not at that time of morning, I will go and get an assistant," and I got Mr. Tarrant, who is dead—we met the parties in the passage—he took hold of Greenwood and I took hold of Clarke and we pushed them out—the prisoner then struck me in the chest with his fist and ran away—I followed him, and when I got back he was a little way in front of me, and turned round and caught hold of me with his left arm, and with his right stabbed me under the left ear in the neck—I did not see anything in his hand—I put my hand to my neck and ran as far as I could after him, but found the blood flowing, and I became faint—I said "I am stabbed," and went back to the house and became unconscious—I afterwards found myself in Guy's Hospital—I was there three weeks as an in-patient—I went from there to the Convalescent Home, and was there for a mouth.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a collector in the post office, and live at the Mission Home, Tabard Street, Southwark—on 15th April, 1887, I was with the prisoner and Mrs. Smith at the Henshall Arms and saw Mr.Dennis there—we left about closing time—I remember going to Mr.Dennis's house—I was not tipsy, I had had a drop of drink—someone knocked at the door—Mr.Dennis came down and let Mrs.Smith in, but refused to let me and the prisoner in—we had both had a drop to drink—the prisoner attempted to go in; and Mr.Dennis attempted to put us out—I was afterwards in the street and heard Dennis call out that he was stabbed—there was a woman there, I do not know whether it was Mrs.Berry—I saw blood on the pavement—I went to the station and made a statement, and then went with a constable to 75, Long Lane, Bermondsey—I knew that the prisoner lived there—we did not find him there and tried to find him elsewhere, but could not.</p>

I am the wife of Robert Berry, of 66, Henshaw Street—we had moved into that house on Friday, 15th April, 1887—it is opposite Mr. Dennis's, and during the night between the 15th and 16th I heard a disturbance in the street—it was about a quarter to 1 o'clock, but the knocking had been going on for some time before—I went to the street door, opened it, looked out and saw two men and a woman—I saw Mr. Dennis open his door in his shirt-sleeves—the woman forced her way in and wanted to take two men in—they wanted to come in and forced their way to the parlour door—Mr. Dennis ran upstairs and came down with Mr. Tarrant, who ejected the other man, and Dennis ejected the prisoner, who struck Dennis in the chest and ran away— Dennis ran after him about 9 or 10 yards and caught him up—the pri<lb/>soner turned round sharp, got him round the neck and gave him a blow in the face—I saw him strike him in the neck with his left arm round his neck—he then left him and ran away, and Dennis went to his own door and came back with his hand up to his neck, and I heard the blood gush out just as if it was coming out of a gun—he staggered into the passage and Mrs. Dennis came out and called for help—I went over and went into the parlour—he was sitting on the floor and a woman who is a lodger was at his feet—she was the cause of it—I staunched the blood with the tablecloth—he was taken away by a constable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner struck him under the ear—it was too dark for me to see if he had anything in his hand, and I should not have known him again if I met him—Mrs. Smith took the two men there—she had been drinking with them all the afternoon, and it was she that suggested that they should come in—when Dennis overtook the prisoner they closed together.</p>

In April, 1887, I was senior house-surgeon at Guy's Hospital—I cannot remember the date when Dennis was brought there, but I examined him; he was only partially con<lb/>scious—his clothes were saturated with blood, and he had a wound at the angle of his jaw at the left hand side—his pulse was very feeble</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188807020171"/>
               <p>—it was a triangular punctured wound, about three-eighths of an inch long, contused—the edges were very bruised—we introduced a probe half an inch—his neck was very much swollen, and there was a great quantity of blood found in the loose tissues—the wound was just over the line of the external jugular vein, which was wounded; the blood was coming from it—a blunt instrument had inflicted the wound, certainly not a knife; it was dangerous—he remained there till May 5th, and from there he went to the Convalescent Home—he was delirious at night, and complained of great pain, and threw himself about in bed, and showed all the signs of suffering from great hemorrhage.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The wound might have been inflicted by a clay pipe stem; it was probably more than half an inch deep—the skin must have been stretched very tightly from his turning his head away, and when the skin is tightly stretched it always gives way in a triangular shape.</p>

I am a coachman, and live at 12, Camber<lb/>well Road—about 1 o'clock on 23rd May, I was walking along Adding<lb/>ton Square; the two prisoners came up to me; Cornish asked me for a match—I told him I had not got one—he asked me two or three times more, I told him I had not got one; then they attacked me— Munro knocked me down and struck me on the forehead—when I was down Cornish snatched at my chain, which came away from my watch and left it in my pocket—they went off—I got up and spoke to a constable—I afterwards found the two prisoners at the corner of the Camberwell Road and Addington Square—I recognised and charged them—they said we had got the wrong man—a policeman afterwards showed me my chain—I was not drunk.</p>

About 1 on this morning, in Addington Square, the last witness made a complaint to me, and I went with him towards Camberwell Road, and standing at the corner I found the two prisoners—on seeing us they ran into a lodging-house —I followed them and tapped them on the shoulder, and said I wanted to speak to them—Cornish said "You have made a mistake"—I said "You don't know what I want you for, you know something"—he said "You can't prove anything against me, you will have to let me go"—on the spot pointed out by the prosecutor, where he said he had been robbed, I found this bar—since then a constable has shown me this chain.</p>

               <p>Munro in his defence said the prosecutor was drunk, and that it was twenty minutes to I when they got to the station.</p>
