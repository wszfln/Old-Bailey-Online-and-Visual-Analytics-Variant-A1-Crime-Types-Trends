On September 7th, about 10.15 a.m., I went to the office of this company and saw the prisoner, and said to him, in Mr. Heale's presence, that Mr. Douglas gave him in custody for forging and uttering the two cheques, one for £2 8s. 9d., and one for £6; he said, "Very well, Mr. Mitchell, I will go with you"—on the way to the station he said, "I only get 12s. 6d. a week; I shall plead guilty to the charge; I suppose they will bring up the old affair against me"—I searched him and found a cheque-book on him, in which cheques were pasted back, and a pass-book with the leaves torn out of it, which showed the balance at the end of the half-year.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> You said that you were quite willing to plead guilty, so that the news should not reach your friends, but I said I would send for your father—you did not give me your address on the understanding that I would not let your mother know; I knew your address</p>

I am a widow, of 19, Hall Street, City Road—on 18th September I went to bed at twelve o'clock—the front door was shut, but not bolted, on account of a constable living in the house being on night duty—he had a latch-key—the next morning at 6.20 I found the front door open—I went to the ground floor front room, a spare bedroom which had been locked, and found the room had been ransacked—I missed the counterpane, blanket, skirt, bodice, pair of gloves, and short cloak produced, value £2 10s.—I informed the police at Old Street—about one and a half hours later I went to that police-station, and saw these articles and the prisoner—I charged him with breaking into the house and stealing them.</p>

I am living along with a girl named Miss Hood, at 26, City Road; she is hard up, and so am I, and she has given me some of her clothing to pawn"—he was detained at the station while I made inquiries at the address given, which I found to be false—Mrs. Coverdale gave information at the station—she afterwards identified these articles—I found a key on the prisoner which fits her door—he had been charged with unlawful possession; he was charged with burglary—he said, "I did not get into the house, but I got the goods because I was hard up."</p>

                  </hi>. About 9.30 a.m. on October 15th, in consequence of a communication I received, I went to 31, St. Martin's Court, leading out of St. Martin's Lane—I there saw the two prisoners—it is a secondhand shop with no name—I said, "I am a police officer; there is a man in custody for stealing, last Friday, a Gladstone bag and contents, and I have reason to believe you have them in your possession"—Mrs. Edwards replied, "I don't know what you mean"—Brooks said, "She has bought nothing"—I said, "Be careful and think; I believe you have the property, and shall search the place"—Edwards then said, "Let me think a bit; a little dark man brought a fur cape here last Friday evening, and I bought it of him for 3s."—I asked to see it—she said, "I have not got it here; I lent it to my sister at Edgware Road to go home in last evening; if you wait till to-night I will get it for you"—I said, "What about the other property mentioned?"—she said, "I know nothing of it"—I said, "You can consider yourself in custody; I shall search the place"—she said, "Wait a minute; I think I have got the hand-bag downstairs"—another young woman came in, who was charged at Bow Street, but she was discharged—Edwards said to her, "These are police officers; did you see my sister have the cape to go home in I bought last Friday?'—Florence Brooks then went into the parlour and got this cape—the other officer, Doyle, then said, "What about the other articles"—Florence Brooks, or one of them, then went to the back of the shop and produced the hand-bag (I think it was Edwards)—there was a silver thimble in it—we took them all three to Bow Street—we then returned, and with Sergeant Marshall searched the place—I found four Gladstone bags, two portmanteaus, three surgical instruments, and other articles, some of which were exposed in the window, for sale—we took possession of them all, and conveyed them to Bow Street, where I showed Edwards these two bags—there is a red stripe</p>

Mr. Gross' bag three letters have been scratched out—you can see that it has been "J. H. G."—it has been broken open—I showed those two bags to Edwards—she said, "I bought them of a little dark man. who sold me the fur cape"—there are initials on this bag now, which have been partly burnt out and painted over—I found a coat in the back room on the same floor as the shop, with the name of Hodgson on the tab.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am told that Elizabeth Edwards is married, and her husband carries on the business, and the prisoner Brooks is her father, living with them—I did not see Edwards; a man escaped, but I did not see him—the witness who saw him escape is not here—I was with Detective Vial—I quite believe that Edwards did escape by the back window—Brookes has been on bail; his son bailed him—beyond saying, "She has bought nothing," Brookes took no part in the conversation—Edwards identified Stewart, but did not say how often she had seen him.</p>

I am an engineer, of 31, Riding House Street—on 17th September, about 11.15, I was passing the prosecutor's house, and saw the prisoner and another man leave the door; a third man was present—Mrs. Osborne came to the door and told her what had occurred, and they stood twelve or thirteen yards further on conversing—she went back, and the tall man with her, who had a key which fitted the door—the prisoner came back part of the way—after they found that the key fitted they ran; I ran after them, and a constable stopped one, and I arrested the prisoner; he said in good English, "Not me, the big one"—the constable let the other man go; I ran after him, caught him, and struggled with him on the ground—as he ran away he threw away a key—I afterwards picked up this knife and sheath and chisel at the place where we struggled—a policeman took him to the station and I went with him—he was seated in a corner, and I heard something fall, and saw a constable pick up a handkerchief and a few keys—I saw his face when he came out of the house, and am sure he is the man.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was read:</hi> "I was basement-maid at the Queen's Gate Hotel; I had been there five months. I remember prisoner giving me 5s. The half-crowns produced were the same. I got them on Thursday. I went home to 73, Woodchester Street, Paddington, that day, and to a friend's at Mansion Mews, Queen's Gate. We did not go to any shop till the evening. My mother and I went to Rudd's in the Harrow Road. I bought eight yards of print for 3s. 4d., and changed a sovereign for it. That was for the prisoner. I gave her 1s. 8d. in change on Friday morning and the stuff. I gave mother 10s. in gold. I only paid my tram fare 4d. I had 4s., two half-crowns, and a sixpence in my purse when I was taken. I gave 2d. away among four of my little brothers and sisters. I was in service at Craven Terrace five months up to May. I left because the family went abroad. My character was a very good one. Two other servants sleep in the same room as the prisoner. One has only been there a week; the other was there before I went. Prisoner had a Sunday out, and one evening during the week, Tuesday or Wednesday. She and I had been very good friends. As far as I know the other two girls were also good friends of the prisoner.")—the following Monday this letter came, addressed to the Magistrate, after which he gave directions to the police—on Wednesday, 14th, I drew up an information by Elizabeth Blanchard, upon which a warrant was granted for the prisoner's arrest—the prisoner was taken into custody, and brought up before Mr. Bennett, on Thursday, 15th—I took the depositions—I was a witness—the prisoner was committed for trial.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Benzion Ehrmann, a wholesale jeweller, of 8, Hatton Garden—I know the prisoner, he had premises at 1, Piccadilly, as a retail jeweller—he came to Hatton Garden in February, and saw me at different times—I allowed him to have jewellery on sale or return—I had no authority to allow goods to go out on credit, only for cash or on sale or return—on 19th April he came and said that there was a wedding at Mr. Harris's, of Cardiff, who was staying at Endsleigh Place, and he should like to show him some rings, and that Mr. Harris was very rich, and was an oyster merchant—I believed that statement, and let him have three diamond half-hoop rings on sale or return—the price of the three was £71—on May 2nd he called again and said that the rings were not good enough, and asked me to let him have something better on sale or return—I let him have two better rings, price £71, and said, "How about the other rings?"—he said Mr. Harris has retained them—on 26th May he called again, and said that Mr. Harris bad returned from Cardiff, and he should like to show him a diamond necklace, about £300—I told him I would let him have one on sale of return in the afternoon, and he came for it about 4.30—I handed it to him; the price was £262—on June 3rd he came again, and had an interview with Mr. Ehrmann, who instructed me to fetch a necklace from a customer at the West-end, price £376, which I did, and handed it to the prisoner about 4.15 p.m.—I then went away for my holidays till June 20th, and did not see him—on 19th July I saw the ring with which I</p>

               <p>had parted on May 26th at Mr. Smith's, a pawnbroker's, in Newgate Street—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had no notion that he had pawned the three rings of 19th April, or the two rings of 2nd May on the day he obtained them from me, or that he had pledged the £262 necklace with a watch for £160, or the £375 necklace for £200 the same afternoon, or I should not have let him have the articles in May.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am sent out occasionally to deliver jewellery, but not to sell it—I had seen the prisoner on many occasions before this year—this is an extract from the ledger of the whole of the transactions I had with the prisoner; it begins on November 18th, since when he has had large quantities of jewellery on sale or return—he had never had either of these diamond rings before—he started with jewellery, and I began to let him have diamonds on November 25th—from November to Christmas he had about £140 worth of jewellery—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is our sale or return book—whenever he bought for cash I gave him an invoice, and then it went into the ledger, and I made an entry of the folio in the sale or return book, but never till after he had paid for it—whenever he had articles on sale or return he had one of these sale or return notes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), except with the goods of May 9th—he paid nothing to the end of December—at the end of January he had paid £50 19s. is February there were no payments, only three acceptances; one for £20, one for £50, and one for £49 9s. 6d.; one was a three, one six, and one a seven months' bill—in March he paid £42 13s. in cash; he paid nothing in cash in April—there was a cheque for £20 on March 28th, but there were not sufficient funds to meet it—it was not dishonoured, bat my bank sent me notice—I include that in the March account for £42—in May he paid me £42 11s. in cheques—he paid cash before he had a banking account—in June he paid £102 11s. 6d.—I did not have a conversation with him as to what he was going to do with every article he had—he used to say that he showed them to customers, and they had not made up their minds—he never had goods value £500; the necklace of 3rd June was the highest—Mr. Harris was the only customer he named; I did not make inquiries about him—I do not know Mr. Harry Barnett, of Cardiff, who did live at 18, Endsleigh Street—the prisoner is an Austrian, and has been in this country three years—I always spoke to him in German, but he speaks English very well—on 20th June Mr. Ehrmann, Mr. Herbert and I were at 1, Piccadilly; we stayed there some time—we did not ransack the prisoner's shop, but Mr. Ehrmann carried away £600 or £700 worth of jewellery that evening in a hand-bag—I do not know how much Mr. Prackholder carried away—Mr. Wile was not there—Mr. Ehrmann did not take some of Mr. "Wile's goods by accident—I checked the goods next day which Mr. Ehrmann took away; he claimed them as being sent on sale or return—I did not see him take them away; I left the premises at 8 o'clock, and did not see what was in the bag—we did not find anybody else's goods there—when I examined the bag next day they were all my employer's except a few which were returned to the prisoner's assistant when she came to our place, for which this is her receipt—the total value was about £25—on the night of the 20th the cashier handed a telegram to the prisoner's sister-in-law—I asked her to let me look at it—I opened it—I cannot tell you whether it was addressed to Mrs. Wieder—I returned it to the prisoner's sister-in-law—I was sent to meet the prisoner when he came to England, but had no conversation</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The transactions on sale or return were somewhat numerous—on 25th January the prisoner came for two diamond brooches on sale or return at £74 10s., which I handed to him, and on 27th January a pearl horseshoe brooch and other articles, amounting to £47 10s.; on February 3rd a diamond crescent and pearl brooch, £16, on sale or return; on 3rd March four pins and two rings, with all of which the representation was that he wanted them to show to customers—I have only seen the necklace since—they were all Mr. Ehrmann's property—on 3rd February I supplied him with a diamond crescent bird, and on 9th May with a diamond brooch and a sapphire and diamond ring value £85, all on the same terms—the first acceptance in February was met; the second and third were not paid.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wholesale jeweller, of 18, Hatton Garden—from February to June this year the prisoner was having goods on sale or return from my premises, with my knowledge and sanction—my assistant, Mr. Frankell, had a good deal of the personal dealings with the prisoner—on 3rd June the prisoner called at my office about 2.30—I had heard that he had had a diamond necklace in May to submit to a customer—he said that the necklace he had for Mr. Harris, of 18, Endsleigh Street, Russell Square, was not good enough, he wanted a better one; that they were very rich people, and money was no object—I said that I had a necklace at the West-end, and if he thought there was a good chance I would send for it—he said that there was a good chance, and I directed Mr. Frankell to get it; it was priced at £375—on June 9th a cheque for £51, which the prisoner had given me, was returned to me marked "N.S."—I telegraphed to the prisoner at Paris, and he came to me on Saturday, 11th June—I asked him for an explanation about the cheque, and where the necklace was, and how he came to go away leaving no entry in his books where he had left the necklace—I had inquired at his shop—he said, "They are all right; they are with Mr. Harris"—I said, "I must have them back to-day for another customer"—He said, "I cannot go to-day, he is very religious; I will get them on Monday"—he came on the Monday, and said, "I can sell the bigger necklace; I can get £500 for it; Mr. Harris wants to pay £100 down, and the rest by monthly instalments; will you give me similar terms?"—I said, "Decidedly not; I must have the cash or the goods"—he said that his father-in-law would give me bills for them—I said, "No; if you will arrange with your father-in-law to give me cash I will accept it"—he said he would call next day (Tuesday), but I believe he did not—I went to his shop on Wednesday, and asked him how it was he had not called the previous day, and where my necklaces were—he said, "They are still under Mr. Harris's consideration, but they have gone away to Ascot races, and won't be back till Friday"—I told him I was very much annoyed and must have my goods—he said that I should hear from him on Friday—he did not come on Friday, and on Saturday I called on him—he said, "I am going there to-night to see the people,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189210170038"/>
               <p>and you shall have them for certain on Monday"—he asked me if I would accept his father-in-law's bills—I said, "No"—he said, "Here is a bill of my father-in-law's for £25; will you take it?"—I said, "I will take it against the other goods, but not against the necklace"—he did not come on the Monday, and I went to his place several times, but could not see him—I went there the last time about six o'clock, and waited there till ten, going away for refreshment only—he did not come—his assistant was there; she is my niece—I asked her to return me the goods which were on sale or return belonging to me, which she did—Mr. Herbert was there—these three rings, pledged on 23rd April at Mr. Attenborough's, and two rings an 2nd May at Mr. Walter's, are mine, and still have my original tickets on them—this necklace (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) pawned at Mr. Smith's, in Newgate Street, and this necklace, pledged on June 23rd at Mr. Walter's for £200, are mine and have my number on them still—I subsequently saw in the hands of different pawnbrokers the two diamond brooches, value £74 10s., which the prisoner had from my assistant on January 25th—I have not traced the sapphire and diamond ring, but I have seen the pearl horseshoe pin with three diamonds, and the diamond crescent brooch—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a list of all I have traced to the pawnbrokers, with the pawnbrokers' names, and the prices I charged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not go to 1, Piccadilly more than half a dozen times; I saw the prisoner mostly at my office—on May 29th he returned an article value £130, and on May 24th about £330 worth of goods—none of these were pearls—on May 25th he returned something like £305 worth—some of the goods he had came into this book—the first transaction entered here is May 9th, but he had had goods previously—most of them were returned on the evening of 21st June, when I was there—there were any number of them lent out by me prior to May 29th—the wholesale price of the goods pawned is £976—these three rings were invoiced at £71—that is the price to shopkeepers—I have not been paid for any of them—I was not paid some money on the Tuesday at the Union Bank—I never recollect receiving any cash from him, except the £4 which I have explained—there is no ring charged to him in the ledger at £28—the price of the rings coming to £71 is £21, £28, and £23, it would appear in my ledger if it was either charged or paid—it does not appear—my pass-book is here, and my cash-book, which is an exact copy of my bankbook—on May 19th he paid £22 11s., being the balance of £52 11s. I had with him on May 9th for different items—he said that Mr. Harris, of Cardiff, was his brother-in-law, and gave his address 18, Endsleigh Street; I went there and found that Mr. Barnett lived there—the prisoner speaks English fairly well—on June 20th I asked my niece to ret urn me all things which were on sale or return; she gave me some which had been actually sold, and I returned them at once; she had been at the prisoner's shop six weeks—I had not recommended her there, but my bookkeeper had to my knowledge—a copy of my sale or return hook was put in the bag by mistake and returned next day to my niece or to the Official Receiver—no other books were taken away nor any approbation notes; I believe my bookkeeper wanted to verify some dates, and he went and got them—they are here—Mr. Frankell left out £51 which was actually paid—the total he has paid is £270.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> They were three half-hoop brilliant rings; £28 was what he asked for them; I should have advanced more if he had asked for it—he has been to the shop several times and pawned things and redeemed them—he may have had fifteen or twenty transactions with me, all in jewellery—when he first came he told me his name was Wieder, and that he kept a shop just by the Pavilion; I went there and saw as large stock, and snowed me two banking accounts; his name was up, apparently as the proprietor of the shop, and I believed him—he left about £150 unredeemed in my hands when he absconded, the retail value was £170 or £180, therefore they were pledged at the full value—I knew he was a retail jeweller, and must have a profit on them—I should sot have advanced the money if I knew he had got them on sale or return—if the goods are not redeemed within a specified time we have the power to sell, in fact they are not pawnbroking transactions, they are mortgages, and he has a right to his account—he never gave me a cheque which was returned—his first transaction with me was last November, I believe, when he first produced a banking account, or on the 2nd or 3rd; it must have been in March that I saw it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have had a number of transactions with the prisoner—I called at 1, Piccadilly very often; I used to take jewellery with me, and have sold some to him—I did not press things on him when I called—I keep <hi rend="italic">appro</hi>, forms—I gave him a book, and I had a book;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189210170040"/>
               <p>and when I handed him an article it was entered—this is my book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he had not had this necklace before, and returned it, nor one like it—I never asked him to buy it; he asked me for it—I showed it to him at his shop, not for the purpose of his buying it, but he had a pearl necklace from me some time before, and said, "I will see my customer, and very likely I might sell that too"—I did not suggest any terms for the diamond necklace—I did not agree to take bills from him six weeks afterwards—I did not introduce him to my bankers, and tell him I could discount his bills—I have sold him more than £200 worth of goods on credit, and he has had goods on sale or return—he owes me a balance of about £200 for goods sold on credit—he told me he had the lease of his shop, and they wanted the corner shop, and offered him £500 for the remainder of his lease, and thinking he was doing a legitimate business he induced me to take bills—I received a cheque from him on June 14th for £12 10s., and one on June 15th for £27, but not another on June 16th, 17th, or 18th—the £39 2s. 6d. you are speaking of a little later may have been a bill that was due, but that was paid to my bankers and dishonoured, and he gave me a cheque in the place of it—I have proved against him in his bankruptcy for £190 for goods sold and delivered; that does not include this necklace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The £190 was for bills which were dishonoured after he absconded—on April 9th he had a pearl necklace, which I find he pledged on April 12th, and a diamond pendant, which he had on June 14th, was pledged with Barnett on June 16th; a single stone ring, which he had on 11th May, was pawned with Mr. Barnett on 12th May; three diamond rings, and a diamond and sapphire brooch, a gipsy ring, and five half-hoop rings, given to him on June 4th, were pledged on June 4th—those were all on sale or return—I gave it to him in writing—this is the common form—on Saturday, 18th June, he told me that he had sold the largest of Mr. Ehrmann's necklaces, and was trying to make terms with him, and all the necklaces were with his customers, a settlement would take place next Monday morning, and he would return my necklace—that was the day he decamped.</p>

I am a jeweller, of 31, Holborn Viaduct—on June 8th the prisoner said he had a necklace of mine, and one, I believe, of Mr. Ehrmann's for £375, and he had asked £500 on it, and thought he should sell it to a gentleman from Cardiff, living somewhere in Endsleigh Street—he asked me for the necklace on my going to his shop—he had a necklace of mine in May, price £220, and he returned it on June 4th—he was going to show it to Mr. Harris, of Cardiff, and I let him have it back—it was not my property—I have had to pay for it—on Monday, June 20th, I went to Piccadilly and saw the prisoner—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189210170041"/>
               <p>said he had sold some jewellery, and that my necklace was in a safe at his house, and he would let me have it during the day—I said, "I will go with you"—I went to Great Newport Street, and then he made the excuse that he had left his keys behind, and would bring it in the afternoon—I said, "Send for your keys; I will stay here"—afterwards he said he would have the safe broken open—I went to his place that night, and had the things taken away—on May 4th I let him have a turquoise and diamond ring on the same terms, which was pledged on May 20th—on May 27th he had a pearl bar brooch, which was pawned on 8th June—there were other transactions in June which were also pawned, and I have identified them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He gave me a cheque and begged me to hold it over, but it was valueless, and I have received no payment in regard to that—I never solicited his custom in a single instance—Mr. Magson, a diamond broker, went to his place of business for me; he is employed by anyone who will pay him commission—I did not ask the prisoner whether he could do with the necklace by putting it in stock; I did not say that it was very cheap, but all our goods are cheap, and it was a particularly cheap article—I did not say that he could pay me for it by monthly instalments, but the reverse, it was to be cash—he had it on 28th May, and returned it on 24th June—he did not have it prior to 28th May, but he had one not so expensive from a different maker—I went to the station to see him when he returned to England, and recommended him to plead guilty, but not with any object of getting my goods back—I was not aware that that would have anything to do with it.</p>

I am a jeweller, of 24, Hatton Garden—on June 20th the prisoner came and asked me whether I had a diamond necklace in stock—I said that I had, but it was out on approbation, and I would get it—he said he had had a necklace from Mr. Ehrmann for £275, the customer Mr. Harris, of Cardiff, had chosen it, but there was some squabble about the terms, as Mr. Harris had offered £100 a month, and he would not take it, and he was going to Mr. Harris, who was very fond of jewellery, and would buy anything, and he asked me for some diamond half-hoop rings, which he saw in my case; he bought four of them, which he gave me a cheque for, and he also had four rings on sale or return—I learned next morning that he had absconded—I paid the cheque in, and it was returned marked "Refer to drawer"—I found that the articles which he had on sale or return were pledged at Mr. Walters within half an hour of his obtaining them.</p>

Russell and Co.'s offices in Newgate Street and ordered two and a half tons of coal—I paid £2 8s. 6d., and took this receipt—I noticed the clerk did not enter the order in the order-book, which was on the counter—I had done business with him before—in consequence of what I noticed I asked if he had the address down correctly, because it is generally entered—he said, "Yes, that is all right."</p>

I am one of the firm of Russell and Co.—the prisoner came to us as clerk on 29th August—he was first at the wharf and afterwards at Newgate Street—his duties were to receive orders and cash, to enter the orders in the order-book, and the cash received in the cashbook, and at the end of the day to take the orders and cash to the cashier, with two memorandums of the money paid in, one of which was filed, the other be initialled and took back to Newgate Street—Mr. Collins' order is not in the order-book, nor is the receipt of £2 8s. 6d. in the cash book; nor is there any entry of £1 19s. received from Messrs. Crocker, nor their order; nor of Mr. Sells' order, nor of the receipt of 19s. from him—on 28th September I wrote the prisoner's father, whom I afterwards saw with the prisoner at the wharf, with regard to the £2 8s. 6d.—I had discharged the prisoner the previous day—the prisoner said, "Here is the receipt for the money," producing the ticket which should have been filed at Newgate Street—I compared it with the one filed at Belmont Street—I formed an opinion, and said, "These amounts have been added"—the prisoner said, "There is another paper; I brought down three papers"—I said the paper ought not to have been in his possession, but at Newgate Street—the prisoner and his father left when I said I would consider the matter—I discovered the omission of the 19s.—I gave the prisoner into custody the following Tuesday—I know the prisoner's writing; the receipts are his writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate:</hi> "I done it through the effects of drink and thorough servitude in looking for work. I served in the Crimea, India, and Australia, and am a pensioner myself. I was badly advised by another man, who was also in drink, and I could not withstand the temptation I served twenty-two years and fourteen days."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner handed in a written statement to the above effect, and that he had been a teetotaler, but some one put gin in his ginger beer, and then told him he had broken the pledge, and in consequence of his skull receiving a fracture at Sebastopol, drink affected his head.</hi>

At a quarter past seven in the evening of 12th September I was on duty in Tewkesbury Road, Seven Sisters Road, Holloway—there was a disturbance there, and a crowd collected of about 100 or 150—I was endeavouring to disperse them; while doing so I saw the prisoner driving a pony in a two-wheeled cart coming up Tewkesbury Road from Morton Road; his wife and two or three children were with him in the cart; he was driving about nine miles an hour—I did not notice whether he was using his whip—he was on his right side of the road—seeing him approaching, I put up my hand, at the same time calling to him to stop; I heard other persons calling out the same—he did not stop till he had passed through the crowd; the people were all across the road—I saw him knock down a lad, who was in the centre of the road, by the near wheel—I put up my hand and called to the prisoner to stop a second time; I ran after him and stopped him after he had proceeded about fifty yards; I caught the horse by the head—I told him that he had knocked down a child, and I wanted his name and address—he commenced swearing at me—he said I was a b——fool, and not worthy of standing in my uniform, and that the clothes I had on were his, and he challenged me to fight—I should say he had been drinking; he smelt very strongly of liquor—after a while he gave me his name and address, and I allowed him to drive away—later in the evening, about nine, I went to his house, 8, Tewkesbury Road—I told him I should take him to the station, and charge him with killing the child by knocking him down with his cart—he said, "I am very sorry that it occurred; I will go with you"—he was then perfectly sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 13, Archer Road, Fulham—on Saturday, 3rd September, I was in the North End Road, about 9.40—I saw a hansom cab coming from the Lillie Bridge towards Walham Green—it would pass by a blank wall of the South Middlesex Volunteers, after which the road widens, and some stalls stand on the left hand, the near side—the cab was on the wall side—I saw two men and two females in the cab—they were drunk—I was going down the middle of the road, towards Lillie Bridge—the cab was coming towards me very fast—the horse was galloping—I saw the shafts of the cab strike a man in the chest; he fell, and the cab passed over him—I picked the man up—the cab stopped; I helped to place the man in the cab, and went with him to the hospital—the prisoner drove the cab—on the way to the hospital the cab ran into a truck in the North End Road, and very near got into another hansom at the corner of the North End Road—the prisoner was not sober—at the hospital he got down from his box—the people in the cab got out and ran away.</p>

I am a furrier, of 12 and 13, Aldersgate Street, and have one partner—the prisoner was in our employ fourteen days before October 10th, on which day I was going to business about 8.30, and saw a man going into a public-house with a bundle of skins under his arm—I went to my office, only about thirty yards oft, and to my stockroom on the second floor—the door was wide open, and the door from the office also—no one had any business to open the door—there are two keys, one for my partner and one for myself, but I missed mine after the prisoner came into our employ—I did not miss anything then; I went back to the public-house where I saw the man going in, and saw the prisoner drinking in the bar, and these three bundles of Neutra skins, twenty in each bundle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), lying by him—they are water animals, something like a seal—they are worth three shillings each—I said, "Is that you, Mr. Noble?"—he said, "Yes," and finished his glass, and was going away—I said, "You can't go till you have given an explanation of having those skins, to a constable"—he left the skins and went into the Saracen's Head, and I gave him in charge—they have a card-mark on them—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the key I missed.</p>

Gtatti, in consequence of an accident to one of the carts, and I received £5 off £30 which I had advanced at Mr. Pitt's request—he gave me this receipt at the time; the date of it is April 1st, but it ought to have been May 1st—I cannot give you the date of receiving the £5—the prisoner threatened me several times, and called me a fool—he is very hasty in his temper, and he threatened to knock me down, and came round the counter to me—I became anxious to dispose of the business, and mentioned it to him, and went to an agent—the prisoner said it business was worth £400 or £500—I was anxious to get my money back, as I had nothing to keep me—I offered the business to Mr. Richards; he said that he knew nothing about it; I said, "You had better become a partner"—I paid in £180 altogether, and made a further advance of £15 for a horse for the business—two or three days after I was there a broker came in, and I paid him £2 to go out, but the prisoner paid me back—I have not got a penny now.</p>

Wellington's works; it does not refer to the book which has been put before the Court—I have since found that there was a judgment debt against the prisoner for £100, on November 22nd, 1890; no step has been taken to enforce it, the plaintiffs in that action are bankrupt—I do not know that Sir Gilbert Campbell and others were plaintiffs in that action—there was also a County-court debt registered against the prisoner, so he told my solicitor—before I signed the partnership deed I was protected at every step by a solicitor—statements have not been made to Mr. Drew complaining of the way I conducted the business—I did not have sunstroke in India—I do not know Miss Rose Elliott—it was hardly the business of a newsagent to kiss young ladies who came to the shop for newspapers—it is not true that I have kissed anybody who came to the shop for newspapers, the whole family have tried to blacken my character—(<hi rend="italic">Miss Elliott wan here called, and was only a little child</hi>)—I have never taken civil proceedings against the prisoner for dissolution of partnership, because I had no money; my solicitor advised me to take proceedings.</p>

I am an elocutionist, of 50, Oxford Street—I became acquainted with the prosecutor about the end of March through the prisoner, who I have known many years—I had many interviews with them; and after the arrangements were complete I saw Pitt, who said that things were very bad indeed, and Stanley corroborated it—Pitt seemed to think that Stanley was utterly unfitted for the business, and that they had much better separate, as he was perfectly useless and essentially a lunatic; and he gave hints concerning immorality, and said that he kept away from the business; that the money had been useful, and Stanley was now in the way, and he wished to come to an arrangement, and it would be better for him to be out of the business.</p>

               <p>under the directions of Inspector Stroud—I was present and heard his evidence at the Police-court—the prisoner had an opportunity of cross-examining—I saw Stroud sign his deposition—I know his writing—this is his signature (<hi rend="italic">Deposition of William Stroud, of C Division, read as follows:</hi> "About the beginning of August ultimo, information reached the police that a Gladstone bag, containing bonds and other articles, had been stolen from 28, Park Lane, the property of Mr. Samuel Plimsoll. From what I heard I kept observation last night, with other officers, in the Haymarket. About eleven o'clock I saw three men drive up in a cab to a public-house. The prisoners were two of the men. The men went into the public-house, and after a short time the prisoners came out and walked down the Haymarket. Amos, with a fourth man whom I had not seen before, went into the Cafe de l'Europe. In a few moments I saw Featherstone outside the cafe. I said to him, 'I am an inspector of police, and am going to arrest you on suspicion of being concerned in stealing, on 1st June, from 28, Park Lane, two bags.' I gave directions to Sergeant Shaddock and McDowell, and in consequence Amos was then brought to me. I repeated the charge in the hearing of both prisoners. Featherstone said, 'I have got no stolen property, and I was not in London in June.' Amos said, 'I do not know anything about any robbery; I am a dealer.' They were taken to Vine Street Police-station, where I saw Featherstone searched by Sergeant Bolter. In his under-coat pocket were twenty shares of the Sheepbridge Coal and Iron Company, of £25 each; twenty-five shares of the same company, of £10 each; and one share of £10 in the Round Wood Colliery Company; also several pawntickets, a counterfeit five shilling-piece, and other small articles. On Amos were forty-six pawntickets and other articles. I said to Featherstone, 'These bonds correspond with the description of those stolen from 28, Park Lane; how do you account for their possession?' He said, 'I was going to sell them for a man that passed you in the Haymarket; I was not in London in June,' and (turning to Amos), 'Let this man go; he knows nothing about it; he is only out with me.' They were then charged. Amos said in reply, 'I know nothing about any robbery. You know me very well, Mr. Stroud.' Featherstone said nothing further. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Featherstone:</hi> You may have said he bought the bonds. I had no reason to arrest the other man who was with the prisoners. <hi rend="italic">Recalled:</hi> It was not the 1st June; I said the 31st June to the prisoners. There is about £600 worth of bonds still missing. The value of those produced is £800. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined:</hi> I do not think Featherstone said, 'I was going to sell them to a man that passed you in the Haymarket. He may have said 'to,' but I think he said 'for'")—these are the bonds mentioned in the deposition—I was present at the arrest, and confirm the inspector's account of what took place—the value of the bonds found on the prisoner is about £800, of the total lost £2,500.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was:</hi> "I bought those bonds from a man on 12th July in a public-house called The Round House, in Wardour Street. The man said they were no good, and he was going to burn them, and I gave him half a sovereign for them. I have since found out the two men that stole those bonds while I have been in prison. One man is in prison for stealing a watch; he had just come out from doing five years. The other man is at liberty. I have told</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189210170061"/>
               <p>Detective Stroud where he lives. The last man is the man who I bought them from, the man whose address I have given to the detective. He came out of prison, after five years, the same day, or within a day or two of the other, I cannot say exactly. I went into the country on 13th June, and have only been twice in London up to the 13th September."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">In defence the prisoner repeated in effect this statement, and said:</hi> "Since I have been in prison I came across the man William Stevens, 20, Union Street, Tottenham Court Road. Stroud has been to see him, and he told Stroud he did not sell them, but he is the man. The other man is in Pentonville or somewhere. Stroud knows he stole a lady's watch," and stated he bought them quite innocently, not knowing anything about them, of the men who were lighting their pipes with them, and said they were valuable. He had no idea they were stolen, and thought he might sell them.</p>

I am secretary to the Waterbury Watch Sales Company, Snow Hill—I advertised in April for a traveller in the watch trade, for Scotland, and got a reply from Samuel Gane Harper, of Milverton Villa, New Barnet, which was handed to the managing director, and has been lost—it was answered, and the prisoner said that he travelled for Ransoms, of Birmingham, and gave me Mr. Hansom's address, Kistor House, Torquay, who he said had retired</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Stating that the prisoner was a man of sterling integrity.</hi>)—I afterwards saw the prisoner again, and told him it would be necessary to have a guarantee, and gave him a form of the Guarantee Society, which he took away, and returned a few days afterwards, and said that he did not wish the smallness of his salary to be made public, which it might be if he applied to the Guarantee Society, but he would give us a private guarantee, if that would do, and suggested Mr. Ransom, of Torquay—I gave him a form for Mr. Ransom to execute, and received this letter.

(<hi rend="italic">Enclosing</hi> £6, <hi rend="italic">giving him two weeks' notice to terminate the engagement, and requesting him to return to London at once.</hi>)—I received letters from him on June 30th, July 1st, August 6th, and August 8th, offering excuses, and on August 8th I wrote him this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that unless the samples were returned by Friday next, proceedings would be taken against Mr. Ransom, his guarantee, and that he was not entitled to salary after July, and enclosing an expenses book</hi>)—on 6th September I received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that Mr. Ransom was in Madeira, and therefore he would leave the matter in the hands of his solicitor, and entrust the samples to him, and requesting payment of the amount due to him</hi>)—I wrote to Mr. Ransom at Torquay, but got no reply; also to Mr. Mann, the owner of Kistor House, Torquay—I gave instructions to Chamberlain, of the Private Inquiry Office, and went with one of his men, and Mr. Ransom to Youngman's Farm, Pinner, where I saw the prisoner and a lady coming along the road—Mr. Chamberlain's man said, "How do you do, Mr. Kean?"—they shook hands, and Mr. Ransom and I stepped forward—Mr. Ransom spoke to the prisoner, and his face became very red, so that he was uncertain whether he was the man; I lit a match and looked in his face, and identified him at once as Harper—he spoke with a foreign accent, as a German might do—that was not the way he was in the habit of speaking—he was taken to the station, and charged with stealing the watches; he was wearing a watch, which he admitted was one of them—he was taken to Snow Hill Station, and said that the watches were in the hands of his solicitor in Scotland, who held them as security for a debt—he has never mentioned the name or address of his solicitor—he had £42 from me in May and June, and I sent him other sums for expenses—he sent an account of his expenses to us weekly, and we sent him what he asked for for pushing our trade.</p>

Ransom, to Mr. Miller, of Uxbridge, stating that Mr. R.T. Kean had been a tenant of his at Ledbury for nine years, and his rent was regularly paid.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. In October, 1891, I was living at Orient Buildings, which face into the Hercules Road—turning out of Orient Buildings, and to the left, you come to the Lambeth Road—I had three rooms on the second floor—in the next rooms to me lived Elizabeth May—early in that month I met the prisoner at Ludgate Circus—he asked me to have a glass of wine; we went to the King Lud—from there he accompanied me to Orient Buildings—it was on a Tuesday, I think; it was a very wet night—from Orient Buildings we went to Gatti's Music-hall—I there met Elizabeth May; I had promised to meet her before I went—I introduced her to the prisoner—the prisoner had on a dark macintosh and a square-topped felt hat—he told me at the music-hall he came from abroad to claim some property—I cannot recollect if he said what he was—he said in his younger days he was a student at St. Thomas's Hospital—he showed me a photograph of his mother, and one of himself—he said he was staying at a hotel in Fleet Street—he took off his hat—I think he had glasses on at the time; I noticed a peculiar look in his eyes, and that he had a squint—he, May, and I went from the music-hall together to Ludgate Circus—before we left the music-hall I gave him my address, and I expected to see him again, because he told me he would write again when he got settled in different apartments—when he left me he said he was going back to his hotel—that happened on the Tuesday—on the following Friday I received a letter, which I destroyed about three months afterwards—in the letter he told me he was going to call that day between three and five, and that I was not to be so cross as I was on the Tuesday night—I knew it was from him, because I did not expect a letter from anyone else, and because he told me it was from the gentleman I went to the music-hall with—the letter said I was not to destroy it, but to keep it till he called, as he should expect to see it again that afternoon—I told May I expected him. and showed her the letter—when the time came, between three and five, I and May were sitting at the window, looking out into the street for this gentleman to come, and on the same side of the street as our house I saw Matilda Clover come, carrying a basket, and wearing a white apron with shoulder-straps, and a hat—she was going towards the Lambeth Road—I did not know her to speak to, but I had noticed her pass the house three or four times, and knew her by appearance—I did not know her name—No. 27, Lambeth Road is tenor thirty yards from us, I should think, round the corner—this is a photograph of the woman I saw that day; I have no doubt about it—I noticed the prisoner following her, and I saw her turn round and smile at him—I put on my hat and asked May to do the same, and we followed to the corner to see where he went—I stood at the corner and saw Clover stand at the door of No. 27, where she lived, with the bundle in her hand, looking towards the prisoner who</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189210170067"/>
               <p>followed her, came up to the door, followed Clover into the house, and then the door was shut—I waited there quite half an hour; he did not come out—I then went away, and did not see him again till I saw him at the Police-court; May told me she saw him again—on the occasion I saw him following Clover he had on a silk hat and dark clothes—I remember hearing afterwards that Clover had died from delirium tremens—I think the prisoner put his glasses on in the music-hall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not see the prisoner from October, 1891, till 17th June, 1892, eight months—Inspector Tunbridge asked me to go to the Bow Street Police-station to identify a man—he said he heard I had been to the music-hall with a man who I had seen go with the woman Clover—when I went to Bow Street I expected to find at the court the man I had seen going by—I saw a number of men in the corridor or passage—I was called in by someone to look at them after I had been about ten minutes at the station—all the persons had their hats on—I walked up and down once or twice, and had a good look at them, and I failed to identify anyone—I could not tell you now many men there were—I could not say if there was a police constable among or close to them—I don't know if a gaoler was there; I don't know who was there—I do not know that spoke to Tunbridge—I left the room, and then I believe May was called in, after me—I was then in another room—when she came out Tunbridge called me in again—I don't know who was there, or whether they were the same number, or whether they were the same persons—their hats were off—I was called to identify the man I had seen passing the house with a silk hat on—I identified the prisoner with his hat off as the man I had seen at Gatti's Music-hall—going from Orient Buildings there is a public-house on the right-hand side, where the Hercules Road comes into the Lambeth Road—I stood in my doorway and watched, not at a public-house door—I could not see 27, Lambeth Road from my door; I followed to the corner of Hercules Road, and then stood at the corner; 27, Lambeth Road was on the opposite side of the road, some way down—27, Lambeth Road is the same side as the Masons' Arms—when I saw the man following the girl in Hercules Road they were both on the same side of the road as our buildings—our window is on the second floor; it was shut—all I got was a glimpse of them as they went by, and then I went to the top of the steps and watched them—May was told to go to the police-station at the same time that I was, and we rode there together—we both knew we were going there to identify the man—we mentioned the matter as we went there; I did not ask her what the man was like—she seemed to know better than I, really; I think she knew better than I did—at the music-hall she was sitting there, and I asked her and Neill to come and have a drink—during the greater part of the performance I aid the prisoner were sitting apart from May—the prisoner was my friend, and had nothing to do with May.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I noticed that the postmark on the letter I got was Lambeth—when I went in to the identification there were a number of persons with hats on—I walked up and down, and did not recognise the prisoner—on the second occasion I went in the persons' hats were off, and I then had no difficulty in recognising the prisoner—I and May followed Clover and the prisoner to the corner, where we stood till they went into the house and the door was closed; after that I walked up to the door into which they had gone, and saw the number, 27, on it.</p>

                  </hi>. In October last year I was living in the same building as and in the next room to Masters in the Orient Buildings—I recollect one night at the end of September, or in October, being at Gatti's Music-hall—I saw Masters there in the prisoner's company—I spoke to them at the bar—afterwards we all three went together ins cab to Ludgate Hill, and had a drink at the King Lud—the prisoner was wearing a hard felt hat with a square top—a few days afterwards Masters told me something about a letter, which she showed me, and which I read—I knew she was expecting a letter, because I heard the prisoner say he would write in a day or two—I don't remember what was in the letter, except that it was signed with two initials—it said he would call on Friday afternoon—on the evening of the day the letter came Masters and I were at the window watching for the gentleman to call, when we saw Clover pass, wearing a white apron with straps, and carrying a basket in her hand—I did not know her name, but she passed the house daily, and I recognised her as a person I had seen before—this is a photograph of the girl I saw pass—the prisoner was folio wing her, I have no doubt of that—the girl turned round and smiled—Masters and I put on our hats and followed them to the corner of Hercules Road and the Lambeth Road—Clover was still going down Lambeth Road, and the man still following her—she stopped at the door, the prisoner went up to it; they both went in—I accompanied Masters up to see what the number was; it was No. 27—I knew Clover lived at 27 by seeing her go into that house before—I and Masters waited there for over half an hour—no one came out, and we came home——on the second occasion that I saw the prisoner he had on a silk hat and dark suit—as far as I remember he had no beard, but only a moustache—I cannot remember whether I saw the prisoner once or twice after that before I saw him at Bow Street, but I saw him passing my house, going towards Lambeth Road—I may have seen him twice after Gatti's—I am positive I saw him passing towards the Lambeth Road—on that third occasion he had a silk hat on—I went with Masters to see whether I could identify the prisoner at Bow Street—I was shown a number of persons wearing their hats; I recognised the prisoner with his hat on—I do not know that I saw him afterwards there with his hat off—soon after the occasion on which I and Masters followed Clover and the prisoner I heard Clover was dead.</p>

It was as follows:</hi>—"London, November 26th, 1891.—Dr. W. H. Broadbent.—Sir,—Miss Clover, who until a short time ago lived at 27, Lambeth Road, S.E., died at the above address on the 20th October (last month) through being poisoned by strychnine. After her death a search of her effects was made, and evidence was found which showed that you not only gave her the medicine which caused her death, but that you had been hired for the purpose of poisoning her. This evidence is in the hands of one of our detectives, who will give the evidence either to you or to the police authorities for the sum of £2,500 (two thousand five hundred pounds) sterling. You can have the evidence for £2,500, and in that way save yourself from ruin. If the matter is disposed of to the police it will of course be made public by being placed in the papers, and ruin you for ever. You know well enough that an accusation of that sort will ruin you for ever. Now, sir, if you want the evidence for £2,500 just put a personal in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Chronicle</hi>, saying that you will pay Malone £2,500 for his services, and I will send a party to settle this matter. If you do not want the evidence, of course it will be turned over to the police at once and published, and your ruin will surely follow. Think well before you decide on this matter. It is just this—£2,500 sterling on the one hand, and ruin, shame, and disgrace on the other. Answer by personal on the first page of the <hi rend="italic">Daily Chronicle</hi> any time next week. I am not humbugging you. I have evidence strong enough to ruin you for ever.—M. <hi rend="smallCaps">MALONE</hi>.")</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Priest, a chemist, of 22, Parliament Street—at the beginning of October, 1891, and before 12th October, the prisoner came into that shop—he said he was a medical student, at St. Thomas's, and gave his name as Thomas Neill—he told me he was attending a course of lectures at St. Thomas's Hospital—he asked me for some <hi rend="italic">nux vomica</hi>, and that being a schedule poison, I asked him for his name and address, and gave him a piece of paper, and he wrote this order: "One ounce, 10 to 20 drops diluted with water," and "sulphate of quinine," and signed it "Thomas Neill, M. D., 103, Lambeth Palace Road"—I supplied him with the <hi rend="italic">nux vomica</hi>—a day or two afterwards the prisoner asked for some empty gelatine capsules—I told him we did not keep them in stock—he asked us to get them for him—on the same day Mr. Priest gave me this order, dated 12th October, to go to Maw, Son, and Thompson, wholesale chemists, to get a box of capsules—I got a box of 100 12-grain capsules there that same day—the next day Neill came to the shop, and I showed him the capsules—he looked at them and said they were too large, he wanted some about half the size—I afterwards went again to Maw, Son, and Thompson and changed the capsules, and got a box of No. 5 capsules, which were a little less than half the size—the prisoner did not say what he wanted the capsules for—they are used for putting powders and solids into, in order as far as possible to render the medicine tasteless—a day or two afterwards the prisoner came and I gave him the capsules in a box similar to this—this is a capsule similar to those I gave him—after that the prisoner came to Priest's shop on different occasions up to the following January—I supplied him from time to time with <hi rend="italic">nux vomica</hi> in quantities of from one to four ounces—the last time I supplied him with it was on 20th December, I see by the order; upon each occasion I took from him a written order; this one and the first one I had from him are the only orders I have been able to find—we do not register them; it is not necessary; it comes under the second schedule, and so long as it is labelled poison, with the name and address of the seller, it is quite sufficient.</p>

I wrote this date "20th" at the time of the purchase; as a rule I always date the orders—it was an omission on my part not to have dated this other one—a registered medical man has more facility of purchasing poison than a man who is not registered—if a stranger came and represented he was a medical man, and I found he was not in the register, I should not supply him with poison if it was in the first schedule—a person might die from poison in the second schedule, but I should see whether the man could write a Latin prescription—if his name was not in the register he might be a medical student—I did not register in our books every purchase he made—I registered the opium because it was a prescription, and there were other ingredients—I did not register the prescription with <hi rend="italic">nux vomica</hi> in it because no sulphate of quinine was mixed with it, it was an independent item, and I should not have registered the other but that he had it two or three times, and to save trouble of looking it up I took a copy in the book—it was not necessary to register it—I should not register it in the hook ordinarily if it was for a medical man—I have no reason to give why I did not register it when I found he was not on the register—I could not say whether my practice is followed by other chemists.</p>

I am a registered medical practitioner I knew Matilda Clover—she had been to consult me on several occasions; the first being about twelve days before her death—during the twelve days I had seen her eight or nine times, about eight—I had been prescribing for alcoholism, bromide of potassium, and sedative medicines, as for a woman who had been taking drink—on each of the eight or nine occasions she came to my place; the last time was on the 19th October—I do not keep entries of club patients in my book; she was in a club—I fix the 19th merely from memory; it was not earlier, I know it was on Monday, 19th—that was the last occasion I saw her alive, and it was at my own place—on the morning of 21st Mrs. Phillips came to me twice—the first time I was out at a case, it was at half-past four—she came again at half-past six; I was engaged at a labour, and was just going out to it for the second time, and could not go, so that I did not see Clover at her house till I saw her dead—I sent Mrs. Phillips to Dr. McCarthy as I could not go myself; I said, "You had better call in another medical man as I cannot come," and I suggested Dr. McCarthy, in the Westminster Bridge Road—after the death I saw Mrs. Phillips and Mr. Coppin—I already knew Clover had been in the habit of drinking; that was what I had treated her for—from both Mrs. Phillips and Mr. Coppin I got the information which I put in this certificate which I gave—I am not aware I was guilty of a very grave dereliction of duty in giving it.</p>

I knew I was bound to put what was true—I said, "I certify that I attended Matilda Clover during her last illness"—I had not seen her on her death-bed—"such person's age was stated to be twenty-seven years; that I last saw her on 21st October, 1891"—I only saw her when she was dead, and I made an examination of her body—"to the best of my knowledge and belief the cause of her death was, primarily, delirium tremens, secondly, syncope"—that means delirium tremens resulting in or causing syncope, which means failing of the heart's action.</p>

               <p>bromide of potassium—if a person has undergone a course of sedatives and then drinks brandy, it would have a marked effect on her—brandy does not go with bromide of potassium in the case of a person in a weak state of health; the two things acting on one another in the body of a person in a weak state of health would produce a kind of fit if the person took an excessive amount of spirit—if a person took fifteen grains of bromide of potassium, and then took brandy on the top of it, it would have a very marked effect on him—on one occasion when I attended this woman in my surgery she was taken quite faint—she was not a strong woman by any means; and her mode of life was not conducive to her health.</p>

               <p>came and looked at a room and arranged, and on the 7th he came in—he said he had been staying at Anderton's Hotel, and his luggage was marked with the label of that hotel—he had one room, the second floor front—he said he had means—he said nothing about what his profession was, beyond telling us he was Dr. Neill—he saw no patients at our house, and so far as I know he did not practise his profession at all—he said he came to England for his health—when he came he wore a brown macintosh and a felt hat with a flat top—some time after he came to stay at the Lambeth Palace Road he asked me to take a letter for him round to the Lambeth Road—he mentioned a number, but I forget it—he said he knew a young lady there, and he thought she had been poisoned; he wanted to find out if she was dead or not—a name was mentioned, but I could not remember it—he said she had a child—I said I would go at first, but afterwards I refused; I said I had better not, and he said himself that perhaps I had better not—I think he said he would go himself—he did not, about that time, tell me anything about what he had ascertained; or say anything in reference to her, not until later on—I think he stayed out the first Friday night that he stayed with us, because he came in on the Saturday morning; that Friday would be the 9th—he said he knew who poisoned the young lady whom he knew in the Lambeth Road; it was Lord Russell—the Russell case was going on in the Divorce Court at that time—he continued to live at our house until he left to go to America, as I understood, on 5th January—on 7th April he returned and took the one room, and on the 9th he came in and he remained there until he was arrested—Easter Sunday this year was on 17th April—he made no reference then to the letter he had wanted me to take to the Lambeth Read; it was not till he was being watched, in May I should think, that he said it was a good thing I did not go round to the house, as they were going to exhume the body—I asked him how he knew, and he said he had sent a Mr. Haynes round—I had seen Haynes—I understood him he had sent Haynes to make inquiries about the girl, so I thought; about the time the body was to be exhumed—my attention was not called to Clover's death at the time it occurred—I did not know anything about it—the prisoner never had dinner at home except on Sunday, but on Monday, 11th April, after he returned, he had the dinner which had been ordered in for the Sunday because, on the Sunday morning, he said he should not be home—on the Monday he dined at half-past six; he said he had a late appointment, and went out at ten—what time he came back I do not know—I remember hearing something about the inquests on Alice Marsh and Emma Shrivell—we take <hi rend="italic">Lloyd's Newspaper;</hi> there was a report of those inquests in it, I could not say if it was on Easter Sunday—the prisoner asked me for the paper; he wished to see the inquest on those two girls—he said it was a cold-blooded murder—in April we had also lodging in our house a medical student named Harper—he had been lodging with us for three years—he was a son of Dr. Harper, of Barnstaple—on the day after he asked for <hi rend="italic">Lloyd's Newspaper</hi> the prisoner came into Mr. Harper's rooms, which were on the drawing-room floor—I was there—the prisoner asked me several questions about Mr. Harper, and looked at his medical books—I could not remember the exact questions now he asked me; I did not refuse to answer him—he asked me where Mr. Harper</p>

               <p>lived, and what kind of gentleman he was—I told him he was very quiet—I felt no difficulty in answering the questions he put to me—later he told me that it was Mr. Harper who had poisoned Marsh and Shrivell—I said he was the last man in the world to do such a thing; that he must be mad—he told me not to tell anyone—he said the police had the proofs—I asked how he knew, and he said he had a detective friend from America—he said each of the women had had a letter before their death, warning them not to take the stuff that Mr. Harper would give them; I understood him to say that the police had the letters—I noticed that the house was being watched on the Sunday when the prisoner was away—that was in May, about 16th or 17th—I could not give the exact time, but some time about the middle of May—the prisoner said he was aware that the house was being watched—I told him they were watching him; he said they had made a mistake; that they were suspicious of him because he was an American—on one occasion he said they were after Mr. Harper; that was after the occasion in May that I have spoken of, I think—later I asked him why he took an interest in the inquest which was going on, and he said the man ought to be brought to justice—when he went away in May from Saturday to Tuesday he gave me on the Saturday a cash-box to take care of—that was before the house was being watched—when I became aware the house was being watched he asked me to give him the cash-box back—he gave me with the cash-box a note-book, they were wrapped up in a newspaper in one parcel—the cash-box was locked—I think it was on the Friday after his return that he got the cash-box from me—I was aware at that time that the house was watched—he mentioned it tome first—when I gave him the parcel he tore the note-book up, and asked me to burn the pieces, and I did so—later on a detective came to the house to make inquiries, and desiring to know the prisoner's movements—I then wrote out this paper at the prisoner's dictation, he being in bed at the time. (<hi rend="italic">This was read as follows</hi>): "May 25th, 1892—I arrived in Liverpool on the 1st of October, 1891; came ashore on the 2nd of October; spent three days in Liverpool; arrived in London on the 5th of October, put up at Anderton's Hotel, spent two or three days there, then removed to 103, Lambeth Palace Road, where I remained till the 6th of January, 1892, on which night I returned to Liverpool on my way to America. There I remained till the 23rd of March, on which day I sailed from New York for Liverpool; I arrived in Liverpool on the 1st of April; in London the 2nd of April; returned to Liverpool on the 4th or 5th of April; spent two or three days in Liverpool, after which I returned to London; put up at Edwards's Hotel; spent two or three days there; then went down into the country, where I spent several days, after which I came to live at 103, Lambeth Palace Road, where I still reside."—that 25th May was the first date, as far as I know, on which any detective had come to the house to inquire—I asked the prisoner to write some letters for me in relation to a relative of mine, and he afterwards handed me these documents; one is in the form of a letter to Dr. Souttar, and the other is a draft advertisement—after he was arrested I received from him, from the prison, this letter, which I afterwards handed to Inspector Tunbridge—there was a cupboard in the prisoner's room—I have seen a box like this in it—I opened the box; empty capsules were in it, such as these—</p>

               <p>when he was arrested on 3rd June the capsule box was not in the cupboard—I had failed to see the capsule box in the cupboard for about a week before his arrest; that would be after the house was being watched—up to that time the box had been there the whole time the prisoner was staying with us—I had occasion to go to the cupboard—when Tunbridge came I pointed out the things belonging to the prisoner, and Tunbridge took them away.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When the prisoner came in October he had no patients and no visitors, as far as I could see, and no acquaintances—he had no sitting-room—he was thrown on himself and his own resources for amusement and occupation, as far as I could see—he told my sister in my hearing that he suffered from his heart and brain, and that he was obliged to take a long voyage for his health—he suggested to me that he was unable to sleep at night—during October I know he was in the habit of dosing himself with opium—he took a dose of medicine in water, and ate a lump of sugar afterwards—I don't know how often he took it—he appeared to be ill during October—I read the Russell divorce case in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>—it was while I was reading it he mentioned that Lord Russell was the man who had poisoned the woman—he appeared a very inquisitive man; thrusting himself into persons' affairs with which he had nothing to do, so far as I could judge—I know that of the few acquaintances he had in London Haynes was an ex-detective whom he had casually met at a photographer's in the Westminster Bridge Road, and McIntyre, a police officer connected with Scotland Yard—when he went away for the few days he said he was going into the country to Berk-hamsted—he told me he was engaged to be married, and he said he was going down to where his sweetheart was staying—before he gave me the cash-box and note-book, I had seen him open the cash-box—I think he used to keep it in his portmanteau, and the note-book as well, I never saw it about—the newspaper in which the cash-box and note-book were wrapped was not tied, and there was nothing to prevent my reading the note-book, if I had had the curiosity to do so—I once complained of being ill, and he gave me medicine, not in a capsule.</p>

I am an M.D., and lecturer on medical jurisprudence at Guy's Hospital, and one of the analysts employed by the Government—on 6th May, in consequence of instructions from the Home Office, I went to the cemetery at Tooting; a grave was there pointed out to me by Steers, from which a coffin had been taken—the grave was in a very dry place—there had been no wet on the coffin—Measures was also there—I noticed on the coffin a plate with the name "M. Clover, 27 years"—the coffin was opened in my presence, and I examined the body, assisted by Mr. Dunn, senior demonstrator at Guy's Hospital—the body was that of a well-developed female of apparently between the ages of 26 and 30, as I judged—for the most part the body was in a very good state of preservation—I proceeded to a closer examination by dissection, external and internal—I opened the large cavities, the abdomen, chest and heart—the brain</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189210170081"/>
               <p>was free from any tumour or hæmorrhage; it was much decomposed—I could detect no sign of disease, either there or in the upper portion of the spinal cord—there was no sign of disease in the heart, stomach, towels, spleen, liver or kidneys—the bladder was empty—the womb was unimpregnated; it was that of a woman who had borne a child or children—the stomach was empty—I found no indication of any disease in the vital organs that went to account for her death—I then, for the purposes of analysis, removed as much of the brain as I could; the stomach, the upper portion of the duodenum (the first portion of the small bowel); the whole of the liver; both kidneys; the spleen; the heart; and nearly half a pint of fluid which had drained into the cavity of the chest during the examination—the entire portions so removed weighed 114¼ ounces—I proceeded to analyse those for the presence of poison generally, but especially for alkaloidal poisons, of which strychnine is one—I detected strychnine in the stomach, liver, the fluid in the chest, and the brain—the kidneys and spleen I reserved for other purposes of analysis—I obtained from the stomach, liver, brain, and fluid from the chest an appreciable quantity of strychnine which I tested on a frog, injecting it beneath the skin of the frog's back—it had the characteristic results of strychnine poisoning, from which it died; it had tetanic convulsions, was very rigid, the forelegs were clasped across the chest; it had peculiar croaking, peculiar respiration, and, in fact, quite characteristic symptoms—I made, eventually, a quantitative analysis in which I obtained a weighing from the same viscera, that is, I took the portion obtained from nearly the whole of the stomach, about one-third of the liver, a quarter of the brain, and half of the chest fluid, and I obtained from those together, about two pounds of material, one-sixteenth of a grain—that one-sixteenth would represent nearly a full medicinal dose—one-twelfth is the maximum medicinal dose—in my judgment, from the evidence I have heard in the case to-day about the woman vomiting frequently, and from my finding her stomach empty, and from the quantity that I did find, and the indications I found, it points conclusively to a larger and fatal dose having been administered—I have no doubt that taking into account the vomiting and the length of time, it did point to a much larger dose—a little above half a grain has killed, but one grain is usually about a fatal dose—I was not present when Lucy Hose and Mrs. Vowles were examined—twitchings, convulsions and rigidity, with intermittence, I should say, would at once suggest the taking of strychnine—those convulsions and spasms are tetanic—they are not at all the symptoms you would find in the case of delirium tremens, there are very marked differences; in delirium tremens the mental faculties are obscured and perverted, in strychnine spasms they are often very acute and are not at all impaired, except perhaps just at the very last moment of life—in strychnine poisoning after twitchings the whole body, as a rule, becomes rigid and often arched backwards; the patient has a sense of being suffocated, due to a fixing of the muscles of the chest, and generally in half a minute, or more often in two or three minutes, all the spasm passes off, the patient is perfectly sensible, bathed in perspiration and free from spasms—Mr. Coppin referred to Clover being bathed in perspiration, that is a symptom of strychnine poisoning—it is also a sign of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189210170082"/>
               <p>delirium tremens, but the patient will remain bathed in perspiration continuously for hours throughout the whole of a bad case of delirium tremens—the case described of the spasms being intermittent, and the patient being collected and calm during the intervals of freedom from pain, would not be consistent with its being delirium tremens; the patient is generally not calm, but flurried, excited, tremulous, and certainly there is no real intermission of the symptoms; I mean a patient is not in a state of ease at one minute, and then in two or three minutes more in a state of violent convulsion—assuming the case to be one where there are those violent agonies, and spasms followed by minutes of freedom from pain, calmness and collectedness, that would be a symptom of, and would point to strychnine poisoning—the symptoms point to strychnine poisoning, and my analysis and post-mortem examination lead me to the same result—bromide of potassium is given to allay nervous irritation and excitement; it is often given in delirium tremens as a sedative—I cannot say whether it would make any difference if the bromide was taken after drink or drink after the bromide; all I can say is that if the man were to take drink after a sedative it might start delirium tremens—this (<hi rend="italic">referring to a bottle</hi>) is the form in which strychnine appears in crystals—on 4th July I received from Inspector Tunbridge this case of pills, and a box containing several kinds of coated pills—I examined the whole of these pills, and analysed some completely—the case contained fifty-four bottles of pills, and of those bottles seven contained strychnine, all in medicinal quantities, taking pill by pill—this bottle, No. 2 in the case, was full, and contained 168 pills; I analysed them twice and found 1/2 2 grain in each pill; they are labelled "Strychnine, 1/16 grain, poison," but they are a little short of that quantity—twenty-two of them would make up a complete grain, and eleven of them would make half a grain—rather less than half a grain has been found to be a fatal dose, but certainly approaching a grain would be a fatal dose—I do not think that there is any poison that quite approaches in the character of its crystals the appearance of strychnine; to a skilled eye there is something rather characteristic; but I would not, with all my knowledge, establish an opinion by mere examination by eye; I think an ordinary observer might easily mistake the crystals for those of some other substance—I also had produced to me a box of capsules; one of them was given to me called a five-grain capsule, and into that I put a score of these pills—these pills contain other matters; they weigh about three parts of a grain each; the chief part of them is milk, sugar, and a little accipient to make the mass stick together, and then there is the strychnine—strychnine in small quantities is given as a tonic in nervous diseases, generally as a tonic; it is very largely given as a medicine in small doses, not commonly in 1/16 of a grain though—I got the twenty pills into the No. 5 capsule without powdering or breaking up the pills—by powdering them you could get a few more in, I think not many more—if strychnine crystals, themselves, were put in of course there would be a great deal more strychnine; I don't know if I tried with a five-grain capsule, but you could get more than five grains of strychnine into it, because strychnine is heavier than many powders; you would be able to get into a five-grain capsule seven or eight grains of strychnine generally, if the strychnine crystals were powdered up, and put in with no other</p>

               <p>matter—the time at which a fatal dose of strychnine begins to operate varies according to the mode in which it is taken, and the condition of the patient—if it is taken in a capsule, first the capsule must take time to dissolve; I have experimented with them in warm water, and I find it takes a quarter of an hour at least before they soften and give way; then the form in which the strychnine is in in the capsule affects it; if it is in a hard pill mass it will not operate so quickly as if it is in loose powder; it would dissolve more slowly—if it is given in a liquid the symptoms are produced more quickly—then the time varies greatly according to the contents of the stomach, and the state of the stomach, as to the period of digestion, acidity of the stomach, and many conditions affect it—the margin for the beginning to operate of a fatal dose is from two minutes, but from ten to twenty minutes is the usual time when it is taken in any article of food, it may vary from, two, five or ten minutes up to three-quarters of an hour, and when the patient is asleep longer than that, two or three hours exceptionally; generally it is three-quarters of an hour after it comes in contact with the stomach that it begins to operate—when it operates fatally would depend upon the dose, and the condition of the stomach, and whether it is retained in the patient or not—I heard that this woman on her death-bed vomited frequently; that in my judgment would probably have the effect of sending out in the vomit some portion of the strychnine taken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think all these little bottles were full when they were brought to me; certainly this one containing the 168 pills was—I took some out to experiment with—I have heard Dr. Graham say to-day that he had attended Clover for drink; her nervous system would be very much upset—I cannot say exactly what the effect of alcohol would be, but if a person were on the verge of delirium tremens I should think it would render the person more susceptible to the effect of strychnine; it is a question of degree—I think a person like that would be affected sooner than a person living a temperate and healthy life—from the time the pill or draught has first been swallowed until the time the symptoms first show themselves is usually within half an hour—if a patient has been asleep it may be retarded for two or three hours; I have never known it retarded for two hours by sleep alone, but it has when opium or morphia has been taken—I discovered no morphia in my post-mortem examination; I know of no instance of its being found so long after death—I can give an instance of death occurring from strychnine five and a half hours afterwards. The first case I gave evidence in in this box, was the case of Silas Barlow in 1876, where he had poisoned his mistress with <hi rend="italic">nux vomica</hi> containing strychnine, and she died in five and a quarter hours—the fatal dose was not known, but very little was found in the body after death—I do not think that was an exceptional case; I think there are two cases where death occurred after six hours—I hardly know if there was medical attendance in Barlow's case; I gave evidence, but I did not make the analysis; I think there was no medical attendance till after death, but I cannot be positive—I think in the other two cases there was some medical attendance; I don't know about sedatives—my impression is that a doctor was called in who did something to alleviate their sufferings—there is no remedy for strychnine, nothing to alleviate it really—chloroform would prolong life—injecting morphia does not seem to delay the progress</p>

               <p>much, but chloroform or chloral does allay the spasms, and so protract the time before death will occur—when I heard of the evidence given before the Coroner and the Magistrate of the twitching of the body, the convulsive spasms, the perspiration, and other matters, it at once conveyed to me the idea of poisoning by strychnine, without the finding of strychnine—when I made my post-mortem I had not heard of the symptoms, but I may say that I had heard of strychnine—I did not confine myself to strychnine at all—before I injected into the frog I had performed the colour test—the frog presented the symptoms of strychnine poisoning—the frog is a cold-blooded animal, and a human being is warm-blooded, but the frog is a very delicate animal for symptoms; I don't know that it is very susceptible; but it is satisfactory at all events, and probably it does not give so much suffering as experimenting on a rabbit or dog—brucine is one of the component parts of <hi rend="italic">nux vomica</hi>—it is only a delicate and difficult chemical operation to separate strychnine from brucine when you get small quantities, such as a grain or two—I found no brucine in this analysis; but there is no difficulty in detecting brucine in the presence of strychnine—I don't know if I should have detected brucine if it had been present, because I don't know anything about the detection of brucine some months after death—you can detect prussic acid months after death—I found none—in many cases I should not expect to be able to detect disease of the spinal cord after the body had been for some months in the ground, but in some cases I should—disease of the spinal cord might cause tetanic spasms—Mr. Coppin described the spasms as of a peculiar kind—a vegetable poison is generally more difficult to discover than a mineral poison—I do not put it that the colour test in strychnine poisoning is uncertain and fallacious, but it must be confirmed by other experiments, proof that it is an alkaloid, separating from the material in a particular manner, giving the colour test with several re-agents appropriate for strychnine, and the fact that it does produce the physiological effect on the frog—as a rule we are not justified in resorting to experiments on animal life till we get some strong presumptive evidence justifying it, and giving good ground for thinking it desirable to do it—I found strychnine obscurely crystalline—other substances present the same appearance as strychnine; I would not in such small quantities rely on the crystalline form—the form of the crystals in this case does not enable me to pronounce positively; nor does the colour test by itself—the action on the frog shows either strychnine or brucine I think—I injected the fluid into the frog after subjecting it to bichromate of potassium, and the action of the frog would help me to the belief that strychnine was what was injected; it confirmed absolutely in my mind the presence of the poison—the capsules I have been shown are merely gelatine—quinine is sometimes taken in them—drugs nauseous to the taste are put in them and taken by patients—probably there is nothing exceptional even in a non-professional man possessing them—I don't think they are very much used in London; they are used—I believe they are all made in America: one always goes to an American firm for them I believe, or else the retailer gets them from an American firm—I found, 1/16 grain of strychnine absorbed in the body; it would be secreted in the urine; of course it is distributed through all parts of the body, and as I operated on a great part of the body I might have got the greater</p>

               <p>portion from the abdominal viscera—the heart was normal; the lungs had been a little congested I should think—I should not expect in death from strychnine poisoning that the heart would be contracted; it is very variable, sometimes it is full and sometimes contracted—symptoms of strychnine poisoning which are always present are the spasms attended with clearness of intellect and remittance, and so on; it is the aggregate of the symptoms; I put the whole thing together and say that drawing the inference from the aggregate number of circumstances I come to the conclusion it was strychnine poisoning—many cases of strychnine poisoning have been tried; Palmer's case was in the infancy of our knowledge of strychnine—there was not a great conflict of knowledge about that case; we knew little of strychnine then; it was the first homicidal case in which it was used, and some time after I had the first suicidal case; of late years we have had many cases—I have been through Palmer's case lately; the body generally was not rigid but flaccid; the legs and arms were rigid—the rigidity is not invariable—one symptom of strychnine is rigor after death, but it is not always present, it depends whether the patient dies in a spasm or in an interval of remission—when a person dies in a state of exhaustion the body would be flaccid in strychnine poisoning—rigidity is not invariable—I think the time between which the poison was taken and death is very important; it did not exceed the extreme maximum time—three-quarters of an hour is the common time—I think an inexperienced person may make a mistake in the colour test if the drugs are not pure—the colour I rely on is a purple-violet, which then passes through a play of colours I cannot explain—I know nothing else that gives that precise play of colours.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The length of time in which a fital dose will prove fatal depends on the mode in which it is administered, and to some extent upon the condition of the patient and on the quantity administered—death is generally more speedy from a very large dose, and if by vomiting the patient has got rid of a portion of the dose it would be a reason for expecting that the patient would live longer, or would recover—if in one of the paroxsyms the patient dies, I should expect rigidity of the body after death, and that that rigidity would last for some time—it would generally disappear a week or two after death, but in Palmer's case some portions of the body remained rigid from 21st November, when he died, I think, to early in January, when the body was exhumed—in this case over six months had elapsed—as regards the absence of brucine, so far as it is valuable at all it would be an indication that the strychnine had not been administered in the form of <hi rend="italic">nux vomica</hi>—I have not experimented in the direction of tracing brucine after death, and I don't know anyone who has—that which I obtained was obscurely crystalline; but the fact that there were crystals; is of value—I arrived at the result that strychnine was the cause of death, not taking each matter as isolated, but as cumulative and supporting each other, the appearance, the colour test, the fact that it was an alkaloid, the crystals, and, finally, the action on the frog—the frog is an animal which remains rigid long after death, and it may be made rigid though many other of its vital portions are cut off first; I cut the head off and then made the body rigid—having considered the matter carefully in the light of my experience I have given the result I arrived at—when I was proceeding to make this examination I had heard of strychnine; that</p>

Sir,—On Tuesday night, 13th October (last month), a girl named Ellen Donworth, but sometimes called Ellen Linnell, who lived at 8, Duke Street, Westminster Bridge Road, was poisoned with strychnine. After her death, among her effects were found two letters criminating you, which if they ever become public property will surely convict you of the crime. I enclose you a copy of one of the letters which the girl received on the morning of 13th October (the day on which she died). Just read it, and then judge for yourself what hope you have of escape if the law officers ever get hold of these letters. Think of the shame and disgrace it will bring on your family if you are arrested and put in prison for this crime. My object in writing you is to ask if you will retain me at once as your counsellor and legal adviser. If you employ me at once to act for you in this matter I will save you from all exposure and shame in the matter; but if you wait till arrested before retaining me, then I cannot act for you, as no lawyer can save you after the authorities get hold of these two letters. If you wish to retain me, just write a few lines on paper, say: 'Mr. Fred Smith wishes to see Mr. Jayne, the barrister, at once.' Paste this in one of your shop windows at 186, Strand, next Tuesday morning, and when I see it I will drop in and have a private interview with you. I can save you if you retain me in time, but not otherwise.—Yours truly, H. Bayne."</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer—I am out of employment—about the beginning of April last I went to lodge at Mr. Armstead's, a photographer, of 129, Westminster Bridge Road—I was there introduced to Neill—he afterwards told me he was agent for the Harvey Drug Company—he showed me a case of samples I have since seen—I was to an extent a good deal in his company—I went about with him in the daytime, and in the evening sometimes—on one occasion Mr. Armstead made a communication that we were being followed, that his house was being watched—I asked Neill if it was he they were following—he said, "No. certainly not"—I said, "I cannot go to the music-hall with you to-night without making inquiry"—that was about 14th May—instead of going to the music-hall that night I went to make inquiries—the following day I told Neill he ought to have told me the evening we were together that he knew he had been followed for some time—he said he had been followed for another man who lived in the same house as he; he said his name was Walter Joseph Harper, a medical student at St. Thomas's—I asked him why they followed Harper—he made a verbal statement at that time, and afterwards a written statement which I took down in his presence with his permission—his verbal statement was as nearly as possible the same as was afterwards reduced to writing—these are the rough notes I took at the time, at the Café Paris in Ludgate Hill, where we went to dine together:—"Walter J. Harper, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.R., student at St. Thomas's, at one time well-known among a low class of people, B.T. lived at time of murder at 103, Lambeth Palace Road, father an M.

H."—the name of the terrace is underlined—"B. T. "is Blythe Terrace—that is to show she lived there—"B.

Harper—I have made other notes for my own purposes—they are at home, 129, Westminster Bridge Road—apart from these notes I wrote a statement which I gave to the authorities—I can find my other notes.</p>

After I had been to Townshend Road with the prisoner, I went there with Sergeant McIntyre, and pointed out the house to him—when the prisoner made the statement to me about young Mr. Harper, I told him it was a very grave matter, and asked him how it was that he had not communicated what he knew to the authorities, and that I thought it my duty to do so—he said it was very foolish of me to think about doing such a thing, as there was more money to be made out of it by seeing Walter J. Harper's father at Barnstaple—I said to him that this was not America, and he could not do as he pleased here; that it was a penal offence—he said he did not care—I remember being on an omnibus with him towards the end of May, and hearing the newspaper boys calling out, "Arrests in the Stamford Street case," upon which the prisoner appeared agitated, and called my attention to it, and he wanted to get down and buy the papers; we were then some</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant Criminal Investigation Department</hi>). About the beginning of May I made the prisoner's acquaintance—I was introduced to him by Mr. William Armstead, a photographer, of Westminster Bridge Bead—he told me he was a doctor of medicine, that he had studied at St. Thomas's Hospital, and had been at Edinburgh and Dublin, and afterwards had gone to America—about 19th May he spoke to me about being followed, and asked me to make some inquiries—at that time I knew of no suspicion attaching to him—I made some inquiry, and saw Inspector Harvey and Chief Inspector Mulvaney about the matter—on 19th May we were in the Pheasant public-house, in the Lambeth Palace Road; I was waiting there until he went to his lodgings, 103, Lambeth Palace Road, to fetch his case and some letters, for the purpose of showing that he was a <hi rend="italic">bonâ-fide</hi> commercial traveller—Inspectors Harvey and Mulvaney were with us—the prisoner produced his case and some correspondence and opened it; there was some conversation with regard to it, and then Harvey and Mulvaney went away, and I was left with the prisoner—he said to me that a few nights previously he had met a <hi rend="italic">rip</hi> in the Westminster Bridge Road, who had informed him that she was sent after him by the police for the purpose of ascertaining who and what he was, as they suspected him in connection with the Stamford Street poisoning cases—that was the first mention of the matter by him—after that I was in communication with my superiors—on 24th May I went to his house at Lambeth Palace Road, midday, and he arranged to meet me that evening at 7.30—he did not keep the appointment, and I went to see him at eight in the evening—he had sent Miss Sleaper to say he could not keep the appointment, he was ill in bed—I found him in bed when I went at eight—he then said that about a week before the last inquest (that was the one upon Marsh and Shrivell) he was leaving his lodgings at 103, Lambeth Palace Road in the morning, when he was stopped in the street by a man who said he was a detective, and gave his name as Murray; the man questioned him as to Dr. Harper, and as to Dr. Harper's associations with women—he then produced a letter, addressed to Shrivell and Marsh, at Stamford Street, the letter having passed through the post—the purport of the letter was to warn the girls to be careful of Dr. Harper, as he would serve them as he had done the girls Clover and Harvey—I told him that I did not know any detective named Murray; I never heard of anyone of that name in the police service—I asked the prisoner to describe Murray—he described him as from 40 to 42, 5 ft. 8 in., or 9 in. high, wearing a dark cutaway coat, light tweed trousers, hard felt hat, dark whiskers, moustache, and beard, full grown, with straggling grey hairs—I asked the prisoner if he knew Clarke, or had ever written to anyone named Clarke; he said no—I said I had been instructed by my superiors to obtain a specimen of his writing—I took a sheet of notepaper from his table, which he pointed out to me, and I read to him a few words from the <hi rend="italic">British Medical Journal</hi>, which was just lying by, and the prisoner wrote it at my dictation—this</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189210170093"/>
               <p>is it; he sat up in bed and wrote it—this piece of paper which I took from his notepaper has, I find, the water-mark, "Fairfield, superfine quality"—the letter sent to Dr. Harper was shown to me by Inspector Tunbridge, it has the same water-mark. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GEOGHEGAN</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">said that he did not dispute the question of handwriting or water-mark</hi>)—I and the prisoner talked the poisoning cases all over, not the Marsh and Shrivell cases particularly—I said, "Doctor, you appear to be pretty well posted in these matters," referring to the poisoning cases; the matter at King's Cross was spoken of where a man was in custody or had been charged—the prisoner said, "Yes, I hare followed the matter closely in the <hi rend="italic">British Medical Journal;</hi> being a medical man, I take an interest in matters of this kind"—I had never heard of Clover up to the time the prisoner said Murray had spoken of Harper, and said the girls would be served in the same way as Clover and Harvey—I did not know whether there was such a person as Harvey—I had never heard of those names till he mentioned them—I asked him if he would let me have a general statement as to where he had been since he had been in this country, where he had stayed at—he said he would do so if I called the following morning—I called the following morning, and found Miss Sleaper then writing this document as to his movements, in his room—I read it over in his presence, and told him he had not accounted for the date on which the Stamford Street poisoning case occurred—he said, "So soon as I get out of bed, and I am able to look up some dates, I will be able to fix my whereabouts at that particular time: but I think I was at Berkhamsted"—the next day I met him in the Lambeth Palace Road; he said, "I am going away to-day, at three o'clock; will I be arrested if I do so?"—I said, "I cannot tell you; if you walk across with me to Scotland Yard, I will make inquiries"—we proceeded together about half-way across Westminster Bridge, when he stopped and said, "I will not go any further with you; I am suspicious of you, and I believe you are playing me double; you sent a <hi rend="italic">rip</hi> after me to meet me outside the <hi rend="italic">British Medical Journal</hi> office"—I pointed out to him that was a matter of impossibility, as I was not aware he was going there—he walked with me as far as the corner of Stangate—he said he would consult a solicitor as to the annoyance caused to him by the police, being followed and so on, and he asked me if I could recommend him one, and I said no I could not, it would not be consistent with my position to do so—I made his acquaintance by accident in the first instance—I was one of the officers entrusted to make inquiries with regard to Loo Harvey, and I did so with a view of tracing the death and the body, and getting some traces of her—Haynes went with me and pointed out a house, 55, Townshend Road, where I made inquiries, but I could not succeed in finding any trace of such a person—I made other inquiries, and inquiries were made by the police, with regard to Loo Harvey—the only thing he showed me with regard to the Harvey's Drug Company was a letter in the public-house—he gave it to me open; I don't remember his mentioning the name of any person with whom he did business.</p>

On the 1st December, I believe, a letter reached the Criminal Investigation Department, Scotland Yard, from Dr. Broad bent—upon that an advertisement was inserted about December 3rd, with Dr. Broadbent's sanction, in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Chronicle</hi>, and observation was kept on Dr. Broadbent's house for two days, to see whether any person called in answer to the advertisement; no person called; beyond that nothing was done—the letter remained in the department; no inquiry was made at 27,</p>

               <p>Lambeth Road, and no communication was made to the officer in charge of the L division—no inquiry was made about the girl Clover, not at Lambeth Road, not about Lambeth Road; no inquiry was made; the advertisement was inserted—I had nothing to do with it; the letter was looked upon as a letter from an insane person; other letters had been received of a very similar character, and inquiry had been made, and no one had turned up in relation to them—27, Lambeth Road is within a quarter of an hour's walk of Scotland Yard—we get a great number of letters of a wild character—nothing was done beyond watching at Dr. Broadbent's residence; it was thought the man would call there and be caught, and it was thought it was an attempt to extort money without any ground such as that stated in the letter—if a man had been caught I presume inquiry would have been made—I first received instructions to inquire into the South Lambeth poisoning cases on 26th May; those were the cases of Clover, Donworth, Marsh, and Shrivell, and the attempt at extortion contained in the letter sent to Dr. Harper—in consequence, partly of a complaint by the prisoner that he was being watched, I went on 26th May to 103, Lambeth Palace Road, and saw him there—Miss Sabbatini was present—I referred to the letter of complaint received from Messrs. "Waters and Bryan, and talked over the matter; the prisoner alleged that in consequence of the police having watched him about it had interfered with his business—I then spoke to him about his business and his presence in this country—he said he first came to this country in October last, that was October, 1891, to consult an oculist; that he was a doctor of medicine, and he had a practice in America; that some time ago he had a serious illness, and that the night calls did not agree with him, and that in consequence he had given up his practice—he showed me this medicine case—I noticed this bottle labelled l-16th grain strychnine—I said, "What are these pills composed of?"—he said, "1-16th grain of strychnine and the sugar coating only"—I said, "At that rate this bottle contains quite a large quantity of strychnine, and it would be highly dangerous that they should fall into the hands of the public in any quantity"—he said it was not intended to sell them to the public directly, but only to chemists and surgeons who would dispense them in their proper quantities—he did not say if he had sold any, or if he had any customers—he said he had taken up the agency in the previous February only, and that he had been travelling through Canada with them until he arrived in this country in April—on the 26th May I had no knowledge, and no suggestion had been made to me, that Clover had died from strychnine; I had heard her body had been exhumed—I first heard that her death was caused by strychnine about two days before the date of Dr. Stevenson's report—on 1st June I visited Barnstaple, and saw Dr. Harper and his son—at that time I had received specimens of the prisoner's handwriting from McIntyre and Mr. Priest, the chemist—upon that I applied, on 3rd June, for a warrant against the prisoner for sending a blackmailing letter—I executed that warrant at 5.25 on 3rd June, in the Lambeth Road—I told him I had a warrant for his arrest, and I read it to him—he said, "You have got the wrong man; fire away!"—I showed him the envelope in which the letter had been sent to Dr. Harper, and said, "This is what you are accused of sending"—he looked at the writing on the envelope and</p>

               <p>said, "That is not my writing"—I took the letter out from the envelope and said, "This is the letter"—he made no reply—I took him to Bow Street, where he was charged; he made no reply to the charge, but he afterwards said, "Can I send to Messrs. "Waters and Bryan, my solicitors?"—I said, "You can wire them; I will get you a form"—he said, "I write nothing; you do it for me"—I sent the telegram—he was searched; nothing was found on him relating to these matters—I afterwards went with Inspector Harvey and McIntyre, and Miss Sleaper pointed out the things she said belonged to the prisoner; among them were this sample case; a dark blue overcoat and a dark grey overcoat; a large portmanteau and tin box, and other things full of clothing; I took possession of everything in the room that belonged to him—he was wearing a silk hat when arrested—I found two other silk hats there, and a soft felt hat—I found no brown coat with a cape, no brown overcoat, no flat-topped felt hat, no light suits, no gold watch—he was wearing a silver or metal watch—I found, in the chest of drawers in the room, this envelope, with certain initials and dates upon it—I found, in the fob-pocket of a pair of trousers belonging to the prisoner, this paper. (<hi rend="italic">This was the paper with the address of Alice Marsh and Emma Shrivell</hi>, 118, <hi rend="italic">Stamford Street</hi>)—I also found two letters from the Harvey Drug Company, of 26th February and 6th May; a certificate of baptism of Thomas Neill, father's name, William Cream, dated 29th June, 1850—the inquest on Clover began on 22nd June, and the verdict was given on 13th July—on the 18th July I re-charged the prisoner with the wilful murder of Matilda Clover—he said, "What, in the Clover case?"—I said, "Yes"—the charge was taken and read over to him, and he said, "All right"—later on he said, "Is anything going to be done in the other cases?"—I said, "Not at present, I believe"—he said, "You will be sure and let me know if anything is to be done"—I was present at the inquest, when a communication was made to the prisoner as to whether he wished to be examined—he was then under arrest for sending the threatening letter—the Coroner told him he was at liberty to give evidence if he chose, and ordered the officer to hand him the book to be sworn; he at first refused to be sworn, but later on he took the oath, and gave his name—what he said was taken down on the depositions.

               <p>Mr. Gill said that was all the evidence he had been able to get as to the inquiries that had been made, and then the Coroner proposed to call the prisoner who was sitting between two warders, as the last witness; Mr. Waters objected—there were excited words between Mr. Waters and the Coroner—the prisoner said he was acting under legal advice, and declined to give evidence, or words to that effect—the Coroner said he had the right to administer the oath to any one in his court, and exercising that right, he called on the prisoner—the police, in addition to the ordinary telegraph wires, have wires radiating from Scotland Yard to every part of London—there is a private wire to Kennington Lane and every other police-station—I never received the letter from Dr. Broadbent—I first saw it on the day after the prisoners, arrest—the postmark on the envelope is S.E.—on 30th November the police had information and full particulars of Ellen Donworth's death—knowing that she died within a quarter of an hour's walk of the Lambeth Road, a wire was not sent to Kennington Lane—fault, if fault there be, rests with Scotland Yard—I know of no jealousy between the police of Scotland Yard and the other police in London—I was present at the police-station when Masters and May were called in to identify the prisoner—we cannot catch hold of people and bring them in from the street; we have to invite them to come in to assist at an» identification—the prisoner was placed among about twenty—we were some time trying to get in people from the street as near the prisoners appearance as possible; we were perhaps a quarter of an hour—I took a statement from Masters and May on 11th June, and they described the man they had seen at Gatti's Music-hall—the twenty persons were nearly all persons from the Court—many had silk hats on—none of them had a squint—we cannot pick and choose the people—most of them had moustaches, not all had brown ones; they were of all kinds—in a quarter of an hour I got twenty men all generally answering the description of the prisoner; not all bald—they were dresssed similarly to him—the prisoner knew a little time before that he was to be brought up for identification that day; probably half an hour before—I think his solicitor was present at the identification; I should not like to swear he was—the gaoler was in the room—when Masters failed to identify the prisoner with his hat on she went out and May came in, and May identified him—May and Masters were not together in the room when the identification took place—the prisoner was placed with twenty persons in the charge-room—Masters and May, with other persons who came to identify him, were placed in a small room off the charge-room, and that was the only time they were together, and that was before either was brought out to see if they could identify—when Masters was brought in on the second occasion, and just before she identified the prisoner with his hat off, the gaoler had not touched him on the shoulder and said, "Come with me"—the gaoler was standing in front of the row of men—it was not from an afterthought of mine that the persons took their hats off; it was from a communication made to me—they were about breaking up when Masters was brought back—I am sure the gaoler was not near the prisoner when Masters came in, and I am perfectly certain he did not beckon to the prisoner or do anything of the kind; he might have done so afterwards, but not when Masters was coming into the room—I don't know the prison regulations</p>

I am by trade a painter—I formerly lived at Brighton—in October, 1891, I and Loo Harvey lived together at 44, Townshend Road—in that month Loo Harvey made a statement to me one morning—she had passed the night before away from 44, Townshend Road—it was somewhere about 20th or 21st October; I could not say for certain—I fix the date because it was a week after I had left work on the omnibuses, and I left about 13th or 14th—I produced my book before—the last entry in my book is on 16th October, so that it was within a week of that—I left the 'bus work on 16th October—in consequence of the statement Leo Harvey made to me in the morning, I accompanied her the same evening to the Embankment—when we got near there I walked down one way, and she up the other; we walked in opposite directions on the same side—I saw her meet someone on the Embankment—I had then turned back again, and when she met him I was within a few yards of them—I watched them; I saw them go to the Northumberland Arms—I followed them there, and saw them go in—I did not address either of them—I saw them come out and walk towards the Embankment—I followed, and when they stopped on the Embankment I was on the opposite side, the width of the Embankment from them—I have since seen the man at Tooting and at Bow Street; he is the prisoner—they stood talking for a few minutes, and then I saw him hand Loo Harvey something—I was not near enough to see what it was—soon after he left her, and walked towards the Westminster Bridge Road, and then she joined me—she made a statement as to what had taken place between her and the prisoner—she parted company from me at Charing Cross.</p>

On the night of 11th April, 1892, my beat included the west aide of Stamford Street—I should go off duty at six next morning, on the 12th—118, Stamford Street is on the west side, on which I was—I was passing along that west side on the early morning of the 12th, about a quarter to two, and I was about a dozen yards from No. 118, walking towards it, when I saw a man come out of No. 118; he was let out by a young woman—I saw her then, and I saw her afterwards when I helped to take her to the hospital; it was Emma Shrivell—I would have described the man as about 5 ft. 9 in. to 10 in., dressed tin a dark overcoat, 45 to 50 years of age, with a high silk hat—as he turned by the street door I saw, by the reflection of the street lamp, that' he had glasses; he had a moustache, no whiskers—the lamp was on the same side, and opposite the door of 118—the street is about as wide as this Court—he walked away rather smartly, but it was a cold morning—later that same morning I was called in to 118, Stamford Street—about 2.30 I saw a four-wheel cab drive up to 118—I saw Eversfield carry Shrivell into the cab; Eversfield spoke to me—I went into the passage—I found Marsh lying over the seat of a chair with her face downwards—I carried her into the same cab that Shrivell was in—Eversfield went with the two girls to the hospital in the cab, and I rode outside—we both put questions to Shrivell, who made a statement—Marsh died on the way to the hospital—I made a report as to the man being let out—I was afterwards instructed to make a written report—I made it on the 14th—I knew nothing then of Neills existence—after this occurrence I was on the look out for a man, such as I had seen coming out of 118, from the 16th April—on 12th May I was standing alone in the Westminster Bridge Road, outside the Canterbury, between seven and eight p.m.—I saw the prisoner walk up and down four times—I saw how much like he was to the man I saw at 118, Stamford Street—I did not then know of Dr. Neill, or of any suspicion attaching to him or anybody in connection with Matilda Clover—I made a statement of it to Sergeant Ward—Ward made a report—I have no doubt it was the prisoner I saw in the Westminster Bridge Road—the man who came out of 118, Stamford Street was like the prisoner in stature, height, and general appearance—he had glasses—he was not dressed the same; he was walking towards the Lambeth Palace Road, which is about a mile from Stamford Street, through York Road, but there are many intermediate places he might have been walking to—he was dressed in a short coat in the Westminster Bridge Road—in Stamford Street in a dark overcoat.</p>

Dear Sir,—Will you please give the enclosed letter to the foreman of the coroner's jury on the inquest on Alice Marsh and Emma Shrivell, and oblige yours respectfully, Wm. H.

To the Foreman of the Coroner's Jury in the cases of Alice Marsh and Emma Shrivell. Dear Sir,—I beg to inform you that one of my operators has positive proof that Walter Harper, a medical student of St. Thomas's Hospital, and a son of Dr. Harper, of Bear Street, Barnstaple, is responsible for the deaths of Alice Marsh and Emma Shrivell, he having poisoned those girls with strychnine. That proof you can have on paying my bill for services to George Clarke, detective, 20, Cockspur Street, Charing Cross, to whom I will give the proof on his paying my bill.—Yours respectfully, Wm. H. Murray."—This other letter I also wrote at the prisoner's dictation, and the envelope also: "To George Clarke, Esq., Detective, 20, Cockspur Street, Charing Cross, London, May 4th, 1892. Dear Sir,—If Mr. Wyatt, Coroner, calls on you in regard to the murders of Alice Marsh and Emma Shrivell, you can tell him that you will give proof positive to him that W. H. Harper, student, of St. Thomas's Hospital, and son of Dr. Harper, Bear Street, Barnstaple, poisoned those girls with strychnine, provided the Coroner will pay you well for your services. Proof of this will be forthcoming. I will write you again in a few days.—Yours respectfully, Wm. H. Murray."—The prisoner took these letters, and envelopes away with him—when I wrote the letters I asked him if he had that evidence—he said a friend of his had it, a detective; he did not mention his name—I asked him why I should sign the name of Murray</p>

I had nothing to do with the forgery. The stamp I had was dated "June," and none of these orders are stamped June. It has not been proved that I had anything to do with passing any of the orders. As regards my signing my name "Stewart," I was married to Dr. Stewart in America, and after being married eighteen months I found he had committed bigamy, and I left him and lived with my aunt. It is not because she has committed a crime that I have had anything to do with it. I have been in the habit of receiving money from America.</p>
