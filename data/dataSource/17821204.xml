               <p>I was in Southampton-buildings, I saw a great skirmish, and I saw a woman fling a pair of stockings, over the wooden railing of the area of the Barber's shop; the woman that made her escape was a shortish woman.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner the woman that threw it over into the area, look at her? - That was not the woman, she was on the opposite side of the way when the man seized her.</p>

About half past seven in the evening of the 24th of October I left the stable, I fastened the door, the great coat was upon the box in the coach-house, and the man's saddle and bridle, and the fustian waistcoat, and a man's hat bound with silver, a linen frock, a pair of leather boots, a pair of leather shoes, and two odd base metal buckles plated with silver.</p>
               <p>Whose property were the last? - They were mine.</p>

               <p>I am watch-house keeper of St. Pancras parish; the two prisoners were brought to the watch-house in Glanville-street near Rathbone place with these things, they were brought by the watchman and patrol; and I found the property which has been before mentioned upon them, some on one and some on the other.</p>
               <p>Court. What, did you find the saddle and bridle, and great coat, and fustian waistcoat, and linen frock, boots, shoes, and base metal buckles? - The prisoner Hunt had on the smock frock, the great coat, saddle and bridle over his shoulders, and a hat in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Can you swear to him? - Yes my Lord, I think it is the same, I believe the prisoners both to be the parties that were in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you swear to them positively? - I can swear to them both that they were brought to our watch-house.</p>
               <p>Had Hunt any thing besides? - I took a key out of his pocket, that is all that was on him: on Hinsell there was one pair of boots, one pair of shoes, two brushes, two odd buckles, and five picklock keys, and one pair of irons, or instruments like toupee irons.</p>
               <p>What were they charged with? - On suspicion of robbery; of robbing no particular person; it was between three and four in the morning; they said they were coachmen to one Mr. Cole in Bond-street; Hunt said so, the other said he was a coachman, but did not mention to whom as I remember; in the morning afterwards, I and the watchman, and the patrol went and searched the prisoners lodgings, they told us where they lodged; in Hinsell's lodging we found nothing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040006"/> but a file; while we was gone we heard that Alderman Kitchin's coachman had found that the thief was in our watch-house, we went to the Alderman's stables, and tried these keys, and this is the key that opened the stable-door and the coach-house door as easy as the key that belonged to the door.</p>
               <p>Court. Is the property in court? - Yes, they have been mostly in my custody, but the Alderman desired his man might have the great coat; I marked it.</p>
               <p>Court. What has been in your custody and what not? - The great coat and boots, and waistcoat were delivered to the coachman; the rest of the things have been locked up in a room in Rathbone-place, in the custody of Mr. Purvis, one of our collectors, who is not here.</p>

               <p>I am the patrol; it was a very light moon-shine night; I was in Charlotte-street, and I saw the prisoners turn into Percy-street, into Tottenham-court Road, we charged them; Hunt said he came from Bond-street, one Mr. Cole, and that he drove a hackney-coach; he said he had lost himself; I said then you cannot be a hackney-coachman; he said he was no thief; we brought him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Court to Kane. What is the value of these things that are lost? - I valued them, my Lord, at 4 l. 9 s. 9 d.</p>

               <p>I had got a furlough to go into the country to see my friends, and I have an acquaintance or two that came from the same place, and they desired me to call on them, and we were drinking rather late on the road, and coming between Newman-street and Tottenham-court Road there were two or three men standing, and when we came up they took to their heels and ran away, and this property was found lying in the street; we stood some time, and nobody came, and we took it up, and we thought to take it home, that it would be enquired after, and if it was not enquired after to advertise it: we had not got above two hundred yards before the watchman and patrol stopped us with it.</p>

If you expect to gain any favour from the Court, or any mitigation of your punishment by pleading guilty, you will be disappointed; the Court will not consider such a plea as any extenuation of your crime, but you will be equally liable to be he executed, as if you had been tried and convicted; therefore it is in your favour, rather to take the chance of trial, and this your plea will not be at all to your prejudice." -</p>

               <p>C ourt. Did you see any body drop them? - No, I laid hold of the prisoner, a man had hold of him; at that time the things lay in the coach-way.</p>
               <p>Was the window fastened? - The window was not fastened, only pulled down.</p>

               <p>What occasioned you to seize the prisoner? - I saw him convey the basket out of the window; I was coming down the street between seven and eight; I actually saw him convey the basket out of the ground-floor window, and laid hold of him while the basket was in his hand, that was the reason of the clothes being thrown about the highway; there were three men with the prisoner, they all escaped.</p>

               <p>Court. I see you suppose them altogether to be worth about 50 s.? - My Lord, we were told to value them, and I did not know; I never was upon any such thing before; I leave that to the Court.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Where was I when Crane laid hold of me? - Off of the pavement, with the basket in his hand.</p>

               <p>No, but you might answer that without being a Surgeon: you asked her name, and you told her she had got something; did not you? - She begged to be let go, I brought her back and desired her to deliver up what she had in her pocket.</p>
               <p>The muslin was along with the other things? - No Sir, it was in another pocket.</p>
               <p>Did not you press her to give it up, and say, if you have taken this muslin by mistake, it should be given up? - No Sir.</p>

               <p>Had you shown her that piece of muslin? - I cannot say that I did or did not.</p>
               <p>Did she say that it was through mistake, when you first apprehended her? - No Sir, she did not, but whether by fright or not I cannot say, she cried immediately as soon as I brought her back.</p>

               <p>Did they both come in together? - Pearson came in first, and Booker followed him; I did not shut the door between them, I held the door while they both came in: Pearson was a considerable time getting out his money, and the other was trying to get out; the latch was small, and fixed pretty high, and he could not find it: when I had taken Pearson's money, Booker was got on the outside of the door on the step; I turned round and looked at the glass case, and saw it a little way open, and missed two gold watches; I then went to my master who was in the parlour next to the shop, cleaning himself; I told him to come out and look at his glass case, and I went out and shut the door after me, and followed the two prisoners out of the shop, I saw them running down St. Dunstan's hill, I cried out Stop thief! when they got to the end of Cross-lane, I thought Pearson was going down the hill, and Booker going to him down Cross-lane; but I cried Stop thief! and they both seemed flurried, and they ran from the top of St. Dunstan's hill, and both turned up Harp-lane, and when they were got about forty yards up, I catched hold of Booker by the collar, and brought him home to my master's shop; he made no resistance, only he asked me what I wanted, I did not satisfy him; when he came there, he said nothing; I did not see him searched.</p>

I was very near the end of Cross-lane, and he dropped two watches, that was the second man that came out, he was immediately taken in custody; he said his name was Booker; I did not see him taken into custody, I was busy taking up the watches.</p>
               <p>You saw the man after he was stopped? - Yes my Lord.</p>
               <p>Immediately after? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Was the man that was stopped the same man that dropped the watches? - Yes, the man that was taken, was the second man that run.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body running after him? - Yes, Field was the man that run after him, and likewise Mr. House's young man.</p>
               <p>Then it was Mr. House's young man that stopped him? - I cannot say, he was in custody when I saw him again.</p>

               <p>Were the watches the same that the prisoner dropped? - They were, one was out of the outside case, and the other was not.</p>
               <p>Court to Bateman. Did you ever lose sight of Booker before you stopped him? - No, only turning the corner, not three seconds; I am sure he was the same man.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you see him drop any thing? - No my Lord, I did not.</p>
               <p>What became of the other man? - The other man run over into Mercer's court; I said, when I heard the people say he was run there, that I should take him for he could not escape there being no thoroughfare; I took him there, coming back again; I said this is the man, I am sure he has passed me before, I took him by the collar, says he what is the matter; Hollandly came up to me and said he had picked up the two watches, and shewed them to me.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure that the man you met coming out of the court, was the same man that run past, and that you pursued? - Yes my Lord, I am very sure of his person, he had the same coat that he has on now; but I am positive to his person; both of them.</p>
               <p>Did they say any thing? - Nothing, only desired they might not be dragged along the street to the Compter; it being so late in the afternoon they were not searched; they made no defence, nor were they asked any questions.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see the watches dropped? - I saw them picked up.</p>

               <p>I went into this gentleman's shop for a watch glass; I asked him to fit a glass, he did, which was a little time about; I recollected the key was broke, I asked him if he had one, he said he believed he had, and I recollected I had one at home; I paid him six-pence and went out: afterwards I heard somebody halloo out, Stop thief! I went as well as the rest of the people, and I went up this court, I thought I saw somebody run up this court; I asked what was the matter, Field said you know, and took me to the watchmaker's, they told me I was concerned in stealing the two watches as they believed; so I went to the Compter before the Lord Mayor, there this young fellow said I was innocent.</p>

She said her master had given her a shilling, and she would have a pint of gin, I said, less would do, she sent for some gin, and they drank it at the door, my washerwoman knew her face; then the maid and the prisoner went towards the Adelphi Buildings, and when she came opposite Fleet Market, she bade her go on as she was going to market: when the maid came back, I missed the things.</p>

               <p>I am a servant to the last witness, I went with the prisoner to fetch the linen from No. 9, John-street, Adelphi Buildings, and as we went she stopped on Ludgate-hill, and asked me for a pin, I gave her one, and she bid me stand before her, and I turned my head round, and she was pinning up something, but I do not know what.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was she pinning it? - Under her coats. We went a little further, and she stopped at the top of the Fleet market, and said she must go the Poulterer's for a fowl, and go to the Grocer's for some tea and sugar; and she bid me make the best of my way to the house for the bundle of linen: when I came to John-street, there was no such name or person: when I came back I told my mistress, and she missed the things directly: two shirts and a gown; they were never got again. I heard the prisoner own to the gown the night she was taken up, which was three weeks after: I never saw her before, but I am sure she is the same person.</p>
               <p>Court. What did she say when she owned to the gown? - She said young woman do not make yourself uneasy, you shall have the gown; and I said, and the shirts too, I did not hear her answer to that.</p>
               <p>Court. Prisoner, would you ask this witness any questions.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Yes my Lord, a great many. This woman I am sure has perjured herself, in regard to her saying I acknowledged the gown at the time I was apprehended on suspicion.</p>
               <p>Court. What shall I ask her about your acknowledging the gown?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask her where and when.</p>
               <p>Cope. At the same house in Turnmill-street that the constable took us to: the constable was present and heard her say it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask her who was present besides? - There was my mistress's nephew, but he did not hear it, and the washerwoman.</p>

               <p>To answer any question, or demand any question, to a set of people like him who now stands before your Lordship, is in vain; I am at present at your bar friendless, and to a man who gets his money entirely by disposing of the lives of people that come before your Lordship, what have I to say? Redgrave came into my apartment, I had a bad leg, and was making a bandage for it; he was in company with two women; he said, You are my prisoner for robbing the laundress; I said, I knew nothing of it; they never proposed to me neither where did you pledge such things, or had you such things, but you are the person, and they took me to Clerkenwell; on the ensuing day I was had for examination, and this woman, in company with another, which I ordered out of Court, both swore to my being the person by a mark of a man of war on my arm, which arm I am at present ready to expose to the Court: they told me after the second hearing, if I would only acknowledge where the things were, they would forgive me; and the prosecutrix has been with me twice, and sent her nephew; I am entirely innocent, I have nothing marked on my arm but Jesus, Holy Saviour: I am a Roman by profession, or at least of the Church of Rome. I have no money to pay people to go for witnesses, and I trust this is not a land for oppression.</p>

               <p>I lodge in Gress-street, I am a single woman, I lost a white silk gown and coat, two black silk cloaks, a shift, two pair of cotton stockings, a lawn apron; I lost these things on the 21st of August, I saw them the night before, I left them on the sopha in the dining room; I missed them in the morning; the prisoner went off in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040019"/> morning, and I did not see her any more till she was taken; she was my servant; when she was taken she owned where the things were, that was last Friday I believe.</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose you was not by when she confessed? - Yes I was; I told her if she would own to me where they were, I would not hurt her if it was in my power.</p>
               <p>And so then she told you where they were? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>How came she in your apartment? - A servant that lived with a person in the house brought her up to me in the morning.</p>
               <p>Then in consequence of that you went and found them? - Yes, she sent for her friends to take them before we went to the Justice's; the pawnbroker is in Court.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. You see the prosecutrix knew nothing at all where to find the goods, but from the confession of the prisoner, which she was induced to make upon the prosecutrix's telling her, that if she would own where they were she would not hurt her: a confession that is obtained by that expectation of pardon, is never evidence against the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Do you come from Winchester? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you ever been in service with him? - Yes, I lived with him about half a year at Winchester.</p>
               <p>Have you heard about this spoon that he is taken up for? - I never heard of it till my master told me of it the next morning.</p>
               <p>Did he come to see you at your master's? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>What I am going to ask you, you will<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040020"/> understand, will not affect you, it is nothing at all to you now, therefore only give me an answer as to him; did you see any thing of a spoon that was broke by him? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>While he was with you? - No, my Lord, I never did.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing of a spoon that was bent, while he was with you? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any thing about it? - No, nor he never mentioned any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any thing about a spoon being broke, or bent, or missing? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not I there that night, and was not I bending the spoon? can you deny it? - There was never a spoon mentioned while I was in the kitchen; I had a red cloak of his sister's, and he called on me to carry it to her; he took it to her; I do not know how long he had been in town.</p>
               <p>Court. How long have you been in town? - I came the 14th of August.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of him from the time he came to town till this happened? - I have seen him, he lived with Mrs. Smith in Suffolk-street.</p>
               <p>Jury to Heather. What state was the spoon in when it was brought to you? - In the same state it is in now, broken in two, which gave me a suspicion that it was not honestly come by; I have had many applications on his behalf; his friends are country people, and live in great credit.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>What is the prisoner? - A hair-dresser; I lost five books, here is a list of them; the first is a quarto Queen Elizabeth's Bible, the next is a large folio latin book, the next is the first volume of Seymour's Survey of London, the next is a folio Latin Bible, and the next is a Geographical Dictionary; on the 11th of November the prisoner came into the shop, and sat down on the seat, and the books were behind him, the two first were taken before; I saw him put his hands behind him, and put one of the books down, it was the first volume of Seymour's Survey of London in folio; I was on one side of the counter and he on the other, and he put it down by the side of him, and it was heavier than he thought, and there was a little washing tub just there, and it rolled the tub from one side the shop to the other; he sat a good bit after that, he said the watch had gone ten, and he said, I will go get me a pint of beer, and he run out of the shop immediately.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he carry any thing with him? - He picked the book up, to be sure.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he carry any thing with him out of the shop? - He took that book out of the shop then.</p>
               <p>You saw him? - I did not see him carry it away, I saw him pick it up, and take it out of the window, but I did not see him take it out of the door.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the book missing when he was gone? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What became of the book after? - I never knew that, he came home at twelve o'clock, I let him in.</p>
               <p>What did you say to him? - Not a word, my clothes were off; besides, I did not think of saying any thing to him, nor would if it was to do again, as I was by myself.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to him the next morning? - I never saw him from that time till Thursday night; on Thursday night, between six and seven, he came into the shop, and sat down, then I saw him take the books; I said nothing to him about the other book, I was by myself, nor I should not; I saw him take a Latin Bible and Geographical Dictionary, all folio; he took them in the same way.</p>
               <p>Did he go out of the shop? - Yes, he did, and I ran after him, and cried Stop thief! all the way down Shug-lane; it was opera night, and the coaches were so thick I missed him; about one o'clock in the morning<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040023"/> he came home, and I apprehended him; he said nothing then, but used a great deal of abrupt language at the watch-house; he had lodged with me five or six weeks, and never paid me any thing; I had seen him before running about.</p>

               <p>Did you tell them you intended to sleep out that night? - No.</p>
               <p>Then why should they suppose that you was gone to Mrs. Rumsey's to sleep, if you had not told them so? - I did not tell them so.</p>
               <p>Did not you think it strange to be locked out? - I do not know, I never used to sleep out of a night, any further than going there to sleep.</p>
               <p>Did you use to do that often? - As I am out of place, I am there for a fortnight together.</p>
               <p>Then your father and mother did not think it extraordinary that you should sleep out of nights? - No my Lord.</p>
               <p>What time do they go to bed? - Nine o'clock; if I had knocked at the door I suppose I should have been let in, but I did not knock at the door, because I thought I should have anger if my mother got up.</p>
               <p>Why I thought you said your mother knew of your going to the play? - Yes she did.</p>
               <p>Then what should you have anger for young woman, because eleven is as early as you could well come from the play; why should you suppose she should be angry? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Then you did not knock for fear your mother should be angry? - Yes.</p>

               <p>You was afraid they should hear you, and let you in? - No, I thought they might not have been gone to bed when I knocked the first time, but when I found they were, I was loth to disturb them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner met you in Cheapside? - Yes, it was in Cheapside, between St. Paul's church yard and Newgate-street.</p>
               <p>She called you by your Christian name? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did she say, Sarah, or Sally? - Sally.</p>
               <p>Very familiarly? - Yes, she asked me where I was going, and I told her, she said there was a fire there.</p>
               <p>Did you believe her that there was a fire in Aldersgate-street? - Yes I did, or I would not have gone with her.</p>
               <p>Was there a fire there that night? - I was confined there till Sunday.</p>
               <p>You had no curiosity to go and see whether your friend's house was on fire or not? - It might not be near them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040026"/>Being told there was a fire where you was going to, you had no curiosity at all to go and see? - She over and above persuaded; to go home with her, and took me by the hand, and said I should go home in the morning.</p>
               <p>What, this stranger that you had never seen before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you to let her take your ring off your finger? - She took it away by force in an instant.</p>
               <p>Did not you feel her? - Yes, but I could not help her taking it off.</p>
               <p>Did you shut your hand? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did she open it by force? - Yes she did.</p>
               <p>She forced your hand open, and you asked her what she was going to do with it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And she said she was going to try it on her own finger, and would give it you again presently? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After all this force and violence, then you rested satisfied? - I was obliged to do it.</p>
               <p>Soon after that she got up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>She desired you to lay still, and covered up your face? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you to lay still after she had left you? - I was very sleepy.</p>
               <p>Then you was quite composed and easy, though this stranger had so forced your hand open, and taken away your ring? - I was rather tired.</p>
               <p>Rather tired, quite composed, no fear or apprehension on your mind, and lay quietly and slept till about eight in the morning? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any body else in the house? - There was nobody else in the place where she lived.</p>
               <p>But in the house? - No, nobody in the house.</p>
               <p>When you waked in the morning you found she was gone with your cloak and bonnet, and shoes and stockings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I thought you laid down in your cloaths? - She took off my shoes and stockings, and said I should be better without them.</p>
               <p>Did you make no resistance? - I did not make any resistance against her taking them off.</p>
               <p>Then you liked to have your shoes and stockings taken off, did you? - I did not chuse to have them taken off, but she took them off.</p>
               <p>And you let her? - I did, I did not want her to take them away from me.</p>
               <p>Did she take them off before you went to sleep? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So then this woman had taken your ring by force, and forced your hand open, and taken your shoes and stockings off against your will, and you lay quietly to sleep? - I did not sleep then.</p>
               <p>You never attempted to go away? - I could not go away without my clothes.</p>
               <p>You could have called the watch? - I did not see any watch.</p>
               <p>Did you open the window? - I did not, I did not call out for help, there was nobody but her sort of people in the place; she said my things were at a neighbour's and I should have them again; she told me if I cried, I should have none of my things again, or else I should never go from her no more, nor see any body any more.</p>
               <p>Then she tried to compose you? - No she did not, she told me to make myself easy, but I could not; she kept telling me so all the time I was with her, that I should have them again; but afterwards she said she must have more for her rent, and she would have them, I told her she should not, but she took them off by force.</p>
               <p>All this time did you see any body with her? - I saw two women, they came into the room.</p>
               <p>Did you tell them? - She desired I would not tell them my case, but one of the women, I told her when she was absent.</p>
               <p>Then having done all this to you, she left you in the room with one woman that she did not want to know the case, and desired you not to tell this woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040027"/>And then left you alone with her? - She did.</p>
               <p>Did you ask this woman to assist you in making your escape, and getting away? - The woman seemed to be my friend; I asked her where I was; she said it was a terrible place, and that it was Blackboy-alley.</p>
               <p>Then this woman told you it was a terrible place? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Though she herself came to visit there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many rooms were in the house? - I do not know, I was only in one room.</p>
               <p>Was it a ground-floor, or up one pair of stairs? - Up one pair of stairs, the rest was uninhabited.</p>
               <p>Nobody else lived in this house but this woman? - Nobody, it is like a barn more than a house; there was no roof to it as I could see when I went out, I did not see that when I went in, there is no number to it.</p>
               <p>After all this she went to fetch your friends and relations, in order to take her her up? - She said, if I would promise to keep it secret, she would go and fetch a person, if she thought, she said, I would not tell my mother; she told me that I was to say, that I knew her very well, and that I had been so good as to give her my clothes to pay for the nursing of a child at Battle-bridge.</p>
               <p>How, for the nursing of a child? - Of her child; I was to tell the person she had an execution served on her for nursing that child, and I was so good to lend her my clothes to pay for it; and she said, if I did not say so, I should never see any body; and if I would make her that promise, I should see the young person I wanted to see, and I should go: she told the story to

               <p>Had you known that Sally was missing from her friends before? - Yes, I had been at her friends several times, but never heard heard any intelligence of her.</p>
               <p>Did not you think this was an odd story? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That she should lend her clothes, and not leave herself clothes to come home in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ask her any particular questions about it? - No.</p>
               <p>Did she say how long she had known her? - She said she had known her a good while.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the prisoner before? - No, I never heard Sally speak of any such person; the prisoner said she knew her when she lived in Bell-yard, Doctors Commons; I went with her to the house, I saw but one room that I know of, and it was a kind of shed, like a slaughter-house underneath, a very deplorable situation.</p>
               <p>Did you observe whether there were more rooms in the house, or any other people? - No, I did not; I did not see any more stairs than what I went up.</p>
               <p>Now relate what happened after you went there? - The young woman said, she should be obliged to me to go home, and speak to her friends to get her some clothes; the young woman sat on the bed, and the prisoner related over again the same story, and Sally did not deny a word of it.</p>
               <p>Did she say any thing about it one way or the other? - No, she did not; only begged of me to go to her friends, and get her some clothes.</p>
               <p>Did you ask her any questions then? - No.</p>
               <p>Had not you a curiosity to know how she came into such a place, and in such a condition? - No, I did not ask her any questions, the young woman was crying all the time; I left her then, and went to her father, I told him I had heard from her; she intreated me not to tell her father or mother till she came home, and I asked him for some clothes for her; her father asked me if she had been stripped; I told him I did not know; he said I must come in the evening; I called on an acquaintance of mine in Fetter-lane, there were three young men of my acquaintance there, they insisted on coming with me, they said, it did not look like a likely story that the young woman should strip herself; they went with me first to her father's, there was nobody at home but her father; her father said, she must stay till tomorrow; I said, then I would go home; they said no, let us go for the curiosity, and we went: there was no light nor no fire, and we found the young woman in the same distress; and when she saw I had got somebody with me, she then confessed how she had been stripped.</p>
               <p>Court. The prisoner was there, was not she? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did she say? - The prisoner asked her to stay all night, and the young men said she should not; the prisoner said she had not stripped her.</p>
               <p>What conversation passed between her and the prisoner on that occasion? - The young woman said, it was as she had said before, and one of the young men desired the prisoner to go with them, and she said she would; the prisoner readily agreed to go with us; we took them to St. Andrew's watch-house.</p>
               <p>What story did the young woman tell at that time in the presence of the prisoner, as near as you can recollect? - She said she had been at the play, and returned about eleven, that she had knocked several times at her father's door, and nobody answered, and that she was going to Mrs. Rumsey's, in Aldersgate-street, to sleep, this woman called to her by her name, and said there was a fire in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040029"/> Aldersgate-street, and she had better go home with her, and she would take care of her; Sally said, she went with her, and laid down with her clothes on, and the woman waked her in pulling off her ring, and she asked her what she was going to do with it, and she said she was only going to try it on her own finger, and would give it her again presently; and that being weary, she fell asleep, and slept till eight or nine, and then the woman was gone with her cloak and bonnet and slippers; she came home at ten, much intoxicated, for her gown, and then for her stays; then afterwards she took her under-petticoat, her shaul and apron.</p>
               <p>Did you ask her how she came to stay there? - She said she was padlocked in, and the woman told her, if she offered to cry, or make the least resistance, she should never see any body again; I asked her if she knew the woman, she said she did not, and never saw her before in her life.</p>
               <p>She gave no reason for going home with this stranger? - No further than that the woman, by her motherly talk, enticed her to go with her.</p>
               <p>Is she a very weak, silly girl? - I really do not know that; she always appeared very sensible in my company.</p>
               <p>You never found any want of understanding in her? - No.</p>

               <p>What time did you go to bed? - I went to bed between nine and ten, I was very uneasy.</p>
               <p>How came you to go to bed then? - We lay very nigh the door, I thought I should hear her knock, my husband was at home.</p>
               <p>As you were uneasy in your mind about her not coming home, you probably did not go soon to rest? - I thought she was safe enough, I thought she might call at an acquaintance of mine, and I knew if she did she would be taken great care of.</p>
               <p>Who was that acquaintance that came into your mind? - One Mrs. Rumsey; I thought she might be there.</p>
               <p>If she had knocked loud and often, you probably would have heard her? - She did knock, because a neighbour came by and saw her when she was at the door; I did not hear her.</p>
               <p>When did the neighbour tell you this? - Since this all came out, then I heard of it.</p>
               <p>Who was that neighbour? - One Mrs. Godsall.</p>
               <p>The next morning did you enquire after her? - Oh yes! of the neighbours that I knew, but I heard nothing of her.</p>
               <p>Did you enquire at Mrs. Rumsey's? - I sent, but she had not been there; the first I heard of her was a Sunday night, she did not come home then, it was from this young woman,

               <p>of any acquaintance of Sally Cooper till this affair: I went to between eight and nine on Sunday morning in the middle of November, to recollection, when I came there, and it was very dark, there was no light at all in the room; I asked for the Cooper, and she spoke, I asked for a light, and the prisoner said she would get one; I believe Fitzpatrick gave her the money for it; then I saw Cooper sitting on the bed, with a petticoat and her shift only in her, I asked her, her situation, she said she had been without any victuals for two or three days, I told her I would bring her some clothes the next day, and she was very well pleased.</p>
               <p>Did she say how she came into that place? - She told me she had been to the play in the middle of the week, and knocked at her father's door, and did not care to knock any more; that she was going to some street in the city; I do not know the street, and the prisoner met her and called her Sally, and asked her where she was going to, and she told her; and the prisoner told her there was a fire where she was going, and that there had been a quarrell and she might be taken up, and that she was welcome to half her bed, and persuaded her to go home with her, and she went home with her; then she stripped her of her ring and clothes, and shoes, and her bonnet and cloak, they were all gone: I believe she took the ring off her finger; she told me this at the watch house, that the ring had been taken off her finger, and she asked her for it, and what she was going to do with it, and she said to try it on her own finger.</p>
               <p>Did she describe it as if the prisoner asked her for the ring? - She said the prisoner took it off her finger by force, and she made off with it and pawned it: the prisoner said that Cooper had given her the things of her own consent; she said it was very cruel to think of prosecuting her; I told her when I found her, if she would tell me where the things were, I would get them out, and give her no further trouble; but she said she could not do that, but she would get them out in the course of the week: her husband who was in the militia, would send her some money in the course of the week.</p>

               <p>I live on Saffron-hill, I know the prisoner, I have known her about two years.</p>
               <p>Do you remember seeing a young woman at her lodgings? - Yes Sir I did, I believe it is three weeks to morrow; I went to the prisoner; and I saw the prosecutrix there; the prisoner had been to buy some tea and sugar, and the young woman was sitting up in bed, and she said, Sally my dear did you think I was gone away; and the young woman was crying, and the prisoner asked me to stay and light the fire, but I could not.</p>
               <p>What was the young woman crying for? - I do not know, I did not speak to her, nor she to me; in the afternoon when I went, they were both sitting by the fire together, and the prisoner asked her to lend her her stays to pawn; she first refused it, and then she said she would, if she would let her have the rest of the things the next day; she pawned them for nine-pence, I saw the duplicate on the table; I believe it was on Thursday, the prosecutor told me she had lent her a gown and some things, and that she had proposed to let her have them the next day, and that was what she was crying for in the morning; I asked her how she came to know the prisoner, and she told me she had been at a play against her mother's will; that she came home and knocked at her mother's door but could not get in, that she went to the Cross-keys in Gracechurch-street, and her brother along with her, and that she could not get a bed there, that she afterwards saw the prisoner in the street, and the prisoner told her she was welcome to go and sleep with her, and she accordingly went.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>What age are you? - Sixteen the 15th of last June.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - I live with my father and mother.</p>
               <p>What is your father? - He is in trade, he lives with his mistress, Mrs. Adams, an ironmonger.</p>
               <p>Where do your father and mother live? - In Rose-lane, Spitalfields, No. 3.</p>
               <p>Did you live with your father and mother at this time? - No, Sir, I lived at Mr. Cox's, at the Black Horse and Trumpet, the corner of Lemon-street.</p>
               <p>How long have you known the prisoner? - I knew him no longer than while I lived at Mr. Cox's, he was a customer; I lived there in November, it was the 23d of October that he committed the rape.</p>
               <p>What is he? - He is a <rs id="t17821204-26-deflabel130" type="occupation">waiter</rs>

               <p>Q. Had you any particular acquaintance with him before this? - No, my Lord, I never spoke to the man, any further than to give him his beer, and what he asked for; I never had any particular correspondence with him in my life.</p>
               <p>Tell us what you have to charge the prisoner at the bar with? - On Wednesday night, the 23d of October last, the prisoner came and had some beer, I do not know what time that was, but it was at night, and afterwards he left the house, he had three pints of beer and three pipes, he and another man.</p>
               <p>Had you any particular conversation with the prisoner during the time that he and this other man was at your house? - No, I had nothing to say to him.</p>
               <p>Had he any thing to say to you? - He did not speak to me indeed; between ten and eleven he came and ordered a pint of beer, I drew it, and there was nobody to take it, and I carried it to the Hotel, and he met me in the passage as I took it.</p>
               <p>What did he say to you? - He said nothing, but took the pint of beer out of my hand, and by main force he took and dragged<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040036"/> me along to the parlour that comes into the street, that parlour that fronts the street, and he fastened three doors upon me.</p>
               <p>What doors were these? - There was a door in the passage, and a door that is right fronting this parlour door, and the parlour door; he threw me down while he lay with me.</p>
               <p>What did he do? - Why, Sir, he laid with me, as I suppose a man lays with his wife, as I was told, Sir.</p>
               <p>You must be more particular, you must say what he did to you? - He took me in and threw me down, and put my petticoats over my mouth, and his hand over that, while he lay with me.</p>
               <p>You must say particularly what he did, you are young and unexperienced, perhaps it may not be that thing that you suppose? - He lay with me in the room after he had thrown me down.</p>
               <p>What did he do to you particularly? - He lay with me as I suppose a man lays with his wife.</p>
               <p>You must say particularly, you must describe it, because the man's life is in hazard; he must not be convicted on your supposition, you must describe it; say particularly what he did; it is perfectly necessary you should say what he did? (No answer.)</p>
               <p>Why do not you say what he did? - Why, Sir!</p>
               <p>You must say what he did; perhaps on your account it may not amount to a rape, therefore you must speak particularly; you cannot tell whether it is a rape or not; that is the reason why you must be particular; it is necessary you should say what he did, and therefore it will not be wrong or improper you should say it; if you do not say it, the man must be acquitted. - (No answer.)</p>

               <p>What did you feel? What did he do? - I felt a great deal of pain while he lay with me: he unbuttoned his breeches while he lay with me.</p>
               <p>You must say particularly what he did? - He put his t - g into my body while he lay with me.</p>
               <p>What his private parts? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive any thing come from him? - Yes Sir I did.</p>
               <p>How long was he about this? - I cannot justly say, it might be half an hour, or it might not be so long.</p>
               <p>Did he do it more than once? - I do not know that he did any thing more than once.</p>
               <p>Did you struggle? - Yes I did struggle, and I cried out, but I could not make any body come to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Could you struggle more? - I struggled as long as ever I could.</p>
               <p>Was it half an hour before he got his ends of you? - No Sir, I was in the place I believe about half an hour altogether.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay in the place after he had got his ends of you? - He took and dragged me out, took and led me over to my mistress's door.</p>
               <p>When you came to your own door did your mistress observe any thing? - After he had led me over the way he told me, if I divulged it to any body, when he met me he would use me ill.</p>
               <p>Then you did not tell your mistress of it? - Not the same night, because I was so bad and so frightened; but I told my mistress the next day, she was busy, and that I did not tell her.</p>
               <p>When did you tell your mistress of it? - I told her on the Thursday night, the next night as she was standing at the door.</p>
               <p>How soon after your coming home, after the prisoner had had his ends of you, did you see your mistress? - I saw her directly, and I gave her the money for the beer.</p>
               <p>Then you did not go up stairs before you saw your mistress? - She was down stairs.</p>
               <p>How much time was there between the time the prisoner quitted you in the street, and the time you saw your mistress? - I saw my mistress about six minutes after.</p>
               <p>Then you who had been thrown down, and used as you have told us, had only six minutes to adjust yourself and come into your mistress's presence, and she did not observe any thing that had happened; how was that?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040037"/> - She was in a hurry: I told my mistress of it the next night; and I told

               <p>Did you speak to your mistress first about it, or your mistress to you? - I spoke first; the prisoner was standing at his door with a pint pot in his hand, my mistress was standing at her door, and I went to the green-stall, and my mistress said she could not think what he stood at his door with the pint pot in his hand for, she said she supposed he was going some where else; then I up and told my mistress in what manner he had used me, my mistress said she could not help it, she is here, and on the Saturday morning my mistress discharged me, and told me that the clerk at Miss Brown's Hotel desired I should go away.</p>
               <p>You used to go there often? - Yes, when the boy was out of the way I was obliged to go; I came away on the same account.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. You was dragged into this room I think you say my girl, and it was a front parlour? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who was in the back parlour pray? - It is a double house and they were all backwards.</p>
               <p>Was there nobody in the next room? - I did not hear any body.</p>
               <p>You resisted for a long time, you must be pretty well tumbled, your cap and your clothes? - My hair was up, my handkerchief was tumbled.</p>
               <p>And your petticoats were tumbled a little? - It was out of the binding.</p>
               <p>Only out at the binding? I am afraid you did not make much resistance? - Yes I did, I hallood out, and begged of him to let me go.</p>
               <p>You never told Mrs. Cox that night, I think you say? - No.</p>
               <p>Why not pray? - Because I was frightened.</p>
               <p>What, did you go up to bed directly? - No, I staid up about three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Did you tell your master that night? - No.</p>
               <p>This is not the first thing of the kind that has happened to you I believe? - I never knew a man before.</p>
               <p>But you have been ravished before, have not you? - No.</p>
               <p>No! why pray do not you know Mr. Kirby? - I did live with Mrs. Kirby, and she was in the country; and her husband did try, but he did not do any thing.</p>
               <p>But I believe though you charged him with it, and the poor man was frightened, and I believe you made him pay for doing nothing? - My mistress gave me half a guinea, and she told me that was to pay for tumbling my gown.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you observe this man before you were first knocked down? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Are you sure and positive, consider the prisoner's life may depend on your oath, and therefore you cannot be too cautious; look again and see whether that is the man? - I am certain sure that is the man.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about it? - No sir, I am as clear and as confident about it as can be; I said I have seen the man's face, I think I should know him again, but I did not know where I had seen his face.</p>
               <p>Were you at all in liquor in that time? - I suppose in the course of that day I might<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040039"/> drink eight or nine pints of beer, I had just drank a pint of beer before.</p>
               <p>Was your head confused at all? - I was very sensible, but I will not say I was as sober as ever I was, but I remember what I did as well as I should now this minute.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. You are a carpenter, I believe. - And joiner both.</p>
               <p>Had you worked that afternoon? - I had not been at work that day.</p>
               <p>You had been drinking all day? - No, I may call myself sober, or thereaways; - I was able to take care of myself.</p>
               <p>I suppose you could walk well? - Walk well, or discourse.</p>
               <p>But you was not so capable, perhaps, of discerning every thing as if you was perfectly sober? - I was, upon, my word.</p>
               <p>You think you was? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time of night was this? - I think about a quarter or twenty minutes after six; it is not ten minutes walk from the place where I live to the place where I was robbed.</p>
               <p>It was a very dark night, I believe? - No, it was a very fine clear night, I am sensible it was a very clear night.</p>
               <p>Do you know Job Carey? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you at his house that night? - It was the last house I went out of.</p>
               <p>Was not you when you went out of Carey's house very much intoxicated in liquor? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Was you at Carey's the next morning after this robbery? - Yes, and I asked him who was in the house.</p>
               <p>Then you was so much in liquor the night before, you could not tell who was in the house? Did not you tell Job Carey the next morning that you was so much in liquor over-night that you could not tell who was there? - I did not; upon my word I did not.</p>
               <p>Did not you say that you could not tell whether any body came in with you or went out with you? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>How was the prisoner dressed at that time? - In a light coloured great coat, buttoned up very close, and a flapped hat; I saw his face because he stood up to me, and being of my own height, or thereaways.</p>

               <p>Nor the colour of his clothes? - I described the colour of the clothes the next morning before the Justice, I did not tell Baker I could not describe the colour of the clothes, I did not tell him any such thing.</p>

               <p>Did not you go to his lodging, or speak to any body, representing him to be the person that robbed you? - I was at work just by, a person says to me, perhaps it might be Fraser; I believe it was one Sigby; I did know him at that time, but I could not call him to mind; I recollected the men afterwards that he was not the man.</p>
               <p>Did not you say at that time perhaps it might be Fraser that robbed you? - It was Sigby that said so.</p>

               <p>Was you called upon to find the prisoner out amongst several others? - He held down his head, and I could not see his face, then he held up his head, and I saw it was him, I knew him immediately; I said directly to my husband that was standing by, that it was him; I said to the best of my remembrance to the Justice that it was him; she that was with me is quite a child, and troubled with fits.</p>

               <p>You did not know him before? - No, but he looked me in the face full, and crossed the ditch again.</p>
               <p>As the prosecutor (you say) and you are entire strangers, how came you to before the Justice? - The man found me out, Arnold knew me, I ran in my fright to the publick-house and ordered a pint of beer; I went home immediately, and I up and told the landlord there was a man robbed; they told him to look up, and he looked me in the face and then I knew him again.</p>

               <p>What time of night was that? - It might be a quarter before six for what I know, he had a pint of beer and drank it, and while he was a drinking of it, he laid his head down and seemed to go to sleep; I was sitting in the next box receiving some money, he got up all in a hurry, and said, Mr. Carey I have had a pint of beer, and I have paid for it, very well, Sir, said I, I did not know that he knew me; he seemed to reel very much in going out of the box, I said to him take care my friend, you will fall down, no, no, says he, I shall be capable of taking care of myself though I have been drinking; I wished him a good night, he went all along the passage reeling; that might be about ten minutes after six: the next morning he came into my house about ten, or half an hour after; says he, Mr. Carey I want to speak to you, says I, my friend what is your will, says he, drink, do not you remember that I was here last night, I looked him in the face, yes, says I, I believe you sat in that middle box, yes says he; he had changed his clothes; says he, what company was I in, I had been drinking, I was ill used; I have some notion that some body dogged me out of your house, and used me ill in the Willow walk; for says he, they took all the money I had from me, and flung me into the ditch; he asked me who was in his company, for he said he had been a drinking and he could not remember whose company he had been in; he said he was in liquor, and he could not remember who was in his company: I am upon oath, I tell you the truth: the prosecutor came about a week after I believe, and drank a pint of beer, this was the third time that I saw him; says he, Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040043"/> Carey I want to speak with you, says I, what is your will now, pray says he is not there one Fraser that keeps horses and carts in Duck-lane, no says I, there is one

               <p>Do you remember Sir any part of the conversation, at any of the two last meetings, any thing said about the darkness of the night? - No Sir, not to my knowledge; it was quite dark when he went out of my house, so that you could not see the length of your hand.</p>
               <p>Court to Tall. You have heard what the witness has said, did you hold such conversation? - I went to his house, and asked him who was in his house, whether any body might have been there and waited for me.</p>

               <p>I am a carpenter, and work for Mr. Allen, I took the prisoner with twelve pounds weight of lead on him at the corner of Long Acre, about five minutes after twelve in the day; he had got it under his smock frock, it was concealed; Mr. Allen and I took the place to build for a certain sum of money, and to make good every thing; we had lost a vast quantity of lead from the place before.</p>
               <p>Was this house inhabited at the time? - This was taken from the shop adjoining to the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>Was it fixed? - It was nailed on.</p>
               <p>Then it was fixed to the out-house adjoining to the house? - We had lost several hundred weight of lead before; I caught the man with it myself, he had been at work there, he was a labourer to Mr. Norris, the bricklayer; I met him coming from the building, and I saw him have something under his smock frock, I judged it might be our property, and I stopped him; I took the lead from between his smock frock and his waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Did you charge him with taking it? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He told me he found it, sometimes he said in one place, first in the shavings, and then at the bottom of the ladder; I matched it to the same place, and the nail-holes matched where it was taken off.</p>

               <p>As I was coming to dinner I found this lead at the foot of a ladder, under some shavings; this gentleman told me he would let me go if I would tell him about his lead; they were ripping off lead that very day.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Wallis. Are you clear and certain it is the same lead? - I am certain it is.</p>

Last Sunday morning between three and four, I heard a great knocking at the door, and I got out of my bed; my master's bell rung before I could get out of my room, I went first to his room door and opened it, he asked me what was the matter at the door; I went to the door and asked who was there, and the watchman answered me; I immediately opened the door, and he told me there were thieves in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040047"/> house; I went down with him, and left another watchman at the door on the outside with his candle and lanthorn, having shut the door; we went down immediately to the kitchen, and the window near the sink was thrown up, and the inside shutters were very much broken, and the outside shutters were open; as soon as we saw that, we went and opened the area door.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see this window shut at night? - Yes, I look at every place before I go to bed, I saw them very fast, I did not fasten them myself, the cook fastened them: we went and opened the area door; and the small beer cellar door faced us almost, and the watchman being before me, said, there they are; I just took a fight, I saw two men in the cellar; we both tried to shut the small beer cellar door, they burst it open, knocked out the watchman's light, got from us, and rushed out at the front door.</p>
               <p>Did you take notice enough of the people to know who they were? - No my Lord.</p>
               <p>How do you imagine these people got into the area? - Over the rails I imagine my Lord.</p>
               <p>Is it a deep area? - It is about eight or nine feet deep.</p>
               <p>Not too deep for a man to drop? - No.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the watchman that watched in that beat that night: I was informed by a woman on the other side of the way, that she saw thieves about, and she believed they were in this gentleman's house; accordingly I poked at the shutters and found one of them open; this was at three in the morning; I called to my brother watchman to assist; I knocked at the door, and the footman came and asked who was there, I said it is the watchman, there are thieves in your master's house; I went down with the man, and we saw the window broke, and we opened the door, and I was the first man that went in; and when I saw them in the vault, I spoke with a loud voice, and said, there they are; and I was fully resolved to throw them down if possibly I could; and they knocked my lanthorn out of my hand, and overpowered me, and I took particular notice of them, as much as I could; and I can swear that the prisoner at the bar is one of them.</p>
               <p>What became of you when they knocked the lanthorn out of your hand? - I was obliged to stay there.</p>
               <p>They did not stay with you? - They knocked out my candle, and went into the house directly; I found this crow in the cellar after.</p>
               <p>What sort of a morning was it? - It was a darkish morning, but I had the light in my lanthorn to observe their faces; if I was to see the other man I believe I would know him; I looked full in their faces; they were a matter of three or four minutes with me, fronting me in the area.</p>

               <p>Your candle was knocked out? - In three or four minutes.</p>
               <p>What, was you struggling with them three or four minutes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That is, you was on one side of the door, and they were on the other? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You could not see them then? - No.</p>
               <p>Your struggle was to keep them in the cellar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then they were withinside the cellar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you stand with your back to the kitchen door? - Yes, they stood for a matter of three or four minutes in the area.</p>
               <p>Court. After they had got out of the vault as you call it, how long was it before they got into the house? - It was three or four minutes, as nigh as I can guess.</p>
               <p>And in what part of this three or four minutes was it that your lanthorn was knocked out? - My lanthorn was a-light during that time.</p>
               <p>When was your lanthorn knocked out? - At the last.</p>
               <p>How was the prisoner dressed? - In a black waistcoat and whitish coat, and a three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040048"/> cocked hat, that is the man; the other was dressed in a blueish coat, and a bit of a round hat with a lace to it; I saw him at the round house about half an hour after, I knew him directly.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the officers that was the man?</p>
               <p>PRISONER.</p>
               <p>My Lord he said he knew nothing of me.</p>
               <p>I was not asked, I knew in my mind that was the man.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing at the time? - I did not say any thing, I was not asked any questions; the other watchman pursued him, and never lost sight of him till he took him to the round house.</p>
               <p>PRISONER.</p>
               <p>The man laid no charge against me at the watch-house till the Monday following; he owned at the watch-house that he had a doubt of me; at the watch-house he did not then think me the person.</p>
               <p>Court to David. Remember you are upon your oath, did you say you knew nothing about him? - No, I was not asked any questions.</p>

               <p>Could you see what passed in the area? - No, I heard them dispute, but I could not see any one in the area.</p>
               <p>How long might they be disputing in the area? - About three or four minutes; then I saw the prisoner at the bar come out of the door, I thought he belonged to the house; he asked me where they were, I said they were withinside; he rushed against me, and with his shoulder he attempted to throw me into the kennel, I saw nobody come out with him; he was the first man that came out, he ran hard into Farmer's rents, he returned in less than five minutes, there being no thoroughfare; he was then in custody of St. Giles's watchman.</p>
               <p>Court. How long might this be that he was taken by the watchman, after he ran past you; - I suppose it had not been above ten minutes; he made all the best haste he could.</p>
               <p>Had you your lanthorn? - I looked as serious in his face as I would in yours.</p>
               <p>When he opened the door, he did not give you much time for examination I suppose? - I thought him to be one of the family.</p>
               <p>Had you opportunity sufficient to see his face so as to distinguish him? - Yes I had, I swear he was the man.</p>
               <p>You must be very quick sighted. - He stood and asked me where are they, and I said they are within side; then he pushed against me, and then I took him to be one of the thieves.</p>
               <p>Did you hold your lanthorn up to his face? - When he came to the door, he pretended to belong to the house; I had time enough to look at his face; I am full sure of him.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - Much such a coat as that he wears now, it may be the same; he had a three cocked hat full of cobwebs, and his back full of brick-dust.</p>

               <p>Whereabouts in the rents did you find him? - At the bottom of the rents, where he could not run any further: I said I do not know what you have done, there is an oration of Stop thief! and I seize you; when I brought him up to the top of the court, this Marybone watchman, Sillway, said that is the man.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he look at him first, before he said that is the man? - No, he did not, he immediately said so, when he got sight of him: I had a light, and my partner had a light; then we took him to the watch-house.</p>

I was no higher up Oxford-road, than the top of Hog-lane: this man gave no charge of me; the footman was as capable of knowing whether I was the person, as this man was. There is another thing I had forgot; at the time I was taken up the watchmen differed, some wanted to carry me to one watch-house, and some to the other; in the interim a very genteel looking man came up, and said, that in Oxford Road he saw a man come up, and that I was not the man; I have had so little notice, but I believe he is here; they ill used the man, and turned him neck and heels out of the watch-house; the man came in and tendered himself a second time to serve me, and they then detained him, and kept him till the Monday following.</p>

               <p>How was the prisoner dressed? - In a drab-coloured coat and black sattin waistcoat, and a lightish pair of breeches; I never saw him before in my life only then, and now I see him at the bar.</p>
               <p>Court to Clench. You hear what he says, that there was a well dressed man came to the watch-house? - He was in the watch-house when I got there, I saw no such person; after they had taken this man, the watchman came to let my master know, and I went to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Court to David. You was in the watch-house? - Not before the servant went there, but I saw a gentleman in black, he gave them very ill language, and abused the beadles very much; he looked like a tradesman or a gentleman, he made a great noise.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him say any thing like the prisoner's not being the man? - Upon my oath, my Lord, I never heard a word about it.</p>
               <p>Court to Silway. Did you hear that gentleman say any thing about it? - He was asked what he was, and he said he was a painter; he came in with the prisoner, he said, he believed he was not the man: says I, Do you know that man? No, says he, I know nothing about him; then the watch-house keeper and the constable of the night turned him out; then he rushed in again, and they suspected that he belonged to the prisoner; he said the man wore a slouched hat, and he saw him run; he said he was late in a public house, and was just come out; he said he was not a master painter, and lived at lodgings, and worked at piece-work, or such work as he could get.</p>
               <p>Court to Hardcastle. Did you hear this man say any thing? - When we got the prisoner at the top of Hog-lane he came up, and said, What are you doing to the man? I said, If you know any thing of him, come with us and speak in his behalf: when he came there he interfered, and they turned him out: he said he saw a man run before, and he did not believe this was the same man; he came in again, and used the constable ill, and the beadle, and the patrols; he used a deal of bad language, and they detained him.</p>
               <p>Clench. My Lord, this woman has sworn, that she never saw the prisoner before or after till now; whereas when he was brought to Newgate she came in the coach with him and his wife.</p>
               <p>- DIXON sworn.</p>
               <p>I brought the prisoner to Newgate, and his wife and this woman came in the coach with him; I am positive to the woman, and I saw her at the office, and she said, you cannot get Forty by him as you wanted to get by my husband.</p>

Then this is not the man that knocked the bag off of the cart? - I do not know what became of the bag, I did not see it on the ground, it was on the other side of the cart, I saw the man knock it off the cart; they brought the prisoner to the King's-arms Tavern opposite; they gave me the bag, and the constable took it; there is the same mark as was on it; it was directed to one Bailey at High Wycomb (look at the bag); I am sure it was one of the bags on my cart.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When they came into the tavern they asked him how he lost this bag, and he said at first he was hoisting up a hogshead of sugar.</p>

               <p>Court. Was not the carter the most likely person to have enquired of? - To be sure, my Lord.</p>

               <p>Court to Sadler. Who was in the cart at the time that this parcel was thrown down? - One of my fellow-servants, I called to him: all our men have brown jackets.</p>
               <p>How long was it after you saw the man with the brown coat on at the wheel of the cart before you cried out, Stop thief? - It was two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>Then that man had gone clear off? - There were two or three on the other side of the way, they stopped a little while and walked on; I did not see the prisoner.</p>

Here, my cock, says I, take this, so he took it; then directly he demanded my watch, put his hand in my pocket, and pulled it out; he clapped his hand in this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040056"/> pocket, and said, What have you here? says I, it is a pen and ink, that I settle my accounts with; says I, My cock, take this, and mind and cast your accounts up against to-morrow morning; I asked him if he would have it, and he said no, and I said, I wish you a good night; it was a fine moon-shine night, as clear as day-light.</p>
               <p>Court. Were they long enough with you for you to be able to distinguish them exactly? - Yes, Collins had a crape about his face, about his nose, the other had nothing.</p>
               <p>Are you positively sure of the two men? Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Why you say Collins had a crape on his head? - Yes, but just as he was going away from me the crape sell off; I could swear to him if it was only by his speech and person.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed then? - With a light-coloured coat and waistcoat, and a light-coloured great coat over it, with flapped hat.</p>
               <p>He never was nearer to you than the horse? - I sat on the tail of my cart, he came near to me, I could swear to him by his speech and his person; it is hard swearing to people, but he is the man, and the other I will swear to.</p>
               <p>Jury. Pray do you say that the crape fell off his face? - Yes, just as he was drawing round to get upon his horse.</p>
               <p>Now as to the other who had not the crape, you say you have no doubt? - Not the least in the world, he was dressed in rather a light-coloured coat, and one about the same colour underneath it; I did not take particular notice of his hat; they did not stay with me above three minutes, they were in a great hurry to get away.</p>
               <p>Was this in an open road where you had all the benefit of the moon, because the moon does not shine upon some roads that are open? - The moon shone bright.</p>
               <p>Did the moon shine on their faces or on yours? - I was on the side that was the lightest a good deal; the prisoners were taken up last Tuesday was se'nnight, I gave information that same night; if I could have got a horse I would have tried to have taken them myself; I knew them immediately when I saw them again, I fixed on them; there was another with them when they came to be examined.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Collins's counsel. There were three together when you came to examine, and so you took two out of the three? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Nobody else was present? - No.</p>
               <p>What did the people say at the office? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>Did not they give you a little hint? - No, only asked me whether that was not my watch.</p>
               <p>What lane is it? - It is a road that turns up to the Duke of Leeds, and the other turns up to a wood.</p>
               <p>A little lane, ha? - Aye.</p>
               <p>Trees of each side set, is not there? - Aye.</p>
               <p>So it was in that lane you was robbed? - No, I was six or seven yards beyond it, I was in the high road.</p>
               <p>Trees there of each side, is not there? - Yes, little low pollard trees, and they stopped me just against the first pollard.</p>
               <p>Had the man that got off his mare a round hat or a flapped hat? - Mine is a tilted cart, he stood below me, close to me.</p>
               <p>He did not look you up in the face? - Once or twice.</p>
               <p>That was all the time you had an opportunity of seeing his face? - Only just as he was getting on the horse.</p>
               <p>At that time he had a crape? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which had the crape? - This here Collins.</p>
               <p>How high over his mouth? - As far as his nose.</p>
               <p>Then you could only see his chin? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That is the only opportunity you had of observing him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And this not above three minutes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You should be cautious; you see here the whole robbery was not above three minutes, the man might see your face, but you could not see his with a flapped hat and a crape over his eyes and nose? - I could only see his chin.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - In a light cloth coat buttoned, and waistcoat and great coat.</p>
               <p>All light-colours. - Yes.</p>
               <p>Nothing remarkable in the coat? - Like a low country farmer.</p>

               <p>How long have you had it? - I bought it last Monday was a fortnight. I have no witnesses.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Collins. This man Thorpe, came to my house about half an hour before, I asked him to dinner: I had a hackney coach, and I found the pistols tied up in a bundle, and a pair of gloves, and several little things in the coach: this man bought a horse on Friday, at market, and he asked me to let him stand in my stable.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Collins called six witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Thorpe. This other prisoner is entirely innocent of what he is accused of.</p>

               <p>Did Edmonds lodge in the house with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you any acquaintance with the prisoner? - No, Sir, I never saw her till I went there to live; I heard her ask for his clothes, and Mrs. Goodall too; I saw her dressed in in them, it was on Tuesday, the 8th of August.</p>
               <p>Did she dress immediately? - Yes, she staid and had her dinner in the man's clothes, she had a round hat on, and the clothes which are in Court.</p>
               <p>Did you see her go out? - No, Sir, I went out about two o'clock of an errand, when I returned she and Mrs. Goodall was gone.</p>
               <p>What time did you come back? - I believe I was gone about a quarter of an hour, I saw the prisoner on the Friday following, the next morning, and Edmonds asked her for the clothes, I believe it was between eight and nine in the morning, at Mrs. Goodall's house, she was then in woman's clothes.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with her about the wager, or the success of it? - No, Sir, I had no conversation with her, she was too much in a hurry to speak to me.</p>

               <p>Is the hat there?</p>
               <p>Yardley. No, my Lord, I found none but a cocked hat, and I did not bring that.</p>
               <p>Court to Greedy. How came these clothes in your apartments when they were found by Yardley? - They were Edmonds's clothes, and he and I were going to be married, that was the reason that they were found in my apartments.</p>
               <p>Court to Yardley. Did you take the prisoner? Yes, my Lord, I took her about three weeks ago, she acknowledged before the magistrate that she was guilty of the robbery; I took her at a house in Norton Falgate; I had information of some coiners being at work there, and in the house I saw her, and I was informed she was the girl that was concerned in the robbery at Tottenham, and before Mr. Wilmot and Mr. Townsend she acknowledged that she was guilty of the robbery.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040060"/>Court. Was that acknowledgment taken in writing? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Was you present? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the confession fair and free? was nothing said about it? - Justice Wilmot asked her, and said, you may as well tell the truth as you now stand indicted: she said she went to Tottenham in man's clothes, and Mr. Wilmot asked her how the breeches fitted her.</p>
               <p>Court. I ask you, whether the confession she made was a free and fair confession; or whether it was extorted from her by any hope or promise, or any thing of that sort? - No, my Lord, there was no promise at all.</p>
               <p>Was she persuaded to confess by being told that it would be better for her? - They did not tell her it would be better for her, they said it would be no hurt to her.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Fortescue. I think I heard you say on a former trial, that none of these things were ever recovered again? - Part of them were, a piece of silk and a very little plate.</p>
               <p>Do they make any part of this charge? - A snuff box and some things, a man was convicted of receiving them.</p>
               <p>Prisoners counsel. How long was the prisoner under examination before Justice Wilmot. - I cannot say particularly, she had two examinations.</p>
               <p>I am speaking of that examination at which this confession was made? - I believe she was there two hours backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>How long had she been there before this confession was made? - I do not believe she had been there above a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Was it before or after she was ordered out? - I cannot say, I think it was the first time of her going in.</p>
               <p>I wish you would recollect the questions that were put to her before she confessed? - She was asked whether she was not in the robbery, and she had better own it, and that it would be no disservice to her.</p>
               <p>Court. nothing was found on her? - Nothing at all, I searched her.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Chetham. The articles that have been since forthcoming, where were they found? - Not on this prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Then there is nothing that affects this prisoner, but what comes from her own the accomplice.</p>

               <p>Court. If any thing had been found at any pawnbrokers, that had been pawned by the prisoner, or any thing found on her, but at present there is nothing to affect her but her own confession, and we cannot examine the accomplice, till something comes out by some other witness to affect her.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Fortescue. If you wish we should call any other witnesses, to any other point, we will call them.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Fortescue. Will your Lordship please to call

               <p>Court. We cannot examine the accomplice now, because nothing has as yet come out against the prisoner, but by her own confession.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Fortescue. We are not anxious at all about it my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. I dare say not.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. The prisoner being thus examined before the justices, she has confessed the fact, and there is nothing else to affect her but that confession; the evidence of the accomplice cannot be received till something has come out to affect the prisoner from other witnesses, therefore you must acquit her.</p>

               <p>This ought to be a very serious lesson to you for the remainder of your life, for though by the tenderness of the law you have now escaped punishment, yet two people have been executed for the same crime, and two more transported for fourteen years; you have been one of their accomplices, and as deeply concerned in this robbery as any of them, and have been partly the cause of their death and punishment; you have therefore now nothing to do, but to make the best attonement you can, by leading a better life for the future.</p>

I said no; I went to another man that I knew in the same way, he did not want them; Wilson said to me, let that man have them, I spoke to Griffiths, and he came and bought them, and I offered to take them home for a pint of beer: presently the young man came in, and called this man out, and came in afterwards, and said, was not you a drinking with that young man, yes, says I, then this gentleman came and dragged me out of the house, says I, do not pull me, I am no thief; and I went to the Justices.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker, the prisoner at the bar offered to pawn this watch with me on the 4th of November, about half after eight in the evening, I live with Mr. Fleming, opposite the Play-house, in Drury-lane; I asked him if it was his own watch, he said yes; he said he had had it two years, and then two months; then he said it was given him that day, and I stopped him, and carried him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>(The watch produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. How long have you had your watch? - Between eight and nine months, I am a journeyman baker, I know the man that made it, his name is Wilson, the number is 1,267.</p>
               <p>Did you know that before you lost it? - I always look at the number of my watch when I have it first, and commonly set it down; I have lost watches before now, and that makes me careful when I buy a watch to set down the number.</p>
               <p>Was there any paper in it? do you know any body in Saville-row? - No, the last man that cleaned it is a man up by the other side of Red-lion Square.</p>

               <p>Did he tell the maker's name and the number at the Justice's before it was shewn him? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Court to Calderhead. Did not you enquire of the mistress of the house who was near you? - I told her I had lost my watch.</p>

               <p>I am a broker, auctioneer, and appraiser, No. 36, Baldwin's-gardens, Leather-lane, I am a housekeeper; I never knew the prisoner any further than once, I was at Hounslow, and he brought me home in a returned chaise, he was a post-boy; I was coming along by the Sun, between seven and eight, I went in, as a person went in whom I thought I knew, I believe it was of a Monday evening, when I went in I found it was not the man I thought, I might stay there a few minutes, I leaned over the settle, and just spoke to the prisoner, he nodded his head, I saw the man that was with him deliver him a watch; I saw him deliver the watch with a bit of chain or link; I have nothing more to say, than that I saw a man deliver to the prisoner at the bar a watch; I</p>

               <p>Court. How did the prisoner find you out? - The prisoner only knew me by bringing me from Hounslow; he did not know my business, or where I lived, or whether I was a master or servant; I was a servant to a nobleman at the time that he brought me from Hounslow, but a woman enquired at the Queen's Head, in Gray's-inn-lane, and they found me out, and I went to Newgate.</p>
               <p>How long is it since the prisoner was a post-boy? - I have not seen him these twelve months before, it was two years ago, or better, that he drove me; my Lord, I give you a just account, I hope you would not dispute any thing that I say; upon my affidavit I came to Newgate to see whether it was the man I had seen in the box or no dealing for the watch, and I am sure it is.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three other witnesses, who all gave him a very good character.</p>

               <p>Court. Then it is a disorderly house? - I cannot say but what it is; the prisoner Mary Hill, and me, went to this house, into a room, and had some pots of beer; the other two women prisoners were in the room, and two or three men came in, among whom was the prisoner Brown; they were playing and joking, one with another, every one had his own company; I did not like them, and I was going; this young body insisted I should not go that night, and upon the same terms I took off my cloaths and lay in the bed; the others went about one or two o'clock; then the other prisoner

I had five guineas and six or seven shillings in silver, I am sure I had that money going to bed, because I stuffed my neckcloth into my pocket to keep it steady; I directly accused Mary Hill, and the other woman, who were still in bed with me: they denied it bluntly: they made a great noise about it, at last she went to accuse that young boy with it.</p>

               <p>My husband is a taylor, I rent the house in Plow-street, where Pearce and Hurford lodged in a ready furnished room; Hurford came in the name of Barker; I let the room to them as man and wife; I heard somebody come down stairs softly, I thought they went out, that was a little before six, they left the street door open; presently they came in and went up stairs, and left the street-door open; then I heard goods rumbling in the passage, and I jumped out of bed, and Pearce was lighting a man with a large mahogany table; I asked her who the goods belonged to, and who gave him liberty to bring the table there; she said she did: they bid me make myself easy, that they were moving goods for a person in Whitechapel; I said, I was afraid they had been a housebreaking; Hurford came down stairs, and said it was his shop-mate's table, that his wife had threatned to set the house on fire, and he was taking them away because they should not be burnt; he said he knew the man that made it, and he was with him; he turned to Pearce, and said, I will take and carry it into Glass-house yard, then it will be safe.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hurford. What time did I go out? - I believe he must have been out all night, for the door was double locked when my husband went out.</p>
               <p>Court to Overton. When you heard that the door was open, and the things were stole, did you go and look at the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you find any thing broke about it? - Only the window; by breaking this pane, they could put their hand round and unscrew the sash; the sash is a sliding sash, it was open in the morning.</p>
               <p>Could a man go through it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did your clerk sleep there? - Not that night, nor the next night.</p>

               <p>I went out about five in the morning, and I saw these two tables laying in the field, and I took them home, and I met this man, and begged him to take one, while I went and fetched the other.</p>

               <p>I was going along the street to Mr. Wilson's yard, the King's wheeler; I met this man in the street, he asked me to carry a large table to Plow-street, and put it down under the lamp, and he would give me 6 d. I put it down there, and saw no more of it.</p>

               <p>Was it in the spring of the year? - It is about eight or nine months ago, I could tell by the death of my child if I was at home.</p>
               <p>Have you forgot when your child died? - I have the receipt at home, but I cannot tell the time; one has been dead six months, and one nine; to the best of my knowledge I saw her between five and six, she asked me where the Jew was; I said I could not tell, I did not expect he would be there till the following morning; she said, he owed her some money; presently this Harry the Slabberer came in.</p>

               <p>When did you see her again? - I never saw her again till I was taken up, and carried before my Lord Mayor, because I would not tell where the Jew was; I know no more, but that one of the Jews was taken up, and the other is out of the way; this Harry the slabberer, he has never been at home in his own place since.</p>
               <p>Court. You said something about two pots? - When she first came in the shop, she said she was taken up for two pots.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Mrs. Wells. Did not I ask you when I came in, says I, do you buy old silver, no, says you, but I will fetch a man that will; she knows it was an old bruised quart pot that I had, I had a guinea and a half for it; and please you my Lord, it had been my great grandmother's, for ought I know; I am as innocent as the child in my womb now, of robbing that gentlewoman; to be sure I have been to blame about the cloak: there was a young man laid over head, I sancied it was my young mistress's sweetheart; another woman lived in the next room; I came into the tap, and I did something in the tap, and my mistress saw me; I have two children at home, I thought I will not stay, I will go home; as for that cloak, I bought it for four shillings and six-pence out of pawn, in Monmouth-street, that was the first day I put it on: to be sure, when my mistress said, it is better to confess, well says I, it is your cloak; she took me to the three Tuns in Fleet-street, the people there said, they could not swear to me; my mistress sent me word yesterday, telling me, not to be uneasy, for she would never appear against me.</p>
               <p>Jury to prosecutrix. Did a young man sleep in your house? - Yes my Lord, he has lodged with me a year and better, he lodges with me now; and the woman that she mentions has lodged with me ten years, next Christmas.</p>
               <p>Court. Were any of these people in the house that night? - They were all in the house, they got up; I went myself, and fetched the young man out of bed, and got him to go to the Justice's; my daughter is very young, and has no sweet heart.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. You are pretty sure of that; you did.</p>
               <p>Dixon. Well, I believe I might, I dare say I did: in his right hand breeches pocket, I took these sixteen pieces of base metal; I then searched near the forge, and Blacketer said, here is something here, but I cannot get it out; here is a piece of rag, so I put my fingers in, my fingers being longer than his, and I pulled out these sixteen pieces of pewter, which are for patterns; the coiners generally work with silver patterns, but these are pewter; I searched further, and Grubb, I believe it was, said, Dickson here is a hole in the wall behind Cope, he looks very earnestly at it, I wish you would look into that; then I looked there, and I found eleven six-pences which are finished; and in the same hole, under some little rubbish, I found this milling tool, which is a milling tool for half crowns: I never opened the flask till I came to the Rotation Office, it was hot when I took it, I opened it there, there appeared to be ten six-pences which were run; the top of the flask was hot, (the flask opened) there is a pattern for sixteen in the flask, but the metal run short, there was only metal enough for ten: the sixteen pewter patterns, answer to every six-pence except the finished ones, which have been crooked afterwards: we found aqua fortis, scouring paper, files, sand paper, sand and facings, and every thing that is used in this business; I do not see any thing deficient: here is arsenick, and every thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What dress was I in? - The prisoner was dressed but meanly, not so well as he is now, he had an apron on, and his hands were dirty, he had his coat on.</p>
               <p>What coat? - I believe it was a black one.</p>
               <p>One or two? - I believe one, but I cannot be particular.</p>
               <p>Was you at the Rose, in Rose-lane, playing at a little table where the marbles roll down, when you sent to Harris's house, to bring me down on this false accusation? - No.</p>
               <p>So you do not know what dress I was in, when you came in at the window? - I think you had black clothes on.</p>
               <p>It is astonishing to me, that a man should come here on his affidavit, and cannot tell what cloaths I had on, had I any cloaths on? - Yes Sir.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. How do you know it was silver that was melting? - I do not suppose it was, I suppose it was metal; I burned my fingers with it, I felt it for a day or two; the flask when they run the metal in, was hot at the mouth; I held Cope, while Dickson searched him; he pulled out of his breeches pocket, some of the spray, I think sixteen; Dickson and I looked round, and found all the things that are here; Dickson as he brought them out, shewed them to Cope.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How did you examine these things to find they were hot? Did you examine them at all? - Yes, for I burnt my hand most terribly.</p>
               <p>Where was the crucible? - It lay down by the side of the forge.</p>
               <p>Where was the flask? - Just by the side of the anvil.</p>
               <p>Do you know what the anvil and the forge is? - Yes, there is a difference; they were close by one another; the first thing I examined was the crucible and the flask.</p>
               <p>Did you examine what was in the flask that you say now was hot? - They were not opened till we came to the office; I am sure they were warm when they came to the office.</p>

My Lord, I have a number of witnesses to call, and I can prove every matter they have set forth against me to be quite the reverse; as to what they have brought there, it is a dead fix upon me; there is a wicked designing man that is concerned with this Mr. Dixon, and has been some time; he has been convicted several times for his life, he has been transported to America for seven years, he returned, he was taken up again, and was tried for the robbery of - I believe I can tell your Lordship in a very short time - for robbing the house of one - Haden, Esq; he got his Majesty's pardon for that, on condition of going on board the lighter.</p>

               <p>Court. Who are you speaking of?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am speaking of one Harris, who gave the information.</p>
               <p>Court. Circumstances concerning any body that has not given evidence on this trial, are totally irrelevant to the purpose; you will not be admitted to prove these facts about a man that is not here; as to the witnesses that have sworn to positive facts, if you have any thing to say to attack their credit, you may produce any witnesses to that purpose.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The men that have given evidence against me, are a set of men that live entirely by rewards; I have witnesses here, by which I do not doubt but I can prove every thing contrary to what they have said; this is the most treacherous affair that ever was in the world.</p>

               <p>All I have to say is this, on the 12th of November I called on Mr. Harris, who was the man that lived in the house where this Mr. Cope was taken; I called to know whether Cope was taken, and Harris told me very freely that he was taken at his house, and that it was the greatest wonder in the world that he was not taken himself; that he had been a casting, and had put the pot on the fire, and stepped out for some sandpaper, and returning, his window being as usual open, he saw four or five men in the house, and heard his wife and the children crying, with that he stepped back into an alley.</p>
               <p>Court. This is nothing to the purpose, what this man said, have you an thing to say respecting the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Searles. No my Lord, no further than I know Harris to be in that way for some time; I never saw the prisoner at the bar before to day, I know nothing of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I should be glad my Lord, if you will look over this matter of defence, it is absolutely the truth, and nothing else but the truth, (handing up a paper) I am rather disappointed in not having my witnesses here; but if I must lose my life, I must lose it; it is the most wretched thing that ever was known; I am as innocent as one of these sprigs of rue.</p>
               <p>Court. I will read this paper to the jury if you chuse it, but you had better read it yourself.</p>
               <p>The PRISONER read his DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am a Gun-maker in Goodman's-yard, Minories; having an order, I applied to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040083"/> Harris to get some things done, which he promised, if I would bring him a pattern; I went to him in a day or two after, and informed him I could not get the pattern, and I gave him the best instructions I could; he promised to get them done, but did not do them: on the 9th of November, Harris came to my house, and told me he had a gun to repair, and would be glad if I would call at his shop in Rose-lane; I promised to call in a day or two, but in the afternoon Harris came again, and begged me to come as soon as possible that evening, as the person that the gun belonged to was in a particular hurry; that was this set of gentlemen that were waiting: Harris, when he came to my house, observing a gun rammer that my wife was stirring the fire with, he told me he had an old poker at home he would bit for me, and hoped I would not fail coming that evening: having some business in Spital-fields market, I went to Harris's, the door was bolted, they let me in; he said Mr. Cope, I am glad you are come, step this way into the shop, I went immediately, and began blowing the fire; and he laid hold of a poker, and said, this is what I intend for you; blow the fire, and I will step and fetch the gun; and he went out and locked the front door; and as I was blowing the fire, I saw something in the fire, and I put the poker in and stirred it, to see what it was, and finding it a pot, I took it out, and took a pair of bellows and blew the ashes out to see what was in it, finding nothing in it, I threw it out of the fire on the anvil; and then these men came in at the window, with pistols, and said they were come to look for dubs: I do not know what dubs are: they asked for the master of the shop, I said he was stepped out; they looked round the shop, and said, there is something else going forwards, and they searched, and found the things concealed; and now old gentleman they said, we must search you, and they searched me, and found nothing but a farthing about me; I had not been in the shop above two minutes: these fellows did not care who it was they took hold of. This Harris was a deserter; he as been tried twice, and sent to America, he came back again, and robbed a gentleman's house, and was convicted, and sent to the lighters, he received his Majesty's pardon, and entered into Lord Harrington's regiment; and has at different times received rewards from the thief takers: here is Dixon himself, to my certain knowledge, but a few days before, when this Harris was taken up for desertion, he cleared him himself, on consideration he should get him any man that would weigh forty. This is the most wicked thing that ever was done in the world, and if I die for it, I shall not give myself any concern; I am as innocent of it as the child unborn. I had a question or two my Lord which I have omitted.</p>
               <p>Court. By all means, any question that you wish to put.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Dixon. Where did you find the sixteen patterns? - In a hole under the anvil, the anvil stands on the half of an old coach wheel, and they were in the hole of the spokes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If I was to die, and to be hanged in the yard this minute, I know nothing of the affair any more than the child unborn.</p>

               <p>It is usual for us apprentices to go home every Saturday night; three or four Sundays before when I was shifting myself, I found some vermin, and I thought it must come from the bed, as we have not had a clean pair of sheets since last July; I was determined to look at the sheets and blankets, I did, and found some vermin on them; I was going to carry the blanket to the scowerers, because if I had asked my master, he would not have had it cleaned: my master stopped me at the bottom of the stairs, I was going into the privy to ease myself; I laid down the blanket, and they sent for an officer, and sent me to the Compter: my friends were here yesterday.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner come in about a quarter after six, it is a house of call for wine-porters; he came and warmed himself, and looked round and went out; he came in again in two minutes with a young woman, and called for a pint of beer, he staid a quarter of an hour, I saw him put his hand down, I did not think of the countryman's bundle, I thought he was taking one of the publican's pots; then presently he got up, and looked round the room, and went out half bent backwards, with his hand behind him; I saw a blue and white checked handkerchief, with a bundle in his hand; I called to one of my fellow-servants to go after him, he did not go immediately, he brought him back to the house, he denied it.</p>

               <p>I went in there; I had a pair of new shoes with me, under my jacket: why did this man let me go out with the bundle, if he knew it to be the countryman's? I am a native of Philadelphia; I went out of this town in the Resolution, I was taken and brought into Rochelle; I have been eleven months in prison there: I have a wound in my leg, I intend to get into St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and then go to sea.</p>

               <p>There was found on the prisoner, a pound of tobacco, a pair of woman's new shoes, and a brass weight.</p>

               <p>The prisoner was in my front shop on the 20th or 21st of November last, about half past one; she asked for some ribbon, and my man having told me she had taken something, I took her by the hand, and told her to go with me; then she dropped one card of edging, I saw her drop it from under her cloak; going a little further, she dropped another card; after that I got her into the back shop, and told her I should send for a constable immediately, and I sent for one; mean while she dropped two pieces of ribbon in the back shop, that were not there before; then I took her up stairs to be searched, and going up, I saw her drop another piece of ribbon.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury, Gentlemen, the evidence does not amount to stealing privately, because the shopman saw the prisoner take two cards of edging, and in order to constitute stealing privately, no person must see the property taken.</p>

            ) were going to breakfast, and I told them how I had been used; they said they were very sorry, they would see if they could hear any thing of them; he said it was better to send for one of the runners at Justice Walker's; by the time he had applied to them the prisoners were taken: I saw them again the afternoon of the next day, I knew Margaret Hall very well, I said the same then I say now; the gold coins and some of the gold rings, and about 20 l. in money, was produced, the Bank note was not produced.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did you spend the afternoon before this? - I came up by the coach, I got down at the White Horse-cellar in Piccadilly, I was very much benumbed with cold, I drank several glasses of rum on the road to keep out the cold, then I went and had a pint of beer, and read the newspaper, then I had another.</p>
               <p>Were you not very much in liquor? - Yes, or else I should not have done so, especially if I thought of my property, I never once thought of my property.</p>
               <p>Now after this, you went with this woman to the public house, and drank more there, so that when you went to Dyot-street I suppose you was so much in liquor as not to know what happened to you? - I was rather too much in liquor, or else I should have had more prudence.</p>
               <p>Can you speak particularly to taking out the box, and giving the half guinea? - I remember that exceedingly well.</p>
               <p>Did you know either of these young women at the time? - I never knew them before.</p>
               <p>Did you take notice of them so as to know them again, as you was so much in liquor? - That young woman I know exceedingly well.</p>
               <p>Can you undertake to swear positive? - I can, indeed, I said all along that I could swear to that young woman, there were two in the room, and one up and down stairs fetching the liquor, that young woman was one of them; I believe one young woman sat down on, or got into the bed.</p>
               <p>Was that the tall young woman or not? - I cannot swear positively.</p>
               <p>Then how can you swear positively that the tall young woman was in the room at all? - Oh yes, Sir! I remember her being in the room with me.</p>
               <p>Was she in the room when you went to bed? - I believe she was.</p>

               <p>But you are not sure of that? - I cannot swear positively to that, she was in the room, and was drinking at the public house, and I am sure she and I agreed to go to bed together.</p>
               <p>How long had you been in the room before you pulled out these boxes? - I imagine some time, they were continually asking for more and more to drink, and I found I had no more silver, and I took half a guinea out of the box; I am sure she was with me in the room.</p>
               <p>Can you swear with certainty to her being there any time after you went into the room? - I think, to the best of my knowledge, she was in the room all the time, but I cannot swear for certain.</p>

               <p>Court. The other young woman you say staid all night? - As far as I know, I did suppose her to be there all night; I did not hear any thing of her being gone at all; we do not suffer two girls to sleep with one man; it was the prosecutor's desire that the little one should sleep with him, he told me so: and so I told Hall not to stay; she only came in as an interloper herself, only to drink.</p>
               <p>Did not they all come in together? - Yes, the prosecutor and Sarah was together; and Sarah was to stay with him, as she told me; and Margaret Hall told me she was to have something to drink; she came with them.</p>

               <p>I am a silver-smith, and keep a sale shop in High-street, St. Giles's; I know the prisoners at the bar, they both came to me on Tuesday morning last, between nine and eleven; they pointed to two pair of silver buckles that hung in my window; they agreed to give me 2 l. 16 s. for them; they were all silver, tongues, chapes and all; going to pay for them, they pulled out some foreign coins, which I have in my pocket; they gave me the silver ones, and said, if it was not enough they would make it good; I weighed them, and they afterwards gave me the gold; and I said, with a view to see if they had any more, that they were worth 4 l. (though they were worth 10 l.) they swore an oath, and said, it was very lucky for them, that they had got money coming to them; then I asked them how they came by them, they said they found them between my house, and the church; I told them I must have a more explicit answer than that, or I would stop them; I sent for a constable, and they were taken into custody; we searched them in the shop, and upon them we found about 20 l. or upwards; there was a box found on the shortest, and nine guineas and a half and two shillings on one, I do not recollect which; and 11 l. odd on the other; they rather baffled me at that time, one of them told me a different name than that which she is indicted by now: I am sure to both the prisoners; I received the coins from the tallest, she had the same cloak on she has now, only it was turned lining outwards. (The coins handed up to the court.)</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Can you describe any of the things that you lost? - Yes, I can swear to the coins; the buttons are my own engraving; I am a clock and watch-maker, and silver smith and engraver.</p>
               <p>What are the letters on the buttons? - I cannot say exact, they are not done by me, there is T. H. on them I believe.</p>
               <p>Court. Tell me some of the coins. - There is a Hanoverian coin, silver with a horse upon it; there is a gold coin, a very remarkable coin of Charles in armour; there is a Venice coin; there is a Hungarian coin; there are several of King John's coin; that gold coin is virgin gold, it will bend under your fingers like lead; it is a great deal better gold than our guineas: there are some of King John's pennys; there is a seven and twenty, without any particular mark; I brought them up to sell.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at these coins. - (Looking at them.) I am sure they are mine, if I was to die this minute.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen the coins are very remarkable.</p>

               <p>Court. Were these two prisoners among them? - They were, my Lord, the prisoners were among the first people that came in; Wood put a pistol to my head, and Fitzgerald a knife to my belly, and swore they would murder me.</p>
               <p>What were they confined for? - They were vagrants; somebody gave me a violent blow on my face, and as I stood in that position, some of the prisoners cried out, Frisk him for the keys! that is, meaning to feel in my pockets; and they cried, Why don't you murder him? then Wood put his hand into my right-hand pocket, and there he took out a shilling and two sixpences, and out of my left-hand breeches pocket he took the key of the main gate; then they went from the lodge, and went out, and one and thirty of them made their escape.</p>
               <p>Did they secure you any way? - I was close up in the corner standing.</p>
               <p>But when they took the key from you, did they tie you, or any thing of that sort? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. When were they taken again? - Wood was out a week or more; Fitzgerald was taken immediately, within a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>When they held the pistol and knife to you, did they ask you for any money, or any thing? - No my Lord, they took the key out of my pocket.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I belong to the Rotation Office in Litchfield-street; on the 25th of October last I went to one Bulger's house, in Nag's-head-court, Fish-street, or Gracechurch-street, Macdonald and Blacketer went with us; we left Grubb at the house in Goose-alley, while we went to this other house to get the stamping press; we saw Connor sitting by the fire in the parlour, with his coat off, and his hands very dirty, greasy, and black; I immediately tied his hands, and ordered Blacketer to secure him while I lighted a candle and went into the cellar; Macdonald opened the door, the shutters were put before the top door that comes into the passage; I broke the top cellar door open, and went below, and there was another door, and Macdonald opened that other door; we went into the cellar, and saw the two women prisoners sit by the stamping press, they were just pulling the fly round, and on seeing us did not pull it up sufficient: this farthing I took from between the dies, but they did not pull it sufficient to make so good an impression as they have on the other, it is rather faint; this blank I took out of Ellis's hand; I took these dies out of the press, they were fixed, and that farthing between them; there were a great quantity of finished halfpence, except the blacking of them: we then secured the women, and I sent Macdonald and Blacketer with them to the office: two candles were lighted by the side of the press; the door into the street was padlocked on the outside, and the parlour shutters being put before the cellar door, some body must have come out of the cellar to have done it; and when we went down the cellar stairs, there was another door which was locked outside likewise, and the key in the door; we took them into custody; the women were without their gowns: Conner pretended to be asleep after he saw us go in.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Counsel. There was a press you say in this cellar, and the two women at work? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Both at the same press? - Certainly, one could not very well work at a press, nor two with any great deal of propriety, it generally takes three.</p>
               <p>However, Conner the man was asleep in the parlour? - No, I do not think he was in sleep.</p>
               <p>He appeared to be so? - He made believe to be so.</p>
               <p>You cannot tell that he made believe.</p>
               <p>Court. What did his hands appear to be dirty with? - In the situation these peoples hands are, he had his coat on.</p>

               <p>I went with Dixon; I saw the prisoner Conner, he had his coat off, and leaned back at the fire side; his hands were dirty, as if he had been at work; they were all black like the womens hands that were below; I searched him, and found this letter on him, directed to

             in Goose-alley, where the cutting out press was; and this key, that Hamilton swore was his key; I went into the cellar; the prisoner Ellis was feeding the die, pushing in the farthing between<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040103"/> the die, and the other woman sat where they pull it from; she was pulling the fly: they jumped up directly, I told them not to stir: the two women were without their gowns.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it dark when you got into the cellar? - They had candles burning, but Dixon went for two candles more.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Counsel. How did you get into the house? - I lifted up the latch and went in; we found the press and the dies below; the women asked us to let them put on their cloaths, their hands were all black: I tried the key which I found on the prisoner Conner, to the door at Hamilton's house, in Goose-alley; it locked and unlocked both the two pair of stairs, and the garret.</p>
               <p>- HAMILTON sworn.</p>
               <p>I know the prisoner Conner, he had two rooms at my house in Goose-alley, at 10 l. a year; I saw the cutting out press, the day it was taken, it was in one of the rooms (in the garret) he took of me.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Counsel. Do you know whether the prisoner Dunn was married to Conner? - Their connection together was as man and wife, whether they were married or not, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. It is too late now I believe to make that objection, for she has pleaded as

               <p>I went to a house in Thames-street, opposite Vintner's Hall; it was the 28th of October, past eleven; my brother and a little boy went with me, I found the prisoners there: we looked into the cellar, and they were at work, but they put out the candles immediately: the cellar was hung round with cloth, except the back part, which was bare; one of the candles, the wick was not out when we got down; I saw the press and a parcel of halfpence just coined off, and the dies set, and this halfpenny between the dies: in the cellar I saw Harrison, Sharkey, and Cherry, the other woman came to open the door: Cherry endeavoured to come up, and I kept them down; I found these halfpence, and these blanks,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040104"/> there was the press with the dies fixed in; the dies were warm, which is owing to the weight of the instrument, and the perpetual whirling; Sharkey said he was a watchmaker, and trade was dead; Cherry said the same, and that poverty induced him to do it; Harrison said she had not been at work, but the blanks were in the cellar, in her apron; Floyd said she was only a servant; there were no other persons in the house.</p>

               <p>One half of the flask had the pattern shillings on it, which he scraped off with his hands on the table.</p>
               <p>How many were there on it? - I cannot say positively.</p>
               <p>Were they laid on it, or impressed into it? - I apprehend them to be impressed into it, they were dented in; most of these that were not thrown out have impressions on them, either on the one side or the other.</p>
               <p>You cannot say that there was any impressions made on that sand? - I only say that the shilling was pressed into the sand, I cannot say what was imprinted on that sand.</p>

I wish you to explain to me a little more the situation. - The two windows are close together, one happened to be open, which was the window of the first garret, so that my head was close to them; the windows are parallel, the wooden partition did not at all take from the sight, the partition was so thin that my head reached beyond the partition; I was looking through that partition while my brother was breaking the door.</p>

               <p>Court. You have been employed about fifteen years for the Mint, be so kind to explain to us the process that these people use in coining of silver. - This spray is laid into the other, and by the side of this they fix any thing that is to be cast, and they are sometimes laid double, and that is filled full of sand, and crushed down, and that makes the impression; then they throw it to the other side; then there is what they call<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040106"/> facings, which is of a stronger nature, as the sand is of a porous nature: they make a little channel from each, (that is it) and they run it the same as I would dumps: if it was filled full of sand, I call it a flask or mould ready for casting, they are flasks till they are compleat to make the impression, then they are called moulds: (some shillings shewn to him.) these have been cast in sand, and filed round with scouring paper, and then they put them into aqua fortis: this is aqua fortis and water, which they are first put in: the aqua fortis being a strong body, it purges the silver on the outside, and leaves a stain; there has been metal put into this aqua fortis and water: here is sand, patterns, flask, aqua fortis, scouring paper, every thing is as compleat as can be; it only wants a fire to melt the metal: I did see a lump of metal in one of the pots that has been melted, here it is, this is silver and copper; there is a piece of white arsenic, this is a poison, and it has been proved in this court, that when they melt the copper, it is fluxed by this, then they throw it into water, and then it becomes almost like a tutenage.</p>

The clerks had not the least suspicion that there could be any fraud in this man; he had been vouched for by one of the other clerks, and he got the money. Finding he got the dividend so easily; on the 11th of May he sold out 50 l. then he saw that in May there was 400 l. placed to his account; and on the 17th of May he sold out the 350 l. so that this man, knowing in the month of April, that he was entitled only to 200 l. in the month of May, comes and transfers all his right and property in the sum of 400 l. without the bank having the least suspicion of any fraud in this transaction. Some time after this, the first Mr. Smith came to receive his dividend of 200 l. When he came to the bank, why, says the clerk you have no money, you have not a farthing here; no says he, why I had 600 l. and I sold out 200 l. and then I sold out 200 l. more, and I have 200 l. left; no Sir says the clerk, the money was sold out such a day; if that is the case says he, then somebody must have personated me: now gentlemen, this being represented to the governors of the bank, who are the guardians of our property, they thought their duty required, that this man should be immediately taken into custody, because, if we trust our money in their hands, they ought to protect our property; to them we look for that money we intrust them with; to them Mr. Smith looks for his 200 l.

The case as you have opened it (and I attended very particularly to your opening) amounts clearly to this, that the clerks of the Bank made a mistake, and that mistake enabled them to offer this man more than belonged to him, and he dishonestly took more than belonged to him; but he, from the circumstances of the case, never personated any man: yet I think the Governors of the Bank have done perfectly right, as the Guardians of the property of the proprietors of Bank stock, every imposition<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040108"/> upon them they certainly ought to prevent.</p>

               <p>At the last September Sessions you was indicted, for that you feloniously did falsely make, forge and counterfeit, a certain order for payment of money, purporting to be an order for 10 l. 10 s. 0 d. directed to Drummond and Co. Charing Cross, by the name of Messrs. Drummond, Charing Cross, by which Messrs. Drummond and Co. were required to pay the bearer the said sum, and which said order was as follows:</p>
               <p>"Messrs. Drummond, Charing Cross,</p>
               <p>"25th August, 1782.</p>
               <p>"Please to pay the bearer, or order, on</p>
               <p>"demand, the sum of 10 l. 10 s. 0 d. and</p>

            : there were three other Counts all laid in the same way; the next for feloniously uttering the same, on the same day and year, well knowing the same to be forged with the like intention; the next, for forging it with intention to defraud the Drummonds; and the last for uttering it, well knowing it to be forged, with intention to defraud them. Upon the trial the forgery was fully proved to have been committed by you, and the Jury found you Guilty. A motion was afterwards made on Arrest of Judgment on this ground, that the indictment charged the note to be drawn on Drummond and Co. by the name of Messrs. Drummond, Charing Cross, whereas the names of the respective partners ought to have been mentioned. The judgment was accordingly arrested till the opinion of the rest of the Judges could be taken. The Twelve Judges have since met together, and have considered this case, and they are of opinion that the question must turn on the operation of the words, Messrs. Drummond and Co. Charing Cross; if the words and Co. are to be deemed words of surplusage, in which light they may well be considered, as Mr. Drummond, Charing Cross, would have been considered sufficiently explanatory without the words and Co. they will then certainly not vitiate the indictment: if, on the other hand, they cannot be rejected as words of surplusage, and being taken all together, they are insensible words, composing an unintelligible description, the indictment will certainly be bad: if, in truth, that is not the case, such a description is intelligible, and conveys a notification of the party intended to be defrauded; if it do, it is not necessary to state in the indictment with more particularity the party meant; for if any person is intended, it is sufficient, and who that party is, is matter of reference to be left to the Jury; nor is any greater certainty necessary in indictments, than that the party indicted is to know against whom he is to defend himself. - Therefore on all these grounds the Judges are unanimously of opinion, that the indictment is good, and of course that the judgment ought not to be arrested. We have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040045"/> taken this earliest opportunity to inform you of it, that you may prepare yourself to receive the sentence of the law, which will be passed on you at the close of this Sessions.</p>

               <p>You was at a former Sessions indicted, and found guilty of stealing a quantity of goods, of the value of 80 l. You was porter to the prosecutor who delivered to you a parcel, containing the goods mentioned in the indictment, to carry to a customer; in your way you was met by two men, who prevailed on you to go to a public house, where they persuaded you to dispose of the goods, to which you consented: you received eight guineas of the money, the goods were taken out of the package in which they were delivered to you, and put into a bag at the public house. The question reserved for the opinion of the Judges was, Whether these facts amounted to a felonious taking in you? and they are all clearly of opinion that you, standing in the relation of a servant, the possession of the goods must be considered as remaining in your master till the actual taking of them; he was to receive the money for them from the customer, and he could at any time have countermanded the delivery of them. Cases of this kind have frequently occurred, and they are of opinion that this is to be considered a Felony, and of course that your conviction was proper.</p>
