I live at 53, Charlotte Street, Portland Place—on the evening of April 9th I was in Mr. Buse's shop about 6.30; the prisoner came in and asked Mrs. Buse for a tin of sardines and gave her a florin; she passed it to Mr. Buse at once—the prisoner said that he would take it back—Mr. Buse told me to follow him, and a little boy followed him with me—he met two women and a man in the street, standing still and quarrelling—he went up to them, and then went on to Mr. Weaver's shop—I went in and spoke to Mr. Weaver and heard him tell the prisoner that the coin was bad—he went out and I followed him with Leader into Charlotte Street, where he asked me why I was following him, and I asked him if he had not been in Weaver's shop; he said, "No," and went into Duke Street, when he put his hand up as if to strike me—I followed him to Langham Street and spoke to a policeman and then the prisoner tried to run away and then he called to the policeman—I had kept him insight all the time—when I came out of Weaver's shop I called him a money forger—he said nothing to that.</p>

Kilburn—on the afternoon of April 6th I went out on an errand—I went home with the prisoner, and when we got indoors he asked me what woman I had been speaking to—I told him that she was a woman who had been knocked about by her husband because the prisoner had been speaking to another woman, and because I mentioned the woman's name the prisoner began hitting me, and knocked me down unconscious—I remember no more until a policeman and my brother had put me on the bed—I was sitting on the bed when the prisoner <hi rend="italic">came for me</hi> again, and got me by my throat in the policeman's presence—he put his hands round my throat, and they had a struggle to get him away from me—he was taken into custody—he said he would have done for me if the policeman had been a few minutes later—we went to the station, and he was charged—we have been married for twelve years.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not notice whether he was sober—I never saw him intoxicated, and I have been there nineteen months—it was Balls' duty to harness the horses—the prisoner had a wound over his right eye and another below, and one on his nose, as if done by a pitchfork—there are pitchforks in the stable—I saw a cigar in the prisoner's left hand, but I did not see a knife in his right—I did not hear them quarrelling—the stable is divided into stalls—I had my child in my arms—I was about a yard and a half from Balls when it happened, but did not see how it happened—the prisoner did not say. "Take that"—no words passed he did not say to me, "I have a good mind to stick it into you."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a horse keeper on the Raythorne cab rank—the cabmen do not each have a set of harness of their own; the harness and cab go together, not the harness and man—on this day the bell rang for a cab, and the prisoner was out with it, and came back with it about an hour afterwards, at 10.30, and objected to the harness—I sent him out again—he came back between 3.30 and 4 o'clock and said, "Peter, let me have my right set of harness"—I said, "You can either have it or leave it"—he said, "I will do for you, you old b----before the day is out"—in the afternoon the quarrel began again, and we had a fight—he struck me and I struck him—I did not take up a pitchfork—I struck him once or twice with my fist and he fell under the manger, and then walked out and went away—I was hanging up a collar, and did not see him coming, and he said, "There you are, you old b----" and stabbed me—that was half an hour after the fight—I was five weeks in the hospital—I am very weak, and I shall feel it as long as I live.</p>

Gregory"—In consequence I went to the house—I saw Gregory there—I told him I had come to take the measurements, which I did, for curtains and poles, blinds and fittings—I asked him if he had an account with us—he said he had not, so I asked him if he would pay on delivery, or give references—he said he would give references, and referred to Messrs. Halse and Hartley—I went there, and was referred to Mr. Newman—on the 19th the goods he had ordered were supplied, amounting to £21 19s. 8d.—Gregory came to our shop on February 20th, and selected about £124 worth of goods, which were not supplied.</p>

Pontings'—on February 16th I heard of the order of Gregory and the reference, and wrote to Mr. Newman, who replied stating that he did not give information as to the financial position of clients—the goods were sent without my sanction—Gregory called on the 20th, and I showed him the letter from Newman, and said it was practically speaking not a reference—I asked him if he would give further references or a deposit, and he said if I made further application to Newman no doubt he would give a reference—after he had gone away I made inquiry at various departments, and found he had given a lot of orders, so I made inquiries—I went to the house agent and local tradesmen—I went back and consulted my directors, and was instructed to see Gregory—I did so, and asked him to give me a deposit—he refused—he told me he always paid about the 29th of each month—he also told me his property was entirely under Newman's manage<lb/>ment; that he, Newman, received the rents of his property in Wales, and when he wanted money he sent his man Freeland to Newman to get it—I asked him for a banker's reference—he said he had no banking account, Newman had the entire management of his financial affairs—the second lot of goods was not supplied.</p>

P.S.—Please let my man have the three bottles of Hock."—I let the man have the Hock—before delivering the whisky I went to Queen Anne's Grove and saw Gregory—I told him it was usual to have references before delivering goods—he gave the name of his solicitors, Newman and Lees, 66, Quicks-road, Wimbledon—I questioned him as to payment, and he said he paid at the end of the month—he then gave me an order for three bottles of brandy, which I supplied—the same afternoon I received some information, and went to Queen Anne's Grove and saw Freeland and Hil<lb/>ditch there—I had a chat with Freeland—I told him I had heard certain things, and had come round to see if I could get a settlement—he said it was a peculiarity of his governor placing orders with different trades<lb/>men; if I came down in the morning he was almost sure Gregory would settle the account—I went next morning, and saw Gregory, who said he could not trouble about our account just then: we need have no fear about it, as he had got plenty of property; if he wanted £200 he could get a draft from his solicitors, and that he could not trouble about settling these <hi rend="italic">tup' penny ha'penny</hi> accounts just then—I have never been paid.</p>

Lees; he was the man who knew most about the business—I told Gregory that I was not satisfied with what I had heard, and said as far as I knew he might be a member of a long firm, and that I would not execute the order—he was very indignant said said, "A gentleman should not be addressed in that manner"—I went to Quicks Road, but saw no one, and then wrote a letter, and received a reply signed "Charles William Lees," expressing great surprise at my calling and saving that he would call on</p>

                  </hi>. I am a colour-type printer at Wortley, near Leeds—I received this letter of November 20th, 1902, from Mr. Hill, of Bear Town, near Huddersfield, whom I did not know, offering employment for thirteen weeks at £1 a week, and 5s. expenses, by the Parker Pen Company, on forwarding 10s. 6d. for one of their fountain pens—it enclosed a four-page circular, like this, with the form of letter to be written to ten persons every day, when the signed agreement would be sent, appointing me the Company's agent on the same terms—half of the circular was to be retained—I read it aid noticed the illustrations at the head of it of the American and London offices of the Parker Pen Company—I also read another document referring to the lucky curve fountain pen—I filled in the applica<lb/>tion</p>

               <p>form on page 2 of the circular, signed it and got it witnessed on November 21st—I returned that and half of the circular to the Company, and a remittance for 10s. 6d.—I was in employment—I had no special use for the pen—I received it, and the signed agreement dated November 25th—it was signed by the Company and witnessed by R. Travis—the pen was satisfactory, and I believed it was genuine business, and that I should receive £1 a week and 5s. expenses on fulfilling the agreement at the end of the first week, which stated "The said remuneration to commence one week from the date of the posting of the first batch of ten letters, and to become due and payable at the end of each week thereafter"—I wrote and posted my ten letters a day, stamping them, and sent in a post card each day to the Parker Pen Company as required by the agreement, and carried out its terms—about December 9th I wrote to the Company for my remuneration—I received this letter of December 10th, stating that my salary became payable at the end of the second week, but as my post cards had come in regularly, and there had been some orders from my work, they enclosed the cheque for 5s.—the letter is type-written or printed, and the cheques printed were like these produced—I wrote on December 11th for my second week's pay, and for more circulars—I got no reply—I wrote again, and on December 16th I wrote, "I cannot understand why you do not reply to my repeated applications for remuneration and expenses for the second week"—I had carefully fulfilled the terms of the agreement—on December 21st I got a circular stating that the Company were going to pay <hi rend="italic">Pro rata</hi> £1 a week for six pens sold, and on December 22nd another fortnight's supply of circulars—I never got any remuneration, only the 5s.—I did not continue writing ten letters a day after I got my second batch of circulars—I received a post card stating that the Company were suspending business during the Christmas week, and that my work was to be resumed on December 31st—I wrote this letter of January 1st, that unless my remuneration and expenses were received up to the second week by return, I should put the matter in the County Court without further delay—I received the reply that no orders had been received from my work, and stating, "In accordance with the terms of the agreement the remuneration does not commence at the end of the first week, but becomes payable at the end of the second week's work"—that looks as if it were type-written—I replied on January 5th that my letters had been posted regularly and the conditions of the agreement faithfully carried out, that I was entitled to the second week's remuneration and expenses, and that unless cheque was sent by return I should not hesitate to put the matter in other hands—that letter came back with a request to put my number on it, 548—I replied on January 8th, and sent the number—I heard nothing further—I never got any remuneration—I spent 10s. 6d. for the pen, 10s. for postage stamps for the fortnight, and 2s. or 3s. for envelopes, blotting paper and post cards, having written my ten letters a day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow—I am housekeeper at 13, Abinger Road, Deptford—on December 29th I was living at Poplar Walk Road, Herne Hill—in November my friend Mrs. Clements, a widow, mentioned the Parker fountain pen to me, and I was shown a written letter—about December 1st I received from her a Parker pen circular and a letter in her writing, like this one, offering employment at £1 a week and 5s. expenses—I applied to the Company and signed the agreement, which Mrs. Clements witnessed—I enclosed a postal order for 10s. 6d. for the pen, believing the statements in the letter and the circular that if I wrote ten letters a day and sent a post card every night as to the letters written I should get £1 a week and 5s. expenses, and because I wanted the pen for the employment—I understood the pay was to commence from the first week—the signed agreement I received from the Company is witnessed by "G. Spicer," in the same writing—I also received circulars to enclose in my letters, and addresses cut from a directory, to write to—I wrote and despatched ten letters every day and a post card every night to the firm for a fortnight—at the end of the fortnight I wrote to the firm, because Mrs. Clements had shown me a new printed form of letter—I asked for remuneration for what I had done—I received in reply the <hi rend="italic">pro rata</hi> circular about December 20th—on December 24th I went with Mrs. Clements to the Company's office—we went into the shop on the ground floor of 195, Oxford Street, and Mrs. Clements asked for the Parker Fountain Pen Company—we were told to go upstairs—we saw another gentleman who said we could wait there or go up higher—we went up higher and saw some young ladies sorting post cards—Mrs. Clements again asked for the Parker Pen Company—after a conversa<lb/>tion with Miss O'Rearden, Mrs. Clements got 25s.—I said, "Have you not something for me?" and that I had worked a fortnight—she said they were behind in sorting the cards, but she would give me a cheque for 5s. and would settle in a day or two—she gave me a cheque for 5s., which I cashed downstairs—when I got home I received a letter stating that they were looking into the matter—on January 15th I wrote for a further remittance and circulars, and to know whether I should use the old form of letter—my letter was returned with the words on the back, "Utilise old letters until you receive fresh supply of new circulars"—I had then moved to Deptford—I did not write more letters after the fortnight—I received this printed form of January 16th forwarding 5s. and a notice of removal to 12 and 13, Noel Street, London, W., pasted on it—a penny stamp was on the cheque, which I cashed—I wrote on January 20th for £2 more for two week's, writing, according to agreement, ten letters a day and a post card—I got no reply—I received two sums of 5s.—the stamps cost me 10s. in addition to paying for the pen and other expenses.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 242, Wharncliffe Gardens, St. John's Wood—on November 26th, in consequence of seeing an advertisement, I went to 195, Oxford Street, for a situation—after a conversation with a Mr. William Dixon I was engaged as a lady clerk at 6s. a week—my hours were to be from 9 till 6 and on Saturdays 9 till 2—he took me upstairs and introduced me to Miss O'Rearden—two or three ladies were in the room, and a boy—they were writing and checking off post cards—I com<lb/>menced there and then by opening letters for Miss O'Rearden—generally they were applications to become special correspondents—the second day I saw Mr. Thomas Dixon, and after a time I saw Black in an office by himself at 195, Oxford Street—matters of difficulty, were referred to Mr. Thomas Dixon—I am not certain what Mr. Black did, he was in his office every day—I do not know that he had anything to do with the Parker Pen Company at first, only when the staff moved to Noel Street—other businesses were carried on, advertising agencies, I think—my second duties were to check off post cards which contained ten names and addresses a day from correspondents, on to yellow cards like this one produced—a separate card was kept for each correspondent;—I put a tick on the yellow card opposite the date to show that each post card contained ten addresses to which letters were to have been sent according to agreement—I con<lb/>tinued to work alone about a week, checking about 100 post cards a day or more—at the end of the week Mr. Thomas Dixon asked me to fill in the printed agreements which went out to the applicants—I put in the details and the signature, "The Parker Pen Company," and witnessed it in my own</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190304270049"/>
               <p>name—I continued to do that for a week or a fortnight—then two other young ladies named Spicer and Dibsdall came to help me because there was more than I could do—they filled up the agreements in the same way—Mr. Thomas Dixon and Miss O'Rearden told me to do that—I filled up 200 to 300 papers a day—four things we had to do: to fill in brown wrappers sixty-five pens and circulars, and the letters, and the yellow cards—I filled in about sixty agreements a day—I addressed the pens to the same people the circulars went to and the acknowledgments of the receipts of 10s. 6d.—I also addressed the post cards for the Christmas holidays—I saw letters come with amounts of 10s. 6d. in them—those were taken to miss O'Rearden at once—on the Saturday after Christmas Miss Dibsdall, Miss Burgess, and I went to Noel Street—I did not send out, but I saw letters like this (<hi rend="italic">The circular enclosing</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">and stating that payment did not commence till the end of the second week.</hi>)—mostly Miss O'Rearden and Miss Nidd attended to that and to these (<hi rend="italic">Forms stating "No orders whatever have been received from your work</hi>") were in piles—on December 27th Mr. Thomas Dixon asked me if I would go round to Noel Street and supervise the work, as it was rather in a muddle—about eight or nine ladies were employed there—with those who went round with me from 193, Oxford. Street, there were twenty-three in all—there was a man, Mr. Jacobs, and two boys—a boy brought letters round from 193, Oxford Street—we had one large room on the second floor—Miss O'Rearden occupied a room on the same floor—about January 10th or 12th* the work fell off—some ladies left—about a week before January 31st I was told I was not wanted any more—the number had dwindled down to about four ladies—I told Mr. Thomas Dixon I required a week's pay or a week's notice—I considered he was my employer—he paid me—sometimes Miss O'Rearden paid—he agreed to my week's notice—he did not come round to Noel Street after Miss O'Rearden came—the last week I examined the post cards, about the ten letters a day—that was all there was to do—I left on January 31st—people came to Noel Street about their money—Miss O'Rearden saw them—sometimes six to a dozen in a day would come—some were noisy—then Mr. Black was fetched from 195, Oxford Street—when he could not quiet them the police were fetched—Black only fetched one policeman—that went on at Noel Street up to January 31st—people came and complained the whole time Miss O'Rearden was there—it was during the last fortnight that Mr. Black was fetched—up to the time Miss O'Rearden came Mr. Thomas Dixon used to come—no members of the public used to come then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> About half a dozen were employed at Oxford Street—the number increased to fifteen—the place became too small—my salary was increased—the most I received in one week with overtime was 23s. 8d.—there was no complaint about my work—a faithful record was made of all transactions so far as I could see—when applications for the post of correspondent were refused the persons were asked if they would have the pen—the money was returned when the agreement stopped and when the pen was not sent—we traced each case from the yellow cards which were kept in the cabinet of drawers which is in Court—it was after Christmas</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190304270050"/>
               <p>when the applications for the post of correspondent began to fall off—in one or two cases after the agreements were stopped the person writing for the post of correspondent accepted the pen, but I had nothing to do with that—I do not complain of Mr. Dixon—I always had my money promptly—the other ladies had the same salary as myself—even when the staff was twenty-three there was difficulty in getting the work done—a week or two before Christmas we ran short of pens—we could not keep pace with the applications for appointments—there was no attempt to disguise the writing in the agreements—I know of no case where one person was asked to write "The Parker Pen Company" and another to witness it—Jacobs was the packer, he sent off the circulars and the pens—the boy assisted Jacobs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I found the other ladies were getting 10s. 6d. I asked for the same—we worked sometimes till 10.45 p.m.—my average earnings were 17s.—overtime was paid for at 5d. an hour—Mr. Black came to Noel Street sometimes twice a day and sometimes not at all—he was there at times before Miss O'Rearden came—this is one of the forms that were sent out in January when the appointments were discontinued—(<hi rend="italic">This stated that, owing to exception having been taken by a large section of the Press, and the general public, which had militated against the success of the scheme the Parker Pen Company awaited the applicant's confirmation as to sending the pen.</hi>)—I had nothing to do with sending those out, but I saw them in the office—this form regretting that the applicant did not wish to start the correspondence and enclosing cheque for 9s. 9d., being 10s. 6d. less postage, I never saw—the packer had to do with the postage—it was 4d. or 5d. besides the postage of the circulars—it would come to about 9d. altogether.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 6, Bishop's Road, Bayswater—about November 24th in consequence of answering an advertisement, I went to 195, Oxford Street, where Mr. Thomas Dixon engaged me as a lady clerk at 10s. 6d. a week—my hours were to be from nine to six, the same as the other ladies—I was taken to a room upstairs and first of all set to check post cards and tick the yellow cards—after doing: that a week I had to make out cheques which were printed forms and torn from books like these produced mostly for 5s., some for 25s.—Miss O'Rearden showed me how to make them out—Mr. Thomas Dixon signed them—after a time I filled up and signed agreements as other ladies did—I went the Saturday after Christmas to Noel Street—on January 16th Miss Bailey brought me this letter (<hi rend="italic">Enclosing a cheque for a weeks work, and stating that the witness's services were no longer required.</hi>)—Miss O'Reardon wrote that—on one occasion, about a fortnight before Christmas and while at Oxford Street, Mr. Dixon said to me, "I will not sign any more cheques until I see how I stand, as it is all paying out and no money coming in"—after that I made out a <hi rend="italic">good few</hi> 5s. cheques and Mr. Dixon signed them—that was when people wrote—when threatening letters came we sent 25s.—two or three dozen letters came—I saw Mr. Black at Oxford Street, but I was never in his office, which was on the ground floor—I saw no other business except that of the Parker Pen Company at Noel Street.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I saw one letter in reply to which a 25s. cheque was sent, which said that unless the Company paid, the matter would be put into a solicitor's hands—at Noel Street there was a big room in which about twenty-three ladies worked, and Miss O'Rearden had a part partitioned off.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a director of the firm of Goodall and Suddick, Limited, stationers and printers, Cookridge Street, Leeds—I have done printing work for Mr. Thomas Dixon for five or six years—about October 11th I received this letter from him asking me to quote price for printing 20,000 four-page letters as per specimen enclosed, with as little delay as possible—the copy was altered from the original circular of the Trafalgar Novelty Company, of Trafalgar Buildings, Charing Cross, W.C. (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I gave an estimate of £13 10s. for the 20,000—I sent a proof, which was returned with the necessary corrections—I supplied the 20,000 copies in October last year, the order having been received on 18th—between October 27th and January 14th I supplied Mr. Dixon with 1,498,650 circulars similar to these produced—we never put our imprint on Mr. Dixon's work, because he is an advertising agent—Mr. Dixon puts his own imprint—I also executed orders for other work, including the altered <hi rend="italic">pro rata</hi> circular—I believe those were sent off on December 18th, the day after we got the order—the manuscript is Dixon's writing—I have corresponded with him for some years—I believe 6,000 were ordered—the final form of circular contained the clause "We reserve the right to verify any names and addresses you may send us, and to cancel our agreement whenever we find you violating any of its conditions, at the end of three weeks, or should insufficient business result from your efforts, and to pay on the <hi rend="italic">pro rata</hi> basis of £1 a week, plus 5s. expenses for six pens sold"—that differs from the old form offering" immediate employment as special correspondent at home for a period of three months at a remuneration of 20s. per week, and 5s. per week for expenses," the words relating to <hi rend="italic">pro rata</hi> payment being added—a similar alteration is made in the specimen letter—I have several times called on Mr. Dixon in London—I have seen Mr. Black there, during the past twelve months—I have conversed with him about the ordinary advertising business, and with Mr. Dixon on the Parker Pen business only about the printing two or three times last year—he gave me instructions about the printing—every time I was in the town I called on Mr. Dixon, which was eight or nine times a year.</p>

Rutzen—Thomas Dixon said, "I am simply an advertising agent for the Parker Pen Company, who are an American firm, and we act as their London Agents, my brothers William and John simply assist me"—the two brothers were present—both made statements—John was sub<lb/>sequently discharged by the Magistrate—Black was not in at that time; we subsequently returned, and McPherson read the warrant to him—he said, "I am only a servant; I have been acting according to instructions; my first connection with the Parker Pen Company was about a month after the scheme started, and as for the books, etc., I know nothing about them, and what I have done was only as a servant to Thomas Dixon"—Black pointed out his office—I asked him to produce any papers or books he might have there in connection with the business of the Parker Pen Company, as they were carrying on other business—Sergeant McPherson took possession of them when he produced them from the office he was in, and in a different part of the building from that where the office of Thomas Dixon was—Thomas Dixon also produced papers which he said belonged to the Parker Pen Company, which were taken possession of—we afterwards went to Noel Street—there we found very extensive premises occupied as an office—three girls were employed there—the documents connected with the Parker Pen Company which are produced, are very bulky—before the arrest the police had received many complaints with regard to this business.</p>

I was present when Drew executed the warrant on February 5th—I went to Noel Street—I saw Miss O'Rearden and another young lady—then I went back to Oxford Street and arrested Black—I have heard what Drew has said; it is correct—I took possession of a great quantity of correspondence and documents generally at both places, including the cheque books and other papers, which have been produced—from a careful examination I find that roughly there were about 8,479 correspondents—the letter Turner spoke to and the correspondence pro<lb/>duced with Mr. Parker, of New York, I believe were handed to Drew—there were also invoices showing large orders for pens, and receipts for $1,000 and other large amounts, showing that 4s. 2d. per pen was paid to the American Company by Dixon, who charged 5s. 2d. to the English Company, who sold the pen for 10s. 6d.—the books produced show that the business of Dixon and that of the Parker Pen Company were carried on separately—the type written document stating "that the appointments were discontinued in consequence of objections, was among the papers—there is also a register of correspondence and a cabinet of drawers containing yellow cards for reference—about 3,400 correspondents received something and 5,070 nothing—£5 is the maximum and 7d. is the minimum received—in the first 1,000 900 received payment and 100 did not; in the second 1,000 the proportion is 674 receiving to 325 not receiving; in the third 383 to 616; in the fourth 322 to 677; in the fifth 284 to 715; in the sixth 239 to 760; in the seventh 313 to 786; and in the eighth 139 to 860; and in the balance of the ninth 1,000, viz., 479; 253 received payment and 226 no payment—£5 was received in one case only; another received £4 5s.; eleven received £4—in the first 1,000 all but one were below £4—in the next 1,000 the most received was one of £3; in the third 1,000 the maximum received was £2 10s., all the others being under £2: in the fourth 1,000 the highest correspondent got £2, the others were under 30s.: in the fifth 1,000 the highest was £1 14s. 9d., the others being £1; in the sixth 1,000 two got £1 each, the others were under 16s. 8d.; in the seventh 1,000 the highest got £1 10s., the next £1, and the others under that; in the eighth 1,000 the highest received £l 7s., the next £1 5s., and the others 19s. 6d. and under—in the balance, 479, nine got £1 1s., the others 11s. 6d. or less—between November 1st, 1902, and February 5th. 1903, in sums of 10s. 6d., £4.482 was received, the amount paid to correspondents was £2,448—this is the cash book from which I get my figures—I did not calculate the wages, only he general expenses—there is a book for wages in addition to the record for correspondents.</p>

               <p>monies paid in have been entered, and Dixon appears to have put monies into the business in addition to the correspondents' half-guineas"—I say now the whole amount was paid out in connection with working the affair—all that Dixon had in his office in connection with the Parker Pen Com<lb/>pany was handed over to the police, but not in the other office—the names of the 8,000 odd correspondents are recorded in the cash book with few ecxeptions—these can be traced on the yellow cards with twenty or thirty exceptions—the whole history of each transaction is not on the cards; the returned sums are shown—I have not treated the whole 8,000 correspon<lb/>dents as having complied with all the conditions of their appointments because I had no opportunity of knowing that nor what proportion had done so, but the cards show many payments stopped for various reasons; some did not write on proper paper, and reasons are shown on the cards why the work was not gone on with, but I have no means of knowing what proportion of the 8,000 correspondents complied with the conditions to entitle them to receive payment—280 received back their 10s. 6d., 612 received 10s., but I cannot say whether the 10s. was after returning the pen or two sums of 5s. for expenses—my statement does not show that 349 had 10s. 6d. 636 10s., and 285 9s. 9d; mine is that 256 had 9s. 9d., 280 10s. 6d., and 612 12s.—I do not make any difference as to the time when the Com<lb/>pany commenced to pay on the <hi rend="italic">pro rata</hi> terms—there are about a dozen cheque books of the Union Bank in addition to the printed forms of the Royal British Bank for 5s. and 25s.—there must have been an enormous amount of labour in keeping the records—I cannot tell when these printed forms began—I believe Dixon kept an account at the Union Bank for many years—the printed forms were for the Parker pen business only—there are some earlier than January 16th—there are documents relating to the coupon system in selling the pens, but no letters as far back as 1899—the Parker pen is sold by well known stationers at 10s. 6d.—I found one or two receipts for payments made by Dixon to the representative of the Parker Pen Company. Mr. Otto F. Mack, beginning in April, 1902, and correspondence as to repairs, carriage charges, etc. as far back as July, 1902—in this letter to Mr. Parker of October 15th Dixon wrote, "I have every hope of this scheme being a great success. A very great deal will depend on the quality of the pen you send. Please see that each is fitted with the best gold nibs and latest feed"—I went to Dixon's premises a month or six weeks prior to the arrest, in consequence of complaints—I did not disclose my identity—all the premises are occupied by Dixon except that of the office of the Great Western Railway—I got some advertisements literature, but not a pen.</p>

               <p>I have known Hyman and Philip Bernstein sixteen or seventeen years—Philip has been resident in London most of that time—Hyman was away for about eleven years in Australia—he returned to this country about 1900, when I used to see him frequently—I saw a man named Mayer in Hyman's company—in June, 1901. I was living with my father at 25, Broad Lane, Tottenham—I was friendly with the Bernsteins—eventually I met a man called Johann Schmidt—Philip Bernstein had a jeweller's shop at 120, High Street, Whitechapel—it had not long been opened—I always thought it belonged to both the brothers—it was conducted as Bernstein and Co.—it was doing a bad business—we got talking about various things, and Philip Bernstein asked me if I could not look up "that forger"—he did not know his name—I said I would try and look him up, which I did—I saw Hyman at this time, but I would not swear whether he was present at that particular interview—he was no doubt present at others about this time, when the matter of the employ<lb/>ment of Schmidt was discussed, and as to what should be done if I could find him, and if anything could be forged—that is all Schmidt could be employed for—it was not discussed what he should forge—I saw my father about it, and had some conversation with him, in the course of which Schmidt's name was mentioned—I was not present at any meeting between my father and Schmidt—I met Schmidt and had a conversation with him—I then went and saw the Bernsteins—I saw them both, and told them I had looked up Schmidt and had had a conversation with him, and that he had suggested to me that Bank of England notes would be the cheapest and easiest things to make—I said that Schmidt had mentioned £50 at the probable cost of making them—we discussed the matter, and they wanted to see a sample—I saw Schmidt again, and told him I should want a sample made—I gave him instructions to make a sample watermark of a <hi rend="italic">fiver</hi>—Schmidt took that work in hand at our house, Broad Lane—he had a genuine £5 note to work from—Philip Bernstein gave me that—it took Schmidt about a week to make the sample, and when it was finished I went to the Bernsteins taking two samples of the watermarks of £5 notes—they both examined them and found something wrong with them—I do not remember what it was—it was some slight fault in the watermark—they did not consider the fault was so grave as to make the notes useless—it was easily repairable, and they were put on the fire in their room—I think it was next day that Hyman Bernstein came to me and brought four genuine £5 notes and pointed out what was wrong and what they wanted altered in the forgeries—I showed them to Schmidt and had a conversation with him—I do not think Schmidt worked on them—I think I handed them back to Bernstein—Schmidt had got his first genuine note all this time, but they brought me the four notes so as to show me that the sample was different to each of them—Schmidt had a plate of the samples he had produced—the Bernsteins objected to the work being carried on from the original £5 note, and I gave it back to them—no further samples were made then, but Schmidt was to give an estimate how much it would cost exactly to make so many pieces of £5 and £10 notes—I do not know how many pieces, but I know it was £12,000</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190304270061"/>
               <p>or £13,000 face value—I gave the estimate on a slip of paper to the Bern-steins—they were living together in the same house—Philip is married—Hyman was single then—£50 was to be the cost, and Schmidt was to have 7 1/2 per cent. after the notes had been converted into money as well as 30s. a week—I was to have £2 a week to look after Schmidt and supervise the work—the Bernsteins wanted the work to be done in my place at Broad Lane, but I could not agree to that, and eventually it was agreed a house should be taken at the sea side—a house was taken at Southsea, and I arrived there with my family on July 1st, 1901—Schmidt went down, I think, in the same train—a room was set aside for him to work in.—before he went down he bought the plant and things he required—I think Philip Bern<lb/>stein gave me £16 or £17—I gave the money to Schmidt, and he bought what he required—he showed me receipts which I showed to Bernstein—they were from different firms—Winstones, Penrose, Fox: I do not re<lb/>member the others—Hyman Bernstein gave me a £5 note and a £10 note to take down to Southsea as samples—he said he had got them from the Bank of England in the name of White—before leaving London I saw the Bernsteins daily—Schmidt continued his work at Southsea—he reported to me from time to time—I reported to the Bernsteins by letter, which I always addressed to Bernstein and Co.—our expenses there amounted to £6 or £7 a week, which the Bernsteins found—at first the money was sent by Philip Bernstein by bank note, then by telegraph money order—at first he sent it from "Philip Bernstein," but then he said it was rather suspicious sending it to me,' and so he sent it as from Solomon Barmash—he had to write to me about that because I had to answer that question at the post office before I could get the money—Schmidt wanted different material, such as sandpaper, blotting-paper, and various pieces of wood, and some framework—when Schmidt wanted them I would write to the Bernsteins and they would send them down to me—on two occasions Schmidt went to London and made pur<lb/>chases himself—on one occasion he went for a special machine—on the other occasion for paper, I think, or for a holiday—when he told me he would require a machine I asked him for a drawing, which I sent to the Bernsteins—when it came it was in accordance with the drawing, but it was a complete failure—I returned it to the Bernsteins—a copying press was bought at Yardley's in Wormwood Street—two pieces of wood were also required for wedges—no drawings of those were sent, only a descrip<lb/>tion—they were forwarded—there was also a square flat piece of wood—Bernstein told me it was very expensive—it was not sufficiently level and was no good—the stay at Southsea lasted until August—about the beginning of August it was resolved to decrease the number of pieces—I do not think there was any resolve to increase the value—I have seen a framework like this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) in Schmidt's hands—it is for stretching the paper—I saw these other pieces of wood (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) at Broad Lane—they are the waste which was cut from other pieces—later on some little wooden blocks were required for printing—there was a determination to make £50 notes—that was discussed between the Bernsteins and my father and communicated to me—I told Schmidt about it and gave him a</p>

               <p>genuine £50 note—there were none forged then—he gave it back to me—it had been sent to me by the Bernsteins—Hyman had got it—I do not know which of them sent it to me—I was with Hyman when he got it—I had come up to London because Schmidt had said it would take a long time to make the notes if he did not have a machine—we then discussed the matter of the £50 notes—I was told it would be as well to have £50 notes—I asked for a sample, and Hyman told me to get it at the Bank of England in the name of White—he told me to get it in the same name as the £10 and £5 notes—it was sent down to Southsea to me because I did not care to take it with me—when Schmidt returned it to me I sent it back to Bernstein and Co.—when I was in London at that time I went with my father to Goldman's at. 35, Sandringham Road, Dalston—I stayed outside—my father went in—he stayed in there about an hour, joined me, had a conversation with me, and we then walked away—he showed me £75, £60 in notes and £15 in gold—it was on that visit that the £50 note was in the first instance given to me—my father paid the money he showed me into the Royal British Bank—he had no account then—I think he opened one with the £75—about a month afterwards I and my father and Goldman were at Bernstein's house—I showed Goldman samples of the forged £5, £10, and £50 notes—they were then complete with the exception of the numbers—he did not say much—he had a look at them and pointed out some of his faults—father said to him, "There you are, now you can see what you have given the money for," or "The money is good," or something of that sort—we discussed the disposal of the notes—I think my father suggested France—I suggested Egypt—nothing definite was spoken of—I suggested Egypt because I knew Goldman had been all round there, and I suggested it as a matter of policy more than anything else to see what he would say—you might call it a feeler—I wanted to know what his view would be—I do not remember what he said he did not say very much—my impression is that; he took the matter quite cool—subsequently there was a discussion between my father, Goldman, and myself as to what Goldman's payment should be—he wanted £400 for lending £200. which my father thought was too much—he thought sovereign for sovereign was enough—they left it to me to decide—I decided £400 was a reasonable figure, and that he should have 200 per cent.—he was to have £600 in all—£50 of the £75 was a pay<lb/>ment towards the first £100, and the other £25 was a loan to father—Goldman was a bookmaker—the £25 was to be repaid by my father, the £50 was for the business—when I showed the samples to Goldman the printing in the centre of the notes was smudgy—we met at Bernstein's house, but they did not know that Goldman was seeing the notes—the arrangement with Goldman was that the Bernsteins were not to know that he was advancing money and that Bernsteins thought that Goldman did not know that they were in it—that is what they were all permitted to believe—that was kept up for some considerable time—Goldman was known as Phillie Michaels—when we met him at Bernstein's house we smuggled him upstairs without their knowledge, to one of their rooms, and showed him the samples—we got him down in the same way—we used</p>

               <p>the private door—he was using the Bernstein's house for making a book—at the house there was also a man named Stern or Mayer—after Goldman had gone we showed the samples to both the Bernsteins—that was the first time they had seen a sample of a £50 note—they had not got to the printed stage then—the Bernsteins complained of their being dirty in the centre—I said I would see that it was remedied—Hyman took the notes down<lb/>stairs while we were there—he afterwards confessed to me that he had shown them to Mayer—the samples were then put on the fire—I went back to Southsea, and the work was continued there—at the end of September the house there was no longer necessary, and we came back to London—I sent some things back to 25, Broad Lane—a copying-press was sent to the Bersteins—Schmidt returned about a week before me—on my return I found him at work at Broad Lane—he remained there for about three or four weeks, when it was decided that the work should be carried on at Mrs. Samuel's house at 82, Winchester Road—the water-marked paper was taken away from Broad Lane from time to time—sometimes Hyman, but mostly Philip Bernstein, came for it—it was packed up in a little parcel and marked with a number—it was not printed—I do not know why it was taken away—the amount taken was according to the amount Schmidt had done during the day—the notes were printed and numbered at Winchester Road, and bleached at Broad Lane—about 400 pieces were perfected in the end, about 100 fives and 100 tens and 200 fifties—a great many were spoiled, but those are all that were completed—the Bank stamp, which is on the one produced, was done by the Bernsteins and myself and my father the night before we left for America—we sat up all night—we made up the stamp ourselves—the notes are stamped London and Westminster, Hampstead Branch—the object was obvious—the idea is very well known to anybody who does not want his handwriting known—it is to prevent the banker from asking you to sign it—my only object in pointing that out is perhaps to make the police wiser—by the end of 1001 everything was completed and in order for the uttering of the notes—there were many discussions, and it was finally decided that America was to be the place where they were to be disposed of—Hyman Bernstein was present—when that was decided upon he agreed to Mayer being sent to the United States—Goldman was not present at any of the discussions—he did not know that America was the place selected—the Bernstein's paid Mayer's expenses to America—I do not know which of them paid—I was not present when his ticket was booked—he went quite alone—the Bernsteins told me that his expenses were £15—they told me the boat he went by, but I do not remember the name now—I know he went at mid<lb/>night from St. Pancras—he did not take <hi rend="italic">the</hi> notes with him—it was deter<lb/>mined that Hyman Bernstein and myself should go afterwards—we had an appointment with Mayer outside the Post Office in New York—money was required for the traveling expenses—I saw Goldman at Bernsteins shop—I asked him for the money for the expenses, and he gave me a cheque for £50—I went to the London and Westminster Bank, Eastern Branch, and cashed it—it was drawn on that bank in the name of Harrison I got a £50 note in exchange for it, which I gave to Philip Bernstein—</p>

               <p>I went elsewhere—I returned to Tottenham—Hyman Bernstein gave me the note back—I gave it to Philip because I could not get down to give it to Hyman, who wanted it for comparison with one of the forgeries—I took it to a friend of mine at Tottenham, a tobacconist named Rutenburg—I owed him a few pounds, which I paid him and got the change, which he gave me in £5 notes and gold—he sent a cheque for the change to his bank, but I did not have it he sent one of his travellers with it, and gave me the change which came to about £40—about an hour afterwards I paid them to Schmidt at Broad Lane—my father was there—Schmidt wanted some money on account, and we agreed to give him £50—we gave him £45—I was at Southsea at the time Goldman paid the second £50—this was the first £50 towards the second hundred—the second £50 of the second hundred was for the fare of Hyman and myself—Philip Bernstein met us up West at an Aerated Bread Shop, and brought £35 in a little bag—I think he gave it to Hyman and took our fares with it—he said it came from Goldman—I asked him about the other £15, and he said he would lay claim to that for Mayer's fare, and that he would settle that up afterwards—we took single fares at Cook's in Cockspur Street—Philip and Hyman Bernstein and myself were there—we booked for New York—we were not personally conducted—we did not want any conductor—I was the conductor—the tickets were for Hyman and myself—we did not give our full name and addresses—he went as Hyman Baron—I went at William Brice—we sat up that night doing the stamping, and left at 5 a.m. for Southampton—we went by the American Line ship "Philadelphia"—my recollection is that we took about £10,080 face value of notes—I do not know what became of the rest of the £11,800 worth which was the total made—Goldman came down early in the morning to our house on his bicycle, and said he wanted security for his money—he did not agree about advancing the other £100 unless he had security, and we went down to his house and left him with £600 worth of forged notes as security—there were about 25 tens and the balance of fifties—I do not remember any fives—the tens were some which Schmidt had made a little time previously and discarded—I thought it was very good security; as long as he held one note it would be as good as if he held fifty, because if he disposed of one note it would be exposed, and he could not get rid of any more and would spoil our scheme—they were not of Schmidt's best—the fifties were Schmidt's best and would have been negotiable if Goodman had chosen to negotiate them—the arrangement between my father, Goldman and myself was that Goldman should hold them for ten days, and within ten days he was to receive at least the £200 which he had invested, and if he did not receive it he was then entitled to dispose of the notes or do anything else he liked with them—the £200 which he was to receive was to be provided by our cabling from New York—that accounted for £10,680 worth—I do not know what became of the rest—when I last saw them before I left England they were in Hyman Bernstein's hands—that was after we had given the notes to Goldman—the ones he had were not stamped—on the way to America Hyman kept them—Philip Bernstein sent a telegram to Mayer, and</p>

Baron, Summit Hotel, New York."—I did not speak to Mayer myself about passing the notes—Hyman had a long conversation about it with him and told me that Mayer was afraid they were not good enough—"Try prevent P. doing business "meant try and prevent Phillie Michaels or Goldman disposing of the notes—Mayer's scruples were over-come, but in his endeavour to pass a £50 note he was stopped at the first onset—he was arrested and kept in custody in New York for a fortnight—a day or two after that, a telegram was sent from New York to London—Hyman and Philip had arranged a code by which they could let each other know how things were going on—the words were "Bare "or "Bull," as representing bad or good fortune—I was present when this telegram was sent by Hyman addressed "Morris, 41, Newcastle Street, White-chapel, Bare cable £20 immediately, Baron, Summit Hotel, New York"—"Bare" meant things were bad—£20 in dollars was paid to Hyman and I at Cook's office in New York, and aided by that we were enabled to make our way back to London—we came back by the same line—I think by the "St. Paul"—we travelled in the same names—we arrived at Southampton—these notes (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) are the ones Mayer tried unsuc<lb/>cessfully to utter in New York—on landing at Southampton, Hyman had the balance of forged notes on him—it was determined to send them by parcel post to London—we put them into a cigar box—it was addressed to Morris, 41, Newcastle Street,—Bernstein's father lived there—it is not far from 120, High Street, Whitechapel—we telegraphed to Philip on our arrival, and then came together to London—we were met, I think, at Vauxhall Station by Philip Bernstein and my sister—we separated and went home—I stayed at 25, Broad Lane, with my father—the two Bern-steins were at 120, High Street—in due course the parcel we had dispatched at Southampton came to hand—I think it was the next day—I saw it at 120, High Street, in the possession of the Bernsteins—it was opened—there was a good deal of dispute about the contents—in the mean time they remained with the Bernsteins—we arrived early in February, 1902, and after our arrival some negotiations were started for the purpose of replacing the notes—I saw Goldman—he said he had a customer who would buy them—the conversation took place at Khann's restaurant opposite 120, High Street, Whitechapel—he said he wanted samples—I gave him one of each which I got from Hyman Bernstein—he went down with them, and in a few minutes came up again with them, but the result was, no business was done—I returned the samples to Hyman Bernstein—I had many conver<lb/>sations during February with Goldman in regard to the disposal of the notes—he did not make any statement to me with regard to the batch</p>

               <p>that he held as security—I never spoke to him about it—I never saw them again; I heard of them—in March the arrest was made by the City police of a considerable number of men charged with forging and uttering Bank of England £5 notes—I heard of it—it was a gang headed by a man named Devenport, and the result of that arrest; there was an investigation before one of the City Magistrates, and a trial in this Court in May, 1902—business during that time was not active in the way of trying to dispose of these notes—it was better to be quiet for a time, but about six weeks before I was arrested, on October 20th, negotiations were re-started for the purpose of replacing the notes—there was a considerable effort to dispose of them, but I and my father were arrested, and at different dates before an Alderman in the City we were charged with this offence, and committed here for trial, and in this Court in December, 1902, and before, my Lord, I pleaded guilty to forgery—I was indicted with my father and Philip Bernstein, who also pleaded guilty, and sentences of different degrees were passed upon us—within a comparatively short time of my arrest I made a statement to the police—I went to Amsterdam between my return from America and my arrest for the purpose of placing the notes—I was not successful.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEYCESTER</hi>. I did not take any of the notes with me to Holland—the last time that I saw any of these notes was about four days before my arrest—when Mayer was unsuccessful in passing any of them in America I did not attempt to pass any myself—I never tried to pass any in America—I went there at the request of the others because I was more acquainted with America than they—I went as a guide—I had been there for some years—none of these notes were ever passed—the only person who made any money out of the transaction was Schmidt, and anybody else who had put any money into it has lost it—I had £2 a week, but I did not have a holiday with it—I did not sleep very comfortably with things like that in the house—I had to work for my £2 a week—I could have made that if I had been bricklaying—I have known Schmidt for eighteen months—I knew he professed to be a very remarkable forger—he was somewhat proud of it—I know at the police court he described himself as the champion forger—I do not know if it was the championship of England or the world—I did not see his diploma his own description of his abilities was rather flattering—he said he had started forgery in Russia; that is where he comes from—he said he had forged Russian rouble notes and paper money in Germany and Exchange notes in America—he boasted that he was responsible for smash<lb/>ing the Cheque Bank—I knew Philip Bernstein better than Hyman, who had been in Australia for eleven years—I did not see him at all whilst he was there—he had only recently returned—I knew him before he went—I was quite a schoolboy then—I am twenty-six now—the first time I saw him after his return may have been at a Christmas party at Philip Bernstein's at the end of 1900—I cannot swear if Hyman was present when Philip asked me to look "up that man the forger"—the next interview I had with Philip v, was when it was agreed I should find Schmidt—Hyman was present then: I am quite certain of that—I was certain</p>

               <p>of it at the police court—I have not had much opportunity whilst in prison to consider what ray story is—they give you occupation there, which prevents your thinking—the police came and saw me in prison—I told them what my story was, and I have given it once at the Mansion House—undoubtedly I said there, "I went and saw one of the Bernsteins at 120, High Street, Whitechapel; I think I saw both"—I was positive then—if I had been asked if I was positive I should have said yes—the first sample note Schmidt made was only for the purpose of the water-mark—I took it to the Bernsteins—they were both present, I am positive of that, and I am positive the samples were burned—I do not know if I said at the police court that I took them back again—I am, quite certain that they were destroyed in that room—I cannot say at which of the interviews Hyman was present—I always considered he and his brother were one person—it is hard for me to distinguish between interviews where both were present or only one—it is about nine months now since Hyman was stopping at 120, High Street—I do not know if he lived with a niece of his at Lavender Hill—I have never been there in my life—I did not call on him there—I know the niece's husband, Raphael—it was not there that Hyman first told me he was going to America, I have seen the niece and her husband, but always at Bernstein's place—Hyman was not living with them just before he went to America—he was living in my house then—Raphael is a tailor—Hyman was in my house for three weeks—he was a bachelor at that time, and had no home of his own—I do not remember him telling me that he was going to engage some stalls at the St. Louis Exhibition—I do not know if there is a St. Louis Exhibition or not—I have never heard of it—I did not hear when I was in America that they were going to have a St. Louis Exhibition in 1903—I did not have time to look up these things, I had other troubles—I do not know if Hyman was a dealer in opals—I know he brought some from Australia—he had one with him in America, which he sold—I went with him when he sold it—he did not sell others when I was not there—I did not shadow him, but he was strange there, and did not want to go about much without me—I only know one Mr. Rosenberg—he is in my own line of business, a tobacconist—he does not deal in forged notes that I know of—I do not know Mr. Harry Rosenberg, furrier, of 26, Hare Street, Bethnal Green—it is news to me that he was paying half Hyman's expenses to America—it is quite possible that I wrote the telegram which was sent from America—Hyman is not a good writer—Mayer may have written the first telegram; he could not have written the second, he was elsewhere when it was sent—it was arranged with Philip Bernstein we should telegraph to Morris at Newcastle Street—I do not think he had anything to do with the notes.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ELLIOTT</hi>. At the time of my arrest I made no statement to the police—I made a statement ten days afterwards—it was at Brixton Prison—it was put into writing by the police—they took it down in shorthand and transcribed it—I signed it—I did not mention Goldman's name in it—I mentioned the Bernstein's names, but not my father's—I did not make any other statement before I pleaded guilty—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190304270068"/>
               <p>nothing was said by my Counsel about Goldman—the name was not mentioned by the police—it was suggested that I knew of others in it but I denied that—I made another statement about six or seven weeks after I was sentenced, at the request of the police—that was taken down by a gentleman from Messrs. Freshfield's—I did not sign it—I did not then know that Philip Bernstein had made a statement—he was then in the same gaol as I was—we could not communicate with each other, we were in different classes—we did not see each other—I first heard that I should be required to give evidence about ten days after I made my second statement, and I also learnt then from the police that Philip Bernstein had made a statement—I did not then make a further statement until I gave evidence at the Mansion House—my second statement included Goldman's name—it was not until I had been in Lewes Gaol for about seven weeks that I first mentioned his name—the idea of finding Schmidt originated with Philip Bernstein—I did not ferret Schmidt out—I eventually met him—enquiries were made by others to get at his whereabouts—having found him, I communicated the fact to the Bernsteins—I do not know if my father attempted to find him; I would rather mention his name as little as possible, he was my father, and I respect his name—Goldman had nothing to do with the original idea of finding Schmidt—a very considerable time elapsed before Goldman appeared on the scene—the dealings with Schmidt were limited for many weeks to the Bernsteins and myself—there was an understanding between us that the knowledge of the transaction should be limited to ourselves—I find there is very little honour among thieves—I did not go to Goldman in the first instance—he first gave any money in August, 1901—I was not aware that prior to that my father and Goldman had been doing business—my father was a commission agent—he did not occasionally act as a solicitor—he may have prepared legal documents and carried through mortgages—I do not know if he did or not—he and I were on confidential terms—if there was any conveyancing of property his part of the transaction would be to bring the vendor to a solicitor—I know he had been acting in that capacity on behalf of Goldman—as a rule he would not do that for nothing—I know my father had not received payment from Goldman as he should have done—he certainly expected to receive payment—I am not aware that there was a sale of property to my father by a Mr. Williams—he sold property to Goldman—I do not know the name of the solicitor who acted—my father acted as Goldman's adviser—I know Goldman eventually bought the property, and although my father carried it out for him Gold<lb/>man's view was that father was not entitled to any remuneration, but only to a present, as he had his own agent, who he had to pay—I think Williams and Goldman bought father some article to the value of some £5 or £10—I was not present when it was given to him—the original value of the property was between three and four thousand pounds, so if father had got any commission at all he would have received £75 or £100—I suppose it would" have been 2 1/2 per cent, or 1 1/4 per cent.—when my father and I went to Goldman's on August 7th, 1901, my father had only a few shillings</p>

               <p>on him when he went in—I always knew at that time how much money he had—we were in a sort of partnership—when he came out he showed me £60 in notes and £15 in gold, £25 of that was a loan—it had then been arranged between him and Goldman that Goldman should let him have £200 for the purpose of the business of the forged notes—I do not know if at that moment it had been quite settled, but the proposition had been made to Goldman—the £75 was split up, partly as an advance and partly as a loan, because my father was bound to hand all the money he received as an advance to the Bernsteins, because they were the people who were advancing money also—my father would tell them how much he got—I said before, that I did not tell Goldman or the Bernsteins everything, but that was not in regard to money—I do not know if my honour is of a discriminating character, perhaps we had better not discuss my honour—we were bound to tell the Bernsteins of every penny we received from Goldman—every pound was costing two pounds—it was the Bernsteins' proposition that we should go to Goldman, because they could not advance any more money for this transaction—they did not know that Goldman was to be told of the transaction—they wanted father to approach Gold<lb/>man to ask him to invest a certain amount of money, but not to tell him what it was for, or that they were interested in it—he could know that it was for Bank of England notes, but he was not to know the true character of them—it would not be unusual to go to a man and ask him for £200 without exposing the real nature of the business; that is a point which I am afraid you will not understand—I do not think you know much about, it at all, but it is an ordinary thing to ask a man to advance money without telling him what it is for, providing the man is to be depended upon—I am not prepared to give a list of the names and addresses of these people who can be depended upon—I am not an information bureau—that kind of man does not want to know very often—it is not an uncommon thing to ask a man for £2,000 without disclosing the nature of the transaction—Goldman had lent my father money before, but not as much as £200—I daresay my father from time to time had paid him back—I am not sure if Goldman is owed money now—the loan had been returned to Goldman—my father may have drawn a cheque to him about August 13th for £15, but a man's cheques are no criterion at all, because if my father wanted £15 and Goldman was going in the direction of the Royal British Bank he would give him the cheque and ask him to bring the money back—£47 may have been paid by my father to Goldman between August 13th and August 27th—I have never seen my father's account at the Bank—I do not know how Goldman made the next payment, because I was in Southsea—when I returned I was told that he had paid £50—the first time that any notes were shown to Goldman was in September, about a month after his first advance—they were then complete with the exception of the numbers—nothing definite was stated to him as to the ultimate paying off of the notes except the discussion regarding Egypt and so on—I thought that at that time the notes were good enough, because the fault although obvious was easily remedied—the £10 notes which were subsequently deposited with Gold<lb/>man were imperfect—they had a fault which was obvious to me—I do</p>

It was reckoned if he changed one in England it would do all the damage. The notes given to Goldman in the parcel were dangerous to negotiate. I should not have cared to negotiate them myself: the printing was not straight, and the vignette was murky"—they were not in a box—they were in a piece of paper when they were shown to him—I do not know if he saw the murky vignette at the first glance—by changing one of them the others would be useless, because it would be known next day that forged notes were in circulation—I suggest that notes changed to-day reach the Bank of England to-morrow—some of them are kept in circulation for some time, but you have to figure that they reach the Bank next day—a man would not risk his liberty on them—if we did not fulfil our agreement Goldman he knew he had us in his hands—if he wanted to negotiate one of the sample notes he could do so without being found out—if Goldman had issued it he could say he was a bookmaker if he was found out, and very likely he would receive a forged note—he advanced the first £50 of the second hundred by a cheque which he gave to me in Bernstein's shop-parlour, drawn upon the London and Westminster Bank, Whitechapel Branch, in the name of Harrison—I think that name came from him, not me—I do not remember whether the cheque, was "To order "or "To bearer"—I do not remember endorsing it—Bernstein brought £35 in gold next day—I was told that Goldman had given a cheque, drawn in the name of Gordon—I never saw the cheque—the other fifteen of the £50 was left to be settled after we had gone to America—I know about that £15, because Bernstein got me to change a cheque of his at a friend of mine—I do not know of my personal knowledge how the £15 was paid.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shop fitter, of 19, Penter Street, North Minories—I first got to know the Bernsteins in October, 1900—I commenced to fit up for them a jeweller's shop at 120, High Street, Whitechapel, in November—that work went on until February, 1901—during that time I executed some further orders for them—amongst other things they ordered several dozens of small blocks of wood about half-inch square and three inches long—as far as I can remember, both the brothers were together when the order was given—I saw them pretty constantly—they were invariably together—I will not say always—I also received orders to make a frame and block like this one—I also made this one—Philip gave me the order for it—I had a description and, as far as I can remember, a paper drawing—I took it to 120, High Street—I saw Philip there—I had some conversa<lb/>tion with him with regard to it; it was not right; it fitted too loose—he gave me an order to make two further blocks to fit tighter—I executed that order—I took away this block and frame, and eventually delivered the two others that I made—I think I delivered them to Philip—I kept this frame at my workshop—I also made two very heavy mahogany supports for the Bernsteins—a sketch was brought over with the height and width and the holes required in it—I made it to that sketch—I bought some mahogany for the purpose, as I had nothing sufficiently heavy—these two pieces of wood are the waste of the supports that I made—there were bolt holes in them—I think it was Philip who gave me that order—I am not quite sure if he was alone at the time—I took the things over when they were done—I think I delivered them to him—I cannot be sure whether his brother was with him or not—I made a piece of wood with a wedge at each end—that was made from a sketch—as far as I can remember it was Philip who gave me the order—I took this thing to the shop—I fancy both brothers were there then—the last four orders were between July and September, 1901—there was a running account between me and the Bernsteins of which £1313s. 6d. is still owing—this is my account (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—there is an item of 12s., which is for making two mahogany blocks as required—I was practically only dealing with Philip for the shop fitting—they traded as Bernstein and Co.—the other things that I made for them I think were paid for by cash when they were delivered—on one occasion Philip paid, I think, and on one occasion Hyman—</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEYCESTER</hi>. I regarded Philip as the person with whom I was doing business—it was at his request that I was fitting up the shop—Hyman was there when I was receiving orders about it—it never occurred to me that there was anything wrong about the frame or pieces of mahogany—I had nothing to impress them upon my mind except that I thought they were funny little things to make—this bill is the only one in which any of these things appear—I cannot swear that both the brothers were present when I delivered the piece of wood with a wedge at each end—some of the work I was doing at the shop was paid for by cash, but in a different way, because I had to make an arrangement with Philip on the Friday to get the cash on Saturday—I do not remember getting any from Hyman in that way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now undergoing a sentence of penal servitude for forging a number of Bank of England notes—I pleaded guilty to that charge in this Court in December, 1902—I first began to negotiate to bring the forgeries into existence in June, 1901, with Solomon Barmash—I then had a shop at 120, High Street, Whitechapel—my brother Hyman was living with me—he had come back from Australia in 1900—he brought about £420 with him—the bigger portion of that he lent to me—I had it in my safe at 99, Bishopsgate Street—in June, 1901, there was no ready money, most of it was in stock in my shop—the Bishopsgate shop was entirely for imitation jewellery—the High Street shop was for better class jewellery; not high-class but genuine stuff—five or six months after 120, High Street was opened business was going badly—one evening in June, 1901, Hyman told me that Solomon Barmash had come to him and said he had got a man who could make successful Bank of England notes, and he wished him to join us—I tried to dissuade him from it—I was unsuccessful—he said that next day Barmash was going to bring him a kind of sample—next day I came into the shop parlour and found Solomon Barmash talking to Hyman—he stopped talking when I came in—my brother said, "It is all right," and he told me all about it—he showed me the sample and compared it with a £5 note which I had, and which he had asked me to get from the Bank of England—I had not been there specially for it, but I got it—I remember seeing Sagar there and asking him to give me some gold—the forged sample was not exactly perfect—it was not satis<lb/>factory—it was only to show the ability of the maker—we were not satisfied with it, but I think it was anticipated that in time it would be better—my brother told me of the conditions with Barmash—he said that be originally wanted him to go himself but he was to supply men trustworthy and reliable, and that he was to lend £49 or £50 at the rate of £5 a week for six weeks—the total cost of the material was to be about £19—Barmash brought a list with him—my brother and I saw it—there was a chance that it was likely to take two or three weeks longer, but the cost would be at the utmost</p>

               <p>£70—Barmash undertook to provide £100—he had not got it then, but he had an idea where to get it, and if he failed, although he did not care to do it, he would make a couple of <hi rend="italic">Bills</hi> in order to get the money—he did not give us particulars of how he would deceive the people who would accept the Bills—my brother agreed to get the £50 in my presence—only £5 and £10 notes were proposed then to the amount of £14,000 or £15,000—the arrangement was that the forger should have 7 1/2 per cent. up to £10,000, and to be paid 30s. a week—the work began at Southsea—William Barmash came to London several times from Southsea—I and my brother saw him, and every week we sent down the money to Southsea to enable the work to be carried on—the arrangement was that Hyman should find the man who was to utter the notes—he was in London; he was called Mayer—Hyman said he had met him on board ship coming from Australia—he said Mayer was a painter or letter writer and had worked his passage home—it was suggested by my brother that the utterer should get 15 per cent., but Solomon Barmash wanted him to get only 10 per cent, and the remainder should be divided into three shares—the whole cost came out at about £600—we did not anticipate it would cost half as much as that—I am sure the Barmashes did not work honestly—in some instances we paid twice as much for machines as we ought to have done—the postal orders that were sent to Southsea were sometimes written by me and sometimes by Hyman—sometimes my shop assistant went to get them, and sometimes Barmash himself—the machinery that was required at Southsea was sent—I did not send any, I only sent two or three small items—one or two things came back—owing to the failure of the process, which it was thought would prolong the time and expense, Barmash suggested that £50 notes should be made instead of tens or fives and that the number of notes should be reduced—William Barmash brought up some samples from Southsea of tens and fives that Schmidt had made—I do not know who gave William Barmash the genuine £10 or £5 notes for samples—the samples William Barmash brought up were shown to Hyman and I—there were only small faults in them, which it was explained could be remedied—my brother and I did not get the £50 note from the bank—Solomon Barmash suggested that he had got an idea how he could get one—Hyman was there at the time—Barmash would not speak to me alone, he had nothing particular to do with me—he would not speak of any new proposition to me unless Hyman was there—he told us he had made an arrangement with Phillie Michaels to borrow £100 to open a banking account, to give Michaels four cheques post dated for four weeks, and as it would only take a fortnight to make a £50 note he would be able to meet the £100—I suppose the post dated cheques were for £25 each—this £50 cheque is not in my writing; it is similar to mine—it was determined that the money should be drawn out of the Royal British Bank, into which it had been paid to Barmash's account—I think this cheque is in William Barmash's writing—I cannot swear who got the £50 note from the Bank of England—I think I gave it to one of Barmash's girls to take to Southsea—I received it from Hyman—when the party returned from Southsea, they went first to Broad Lane—I used to see them everyday—</p>

               <p>one of the Barmashes came to our place every day—I saw the work as it was progressing up to the end of November—by then the work was being carried on at Mrs. Samuel's house—the notes were completed by the beginning of January—it was determined to despatch Mayer to New York to utter the notes—I was away when he left London—I went away at the end of November, and returned on December 21st or 22nd—I was here from then to the end of January—I understood that Solomon Barmash had lost the first £100 at cards, so he had to tell Goldman the whole of the secret, and asked for an additional £100—he offered him some remunera<lb/>tion for it—I think he was to have £300 for his £200—my brother and I were told that originally, but afterwards we were told that it was to be £400 for the original £200—Goldman said when he knew the whole of the secret that he must have good interest for his money—he did not say the amount—he eventually withdrew his promise, and Solomon Barmash had to offer him £600—Barmash was very angry at the time, but he had to give in—eventully he gave him £400 for his £200, in fact I understood he gave him more than that—I think £800 to £1,000 in forged notes had been given to Goldman for making the advance of the second £100—when the time for the American journey arrived, Solomon Barmash had not got any money—we were not supposed to give any for that purpose, that was Barmash's undertaking; but while I was away Hyman advanced £15 for Mayer's journey—my brother had access to the takings of 120, High Street, as well as I had—he was not exactly my partner, but we were almost like one—we trusted one another—we never had a quarrel—just before he sailed for America I got £35 in gold from the London and West<lb/>minster Bank on a cheque which I had obtained from Solomon Barmash—I do not remember in whose name the cheque was—it was Goldman's cheque—I went to an Aerated Bread shop with it, where I found young Barmash and my brother—I gave the money to them—we all three went in the direection of Cook's Office—they went in—I afterwards joined them in there because I wanted to buy a little American guide—the passages were taken, and next day they sailed from Southampton to New York by the "Philadelphia"—there were many arrangements made the night before they sailed, one of them was as to how they should communicate with me by cable—they were to cable to "Fulda, Compton Hotel, Liver<lb/>pool"—I went to Liverpool—I found a telegram waiting for me there, dated January 22nd, "M. refused going last minute, cable £20 imme<lb/>diately; try to prevent P. doing business, coming home.—<hi rend="smallCaps">H. BARON</hi>"—I returned to London—Barmash came to me—I showed him the telegram and had some conversation with him—I did not send any money on that day—two days later I received another telegram, "Bare cable, £20 imme<lb/>diate"—that had been sent to 1, Newcastle Street, my father's address—"Bare "was the code word which had been arranged—it meant un<lb/>favourable—I went to Cook's and cabled £20, to be paid in dollars on the other side—Solomon Barmash was supposed to help me with it, but he could not get it, so I got it—within a short time Hyman and William Barmash returned to London—I went and met them—they told me all about their failure—next day a parcel came from Southampton—I was</p>

               <p>not present when it was opened—it consisted of a cigar box containing the forged notes—between £10,000 and £11,000 had been taken to America—I did not count them when they were returned—it was taken away by one of Barmash's sons, who was waiting—I did not see the notes after that—the box had been opened in my brother's room—he told me he saw samples of them after that—I was away in the country about the end of March or beginning of April, and on my return Hyman told me that Gold<lb/>man had introduced a customer for the notes—no business resulted from that—Goldman was at 120, High Street, Whitechapel, ever since he was connected with Barmash—I went there in March, 1901—he came about July—he continued to come until I left in February—he used to make regular appointments with Barmash there—his runners used to bring him papers there—he is a bookmaker—he did not use the place for betting—I objected to papers being brought to him there—he said there was no risk attached to it—one day in April, 1902, I met him in the street—we went into a public house—he then owed me £10—I asked for a portion of it—he said he could not afford it, because old Barmash had ruined him entirely—I said, "It is the same with me, as regards Barmash"—we had a general conversation about the forged notes—that was the first time that he per<lb/>sonally disclosed tome that he had anything to do with them—I had known it all the time—he told me he knew I was in it, and I told him I knew he was in it—I removed to Plymouth about the end of October—I was arrested on October 4th—this book (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) was found amongst my possessions—it is in my writing—Hyman saw it at the same time that I did—he often told me to put down certain amounts—I cannot identify anything particular—some of the accounts refer to the forgeries—Hyman looked over it almost every day—I do not know if he ever saw the last page of it.</p>

               <p>know about the forgery—it was in Goldman's interest that he should not know, but I believe he would have preferred from the beginning to have known—I do not care if you have had another prisoner in the box—I do not see why I should tell lies, the matter is not so very important—Solomon Barmash told Hyman and myself that Goldman should not know that we were connected with the forged notes—Solomon told us that as it took such a very long time to take the numbers out of the notes Goldman began to suspect that that was not being done, but they were being manufactured, and he commenced to bother Solomon greatly about his first £100, then Solomon absolutely made a clean confession to him in order to obtain the second £100; that the notes were being manu<lb/>factured, that they would soon be ready, that he would want another £100 and that in compensation Goldman would get £400 for his £200—that was about Christmas time—Goldman promised he would give it to him the day it was required, but three or four days before the departure for America Goldman said he was not satisfied with the offer and that he wanted a bigger remuneration, and they had a quarrel—they came to terms—he was to have £400 for his £200 which would make £600 due to him—I think Goldman knew that Barmash had lost his first £100—I had frequent opportunities for conversation with Goldman, and during one of them he told me what a reckless man Barmash was in gambling with other people's money—I think that was before the whole truth had been told him—I told Barmash that I thought Goldman knew more about it than we thought he did—Barmash kept on denying it—I did not get any money direct from Goldman in connection with this transaction—I once got a cheque from him for £40 for my father-in-law—I gave him £40 in cash, and he gave me a cheque for it—he asked me what name I wanted it made out in—I said I was not particular—I had to send it to Nelson and he made it out in that name—I had to send it to Nelson as I owed it to him—it was nothing to do with the forged notes—I may have gone to Goldman to get another cheque to send away; I cannot remember it—letters used to come to Goldman at 120, High Street, but not in connection with his bookmaking business—he had his letters and papers brought there—they did not come by post—he used to pay his runners there in the evening to pay his men—I think he had a real bookmaker's business—I do not know if it was a large one—he was not making a large book compared to some people I know—when the telegram from America to "Fulda "came I had not a number of notes in my possession—I did not have any notes until the day they arrived from America—they were only in the house for two hours—they were brought into the room where my brother was, and taken away by one of Barmashes' family—I knew there were some left behind—I was not then preparing to go to Africa or Antwerp—I do not think I have ever been to Antwerp—at the time the telegram arrived at Liverpool I think Solomon Barmash was at home, but I do not know.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Highbury, and am an agent at 14, Monkwell Street—I met the prisoner last June, and he entered into my employment as a commission traveller—on August 1st I supplied Messrs. Norman and Stacey, through the prisoner's introduction, with goods to the amount of £7 3s.—on August 5th and 15th, September 6th, October 20th, November 13th, and December 5th I supplied them with goods to the value of £11 16s., £17 10s., £96 8s. 1d., £8 3s. 2d., £24 19s., and £26 1s. 4d. respect<lb/>tively—on October 14th I received from them through the prisoner £30 15s. 10d. in cash—that amount balances the first three items in the account—on March 26th he brought me a crossed cheque from Norman and Stacey for £20 laid., and said that the managing director had lent him privately £6-4s. 4d. out of it, and that I was to credit them with £20 and give him the £0 which I did—on April 16th I was shown three cheques drawn by Norman and Stacey on August 27th, 1902, on October 14th, 1902, and on February 6th, 1903, in favour of Teppish and Co. for £28 12s. 2d., £70 3s., and £37 9s. 6d. respectively—all three had been cashed, and the endorsements are in the prisoner's writing—he had no authority from me to do so—he never rendered me any account for those money—April 16th was the first time I saw the cheques—on March 16th this year he made out a statement of account showing £135 odd due from Messrs. Norman and Stacey—I had several conversations with him about getting the account settled, but he always made excuses—on April "16th I told him that I should go and see Norman and Stacey with him—strongly objected and refused to go with me—I went alone, and found at the money had been paid—I then went to the police and gave him into custody—since he has been with me I have constantly advanced him money—I took I O Us, from him for about £150—on March 2nd</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190304270091"/>
               <p>he gave me a bill for £135 to cover the I 0 U's till Christmas—since Christmas I have advanced him about £40.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WHITELEY</hi>. It is quite true that I have not paid him a penny for salary or commission, but he received small sums from the petty cash for expenses—I think he introduced fourteen agencies to Teppish and Co.—it is not true that I offered him £25 for each agency he introduced—he was not a partner in the firm, he was a commission traveller—when I gave him a reference, and said we were working "hand-in-hand," I could not speak English very well; that is a German transla<lb/>tion—I swear positively I did not know that he had received the three cheques from Norman and Stacey—he was always asking me for money—I deny telling him that if he got a cheque from Norman and Stacey he could go on with that—I told him if he got a cheque from them I would lend him some money—a Mr. De Brunet has invested £500 in my business—I have received a letter from his solicitor asking for the return of the money, but he has not been constantly pressing me for it—it is not true that I asked the prisoner to make out a false statement with regard to Norman and Stacey's account to deceive Mr. De Brunet—last Friday week I had an interview with the prisoner's brother—I did not then agree to withdraw the charge if he paid me £125—I wanted a written statement by the prisoner confessing his guilt, otherwise I thought he might have ground for bringing an action against me for malicious prosecution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have no wish to press the charge—I had an agreement with Mr. De Brunet, dated in November last, that his money should stay in my business for two years—I have paid him the interest due—no question was asked me at the Mansion House about my conspiring with the prisoner to deceive Mr. De Brunet by drawing up a false statement with regard to Norman and Stacey's account—it has been put to me for the first time to-day.</p>

I am medical officer in Camberwell Infirmary—on my arrival there between 12.30 and 1 on the early Sunday morning of March 22nd my attention was called to this case—the woman's head had been shaved—she had five wounds on the top of her head, three one inch apart—they were star-shaped—about three inches in front of them</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190304270105"/>
               <p>there were two more of the same charater, also one inch apart—the whole of the scalp was contused—on the right side of the face she had a con<lb/>tusion just beside her right eye—there was a hemorrhage beneath the white part of the right eye—both her hands and fingers were contused and abraided—there was nothing on the palms—she was suffering from shock and loss of blood—I concluded that it was a case of assault, and therefore communicated with the police that evening.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not think the marks on the hand were occasioned by being scraped down a wall—they were contusions, not abrasions—I did not see the woman's hat—I know Pepys Road—I do not know that there is a park near there—I think it is extremely improbable the wounds were caused by the woman falling on any railings—I do not think the wounds could have been self-inflicted—if she had fallen twice on the same stone she may have caused two wounds—all the wounds were inflicted by the same implement or article—they are precisely of the same character—she had been in the infirmary about forty minutes when I first saw her—she had probably had a glass of beer—the wounds were inconsistent with an ordinary fall—I think the wound on the temple was occasioned by a fall, that was a graze—if the wounds were inflicted on purpose I think they could have been caused by a piece of Macadam if it was put into a hand-kerchief and flung round—if the woman had fallen on a loose piece of Macadam she would have had to fall five times.</p>
