That the Prisoner came to Mr. Piver's House on Saturday Night after the Watch had been missing, and they bid her not be out of the way; that thereupon she came again on Sunday Night, and that they charged her very strictly with having taken the Watch, telling her, that if she did not tell where the Watch was, they would hang her; but if she would discover what she had done with it, if she had sold or pawn'd it, he would redeem it, and forgive her. That thereupon, though she had before deny'd that she knew any thing of it, she owned she had taken it, and thrown it into the Common Sewer, and sometimes she said she had burnt it; that she varying thus in her Story, he said to her, you know what you say, what have you done with it? That she deny'd that she ever took it, and that she was frighten'd out of her Wits, and that being carried before a Justice, she said she knew nothing of the Watch, and that what she had before said was in her fright.</p>

               <p>The Prosecutor depos'd, The Prisoner was a Neighbour's Niece, and used to visit her Daughter, that she had Reason to suspect that she had Robbed her twice, that the Tea Pot was lost the 24th of September, and the Ring lost January the 18th, that while she was gone out of Town, the Prisoner, as she was inform'd, came to her House, and having sent out the Maid of an Errand, there being only two Children in the House, and her self, she broke open a Wallnut-Tree Scriptore, and took the Rings mentioned in the Indictment; that when she came Home on the Tuesday following, she found the Scriptore was broken, and the Rings gone, and that the Prisoner owned the breaking of the Glass, and sent Money to pay for it. There were other Evidences to confirm this, and that the Rings were found by the Prisoner's Direction, where they had been pawn'd by her.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner did not deny her having pawned the Rings; but pleaded, that the Glass of the Scriptore was broken by Accident, by the Fall of a Curtain Rod; that the Board of the Scriptore behind the Glass was not broken, and that the Prosecutor's Daughter,

               <p>The Prosecutor depos'd, That the Sheep were feeding in the Field, and the next Morning he found only the Skins, the Guts, and the young Lambs, for they were both with young; but the Carcasses were carried away.</p>
               <p>A Watchman depos'd, That he was crying 3 o'Clock in the Morning, when he met the Prisoner in the Field with a Bundle, and demanded of him, what he had got? That the Prisoner told him it was old Cloaths, he being a Taylor by Trade, but he told him he must go with him before the Constable; that examining the Bundle, it was found to be Mutton, and he said he had found it at Black Mary's Hole.</p>
               <p>The Constable depos'd, That he enquiring of him what he did out at that time, he told him he had been to Hampstead for some Work, and getting Drunk, had lain in the Field, and going along found the Bundle, and it was Mutton. The Constable added, That as he was carrying him to New Prison, he desired to come back again, and he would tell him more about the Mutton; and owned, that himself and Foulks had been in four Robberies in stealing Sheep; that Foulks liv'd at Hampstead, that he went thither, and found the other six Quarters of the Sheep, the Prisoner having two found upon him.</p>
               <p>The Prosecutor depos'd, That the Mutton was that of his Sheep, and gave the following Reasons; that they had taken off the Skins so bunglingly, that they had left pieces of Flesh upon the Skin, and also had cut Holes in the Skins, and left the Wooll upon the Flesh, and that applying those Places the one to the other, they match'd exactly.

               <p>Mr. Harris, the Surgeon, depos'd, That he being call'd out of his Bed about 3 o'Clock in the Morning to the Deceas'd, search'd his Wound, and it went into the Right Breast, near the Pap, and touch'd the descending Trunk of the Vena Cava, and passed into the Cavity of the Breast, going slanting down on the Rib, and that it was the Cause of his Death.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Whitley depos'd, That the Deceas'd said to her, my Dear, I was not the Aggressor, Mr. Fitzgerald drew first; I thought of no Quarrel, my Dear, do not think me in Fault.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fitzgerald pleaded, That having been at Supper at a Gentleman's House, he was going Home, and being grip'd, went in to get a Dram, and there found Mr. Stone, and telling him he was out of Order, Mr. Stone took a Pen and Ink, and prescribed for him; that the Deceas'd was there at Play, and would have him play, but he refus'd, not understanding the Game of Cribbage, but did play with him at All-Fours for a Bowl of Punch, and the Deceas'd would have him play for another Bowl, but he desiring to be excus'd, the Deceas'd thereupon called him Rascal and Scoundrel; that he reply'd, that was Language he was a Stranger to, and he seeing the Deceas'd drawing his Sword, did draw his own, that after the Deceas'd had receiv'd the Wound, he said to him, you know it is not of my seeking, he answered no, and bid them let him go.</p>
               <p>He called a great many Persons to his Reputation, who gave him the Character of a peaceable, inoffensive Gentleman, not given to Quarrel; but had taken and born patiently such Affronts, as few others would have born; upon a full hearing of the Matter, the Jury <rs id="t17300228-29-verdict153" type="verdictDescription">
