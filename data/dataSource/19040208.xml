Hook, of Upper Thames Street, for 60 feet of 2—Inch belting, 60 feet of 2 1/2—Inch, and 60 feet of 3—Inch—I supplied him with the 2—Inch and 3—Inch; we had not the 2 1/2—Inch in stock—D. B. Hook are customers of ours—he signed the order as having received the goods in the name of W. Kempson—I am sure he is the man—I sent him round to our works at 219, Upper Thames Street, for the rest of the goods—I next saw him about a fortnight after<lb/>wards at Bridewell Police Station—when he called upon me he was with me for about five minutes—I looked at our books and saw that we had supplied D. B. Hook before—I believed this to be a genuine order.</p>

B. Hook, Upper Thames Street," written on it—in this pocket book I find "Ridley, Whitley, Newgate Street, and Cheapside, £4 12s.," and in another part of the book there is "G. Jackson, to-morrow"—in consequence of what he said I went to a lodging house in Barnsbury Street, where about a fortnight afterwards I found Bugden, who said that Brotherton was innocent—I showed Brotherton the receipts—he denied taking the order signed "Kempson;" the others he admitted taking.</p>

"What do you want it for?"—he said, "I am going away on the road in the provinces to find employment.

"For God's sake go"—he said. "Here is my address"—I said, "I will assist you if I can by sending you more money"—when he went in the morning Mr. Mason was disappointed with his work, so could not start the prisoner—I have not seen him since—he and his wife lived on bad terms through her—wherever they lived, she accused him of having something to do with the females in the house—she has caused one man and wife to be parted—the prisoner's wife has not said anything to him in my presence about work, but I have heard her abuse him—he belonged to the French Polishers' Trades Union—when he came to me on January 12th I said, "Can't you sign on for out of work pay?'—he said, "No, my name is erased"—his name had been struck off because he could not pay his contributions—he looked agitated and white.</p>

               <p>crown?"—he said, "No; are you sure?"—I said, "Quite sure; it is a very bad one"—he aid, "Give it me; here is a penny," tendering one—I said, "Ah, that does it; now I am sure that you knew it was a bad one, because you had a penny, although you gave me this bad half crown"—he made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at it, but I held it firm—he said, "You have got your penny; give me the b——money back"—at that moment I recognised him as a man who had previously given me a bad half crown—I think I said something to him about it, but am not sure—about November 5th a coin was tendered me for an article worth 4d., and I afterwards found it was bad—I carefully preserved it—I sent for a police<lb/>man, and the prisoner rushed into the street—I ran after him with the policeman—he was caught and brought back into the shop—I said to the constable in the prisoner's presence, "I am certain this is the man that gave me this bad half crown"(<hi rend="italic">The first one</hi>), "and I charge him with it"—he said he would own that the last one was bad, and that he brought it to me, but denied all previous knowledge of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I have known the prisoner for three or four months—I have seen him frequently during that time, and slept with him twice before we went to 5, Artichoke Hill—I had made him no promise with regard to living with him, and he had not asked me to do so—I went with other men while I knew him—I do not know if he knew that—he never said anything to me about it—on Saturday, January 2nd, I did not see him, but he left a letter at the George for me on the Monday afternoon—I got it that night—I saw him at 1.30 p.m. on Sunday—I was just coming out of where I live—we had a drink, and then I left him—this is the letter I received from him (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>) "<hi rend="italic">Dear Agg</hi>,—<hi rend="italic">It is all right.</hi> When I went down stairs that woman was not in, so I went out, and did not like coming back again, as you did not wish me to do so. I will be up at the George at 6.30 to-night, and again at eight. I hope you will get this, so as to be able to meet me for your money. P.S.—I suppose you will be vexed. Did you think I had sloped off on purpose?"—I had slept with him on the Sunday night at 5, Artichoke Hill and he had left me without giving me any money—after getting that letter I met him in the George, and we went to 5, Artichoke Hill to sleep there—we got there between twelve and one at night—I knocked at the door twice—the deceased came out—I said, "Have you got a bed for two nights?'—she said, "Yes"—we went into the front parlour—the deceased was there by herself——she said to the prisoner. "Are you going to treat us before you go to bed?"—he said, "Yes; what have you got in the house?"—she said, "I have got a nice drop of whisky"—he said, "Go and fetch it"—she went and got a big bottle and poured some whisky into a small bottle, and we drank it—she said again, "Are you going to treat us again before you go to bed?"—he said, "Yes," so she poured some more whisky into the small bottle—before we went to bed we had two quarterns of whisky between the three of us—before we went to bed at 3 a.m. the prisoner had his senses, and did not seem to be so very drunk—he paid the deceased 2s. 6d. for the bed and 2s. for the whisky—when we were going to bed he took a revolver out of his pocket and placed it on the corner of the table—we did not say anything about it—about 10 a.m., when the prisoner and <hi rend="italic">me was</hi> in bed, the deceased fetched up a cup of tea—she said, "Ain't you going to treat us?"—the prisoner said, "Yes, go and get me a quartern of whisky," and he gave her 6d., and 2d.</p>

               <p>—she went and fetched it—he took it from her and drank the whole of it; then she went down stairs and came back again and knocked at the door, and said, "Aggie, do you want soap and towel and comb?."—I said "Yes," so she went down stairs and fetched it—she came back and said, "The man is mad"—nothing had happened to make her say that—he said, "Get away;" then he sent for another quartern of whisky—I thought he gave her 1s.—when she came back he said, "How much does a quartern of whisky cost?"—I said, "Sixpence or eightpence"—he said, "She has fetched me back fourpence"—I said, "What did you give her?"—he said, Sixpence and half a sovereign"—I said to her. "Go and fetch the change back"—she was just against the door, and said, "Wait a minute; 'Gusta' has gone for the change"—that was Augustus Gunther—she went down stairs, and came back with two half crowns and two two shilling pieces, and gave them into his hand—he poured some of the whisky into a glass and said, "Drink a glass, Aggie"—I said, "I don't care for it the first thing in the morning," so he poured it all into the glass and drank it—I reckon altogether he had five or six quarterns of whisky in the house—he had three or four quarterns after we woke up in the morning—he got me round the neck and said, "Drink and wish Jack luck"—I said. "Don't be so silly; dress yourself and come out with me"—he said, "Come and lie on the bed a little while"—I said I did not wish to—I got up and dressed, and went out into the yard to the w.c.—I went back into the front parlour—there were three women there, no men—I was sitting on the sofa—the prisoner called out, "Where is Aggie?"—I said, "Here I am"—he came into the parlour—he had his shirt and trousers on, but no boots—he said, "Come up stairs"—I said, "Go on; you go up"—he went up stairs; I went as far as the top of the stairs—he kept getting me round the neck, so I left him—he had the revolver in his shirt pocket then—before that I had last seen it on the Monday night on the table—it was there when I went down stairs to speak to the three wome—before I went to the w.c. I said. "Ain't you going to give me no money? You gave me none last night"—he went over to his pocket and gave me £1 9s.—he gave me two shillings, <hi rend="italic">two</hi> half crowns, one two shilling piece, and a sovereign—I saw that he had four other sovereigns in his hand then—I said, "Be careful of your money; look after it"—I did not see him put the revolver into his pocket.</p>

My dear Mother,—How shall I begin, and what shall I say? You will, of course, have heard of this awful affair. I got away with bad company, mother, and went with a woman on Monday night. I remember having a little whisky yesterday morning with water. I came down stairs feeling very queer and dizzy in my head. The girl had left the house, so two other women told me. They got me into a room down stairs and set about me at once. Mother, I had a revolver on me, which I bought for the purpose of taking to Tasmania. Heavens help me, you can guess the remainder. I have a dim remembrance of some men being there, also; the strangest part of it, mother, my money was taken from me. I had it in my possession when I came down stairs. The woman I was with got nothing; but she knew I had a few pounds on me. Could she have told the others to put something in the drink to stupefy me, and then take this money? I must say it has the appearance of it. So see, mother, I don't even know those two poor women. If only they had let me go away quietly. Mother, think as little of it as possible. Don't take it too much to heart. It isn't as if I had intended doing it. I shall, of course, write again. God bless you, dear, and again don't let it affect you too much. Give my love to them all.—Your loving son, Jack"—he had not said anything about any men being there—he had not the appear<lb/>ance of a man who had been drugged—I was not present when Powell was searched at the hospital—I heard of some property being found on her—it was not given up—that which was found on the deceased was given to the Coroner's officer—I saw the prisoner write this letter—the writing on this postcard is the same.</p>

Have you been stealing letters for some time past, if so. for how long? Since May, 1902. Have you negotiated all the stolen orders yourself, or has anyone assisted you? My brother-in-law has assisted me. What is his name Bert Lewis, he lives at 102, Gainsford Street, Kentish Town. Do you remember stealing a letter addressed to S. Gardner &amp; Co., 1.

Have you given other cheques to Lewis, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, cheques taken from letters? Two or three; Lewis negotiated them. I should like to say that my brother-in-law first induced me to steal. Did you on the 20th May, 1903, steal the registered letter to which the "tab" produced refers, and did you sign the tab "G. Clarke?" "Yes, I changed the bank notes, somewhere near Charing Cross. What have you to say with regard to the letter addressed D. H. Evans, and which was found in your uniform trousers pocket? It contains a postal order 13/68 882312, 1s. 6d. and five stamps. I stole it. Were postal orders O/68 839388,20s., and C/75 005226, 2s., stolen from a letter and negotiated by you? They were contained in a letter stolen by me. I negotiated the 20s. order and Lewis the 2s. order. Was postal order G/66 408801, 4s., stolen from a letter and negotiated by you? Yes.

I gave it to someone to negotiate, but cannot tell who. Did you receive the money from the person to whom you gave the cheque to present? I did. What did this person receive from you for his services? I don't care to say. Were part proceeds of the cheque two £5 notes, and did you buy the postal orders produced with the respective notes? Yes.

On December 22nd I had a number of women picking sprouts in my field in Hospital Lane, Harlington, near Slough—I sent for the sprouts next morning, and missed fifteen sacks—the sprouts had been put into sacks by the women—I found on the field, wheel marks of a small cart, also these two potato bags (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), which do not belong to me—they had evidently fallen out of the cart—"Beesley" is the name on them—a few days afterwards Detective Sergeant Crutchett spoke to me; I went to the police station at Harlington and identified fifteen bags as those which had contained my Brussels sprouts—five or six had my name on them, and the others were plain—I have not sold any Brussels sprouts in sacks this season.</p>

I am a fruiterer and greengrocer at Isleworth—on December 23rd, between 9 and 10 a.m., the prisoner, who serves the same round as I do, came to me and said, "How are you of for Brussels sprouts?"—I said, "Well, I don't know"—he said, "I have got some, cost £3 10s. a load"; that is 3s. 6d. a bag; "if you like to have a couple of bags you can have two at what they cost"—I said I would—I took them and paid 7s. for the two; that was on the Wednesday—on the Thursday he came round again—I said to him, "If you've got a couple more bags of those sprouts, I can do with them"—he said, "Yes, you can have two"—he fetched me two on the Thursday night with his pony and cart, which I paid him for—I said to him, "Well, you had better take a little profit for your trouble of going to London and getting them"—he said, "That will be all right; if that will satisfy you it will satisfy me"—he said, "Whatever you do, don't lose the bags, because there is 6d. apiece charged on them"—he told me he bought fifteen bushels that cost £3 10s., and it was more than he wanted for his own trade—on the Monday after Christmas I took some potato bags back to Mr. Peters, of Kew Bridge, and amongst them by mistake two bags</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S and L.R.C P. On January 4th I was acting house surgeon at Guy's Hospital when Mr. Lane was brought there—he had a wound on the right side of the back of the head and one over the right eye; the posterior wound was a clean incised wound, going down through the tissues of the scalp to the outer part of the skull: it was not a fracture—the one over the eye was a little more bruising—I think they were both dangerous—but it would depend on the condition of the person's health, and if there was any dirt on the axe—the wounds were such as might be caused with a weapon like this—the one across the eye would probably be caused by some other part than the edge; it might have been thrown at him or the edge might not have struck clean—Mr. Lane remained in the hospital until the 13th—I hope there will be no ultimate injury, but it is impossible to be absolutely certain.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Defective Inspector, City.</hi>) On January 5th I was called on Cloak Lane Police Station to see the prisoner—I asked him if his name was Thomas Efford Schultz; he said, "Yes"; I said, "I am a detective inspector of the City of London Police; do you know the charge against you?"—he said. "Yes"—I cautioned him—he said, "I should like to write something"—I supplied him with paper, pen and ink, and he wrote this statement partly in the presence of his father, whom I had sent for—it was read over to the prisoner by Superintendent Staff—he made no reply—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi>) One morning last September I found a letter on my desk up at the office. Looking through it. I saw it was a letter threatening the death of some persons, and saying that whoever found the letter was to do the deed. That letter I put in my pocket and said nothing about it, because 1 thought someone was having a joke. The letter somehow fell out of my pocket at home, and was seen by some members of my family, after which 1 tore it up. A few days later a man asked me in Queen Street to go in the ironmongers there and buy him an axe head. I did not think much about a then but simply went and bought if for him. Since that time</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190402080062"/>
               <p>I have had two or three handbills given me in the street on which was written something like 'When you are ready to fulfil the requirements of the letter you had in September let us know by advertising in the Personal column of the <hi rend="italic">Daily Mad</hi> I am now positively sure that <hi rend="italic">the</hi> man who gave me the bills and the one who asked me to buy the axe are the same. On Monday. January 4th, I went to work as usual. About 11 o'clock I was going to ask Mr. Lane if he could let me go to the Ophthalmic Hospital about my eyes, when (he man mentioned above came in and asked me for some paper and envelope, as he wanted to write a letter to Mr. Lane. I told him Mr. Lane was in if he would like to see him. He said it did not matter; he would write him a note. I gave him some paper and a plain foolscap envelope in which I was going to send 2 s. to Mr. Stead's new paper. He handed me back the envelope sealed down, on which was written "Wait for answer." When he handed it back to me he said Take this, and fulfil the letter given to you a little while ago,' at the same time handing me a brown paper parcel which felt rather heavy. I thought he meant the letter that I was to give to Mr. Lane, so took letter and parcel in to Mr. Lane. While Mr. Lane was opening the letter I remember hearing someone walking behind me, and turning my head, saw the man come in the door, crouching down. He came swiftly towards me, and before I could hardly take in the situation he had snatched the parcel out of my hand and, as I thought, was going to hit me. I raised my hands to defend myself, but he ran round me and hit Mr. Lane across the head with it. I only have a very dim recollection of what followed. He then thrust the packet back in my hand, and I, seeing blood on it, I threw it away, and I think it hit Mr. Lane. I remember nothing more until I found myself in the Strand with the man who had attacked Mr. Lane. He said I had killed Mr. Lane, and, remembering the letters I had received and the packet I threw away, I thought it was true; so when he said I wanted some<lb/>thing to drink, and he would go and fetch it, I waited, this being just by the Charing Cross Post Office. I wanted there a long while until I saw some evening papers saying that a secretary had been attacked in the City. I immediately come to the conclusion that I was the person who had done the deed, and straight away went running oft. I somehow got to the trams over the Thames, which I followed till about 9 o'clock, when I found myself at Woolwich. I then went into a lodging house and went to bed. I woke late this morning, and walked slowly back to the City, where I decided I would go to the police and tell them everything. I sent a note to my mother, saying that I would, and then walked about the West End all the afternoon till this evening, when I gave myself up at the Cloak Lane Police Station. The man is rather short, very thin, but with rather a large face and very black eyes. I declare the above, although it may not seem so to be absolutely true—Thomas E. Schultz"—he was then charged, and made no reply.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Bedford Park, Croydon, and am a clerk at Messrs. Cox &amp; Co.'s, Army Agents, Charing Cross—on January 6th I went from Highbury to Broad Street Station by the 9.46 p.m. train from Highbury—I was in a first class carriage—when the train left Highbury the only other person in the carriage was the prisoner—he got in after me—the train ran to Dalston without stopping; nobody got in there—the prisoner was perfectly awake the whole time, and was watching me—when we got out of Dalston I turned to look out of the window—I had a hat on—before I knew anything else I became dazed by being struck on the head by an instrument—I did not know then what it was, except that it was very hard—I partially came back to my senses—I was wearing a watch in one pocket on this chain, and a sovereign purse in the other pocket—I had a couple of rings on—the prisoner and I struggled for some time, and then I found myself on the floor of the carriage—I was sufficiently conscious to recognise that it was a struggle for life—I managed to get up, then the prisoner came for me again—the last I remember is flinging him over to the other side of the carriage—he opened both doors, and while I was on the floor he tried to throw me on to the line—I do not remember his leaving the carnage—I perfectly well remember reaching Broad Street—I had closed the doors before that; then a constable came up, and I was taken to the hospital—I stepped on to the platform, and the policeman was fetched—I did not call for the police—when I got out of the carriage I was a mass of blood—I was treated at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, where I remained ten days—I am fairly right again now—there were eight wounds on the left of my head and a mark on my ear—I have a lump and the scars now—a link of the chain was found in the carriage—I remember feeling a tug at my chain—there is no truth in the suggestion that I made any attack on the prisoner—I did not speak to him or take any notice of him until I felt the blows.</p>

I am a solicitor and managing clerk to the last witness—I know the prisoner—he came to our office on October 1st, 1902—he gave his card, "Reginald Shawter, Kilford, High Street, Botley"—he first asked in the clerks' office for some particulars and conditions of a sale of some property at "Wandsworth"—I told him we had only the proofs; he said he wanted them for his brother; I said if he would give me his brother's address I would send them on when ready—he did not give his brother's address, but said if I would send them direct he would hand them to his brother—I sent him a copy on October 4th, but no business resulted—at the same interview, as he was leaving, he mentioned that he had had an accident with his motor car, having run into a woman in his neighbour<lb/>hood, and he produced this letter from her, claiming damages for injury: "I write to ask what you are ready to settle the accident to my wife for? She is very ill, and won't ever get over quite her shock and injuries; we don't want to go to law, but will take £50; if we do not get £50 we will instruct our solicitor—yours respectfully, Henry Norman"—the prisoner said that the claim was ridiculous, that he had not damaged her at all, but he had been fined for <hi rend="italic">scorching</hi> in the neighbourhood, and rather than let the matter get into the papers, he would pay a small sum, say £20—he offered to give me £25—he did not produce the money, but said, "Shall I give you £25 to see if you can settle it?—£5 was to cover our costs—I said it was no use my taking the money till I knew whether we should be able to arrive at a settlement, and I arranged to write Mr. Norman the same evening, which I did, and received his answer:" 48a, West Street, Fairham, October 2nd. Sir,—My wife has decided to accept the £20 offered by Mr. Shawter; I enclose her receipt, which is written by me except her signature, as she is too ill to write much.—Yours respectfully, H.

Bartlett, in full settle<lb/>ment of my claim against him for my injuries through his motor car knocking me down, Ellen Norman"—I wrote to Mr. Shawter at Botley on the 3rd for a cheque, saying the £20 would be accepted—he called on the 8th, expressing his satisfaction and handed me £25 in notes—the same day Mr. Bartlett drew and signed this cheque for £20, and I sent it off—it is pay<lb/>able to Mrs. Ellen Norman, and a form of receipt was sent with it to Fairham for her to sign—we got the receipt back on the 10th, and it was sent to Mr. Shawter at Botley—he wrote sometimes from 1, Garden Court, Temple—we received this letter about August 20th (<hi rend="italic">Thanking Mr. Bartlett</hi>

Sir,—I left the house, Prince of Wales, St. John's Wood, in June, 1903, and in July, 1903, the brewers, Messrs. Chandlers, Wiltshire Brewery, Limited, foreclosed on the mortgage on account of arrears of interest. I had paid £6,100 for the house of which £4,800 and £600 respectively were on mortgage. Of this, £250 was for fittings on valuation. I left the house in charge of my wife. I took no money with me, or goods from it. I understand that the house has since been sold, although I am still the licensee. The money obtained from sale of stock in trade and fittings and the cash in hand would be more than sufficient to pay off the brewers' debt and the sum due to your society. The money belonging to you was, in fact, left by me in the house in kind and in cash, and has been appropriated by the brewers, who should refund the money due to the benefit society to settle the claim of the latter. I am writing to the solicitors who acted for me when I was in London, Messrs. Batchelor &amp; Cousins, to direct them to communicate with the brewers and with the benefit society to settle the claim of the latter.—I remain, yours respectfully, F. GRACE.</p>

Sir; they are pure white, and the ring only wants washing out, and you will see they are"—the prisoner's hands were gloved—he had dark <hi rend="italic">suide</hi> gloves. I should say—after he left I gave his description to the police—after Mr. Bird said the stones were all right, the prisoner said he had to see somebody who owed him some money; he would be back again in half or three-quarters of an hour and buy a ring if it was a bargain—he left the shop so hurriedly that I asked Mr. Bird at once to replace the rings in their places—one was missing—this is it—I gave information to the police—I next saw the prisoner last Friday—he was brought to me by Mr. Bird and Sergeant Newell—he said, "This is a shocking position for me to be in, Sir," and handed me the ring—I replied, "A great deal more shocking for me to find that I have lost a ring last Monday after you visited my shop; how did you become possessed of it?"—he replied, "Oh, I accidentally found it on my finger"—I said, "How can that be when you had your gloves on?"—I asked Sergeant Newell to take him to Cloak Lane Police Station and charge him—it was a lady's three stone ring, worth £44.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> On February 1st a case was taken from inside the counter and two trays from the window—I am not quite sure who got the things; I might possibly have got the ruby and diamond tray from the window or Mr. Bird—I say the prisoner was gloved on both hands—that is from what I absolutely saw—I am speaking from memory founded on sight—the gloves were dark ones; I think they were <hi rend="italic">suide</hi>—on the 5th, immediately he entered the shop, he offered me the ring before saying anything or before I said anything—I may have said at the Police Court that he said, "It is a shocking thing, but here is your ring"—he may have put in that way—he did not say that he picked up his gloves or glove from the counter—he did say, "I found it accidentally on my finger"—those are the very words he used—I did not make a note of the conversation because there was a witness present.</p>

I am a clerk of the Great Northern Railway at King's Cross in the parcels office—I remember Harding bringing back a trunk addressed to "Pearson, 15, St. Gabriel Street, Newington Butts"—it had a passengers' advance luggage label from Scarborough on it—in consequence of what Harding. said I wrote to Pearson at that address, and received this reply (<hi rend="italic">A request for delivery</hi>), in consequence of which I gave instructions for re-delivery—I took special notice of the trunk, it being returned in that way.</p>

I told her to have nothing to do with the trunk, and I did not know that she had taken the trunk in until you now told me so"—I showed him this letter, signed "Pearson" (<hi rend="italic">The request for delivery</hi>) and said, "Do you know anything about this letter? I have examined the writing with some of yours, and I am of opinion it is iden<lb/>tical"—he said, "I cannot remember writing the letter; the writing is similar to mine; I will write my name and address for you"—I said, "If you do it may be used against you"—he wrote his name and address in my notebook, also the name of H. Pearson (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I then left—at 1.55 the following day, January 27th, with other officers, I saw the prisoner outside Aldersgate Street Railway Station—I told him I should arrest him for being concerned with his wife in stealing a trunk value £59, the property of the Great Northern Railway Company, on November 19th last"—he replied, "I shall take it all on my own shoulders; my wife knows nothing about it"—he was conveyed to Kennington Lane Police Station, and afterwards charged with his wife—the wife was discharged by the Magistrate.</p>

She said, 'Yes,' and that she had sent it back again, and that he then asked her if she would take it in the following day, and she said, 'Yes.' I met the man at Newington Butts, and he asked me to have the trunk sent back. I did so, and afterwards heard that the box had been sent to my place and taken away again. I told the officer that I did not write the letter"—he had a letter in his hand at the time—"because I thought it would be easier for myself to get out of it"—when he was charged he made no reply.—</p>
