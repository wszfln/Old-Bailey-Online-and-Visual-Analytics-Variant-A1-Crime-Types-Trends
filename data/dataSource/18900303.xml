                  </hi>. I am a banker, carrying on business at the Charing Cross Bank in Bedford Street, Strand—in October, 1884, the female prisoner called on me—she gave the name of Miss Annie Walton—she said she wanted to borrow £800 on two freehold houses at New Brighton, in Cheshire, which were left to her by her uncle—I told her if the security was sufficiently valuable I should be pleased to do it—after surveying the property I sent her to my solicitors, Messers. Taylor and Sons, to finish the matter—in consequence of their report I advanced the prisoner £800—I sent them the £800 to give to the prisoner on 8th January—on 1st July, 1885, I again saw the prisoner, and made her a further advance of £100, and on 22nd February, 1886, another sum of £200—I know her signature—this is the mortgage deed, and in the three instances she signed the name of Annie Walton—I advanced the money on the strength that she was the Annie Walton entitled to this property—proceedings were first taken against me by the real Annie Walton in May, 1888—judgment was given against me, and I was ordered by the Court of Chancery to give up the title deeds in, my possession—I have never received a penny of the £1,100; it has all gone</p>

               <p>—when the prisoner called on me she brought certain deeds relating to this property—they have been given up to Annie Walton.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. FILLAN</hi>. It was in January, 1885, that the £800 was got—I don't know what became of it—I don't know that £500 went to pay off a mortgage on a reversion; she told me she wanted it to-put into a pawnbroker's business at Liverpool—with about £150 of it she opened an account at the Charing Cross Bank, of which I am a proprietor—in June, 1886, the half-year's interest was not paid, and we pressed for it—I did not hear that the deed was not signed by Annie Walton till the end of 1887, about the 1st or 2nd October, when Annie Walton called on me with Mr. Potter, and said that the deeds in my possession were forgeries—Mr. Potter said that she was desirous of executing a proper mortgage to replace the £1,100—I do not recollect Mr. Potter saying that she had authorised Emily to raise the money; she did execute another mortgage—she said something in an off-hand manner about wanting to get her out of the difficulty—when the half-year's interest became due in April, 1888, I applied to her first, and she could not pay—there was a good deal of negotiation to try and raise money on this as well as some other property; they could not raise sufficient—she then consulted Messers. Miller and Miller, solicitors, and instituted a suit in Chancery to set aside the deed which she had signed in my presence—I did not know Miller and Miller; I did not like it, and I defended the action before Mr. Justice Kekewich in May, 1889; he set the deed aside—I was not satisfied with his judgment, and I appealed to the Court of Appeal; that Court upheld his decision—I afterwards took proceedings against the prisoner Emily—I do not think that Annie has treated me well in this matter.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 14, Overstein Road, Wandsworth—the male prisoner is my brother; the female prisoner is my sister-in-law—my uncle died in 1883—under his will I became entitled to certain property, consisting of the house 14, Overstein Road, and two houses at New Brighton, known as Belmont Villas—the title deeds of those three houses and the probate of the will came into my possession on the death of my uncle—I gave them to my sister-in-law—my brother was living with her at Liverpool—he took the deeds there with him in 1883—I consented for him to take them—I next saw them in 1884—he sent them by post from Liverpool; I wrote to him—I had them in the house in April, 1884, and my sister-in-law came over for them; they had come from Liverpool to live in Louvain Road, close to me—she said, "Annie, will you let John look at the deeds?" and of course I gave them to her—during 1884, '85, '86, and '87 I asked many times what had become of the deeds; I wrote both to my brother and sister-in-law to return them—I saw my brother about them many times, and he kept saying they were quite safe with him; I think that was year after year from 1884 up to the time of the discovery of the forgery—it was on 31st July, 1887, that I first knew of their being mortgaged to Mr. Carpenter—I never authorised my sister-in-law to raise money on them, or to pay off a debt or mortgage of mine; there is no truth whatever in that suggestion—in July or August I discovered</p>

               <p>something was wrong about the New Brighton deeds; I received a letter from Miss Hall, one of my tenants—the female prisoner saw it, and read it; this is the letter. (<hi rend="italic">This stated</hi>, "Mother is very anxious to know who she is to pay the rent to; Mr. Carpenter said in his letter we were to pay him, and if we paid anyone else he should expect it again")—I showed that to Emily, and she said, "Take no notice of it; it is a mistake"—I was satisfied with that—I asked her for the deeds, and she said they were quite safe in the house—that was the first time I heard of Mr. Carpenter—I wrote to John about it after that; I have not got his answer—I did not go to see him; he was at Liverpool at that time—I spoke to him about these forgeries on his return from Liverpool; I can't say the exact date; I think it was the beginning of August, 1687, and he said he thought he should have died of it, and that he knew nothing about it; he seemed greatly grieved about it—I know Emily's handwriting—the three endorsements, "Annie Walton," on this deed are not my writing—I never authorised any person to sign it; it is my sister-in-laws writing; I never authorised her to write my name there; I have never received a penny of the money—when they were living at 13, Louvain Road I did not visit them very often—I had an opportunity of seeing the way in which they lived; they lived very well—I don't know what my brother's occupation was; I don't think he has been doing anything for years; from 1884 to 1887 I don't think he was in any occupation—Mary Farrell is in my service—between 1885 and 1887 I frequently sent her to my brother's—I do not remember her being present when there was a conversation with my brother about the deeds—I brought an action against Mr. Carpenter, and recovered my deeds—I saw him in 1887—I did not want to execute a mortgage, it was only to allow them six months to replace the money—I went to Mr. Carpenter at the time the forgery was discovered, when some trouble began—the proposition was made that we should give them six months to replace the money—I was not willing to replace the £600—the prisoners were not authorised by me to raise money on these title-deeds.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. FILLAN</hi>. It was proposed that six months should be allowed to raise the money, and on that I executed the mortgage afterwards set aside—Mr. Carpenter agreed to that for the six months—in 1884, before this was discovered, I was very friendly with Emily, they had just come to live in Louvain Road then-when this legacy was carried to probate John Walton took my deeds, and got it carried through—he employed Mr. Rudd, a solicitor, of Liverpool, to do it; I never saw Mr. Rudd's bill—he returned me all my deeds—they were living at Liverpool then—Emily and Mrs. Smith, her sister, were staying at Louvain Road on a visit—they were not staying with me—I don't think Mrs. Smith was up in 1884—I received no letter from Somerset House in July, 1884—I received no intimation at all that succession duty had to be paid—I never in the presence of Mrs. Smith asked Emily to come to Somerset House; she did not go to Somerset House, come back, and tell me I had better consult a solicitor; I never heard anything about it—I never gave her my deeds to take to the solicitor to see after the succession duty—I did hand over the deeds to Emily at about that time—she said she wanted them for my brother to look at to refer to some tenant or something—I did not hand them to pass to Mr. Gillaume about the succession duty—I understood my brother had paid the succession duty before he handed</p>

               <p>the deeds over to me; I put every confidence in him to do everything—I always expected he had paid it—I did not give the deeds for Mr. Gillaume to be consulted; I never heard the name before—I have heard Mr. Nettleton's name; I don't know him personally—I did not ask John to see Mr. Nettleton—Mr. Nettleton did not refer him to Mr. Gillaume—in 1884 £250 was raised, through Mr. Gillaume, on the deeds of the Overstein Road property; I had one house there and two houses at New Brighton—I did not know the £250 was raised on the Overstein Road property till Mr. Nettleton's clerk called and asked me if I knew Mr. Nettleton, and I said, "Not personally"—he asked me if I knew there was a loan on the house, and he mentioned Mr. Gillaume's name—I arranged to go next morning—my sister-in-law was with me at the time—I heard then, for the first time, that my sister-in-law had forged my name to this property at Overstein Road; I did not know it at the time—it was not for me to pay this money to Mr. Gillaume; I had not received it—I afterwards arranged another mortgage with Messers. Nutt and Savory, and signed a deed mortgaging the property to pay off Mr. Gillaume; that was when my sister-in-law came over, frightened, and begged of me to forgive her—I forgave her, and made myself answerable for the Overstein Road property—I executed another mortgage to pay off Mr. Gillaume, although I never authorised my sister-in-law to raise the money—I went with Mrs. Inwood and Mr. Potter to sign this mortgage deed—I will swear I did not turn to Mrs. Inwood and say, "Will you sign for me, Mrs. Inwood?"—I don't remember it—I don't remember Mr. Potter turning to me and saying, "No, Annie; you must sign for yourself"—I signed it myself—Mr. Potter was a great friend of our family—I don't know that Emily was entitled to one-seventh of £12,000; she told me they had a reversion, but I did not inquire what it was—Mrs. Walton, Mrs. Inwood, and Mrs. Ward are sisters, and they told me they had a reversion—I did not know the sum, but I heard it was a large one—Emily told me she had £400 a year—I did not know there was a mortgage of between £400 and £500 on the reversion to Mr. Rogerson—she did not ask me to raise and lend this money, as Rogerson was trying to foreclose the reversion, and she would lose it—the did not tell me that she had raised this £800 and paid Rogerson out of it, and left £150 in the Charing Cross Bank—I received no cheques from her—a friend named Williams introduced me to Miller and Miller—Emily gave me no cheques for Williams on the Charing Cross Bank—she did not give me a cheque for £10 for Williams in the presence of Mrs. Inwood—I did not take it to the bank and have it cashed—I have not been in the bank since my uncle's death—I never said laughingly that Carpenter asked me how Miss Walton was—I know nothing about the other £100 or £200—Emily did not request me in Mr. Forbes's presence to allow her to raise a further sum of £200 or £300 on my New Brighton property—Mr. Forbes did not say, "You had better give her that in writing," nor did he write this out in my presence—I did not sign it—it looks like my writing—I am sure I did not sign it—I only saw Mr. Smith once; I know a little of Mrs. Smith, not much—I remember being on a visit to Liverpool in August, 1885—I and Mrs. Hall called on the Smiths—we did not have tea with them; we were only about ten minutes in the house altogether—they asked about the Walton—I did not say, "Very well; Mrs. Walton has been in a little trouble over money matters, but it is all</p>

               <p>right now; I helped her by getting a little money on the houses up the road"—that was the only time I saw Mr. Smith, I think—I did not know before July, 1887, that Mr. Carpenter was making some bother about the New Brighton property—the first intimation I had of the loan on that property was on 31st July—I was not trying to raise money from another person in order to pay off Mr. Carpenter—I did not ask my sister to do so—I did not authorise Emily and Mr. Potter to raise money from Mr. Martelli to pay off the loan on the property—I never heard of Mr. Martelli till came here—I never asked Mr. Potter to go and see Martelli—I don't remember writing such a letter as this; it is a mystery; I cannot understand it all—it looks like my writing.

Miller and Miller, and then I issued a writ to set aside this deed in May, 1888—Mr. In wood told me something about negotiations going on between May, 1888, and May, 1889, to settle the matter by raising money on my property—I did not agree to sign a mortgage for £800 to Mr. Carpenter; no appointment was made for me to sign it—I did not on the same morning say I would not—it was never arranged that I should sign a mortgage to Mr. Carpenter, or someone else, after the action was commenced; I never agreed to do so.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. FILLAN</hi>. The first conversation I had with. Annie Walton about the deeds was in 1886, she said they had got her deeds and her papers, and would not deliver them up, and had got money on them—she said it more than once—she never told me that she had not got any of the money, I knew that she had money from Mrs. Walton repeatedly, but she never said anything about it—they were living opposite each other, and were on very affectionate terms—I remember some time in July, 1887, going to Messers. Nutt and Savory's office—Mr. Potter was present,</p>

               <p>and Annie Walton—there was a deed for her to sign to replace the deed signed by Emily in her name for £250 from Mr. Gillaume—when the deed was produced Miss Walton turned to me and said, "Mrs. In wood, will you sign that paper for me?"—I felt rather startled at the time, and Mr. Totter said, "No, Annie, you sign yourself," and then she did—I asked her why she required me to do so, and she said she had a very had hand—she took off her glove and signed the paper, and there was nothing the matter with her hand—she said she had been scrubbing a floor, and had run some nails into her hand, which gave her a very bad hand, and that was the reason she asked me to sign the paper—she had told me she had met with such an accident, but did not tell me what it was—these letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are all Miss Walton's writing—also the signature to this letter.</p>

I first went to stay with the prisoners in Louvain Road in July, 1884—I stayed a few days, and went back again in November—I knew that Mr. Walton was absent during that period, and went down to the North in July, and he called on me there, and took his little girl, and went to Hexham—he was there some time; I think to the end of the year—I think he came back in October or November, when Annie Walton accused him of borrowing money on the deeds he at once repudiated it, and expressed his indignation, and said, "You knew where they were"—the conversation about the forgeries was only a few weeks ago.</p>

I am a publisher and author, and live at Clapham Common—I have known the prisoners over six years; I have not known the male prisoner have any occupation or means of livelihood; I know of his being connected with the Press—I was a friend of the prisoners as well as the prosecutrix—after the uncle's death, about seven years ago, I became acquainted with the prisoners; I met them first at the uncle's funeral—I have known Annie Walton twenty years—I bad known the uncle, Alfred Walton, quite thirty years; Annie was his housekeeper; ho left these houses to her, according to the will; I did not know how they were left—at the time of these disputes, as to the Overstein Road property, I was called in by the wish of Annie Walton, as a friend of the family—about August, 1887; she handed me a letter from Mr. Martelli—before that, in July, the Nutt and Savory business was done, the mortgage on the Overstein Road property—Mr. Gillaume wanted to call in his mortgage—Annie called at my house, and at my office also—she said Gillaume had called in the mortgage And was pressing for payment, and she wished another mortgage on the property, and asked if I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189003030011"/>
               <p>could aid in it; and I did—I was the means of introducing it; that was in August—Nutt and Savory surveyed the property, and were prepared to lend the money; and the mortgage deed was drawn up and executed—Annie Walton, Mrs. Inwood, and myself went to Nutt and Savory's to feign—when Annie was asked to sign she asked Mrs. Inwood to sign for her—I said, "Annie, you must sign for yourself"; and upon that she took off her glove and did sign—I did not notice anything wrong with her hand—mine was a friendly interference, strictly on her behalf—I never hoard anything about the original mortgage being raised without her authority, only that the one mortgage was to be raised to pay off another—about a fortnight afterwards, Annie came to me with a letter from Mr. Martelli, and said that he was pressing for payment, for some<lb/>thing to be done about the Overstein property—she asked me to negotiate a new loan on the New Brighton property—that was in September, 1887—I received this letter from Martelli, in consequence of which I went to see him with Annie, by her wish—she had heard from her tenant that the property was up for sale, and she wished to know what it amounted to; and I was to go with her to Mr. Carpenter—I was present when she signed the new deed—it occurred in this manner Mr. Carpenter wanted the money, and ho arranged that the new deed should secure him an interest, payable at the end of six months—it was a voluntary friendly transaction altogether—I don't think she said exactly that she would give them six months' time to pay; she said time was asked for to repay it, and the interest was to be paid in six months—I then went away, thinking that everything had been amicably arranged; and I said I hoped they had buried all family scandals—about six months afterwards, I under-stood that Mr. Carpenter began pressing for his six months' interest—she did not at that time ask me to negotiate a further mortgage for her; she did later on, during the progress of the action, and we arranged a settlement—I got a person to lend the money—a deed was drawn up for £800 for the reversionary interest and the balance, and it was signed by the three sisters—an appointment was made the night before for her to sign it; but we had a letter from Mr. Miller saying that he would not allow his client to carry on any negotiation whatever, and the matter fell through—at that time there was a Chancery suit before Mr. Justice Kekewich, in which Mr. Carpenter was defendant—he had to lose the money and pay the costs—I have heard that all the prisoners' family had a reversionary interest in a large sum of money—I never heard the amount.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, of 12, Trafalgar Square, Chelsea—I had another business as a house and estate agent, at 3, Gloucester Terrace, with which I had a communication by telephone—I employed the prisoner from March, 1887, to May, 1888, at a salary of 30s. a week and 5 per cent, commission on the business earned on at 3, Gloucester Terrace—his duties were to attend to the house agency business there alone; he had the sole charge there, with only an office boy—I lived in the house, and was there every day to see how the business was going on—his duty was to attend to any people that called, to account for any money he received, and give a receipt for it—if it belonged to the building department he would simply hand it over; if it was in the house agency department he would enter it in a cash-book which he kept for the purpose—if he received a cheque his duty was to hand it over tome, and enter it in the books—in May, 1888, his salary was raised to £2 a week, with commission, and he continued in my service down to September, 1888—in that month some matters arose between us as to a cheque for £42—in consequence of that I saw the prisoner at the office, and in the presence of Mr. Glazier, my solicitor, I then told him that whatever he did never to touch any cheques or write on them, but hand them over at once to me—he promised faithfully that he would never do anything of the kind—a Mr. Watson and Mr. West, executors of a Mr. Matheson, were clients of mine—I acted as agent and surveyor on their behalf as to part of the estate at Highgate—MESSRS. Southgate, builders, were employed upon it—I did not personally attend to that matter; the prisoner did—he surveyed the premises—he always reported to me what ho had done—he would record it in a journal, and I should see it from time to time—I took part in that, fixing the charges that were to be made—when the work was completed I directed the prisoner to make out the bill—it amounted to £13 12s. 9d.—he made it out under my direction, and I told him to send it in to Mr. Priestley, the accountant for the executors—I have never been paid that amount, or any money at all, from the prisoner in reference to that transaction—there was some correspondence with Mr. Priestley about it, in the prisoner's writing—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the account in the prisoner's writing, and this receipt for</p>

Scharien and Co.—I don't remember seeing the prisoner endorse it—it appears to be written with a different pen; he receipted the bill and I gave him the cheque—it has passed through the bank.</p>

On Saturday, 23rd February, I went with Mr. Scharien to East Road, Wandsworth, and took the prisoner into custody for embezzling £10—he said, "Pray don't do it, sir; have mercy, for my wife's sake"—on the way to the station he said, "Part of the money belonged to me, but I know I was wrong in taking it"—when he was formally charged he said, "I did not abscond; I was at Mr. Scharien's offices on Thursday last, and I attended Barnet County Court in a case in which he was plaintiff"—I searched him, and found on him two bills of exchange, forty-three pawnbrokers' duplicates, and 23s. 6d. in money—on 25th he was charged with forging the endorsement on the cheque—he said, "I thought that was the charge on Saturday night"—he was remanded on bail until the 5th of March—on that day he was called, and did not appear, and the recognisances of himself and his surety were estreated—I made inquiries for him, and on 24th January this year found him in the custody of the Ramsgate Police—I read the warrant to him—he said, "I am very sorry I went away, but I was in great trouble at the time"—I know that his wife had been recently confined.</p>

I am a carman, in the employment of Frederick Woodroof, of 54, Crutched Friars—on 7th February I was delivering tea with a van, and went to Herbert's, a tea merchant, to deliver three cases—I went in and gave my notice to the manager there; came out and carried in one chest, leaving two half-chests in the van—when I came out one half-chest was gone—I carried in the remaining one as soon as I could, and then coming out I ran down Ludgate Hill, and I saw the prisoner walking across Ludgate Circus, in the direction of Fleet Street, with a half-chest of tea in his arms—I stopped him and asked him where he had got it from; he immediately dropped it, and attempted to run away—I left the tea, and went after him, and stopped him—he said, "A man asked me to carry it for him"—a constable came up and I give him in charge.</p>

I was called about 1.40 to Aldersgate Street Railway Station, where I found Farrell in Serle's custody; he was handed over to me and the platform Inspector, who said he should be handed over to me till the arrival of Phillips, for being concerned with a man in custody in stealing a purse; Farrell made no reply—during the time he was in my custody he tried to escape, and succeeded in reaching a train in motion towards Moorgate Street, the other way to the Borough—to avoid an accident I let him get in, and got in myself, and at Moorgate Street I removed him, and brought him back to Aldersgate Street again, and handed him to Phillips.</p>

I am a son of the prisoner—on the morning of 20th February I went out about quarter to four—my father and mother were not on good terms at that time; they had been, quarrel ling that morning—my father was in drink when I left the house—I came back at half past ten—while I was out, at a quarter to nine, I saw my mother run from the house into the street—she stood there about two seconds, and then walked back again—I then went to my work, and returned after four in the afternoon—I went upstairs and saw my mother in bed—my father was in the room—I said, "Mother, what is the matter?"—she made no answer—about eight in the evening I was in the kitchen with my father—he said, "Alf, I threw the knife at mother"—he was cutting the skewers that afternoon, so I knew what knife it was—I had not seen him do it, but I knew by the chips about the kitchen—that was where the skewers were generally cut—no knife was kept in that room for the purpose of cutting skewers; a particular knife was used for it—this is the knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw it on the counter in the shop the same evening—there was no blood on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 102, Sloane Street—on 20th February, about half-past two, I was sent for to 59, North Street—I there saw the prisoner—he did not give me any details as to his wife's condition—I went upstairs to the room on the first floor, and saw Mrs. Lawrence in bed, Mrs. Morgan was with her, and I had some conversation with her—the deceased was far advanced in pregnancy—nothing was said at that time about the existence of a wound, and I merely treated her medically for premature labour, which I feared might come on—I left her, saying I would send some medicine, which I did—about a quarter-past six I returned to the house, and then in consequence of</p>

               <p>what I was told I examined her—I found a wound on the left side, midway between the navel and the edge of the ribs, about three inches to the left of the middle line of the body—blood was oozing from the wound—I dressed the wound and stitched it up, the vein was bleeding—at that time she made a statement with regard to the wound—I do not recollect saying anything to her as to her condition, before she made that statement—she was in an extremely debilitated collapsed state—from what I saw I suspected internal injury; a greater injury than I could see any external appearance of—I then left, and returned about half-past nine—I found her still weaker—I again dressed the wound, and again stitched it up—the condition was much more marked—I left, and saw her no more alive—on the 22nd I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of the body—I was then able to trace the wound through the abdominal walls, severing a large vein lying over the intestines, and passing through the left lobe of the liver—the direction of the wound was downwards, backwards, and inwards—the outer wound was about half au inch wide, and penetrated from about three inches to three and a half—there was considerable internal hemorrhage; there was from three to four pints of liquid blood in the cavity of the abdomen—death was due from exhaustion, consequent upon the hemorrhage caused by the wound—I had placed before me the dress, petticoat, stays, and chemise which were worn by the deceased on this day—I found in them the marks of a cut, through all the four articles of clothing, all caused by the same cut—three folds of the dress were cut through—the knife produced is such a one as would inflict such a wound—I should say it went up to the hilt—it is only sharp at the edge; the back is blunt—I think the injury could have been inflicted by a throw of the knife—if so, it must have been thrown with considerable violence—from the direction of the wound, the person inflicting it would probably be taller than the person on whom it was inflicted, and four or five feet from the person—I think sufficient impetus could be placed on the weapon so as to cause the injury; the woman being pregnant the abdominal walls would be tense, like the head of a drum, and therefore a knife like this would penetrate much more easily than if they were flaccid—I think it would penetrate the stays; it has a very sharp point, and would penetrate easily—the wound was necessarily fatal; nothing could have saved her—she made no statement to me on my first visit, showing that she was aware of approaching death—I do not recollect that she did so on the second visit—she felt very bad and very faint—she did not say that she did not think she should recover—I did not tell her that she was rapidly sinking—there is no whalebone in that part of the stays where the wound was; it is a thin part.</p>

I am a dairyman, of Seven Sisters Road—on 20th July the elder prisoner asked me to supply her with milk at Harold Terrace—that was the first day they were there—I saw them again next day, and she asked me if I could give her credit; I said that the last people who lived there owed me money—she said that her daughter was private vocalist to the Princess Maud, and the Royal Household was away, and that was why she was at home, and she wanted credit because her salary was only paid quarterly—I believed that and supplied them—the first quarter was to be on August 27th, it was not paid; I said I should write to Marlborough House to know—the younger prisoner begged me not to do that, and cried at the door; and the elder prisoner said, "Pray do not do that, as if you do you will ruin my daughter"—I did not do it—I afterwards met them in the street, and the younger prisoner said she had been to sign articles at Marlborough House with Col. Nolan, for her money to be sent on in a day or two—I went to the house in a day or two, and found this note in the empty milk-can. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that the Royal Family being away made it difficult to get the money</hi>)—I never got paid—the amount is £2 14s. 8d.—the mother told me that Lady Knollys paid her daughter—they afterwards disappeared from the place, and I could find no trace of them.</p>

Tathams and Pym—he gave me his mother's name as Mrs. Fanny Glubb, 13, Hill Side, Wimbledon—he said he was a gentleman, and, believing his representations, I ultimately gave him a cheque for £70, which was returned through my bank, paid—after that I asked him for a reference as to his identity—he gave me Frank Jackson, 40, Grace church Street, to whom I wrote, and have a press copy of the letter—after it was posted I saw the prisoner, and asked him how long he had known Mr. Frederick Manley Glubb—he said, "Seven years, first at Wimbledon and then at Walton on-Thames"—I said, "Do you know Mr. Glubb has a reversion under the will of Mr. Stephens?"—he said he believed he had, and that he saw Mr. Glubb the day before, and he was very pleased to be of some service to him—this is the press copy:—"Dear Sir,—Mr. Frederick Manley Glubb, of Walton-on-Thames, refers me to you as to his identity. Will you please call on me to-morrow morning?"—Thompson called next day, and asked for a further loan of £30 to make up the £100—I didn't advance it—he gave me a charge on the reversion as security, and gave me a memorandum—security was offered on a horse and cart and harness which he said were at his private house at Walton-on-Thames—I accepted them, and instructed Mr. Dalton to go to Walton on 28th December, and the horse, cart, and harness were left at my house, and I have had them ever since—"Parker Brothers" is on the wheel.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the Prisoner</hi>). I have been a domestic servant—I have not been in service at Mrs. Rackstraw's, Manor Road, Holloway, but I know Elizabeth Gill, the cook, there—on Saturday, 1st February, between five and six, I met Brown and Louch in the Holloway Road, not far from the Manor Road—I knew Brown—he said, "Good evening," and shook hands, and asked if I would do him a kindness by changing a cheque, which was in his hand—he said, being Saturday, the banks were closed, and he could not change it until Monday—I think he asked me if I knew Mrs. Rackstraw's Christian name; I said I did not—he said he thought it was Mary—he said he had lived in the Devonshire Road, opposite to Mrs. Rackstraw; he knew her very well, and he asked if I knew whom she dealt with, and where she got her milk, and who was her butcher—I said I did not know, and then he asked me if I would go and ask Lizzie—I went to Mrs. Rackstraw's—they followed, and waited down the road—I asked Lizzie, and she said if Brown wanted to know let him go himself—I went outside and told him—I waited outside with Louch while Brown went in—then Brown came out, and we all three went to the Friern Manor Milk Farm Brown, I think it was, told me to take the cheque in and say it was for Mrs. Rackstraw, and get the change for it—the two men waited outside; I went in, gave this cheque, and got the change, £7 3s.—I had not written anything on it—I gave the money to Brown, who gave me 3s. out of it—he then asked me if I would change him another cheque; he said he knew Mrs. Rackstraw's butcher in the Seven Sisters Road, and asked me to go in and change it—Wright, I think, he said was the name</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189003030049"/>
               <p>of the butcher—I went in; they would not change it—I went out and told Brown; he then, I think, took me into a paper-shop and asked me to write a letter—I went to two butchers' shops that day, the first was at the corner of Manor Road; I don't know the name of that one—I saw Lizzie twice; I went and saw her after I went to the first butcher's—the first butcher would not change it, because they did not think Mrs. Backstraw dealt there, and then Brown said would I go and ask Lizzie where she did deal—I went back and asked Lizzie, and she said she would not tell me; if Brown wanted to know, let him come himself—I told that to Brown, and he went back—he gave me the cheque before I went into the first butcher's, and then I returned it to him when I came out—I and Louch waited outside while Brown went to Lizzie—when he came out he asked me to go to the Friern Manor Road—we went to the butcher's after coming out of the milk-shop—I only went once to the milk-shop; we went first to the butcher's, and then to the milk shop after seeing Lizzie—we went to three shops, first to the butcher's who would not change the cheque, then, after going to Lizzie's, to the milk-shop, and then to another butcher's—I took the cheque for £7 3s. to the first butcher's, and afterwards changed it at the milk-shop—this cheque for £5 12s., which I think Louch handed to Brown and Brown gave to me, I took to the second butcher's at Seven Sisters Road. (<hi rend="italic">This cheque was drawn on the London and South Western Bank to Mr. Hudson or H. Brown or order, signed Louch, and endorsed W. Hudson Brown and M. Rackstraw</hi>)—I went with it to the butcher's shop and told them I came from Mrs. Rackstraw, and asked them if they would change it for her—they said they could not change it because they could not recognise me as one of her servants—they gave me the cheque back, and I came out and crossed the road to where Brown and Louch were waiting, and said they would not change it—Brown told me to come down the road, and we went into a paper-shop, where he asked the man for a pen, ink, and paper—he got them, and then he told me to write down what he said—this is the paper—"Please oblige the bearer with change for me, and oblige M. Rackstraw"—after writing that I think I wrote this endorsement, "M. Rackstraw," on the back of the cheque; Brown asked me to put that there, I think—the cheque was put with the letter in an envelope then we went back to the butcher's shop in Seven Sisters Road; the two men waited on the other side of the road, and I went in—the people then read the note, and asked me if I was Mrs. Rackstraw's servant; before I went in Brown had told me I was to say I was her servant, and I said I was—they said they did not recognise me as her servant—I had a hat on—the boy who goes round to Mrs. Rackstraw for orders was asked, and he said he did not know me—the boy was sent with the money, to Mrs. Rackstraw's; they would not let me take it—I left the shop, and told Brown and Louch they would not give me the cheque or the money—Brown said it would be all right—I went back to 5, Manor Road, to Lizzie, of my own accord, because they said they would send the money and cheque by their boy; she said she knew nothing about it—I saw Brown and Louch go past outside when I was in inside—the butcher's boy got there at the same time that I did—he said he wanted to see Mrs. Rackstraw—Lizzie said could not she take it up to her—the boy said "No," he was to give it into Mrs. Rackstraw's hand—I left the boy talking with Lizzie, and went to Brown and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189003030050"/>
               <p>Louch, and told them what had happened—Louch said, "I can get the cheque back"—then they left me, having asked me to meet them that evening at half-past eight, I think, and Louch said he would go back with me to the shop to get the cheque—I met them at the Nag's Head—we stood on the other side of the road to the butcher's, and they asked me to go in—I did not; I stayed about for some time, and Louch came up and said if I did not go in he would fetch a policeman, but I would not go in, and then at last Louch went with me, and I said, "Would you be kind enough to give me the cheque back?"—they refused.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Louch</hi> You were a stranger to me when I met you with Brown in the Holloway Road—I had never seen or spoken to you—you said nothing to me about cashing a cheque—when I came back from seeing Lizzie you said, "What have you done?" and I said, "I have put Mrs. Rackstraw's name on the back of these cheques"; you said, "Do you know what you have done? you will get us all locked up; if you don't get that cheque back I will call a policeman and have you locked up"—I was very frightened when you said that—when I came back from Mrs. Rackstraw's I went into a chemist's shop with Brown, and signed the £7 3s. cheque, it must have been—you were not in the chemist's shop when I signed it—I went to the milk-shop then with it, I think—they gave me £7 3s. for it, which I gave to Brown—he gave me 3s. out of it.</p>

I had last been a general servant at 4, Courtney Road, Drayton Park; I had left there three days—I had been there three months—a fortnight or three weeks before that I was at Pemberton Gardens—I was there six weeks; I only went to oblige a lady—before that I was at St. John's Park—I have known Lizzie Gill for eighteen months—about eighteen months ago I lodged with her at a private residence for servants; she was there about a week, and I for six or seven weeks—I was out of a situation then—my people live in the country—Louch hardly spoke a word to me on that day—I saw him and Brown together the next day, Sunday—Louch lived at Fonthill Road—I went home and slept with him on that evening—he told me there was a separate bedroom, and I might sleep there, and when I got there was only one bedroom—I stopped all night because I was so tired, or else I should not have done so; I came home next morning—that was the first time I had slept with a man—Louch tried to seduce me on that evening—I don't know whether he did—I had a home to go to, but not in London—I had lodgings in Rupert Road, Cromwell Road, since I left my last place, but I did not like them, and I told Louch I should not go back there—I cried, and said I had no home to go to; that was because I did not like my lodgings—I think when I made a statement to the Sergeant who arrested me on the 3rd that I told him nearly all the truth; I tried to—he did not hurry or frighten me—when I met Brown I had a conversation with him, and then went into a butcher's shop, where they refused to cash a cheque; then I went and had a conversation with Lizzie while the two men waited outside; after that Brown asked me to go to Manor Farm, and I went and cashed the £7 3s. cheque—I did not know when I first met the two men where Mrs. Rackstraw got her milk—I saw Lizzie first, and changed the £7 3s. cheque afterwards—before the Magistrate's inquiry I knew I had twice committed forgery in these transactions—I did not say a word to Mr.</p>

               <p>Bromby about going into the chemist's shop and forging one of these endorsements, because I had forgotten it—I am certain I did it now you speak about the chemist's shop—I first spoke about it when Louch mentioned it just now—I handed the £7 3s. to Brown alone—I think I said to the policeman, "I handed the money to Brown and the other man"—when I handed the money Brown said, "I will buy you a pair of gloves"; Louch did not say so; I don't remember him saying anything—I think it was when I came out of the chemist's shop that Louch said, "What have you done?"—and I said, "I have just been putting Mrs. Rackstraw's name on the back of these cheques"; that was after I saw Lizzie, and before I went to the Friern Manor Farm Dairy—he did not say about us being locked up till after I had changed both cheques—it was before I went to the dairy and changed a cheque he asked what I had done, and I said I had signed Mrs. Rackstraw's name—I handed the £7 3s. to Brown in Louch's presence—the chemist's shop is against the Great Northern Hospital in the Holloway Road—an elderly gentleman was serving in the shop when I signed the cheque—Louch said nothing after I had changed the first cheque; if he had said anything I should not have changed the second one—Brown did not mention Louch's name when I first met them—I did not know the cheque was one of Louch's—I swear that when I came to where Lizzie is in service I did not say, "I am going to see if Lizzie is coming out to-night"; I knew she could not come out on Saturday night—I asked her who Mrs. Rackstraw's butcher was, and she would not tell me—she said when I asked her, "Bartlett's, Seven Sisters Road; it used to be Bartlett's, but it is not now, some one else keeps it"; she refused to tell me the right name—when Brown spoke to her, I and Louch were just outside the gate; he was down the area-steps, as far from us as I am from you—I could not hear what was said—Brown dictated the letter to me in the stationer's shop; I think there were one or two other customers in the shop—Louch was waiting outside; I don't remember his coming in the shop; he did not come in at the time; he might have come in afterwards; I did not notice it—I did not notice him in the shop at the time the letter was being dictated—I don't remember if he was in the shop—after we left the stationer's, and before we got to the butcher's, they were telling me to say I was Mrs. Rackstraw's servant—J think Brown told me that; I am not certain; I am sure Brown said it—I did not see anything of Louch after the Sunday evening till they were at the police-station—I saw Lizzie, Louch, and Brown on the Sunday night—I don't remember hearing Lizzie ask whose cheque it was, nor Louch saying, "It is my cheque, and it is all right," or words to that effect—Louch did not say, "It is no concern of anybody else's what I choose to do with my cheques," or words to that effect—I don't remember whether that was said or not.</p>

I am a stationer, of 546, Holloway Road—on 1st February the three prisoners came to my shop about four o'clock, or it might have been earlier the first time; they came twice—the first time one of them, I could not say which, bought a pennyworth of writing paper and envelopes, and one of them wrote something, and they went away—I cannot say if other customers were there at the time—about half-past seven I think they all three came in together, and wanted a sheet of paper and an envelope—it is a small shop, and with three people in it is crowded; I have a stall with toys outside, and I stood at the door while they were writing—I heard them say nothing to one another; something was written, and this blotting-paper was used; there is Louch's signature and the name of Rackstraw on it; I do not know who wrote—then they all went away—I could not say Brown ordered the goods—I could not say who did; all I remember is that on the second occasion Brown paid 2d., and I gave him 1 1/2 d. change—I could not say who paid on the first occasion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Louch.</hi> You were all three in the shop on the first occasion about half-past four, and you all three came in together on the second occasion—I have seen Mrs. Brown downstairs here—she and her solicitor have not been at me—I am positive you bought paper and envelopes twice—I don't know what you wrote—you did not speak to me in the shop—you were not talking to me at the door when you all three came.</p>

When they wrote something in the afternoon it was on one of my sheets of paper, but I cannot say what they wrote—it is not unusual for people to buy a small quantity of paper and envelopes, three or four a day do sometimes—I don't remember if Louch said anything to me on the second visit—one of them had a parcel under his arm—the writing was going on six feet</p>

               <p>from me, I suppose—they were only there a couple of minutes perhaps—I don't think any customers came during that time; I could not be positive—I heard no conversation; what was done was done in silence; I could not have helped hearing it if there had been conversation.</p>

                  </hi>. On 1st February I was servant to Mrs. Rackstraw, of 5, Manor Road—I have since left there—I lodged with Skitter at a servants' home there used to be in the Holloway Road for those waiting for situations—I have known Brown for about four months—on 1st February, about half-past five, Skitter came down into the kitchen and said, "I have met that fellow and another man you know, I think his name is Brown; he has got a cheque that wants changing, and if you give me the name of the butcher where you deal in your mistress's name I think it will be all right"—I said, "Bartlett's, in the Seven Sisters Road; tell him to come himself"—I did not think he would come—the butcher had been Bartlett, but a fresh man had come whose name I did not tell Skitter—I said I would tell Brown if he came—Kate went away, and Brown came—I don't remember if Skitter told me what she had been doing before she came to me—she went away, and came back with Brown and Louch—she and Brown came to the door; I saw Louch outside—Brown asked me where the butcher we dealt with was; I said, "Wright, in Seven Sisters Road"—he had taken Bartlett's shop—I think Brown said he had a cheque he wanted changed—he said, "Do you think if I sent Skitter to change the cheque in Mrs. Rackstraw's name it would be all right"—I said, "Oh, you had better not"—he asked me if we had any old bill of any kind that wanted paying"—I told him the bills were all paid yesterday—they all three went away together—later on Skitter came back, and Wright's, the butcher's, boy came about the same time—she came in and shut the door, and he remained outside—she said, "Lizzie, you know nothing about it; I have been to try to change that cheque at the butcher; take the money, and say you will take it to Mrs. Rackstraw"—I was to say that to the boy who was outside the door; I thought what he was there for—she told me I was to take the money that she changed the cheque for—she said, "He has brought the money"—she did not say why—she said the butcher would change the cheque, but he would not let her have the money—I said I would not—I opened the kitchen door, and saw Brown and Louch outside the railings, and the boy was standing at the door—I spoke to the boy—he would not give me the money—I went back to Skitter, and said, "He won't let me have the money"—she said, "I wish I had not done it"—then I told the boy to take the money and the cheque back, "for, "I said, "Mrs. Rackstraw knows nothing about it"—Brown and Louch were a good bit off me while I was talking to the boy—Brown waved his hand to me; that is all I saw—Skitter went away—she came again afterwards, and said, "I have come to see if they have brought the cheque back; if they have not brought it back it will be all right, because Brown knows the foreman at the butcher's."</p>

               <p>and my notice had a fortnight to rim—I did not stay my fortnight; I came away on the Monday, Mrs. Rackstraw said I had better go, she did not like it—I could see there was something wrong with the cheque when Skitter came back—I understood from her I was to give the money to her and not to Mrs. Rackstraw, when the boy had gone—I proposed to the boy to give me the money—I knew I was helping what was wrong Skitter did not hear what I said to Brown when they talked about the butcher; she said, "Here he is," and went away, and she and Louch stood outside the railings—there is a garden in front of the house—Louch did not speak to me—he did not say in my hearing, "It is my cheque, and it is all right"—I did not hear him say anything to Skitter about the cheque—I heard no talking about it—no one said in a joking way, "Shall I pay a bill for you?"—nothing was said about the cheque having nothing to do with Brown—I have known Brown about four months—I don't know he has money expectations, or that he was born and brought up in the neighbourhood of Holloway, or that his people have been there a great many years; I know nothing of him except as a casual acquaintance—I first knew something was wrong when Skitter and the butcher's boy came—nothing led me to suspect anything till the boy came.</p>

I am the wife of William Beaver, butcher, of Seven Sisters Road—the name of Wright is over the shop, and it is known as Wright's shop—Mrs. Rackstraw, of 5, Manor Road, is a customer—on the evening of 1st February Skitter came in and said, "Will you cash" or "change this cheque for Mrs. Rackstraw?"—I communicated with my husband, and he said to Skitter, "Are you Mrs. Rackstraw's servant?"—she said, "Yes"—he said, "Go and fetch a note from Mrs. Rackstraw"—she went away, and after about twenty minutes she came back with this note, "Please oblige the bearer with change for me, and oblige M. Rackstraw"—I did not think it was Mrs. Rackstraw's writing—I sent the money by one of our men—I said to Skitter, "Our young man doesn't recognise you as Mrs. Rackstraw's servant"—she said, "No, he would not know me; I am the housemaid; it is the cook he knows, the stout one"—I said, "How long have you been in Mrs. Rackstraw's service?"—she said three months—the young man went off with the cheque and money, and brought them back—I detained the cheque.</p>

I am the wife of Robert Gray—we did live at 19, Grosvenor Street, St. Peter Street, Islington, I am now living at number 27, a few doors lower down—the deceased, Theresa Neal, was my daughter; she was 24 years of age on the 16th April last—she was the prisoner's wife; they were married on 25th November, 1883; they had five children, the youngest was five months and four days old; that was the only one they had with them—one was with Mr. Dawson, and the remaining three were with Mr. Beasley—there were six children, but only five were my daughter's—after the marriage they lived at different houses, and finally at 25, Parkfield Street, and then at 81, St. Peter Street, Islington—they lived very wretchedly together; they had terrible quarrels; he attempted her life twice, and he has repeatedly assaulted her; he cut her down with a large stick on several occasions—in October last I was witness of an assault by him upon her; she had only then been four weeks confined with her last baby; I attended her during her confinement—I was in the kitchen with the children; I heard words, and ran upstairs, and ran between them; he knocked me down, and threw her from the parlour into the passage, and then threw me on the top of her; he assaulted me with a large stick, and I prosecuted him</p>

In consequence of what I heard on the morning of 28th January, about eleven, I went to the second floor front room of 81, St. Peter Street—there was a bed on the floor, against the wall of the next house, 83—there was a quantity of blood on the top sheet, at the head part of the bed, also a quantity of blood on the floor,</p>

               <p>just at the foot—there was also a quantity on the wall, as if it had been spurted, about two feet above the bed, near the head—just behind the door I found the bloody prints of a hand—I found this hammer in the room, lying on one of the chairs, about a yard or a yard and a half from the bed; there was a stain of blood on the handle—that same night, about eleven, the prisoner was handed over into my custody at the Dalston Police-station—I told him he would be charged with the murder of his wife—he replied, pointing to Huntley, "That is what he tells me"—I conveyed him to the Police-station in Upper Street, Islington—the charge was entered, and read over to him—he then said, "I ain't guilty"—the knife was handed to me by Huntley—I saw stains of blood on it—the prisoner was wearing this hat—I saw the stains on it—I called the prisoner's attention to them, and on the knife, and told him they were blood stains—I talked very loud to him, as he is very deaf—he made no reply.</p>

I am a shoe manufacturer, of Northampton—about the middle of last July Lester called at my place, and handed me a card bearing the names of "Mears and Lester, Factors and Agents, 13, Bow Lane, London, E. C.; cash advanced on consignments for sale"—it was similar to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said they were shipping agents, and were doing a large business in the shipping line—he ordered £13 10s. worth of boots—on 23rd July I went up to 13, Bow Lane, where I saw the prisoner—it was a small office, stocked principally with boots—"Mears and Lester "was on the glass door—I told the prisoner who I was, and he said he had heard of me through Lester—he said they were doing a tolerably good business in the shipping line, and he introduced a strong nailed boot to me, and asked what I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189003030062"/>
               <p>thought of it—I told him I thought it a very good boot, but rather rough—he then said they wanted someone to manufacture a smarter nailed boot, and asked me if I could introduce them to a house—he said, when we were alone, that Lester did the buying principally, and that he, the prisoner, was the principal partner who found all the cash—Lester came in and looked at my samples, and then gave me an order for £44 2s.(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) written by the prisoner—I executed the order, and sent it off from Northampton, on 30th July, to 13, Bow Lane—for the first order I received a cheque post-dated two or three days, which was met—for the second I received a bill at two months, which was met—in August Lester came to my factory at Northampton, and gave me another order, which he said he wanted for shipping agencies—they were principally made in sample dozens for shipping agents—I showed him eighteen pair of men's Bals split and forty pair of men's military, which I had in stock, which he ordered to be sent on—he said he hoped we should do a large business together, as he could sell any quantity of these low-priced boots—he said they were cash transactions as a rule—the third order was for £27 12s. 6d.—I executed it, and consigned them on 29th August, and sent an invoice similar to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is a sample of the forty pair of split at 4s. 3d., and these are the military (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I received a bill in respect of this order, dated 17th September, at two months, "Accepted, payable at the Union Bank of London, Limited; accepted, Mears and Lester"—I had no further transactions with Lester—on 21st November I received this letter, the bill falling due on the 20th:—"13, Bow Lane, London, E. C. November 21st, 1889. Memorandum from Mears and Lester (<hi rend="italic">Mears scratched out</hi>). To Mr. W. Baker, Northampton. Dear Sir,—I have been about Northampton for the last few days, and forgot to leave cheque for your bill due yesterday. Of course, you understand since the dissolution the account of Mears and Lester has been closed, and transferred to me only; and when a bill is due to the old firm I must put in cheque for same. Please let me know at once who holds the bill, and I will forward draft for the same lam very sorry for this," etc.—"<hi rend="smallCaps">H. LESTER. "</hi>—I telegraphed, "Your letter to hand; send bank draft on immediately"—I think Lester telegraphed to the bank, and I again telegraphed to Mears and Lester that I had the bill, and to send bank draft by next post without fail, to which I received no answer—on the following Monday, 25th November, I went to London, and to 13, Bow Lane, where their name was still up; I found a small boy there, and the office in a very indifferent state; there were a few pairs of boots and some empty cases or <hi rend="italic">cartoons</hi>—I went the next morning at nine, and stayed till ten, when the small boy came—I waited till one o'clock, when the boy went to dinner—Lester and another gentleman came in; Lester said, "Hallo, Baker! how are you?"—I said "Better in health than in temper"—"Oh," he said, "I will talk to you in a minute"—we went outside the office, and he said, "Have you come up this morning?"—I said, "You know I have not"—"Oh," he said, "you were up yesterday?"—I said, "You know when"—he said, "I sent your cheque on last night for that bill to the bank"—I asked him to show me the counterfoil in his cheque-book to convince me—he refused—I asked him for his private address, and he said he would not be dictated to, and would not tell me—I then telegraphed to my wife, to which I received a reply—I went</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Croat-examined.</hi> I cannot read writing very well—I believe the £13 10s. transaction was a post-dated cheque—I had not known Lester before—he represented that he understood the boot and shoe trade—you can tell as a rule by the way they handle them—I only saw Mears once—I joined in the prosecution—the solicitor at Northampton was Mr. Phillips, of Pugh and Phillips—Franklin, Vicars, and Fairey joined—the first examination took place on 4th December—I saw Mears once before the prosecution was launched—I was in Court at the hearing on 23rd December, and allowed my solicitor to apply for a month's adjournment—we were not consulted—I left the matter in Mr. Phillips' hands, in whom I had every confidence—on 4th January I saw the prisoner alone at my house, 52, St. Andrew Street, Northampton—he stayed about an hour—I saw him again on the 11th—I do not know that he had supped with Franklin the night before—on 14th January there was a meeting at Franklin's house, of Franklin, myself, and Vicars—I did not hear it said that the man we wanted to punish was Lester, and if Mears would pay £30 and costs the prosecution would be withdrawn—there was something said about payment and withdrawing the case, and that the person they wanted to punish was Lester—Mears asked whether, if he paid eight shillings in the pound and expenses, we would withdraw—that was on the 11th—there was no statement as to costs; a rough sum of £30 was mentioned—we did not agree to it—we told him we could not settle the matter in that way, but we would consult our solicitor, and let him know further on—I believe a solicitor from London, representing Mears, saw Mr. Phillips at Northampton on the 13th, and on the 18th Mr. Phillips communicated to us that eight shillings in the pound and £50 costs had been suggested—we did not object—I was told that bonds would be deposited, when the month had expired, by Mears or his friends, to secure payment of the eight shillings in the pound and £50 costs—I was in Court when Mr. Phillips applied to the Mayor and Bench to further adjourn the hearing of the charge for fourteen days—I believe he made the application before I was informed of the bonds—on 31st January I attended a meeting of the prosecuting creditors at Mr. Phillips's office—Franklin, Fairey, and the two Vicars were there—one of us said to Mears, "We must have cash for £50, the bonds will not do"—he said he had got £30; I don't remember his saying it was from the sale of his furniture—he said he would raise the other £20 by the following Monday morning, and the £30 was paid to my solicitor, for which he gave a receipt—I never saw the bonds; I heard the £20 had been paid as arranged—he wrote something, but I could not see what—I was informed during the day that Mears had drawn two bills—I believe the Bench said they should have to consult the Public Prosecutor—I did not see the bills, or know that my name appeared on them till last Thursday—the case was further adjourned from the 3rd to 12th February—subsequently the £50 and the two bills were returned to Mears, and a committal took place in consequence of the interference of the Public Prosecutor—I did not hear Phillips state that Lester was the guilty man, and that Mears was his dupe—I</p>

What-right have you here?"—he said, "Look here, old fellow, I am going to employ Sir Henry James or Mr. Lockwood, and it will cost me £500"—I did not know on 11th January that terms had been proposed of 5s. in the pound and £30 costs; it had not been proposed to my knowledge; Mr. Mears offered to pay us instead of paying counsel, which would have come to 13s. in the pound—I do not think Mr. Phillips was standing out for 8s. in the pound and £50 costs—£30 in cash and £20 the following Monday was proposed with my consent, on the understanding if the thing could be done honourably without defeating the ends of justice—I saw him sign two bills in Court while the Bench had gone out—George Henry Smith is in my employment, he lives in Barton Terrace—I did not pay him for sending a telegram to Mears, saying that unless £100 was paid on Monday there would be no surrender—I never knew that it was sent, and never asked anyone to send it—we expected more than £100—I saw the receipt for £30—the refusing to refund the £50 was discussed between four of us—we told Phillips to do what was right until somebody told him what to do with it, and he asked the Mayor of Northamp</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of South, Son, and Whitcomb, of 18 and 19, Bishopsgate Avenue—I have known a man named Lester some years; he was employed by Mr. Nicholls, the auctioneer—from time to time I have received consignments of goods from him to sell by auction, and boots among other things in June last—I know the prisoner as Lewis; Lester told me that was his name, and called him his man—Lewis came to me after June, and from time to time, and I addressed him as Lewis; he did not say that that was not his name—he used to come to me about consignments of goods by Lester—the first record I have of his coming is on July 30th, when he came with this consignment note (<hi rend="italic">For twelve pair of boots</hi>)—I handed him a cheque for £4; it is endorsed, "H. Lester"—on August 29th the prisoner brought this consignment order (<hi rend="italic">For eighty-four pairs of children's boots, forty-eight pairs of Levant, and twenty-four pairs of Balmorals.—Signed</hi>, <hi rend="smallCaps">H. LESTER</hi>)—I handed him this cheque to Lester or order, for £31 4s., which Lester has endorsed—. on 2nd September the prisoner came and I handed him £11 4s. 3d. for goods consigned by Lester on authority which I had received from Lester—on 5th September is the next consignment note—I do not think the prisoner brought them forward again—they were delivered by van, and I made an advance of £21 that day—all the goods on which I made an advance I sold by auction without reserve, even those on which I may have paid the railway carriage—the goods of September 5th were sold by auction on September 11th—among the things so sold were fifty-two pairs of military boots, some rivetted and some slit; they were purchased at 3s. 8d</p>

               <p>per pair, by Owen, a dealer—I never saw the bought invoice of those goods, and had no notion that they had been invoiced at 4s. 5d. and 4s. 6d.—on the same day I sold some of the Balmorals at 3s. 11d.; I had no notion what the invoice price was; we considered we got the full auction value, but we have to allow for a big trade discount; very often we get more than first-hand value—we have an auction every Wednesday, and it sometimes happens that we sell goods within six day 3—about the middle of October we declined to sell any more goods for Lester—there were many sales for Lester between the 11th and 27th September, all boots and shoes—the proceeds were given to Lester, if we had not advanced it; if we had, we gave him the balance, if there was a surplus—on September 27th I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">Signed John Mears, giving notice not to part with the goods and money held in the name of Lewis</hi>)—I did not identify the writer's name; I daresay I had £100 in hand at that time belonging to Lester; he called that day or the next; I read the notice to him, and asked him the meaning of it—he said that the writer of it had no power to stop the money—I asked him the man's address—he said Northampton Street, Islington, and that his name was not Mears, but Lewis—he said that he and Lewis could not agree, I think—he said that Lewis had been drawing more money than he ought, and he had been down to the bank, and seen the manager about the account—it was left on my mind that they were in partnership, notwithstanding what I had heard of Lewis; I do not remember anything being said about dissolution—between 27th September and 11th October I received more goods from Lester—after receiving the protest I declined to hand Lester any more money, and I wrote to Mr. Lewis (<hi rend="italic">Stating that unless he received documentary evidence by twelve o'clock next day, proving his title to partners ship in the firm, he should hand over to Mr. Lester the money due to him</hi>)—Lester said that the man had not the power; he did not say he was not a partner—the £100 I had was in goods, not in money—while I was communicating with Lewis he sent in more goods, and wanted an advance—on 11th October I had £25 in goods and about £100 in money—on 7th October I received another consignment note from Lester: "Please receive two cases of boots, H. Lester, and pay charges"—I did pay the charges—there were 144 pairs of men's cloth Balmorals, and other boots; in all, 234 pairs actually in possession when the letter of 11th October came—I had advanced money on them, but had not sold them—my next auction was October 9th, of goods for which I had paid the railway charges on the 7th—144 pairs of kid boots were sold to Thomas Layman, a pawnbroker in the Borough, at five shillings a pair—I had no notion that the invoice price was 5s. 6d. a pair—on the 11th I received this (<hi rend="italic">A withdrawal of the protest, signed, J. Mears</hi>)—and on the 12th I handed Lester the balance, £15—I had made an advance of £68 between 27th September and 11th October in spite of the protest—Lesser gave receipts—I declined to pay the balance unless I had a formal withdrawal of the protest—I did not know that there was any connection between Mears and Lester—all the documents sent to me were on plain paper, and all signed H. Lester—I made these advances to keep up the credit of the firm—from that time we declined to do business with them—I told Lester we had made inquiries at Northampton, and found it was not straightforward—I should say I did not see the prisoner at my place after the withdrawal of the protest—he called before it was</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant, Northampton</hi>). On 30th November I received a warrant for the apprehension of the prisoner and Lester—I went to London, and on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd December I was watching different places, principally 13, Bow Lane; outside there the names of Mears and Lester were written in white letters—from information given to me I watched 69 and 71, Finsbury Pavement from time to time—on 3rd December, about 1.15 p.m., the prisoner came out of 69, Finsbury Pavement, with a man not known to me—they went to 27, Coleman Street, and the prisoner came out and went to Finsbury Pavement—I asked him if his name was Mears—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I have a warrant for your apprehension"—he said, "For me?"—I said, "Yes, for you"—he said, "You don't mean me?"—I said, "Yes, I mean you; I will read it to you if you like"—he said, "Not here"—I took him to Old Jewry station, and he was asked his private address; he wrote, "John Mears, 34," and did not finish it—he was asked for Lester's address, and wrote it on the other side, "Goulston Street, Whitechapel"—I searched him, and found eleven pawn-tickets, ten of which related to boots, and a quantity of cards of Howard, Bevan, and Co., and a paper containing the names of a great number of bookmakers at Northampton, Norwich, and Great Marlow, and a paper relating to the debts owing from the firm of Mears and Lester, amounting to £274—the names of Baker and Franklin occur in the correspondence, also an invoice from Messers. Vigors, for the supply of eight pairs of boots, £2 10s.—the warrant was read to Him at the station, and he said, "The villain that has got away got me into this"—I took him to Northampton, when he was charged with this offence, and answered, "All right"—on 5th December I went to 13, Bow Lane, and found nothing in the office but a wooden bench and six books in a cupboard—one was a letter-book, and this memorandum of an unpaid bill—here is a letter of December 5th, from Market Harborough, saying that a bill for £13 8s. had been dishonoured—from there I went to the office of Howard, Bevan and Co., Finsbury Pavement, and found a quantity of tinned vegetables and preserved meat and other things, and some toys, some Wellington hoots, and something almost of everything—I went to Bray, Shaw and Co. 's, 21, Paternoster Square, but it was shut, and I did not see the inside—I have a warrant for Lester, but have not found him—I have been on the look-out for Brayshaw, but have not found him.</p>

I was employed by Mr. Lester, at 13, Bow Lane, on 23rd October, 1889, and remained in his employ till November 2nd, at £1 a week—Lester paid me my salary—my duty was to attend the office in his absence—I had strict orders from him not to give the keys to anyone, and if Lewis came I was to prevent his interfering with or moving any goods or anything in the office—he ordered me to get there early in the morning, so as to get all letters, and put them in my pocket, and retain them till he came—I did so—Lewis came occasionally, but never interfered with the business—on three or four occasions high words arose between him and Lester, principally from the defendant requiring to know the position of affairs, and wanting an account of what had been done with the stock, and demanding some money, as he had none to go on with, but generally I was told to quit the office, and therefore I did not know all that took place—as a rule I was told to go out to the post—they did not appear very friendly—Lester did not put a new lock on the door while I was there—I left last at night—Mears had no key of the office that I am aware of—I went on 2nd October, and about a week afterwards goods came in cases—they must have come in a van, but I was upstairs, and Mr. Lester would go down—the carman did not come up and have a receipt signed—Mr. Lester sent the goods somewhere—goods were sent away on several occasions—Mears was not there when that was done—a week or a fortnight before I left, Mean came and asked for Lester, who was not in—he told me I knew where Lester had gone; I said, "I do not know"—he sat down and wrote several letters, I saw what they were when I looked in the letter-book—he gave them to me to post, and then left—I did not post them, because I saw the purport of them, and thought it my duty to look after my master's interests—I did not see Lester that day, he returned on the Monday, and I told him to look in the letter-book—he said, "That is what he has done, has he? have you got the letters?"—I said, "Yes—he then tore out several leaves from the letter-book—the letters were to different firms, telling them not to deliver any goods till they had notice from Mr. Mears—I left because I had a better situation offered me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of Northampton—I was instructed to institute a prosecution in this matter, a police officer and Mr. Baker both mentioned it to me on the same day—I went with Baker to the Magistrate's clerk's office, and he swore an information, and a warrant was issued against Mears and Lester, for obtaining goods by false</p>

               <p>pretences—on 16th December they were first charged before Mr. Baker, there was an all-day sitting till six p.m., and it was remanded for a week—the case for the prosecution closed on the 23rd, and the defendant, through his solicitor, Mr. Hopkins, applied for an adjournment, that he might get a certiorari to remove the case from Northampton to London, as it was a shoe case, and he might be prejudiced if tried in Northampton—it was remanded for about a month—on 14th January I had a visit at my office from Baker and Franklin, and I believe the two Vigors told me that the defendant had been to Northampton to see them, I think they said a week previous, and had asked them whether they would not allow him to pay the fees—I think he said he was going to spend £200 in counsel's fees if the case was withdrawn—I do not think they said any<lb/>thing about Lester's part in the transaction, but we were very anxious to get hold of him—there was no suspicion that Mears was active; Lester was the prime mover in the whole thing—there were some things which did not come out, but which influenced my mind—we understood that Lester had been made bankrupt—Mears had not been joined; the solicitor contended that he was the dupe of another man (<hi rend="italic">The London Gazette of 14th January was here put in, giving the date of the bankruptcy, December 9th, and the adjudication, January</hi> 9<hi rend="italic">th</hi>)—that strengthened my opinion that he was not the prime mover in the matter—the prosecutors came to me, and told me the defendant had been to them, and made proposals—I told them the charges were not felonies but misdemeanours, which might be withdrawn by consent of the Court, and they must not do anything; I went to the Magistrate's clerk, and told him what the proposals were, and that it was getting on for £200, and that all the men prosecuting were very poor, and had suffered great losses; and I put it to him whether they could not make an application for the summonses to be withdrawn; he did not offer any objection, but said he thought it would be well for me to see the Treasury, and I wrote there; in the meantime I told my client they must not see the defendant—three days afterwards I went to the Public Prosecutor's office, and saw Mr. Thomas, who said he must leave it with the Magistrate—I went back and applied to the Magistrates in Court, who took a week to consider it, and ultimately refused; they said they thought it was not a case which they could allow the prosecutors to receive money on—I did not say that Mears was really innocent, and Lester the real culprit; I said that Mears was to some extent the dupe and tool, and that the prosecutors felt that the really guilty party was Lester—Mears paid me £50 and £20, and I drew two promissory notes for £50, which were accepted as bills of exchange, making together £150—the money was paid before I made the application.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My interview at the Treasury was on 17th January—the prisoner was next brought before the Magistrate on 20th January, when I told the Magistrate I had seen the Solicitor to the Treasury, who said ho had no power to interfere, but if the Magistrates consented that the whole thing should be withdrawn, there would be no opposition from the Treasury, and asked for a further adjournment—I appeared on the next hearing, and asked for a further adjournment for a week or a fortnight, as there was no solicitor present—the next hearing was on February 3rd, and it was adjourned for a week that they</p>

I am a convict, at present undergoing fifteen year' penal servitude at Wormwood Scrubbs (<hi rend="italic">see page</hi> 127)—I have known John Deeley for about eight months—on 4th November last I was living at 32, Parkfield Street, Liverpool Road, Islington—on that day John Deeley came to my lodgings between half-past three and half-past four; as near as I can recollect he stayed for twenty minutes to half an hour, and then said, "Which way shall we go, Jack?"—I said, "I will leave it to you"—he said, "We will go to Hornsey"—we went up the Liver-pool Road into the Holloway Road, and then came out at the top of Green Lanes—we had a drink in the Manor House public-house, stayed there a few minutes, and considered which way we should turn—John Deeley said, "Come on," and we went towards the Alexandra Road, but not direct—we then walked up several streets, knocking at several doors of houses which were in darkness; that would be between five and six—people came to the doors, and Deeley received answers, and was obliged to come away—we continued knocking at doors till we came to the Alexandra Road, where we found No. 11 in darkness—I did not know the number then, I learnt it at the trial; it was ten or twelve doors from the corner—I stood a few yards off to the left—Deeley knocked at the door, and then came back and paid to me, "It is all right, Jack"—I went with him to the house; he tried several skeleton keys which I had with me; they would not fit—I then took <hi rend="italic">a, jemmy</hi> from Deeley, and forced the door; we both went in; I left Deeley to fasten the door on the inside—I went up to the first floor bedroom at the back, and broke open a right-hand drawer of a chest of drawers—I saw a purse on the top of other articles—I took the purse out, and examined it while Deeley continued searching the drawers—in the purse was £5 10s. in gold, and a Jubilee five-shilling piece—from a box in the corner of the room we took out a small morning coat and waistcoat—I put them on over my own clothes—when Deeley was examining the drawers he said, "There is nothing else of value in the drawers," but he had plenty of opportunity of taking small articles of jewellery which I could not see—I saw no jewellery there—I first saw this ring at the Police-court—Deeley might have taken it from the drawer and concealed it—we then went into the front room, and looked round, but the things were too big, and not of much value—we came downstairs, and looked round the back parlour—I took an overcoat off a peg in the passage, and put it on—we then left the house, Deeley leaving a minute or half a minute after me—we went towards my lodgings—on the way, between seven and eight, we had a drink in a public-house, where Deeley changed the five-shilling piece—we shared the money, £5 15s. altogether—I had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189003030080"/>
               <p>£2 10s. in gold and half the five shillings, and I bought the overcoat, allowing Deeley five shillings for it—we sold the coat and waistcoat to Tom Chandler at one of the streets off Nile Street, Hoxton; his address has been known for many years to the police—I went there with Deeley—we got between eight and six shillings for them, which we shared—I was not told anything about the jewellery—I got back to Parkfield Street after 8, with the overcoat in my possession; it was produced before the Magistrate—I was apprehended on 7th November, and charged with stealing boots from a shop in Upper Street, Islington—I was tried with a female and two men; they could not connect me with the other men—I was charged with three cases including this one; I was guilty of two with Deeley, and one I was not guilty of—I was committed and tried here on two cases, and also brought in guilty of a third—I was properly convicted of two cases and sentenced to 15 years' penal servitude—I know the female prisoner; she was living with a woman I was cohabiting with before the prisoners were married—they were married four or five months ago, before this robbery; I have only their word for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by John Deeley.</hi> I was charged here with two other men—I was found guilty of three charges—Thomas Smith was found guilty of two robberies and one receiving, the three charges against me; Henry Taylor was brought in guilty of one—I have known Henry Taylor about fifteen years—I was convicted in 1881 with the same man in the name of Henry Jones, for burglary—I have drunk with those men and been in their company since I came back from penal servitude—no one went besides you and me to Alexandra Road—I believe you were wearing the same brown sort of trousers as you have now, and an overcoat—I picked the purse up and counted the money and put it in my pocket—we came back a by-way, by the Nag's Head public-house, and then we took a tram-car—we called at the Manor House before that—you paid with the Jubilee piece—that was after the robbery, but before we got home—we did not share the money till we got home, but I gave you the 5s. to pay for the drinks—when we got back to my house no one was at home; we stayed there half an hour, it might be—we then went together to Tom Chandler's, between 8 and 9, with the coat and waistcoat, to sell them; I wore them—only you and me went; there was no third man going or coming out—no one else in my house saw you—the woman I was living with was out, and my landlady would not see you unless her door was open—I did not see you take anything—I believed you concealed the jewellery taken from the place unbeknown to me; it seemed strange to me that you wanted to leave me and meet me in an hour's time to do the next job, which was the large boot-shop—it seems to me the reason you wanted to go away from me was because you knew you had the jewellery that was taken from the place, and you were going back to Tom Chandler—you asked me at the Police court, "Can you swear you did not send that coat and waistcoat to pawn?"—you were going back to Tom Chandler to sell all the jewellery except the wedding-ring, and you bought the coat and waistcoat from Chandler, and brought them back to pawn, because a man who has been buying stolen property as many years as Chandler would not tell anyone what he had done with property after he had bought and paid for it—at the Police-court you said you wanted the woman I was cohabiting with, in the box—when</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189003030081"/>
               <p>asked if you wished to call evidence you reserved your defence—I said the coat and waistcoat were sold to Chandler, and were not pawned—I did not send them to be pawned in the Liverpool Road—I don't know what became of them after they were sold to Chandler—I pleaded not guilty when charged with this housebreaking—I did not admit I was guilty till about two months after my trial—I have admitted my guilt now, because you suffered Louisa Cooper, who was charged with me, but who was innocent of taking any active part in the robberies that I have committed with you, to be locked up for six weeks for the sake of a £20 bail—she was the woman. I lived with; she was discharged after six weeks of remands—I have said now you are guilty became you did not get bail, and because of your keeping the jewellery that was taken from the place; I only think it is fair for you to have a little of the suffering as well as me—the only evidence against Cooper was five skeleton keys, which I crave her that morning that they might not be found on me; I did not think she would be taken into custody—since my conviction the police have visited me three times; they have not made any threats or promises to me—I should very much like to get my sentence reduced, but I am not giving evidence for that, but because of your unmanly actions to me; you and others promised me five witnesses and also a defence to the third case, where the only evidence against me was through the perjury of Sarah Wood with whom I lodged, who swore on me a coat belonging to Thomas Smith, who was charged with me and is now doing fifteen years—I said I bought the coat—the case was not tried—I know your wife lived at a brothel with one of my brothers—you went and brought her away and thrashed my brother, you drew a knife against him; that was before you were married; I was not there at the time—you and your brother assaulted me-you did not pull me out of a trap and thrash me for the part I took in inducing your wife to leave you—you aimed a blow at me with your, fist—I did not say I would have my revenge if it was in years to come—your wife was not within hearing—I have spoken the truth—you were concerned in another burglary with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He assaulted me, and we quarrelled—that quarrel was afterwards made up—I have since seen him several times, but he has been working with a man who was convicted in the November Sessions—early in November I was in the habit of seeing him for 12 or 13 days—after going to Tom Chandler's on that night I returned to Parkfield Street alone—after going to the Manor House, where we had a drink, and Deeley changed the five-shilling piece, we returned to my lodgings and shared the money, and made arrangements to do another job—I cannot speak with accuracy as to the various times, I had no watch; I speak generally from my recollection.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective-Sergeant N</hi>). For about a fortnight in October and November, I and Drew were keeping watch, sometimes alone and sometimes together, on 32, Parkfield Street, where Taylor lodged—I frequently saw Taylor, and I saw John Deeley going into the house—he usually used to come there with another man—Deeley was not lodging there—I saw him in Taylor's company almost every day—on Monday, 4th November, I saw Deeley and the third man go into the house, somewhere between 2 and 3 p.m.; they remained a short time, and then left, accompanied by Taylor—I was alone then—I cannot</p>

               <p>speak with accuracy to the time—they went up Parkfield Street into Liverpool Road—I came down from where I was keeping observation to try and follow them, but when I got out I could not find them, and I at once returned to where I was keeping observation—I saw them all three next between 9 and 10 in the evening; the came back and entered 32, Parkfield Street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> To the best of my recollection you went in the house about twenty minutes past two, stopped ten minutes, and then left with Taylor and the other man about half-past two—I am positive you are the fame man, because I had you under observation for a fortnight as well as Taylor—the lodgings were Taylor's—the private door of 32, Parkfield Street is in Liverpool Street—I lost sight of you—to the best of my recollection you had a coat and waistcoat on; the same as you have now—you had no overcoat on—you all three returned between nine and ten—I noticed nothing suspicious about you, but I noticed Taylor went out with-out an overcoat and returned with one on—I had no reason for thinking that overcoat was not his own—I saw you leave Taylor's lodgings about a quarter of an hour after that, just before ten o'clock—I did not follow you—I did not see you bring a parcel or anything out—you turned to the left to go down Bernard Road into Upper Street—I have seen you since 4th November—I did not know at the time you were connected with Taylor—I heard it after his conviction—I did not give evidence against him in November.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When they came out of the house first they went in the direction of Hornsey; the second time they came out they went in the direction of Upper Street, Hoxton—I know there is such a man as Tom Chandler; I don't know the man, nor where his place is.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Elizabeth Leech, a pawnbroker, of 193, Hoxton Street, Hoxton—a wedding-ring similar to this (I should not like to swear this is the one) was pledged with us by Louisa Deeley in the name of Mrs. Allen on 23rd December for 6s.—this is the ticket—on 20th January it was redeemed, and on the same day it was pledged again for 6s. in the name of Ann Allen, James Street—afterwards the police brought this pawn-ticket; I referred to the duplicate, and then produced this ring, and handed it to the police as the one pledged by Mrs. Allen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have not noticed whether the ring was pledged previous to the 23rd December—I could not say if I ever took in a wedding-ring from Louisa Deeley previously—the ring is worth about 5s. from a pawnbroker's point of view—we might lend more to a regular customer—I have known Louisa Deeley before—we don't advance the full value of an article.</p>

In October and November, when, I was with Ballard watching this house in Parkfield Street, I saw John Deeley about half-a-dozen times altogether, from 28th October to 5th November, I think—I saw him come to the house alone and in company with other men—I saw him with George Taylor more than once—on 4th November I was watching the house during the evening, and a little before ten o'clock I saw Deeley, Taylor, and another man come to the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk, living at 70, Allerton Road, Stoke Newington—on the night of 9th February I went to bed about twelve o'clock, after seeing my wife fasten up the house, close the front window of the dining-room, and fasten the sashes—next morning, at nine o'clock, I went into that room and found the window unfastened and the blind up—the room was in disorder, and I missed these things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), a cruet-stand, nut-crackers, sugar-tongs, jam-knife, pepper-box, salt-cellar, dish, and three spoons—I gave notice to the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, at Hamilton Place, Victoria Grove,. Stoke Newington—on the morning of 10th February I drove an empty van from my house in Hamilton Place (which I left at quarter to six) to 66, Queen Elizabeth Walk—William Kent was with me—I was loading Con-stable Richard's furniture, who lived at No. 66, when I saw the prisoners come by the back part of my van; Barrow went by, Bennett went into the garden of the house I was loading from—they went to a flower-box in the garden and took a sack with something in it—I got out of my van, and with Richards (who was helping to load the van and was coming with a box) chased the prisoners down Queen Elizabeth Walk—after taking the sack they had run off out of our sight when they saw us running—at the bottom of Lordship Road Richards turned to the left, I to the right—I examined the gardens on the right, and then crossed the road to meet Richards—I saw the prisoners in the garden of Lulworth House, in Lordship Road, sitting down in the garden between two trees—I caught hold of Bennett, and Richards took Barrow, and we brought them to 66, Queen Elizabeth Walk—nothing was said till we got into the road, and then Bennett said, "Let me have a struggle"—Mrs. Richards, at No. 66, did not identify the cruet, and then I and Richards took the prisoners round Lordship Park; we met Sergeant Hurley, and he assisted us to take them to the station—I did not turn the corner of Queen Elizabeth Walk before I saw the prisoners—I after<lb/>wards found a knife and a jam-dish, five or six houses from No. 66—I saw Bennett throw the dish away at 66, and the knife he threw six or seven doors off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first noticed the prisoners going into the garden of the policeman's house from which I was removing the goods; I saw them carrying nothing in there—Bennett took the sack with something in it from the flower-box of the window, and they walked in the direction of the road—I spoke to Richards, no "Stop thief' was called—we ran after them about twenty yards—Richards said, "What are you doing here?"—Barrow said, "It belongs to Bennett," holding up the sack-Bennett said, "No, it does not; it belongs to him"—they argued it for a few minutes—Barrow said, in Richard's hearing, they bought it of a lad;. I am sure of that—I did not hear Bennett say "Barrow found it, and</p>

At 6 a.m. on 10th February I was engaged with Taylor in moving my furniture into his van, and I saw Bennett standing at the flower-box; he took the sack out of the flower-box, and walked out of the front garden, saying as he went out, "There is something here belonging to me"—I was in plain clothes; I had not said a word—he walked out of the gate, and joined Barrow, who was waiting outside the next house—I followed with Taylor—when the prisoners saw us following they ran away, and we ran after them—they turned into Lordship Road, and we lost sight of them—I searched the front gardens, and we found the prisoners hiding under bushes in the front garden of Lulworth House—I told Taylor to catch hold of Bennett, and I caught hold of Barrow, and said, "What have you taken from the front garden?"—Barrow had the sack, and he took this ornament out of it—he said, pointing to Bennett, "He gave it to me; he found it"—I told him he would have to go back to the house with me—when we got back to No. 66 I told him I was a police constable, and should arrest them for being in unlawful possession of this ornament; they both began to struggle violently—Barrow struck me on the back of the head with this ornament, and threw it into my front garden—I shouted for help; Taylor came to my assistance—we tool the prisoners to the station—I found nothing else on Barrow—on Bennett I found this knife and all these articles, except this glass, which he threw away when he was being conveyed back to No. 66—I have no doubt the prisoners are the men I saw in my garden.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>, Only Bennett went into my garden; the other man waited outside at the next house—the cart might have been there ten minutes when this occurred—I had been sleeping in the house that night—I had been downstairs an hour before the carman came—all my things were packed ready for removal—from the outside it would have the appearance of an empty house—I was care-taker there—I am quite sure Barrow did not say Bennett found it in the garden; he only said he found it—that was all he said in my hearing—neither of them said they bought it from a boy—when I told them I should lock them up they began to struggle; nothing was said to me.</p>

               <p>before he got half-way round the corridor I overtook him, and took him into the street, and he went away—some minutes afterwards he came back in an excited state, and said, "If you will not allow me to go in I will kill you"—he stepped back a short distance and presented a revolver at me—I stepped towards him, and he fired, and the shot passed through my hair, and the flash burnt off a portion of my eyebrow—he fired a second shot, which struck the wall seven or eight feet to my left—I should think the barrel of the revolver was about three or four feet from my face when he fired—I closed with him, and took the revolver from him and gave him into custody—I took the revolver to the station, and gave it to a constable—I have heard that the prisoner's wife was employed at a stall at the Circus.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Mr. Everall, a solicitor, of Devonshire Square, and live at 7, Paragon Road, Hackney—on 3rd February I went home about 10 p.m., and at a little after ten the prisoner Wrench came to the window and then to the door, and said, "Are you going to let us in?"—I said, "Certainly not, what for? My application to the Divisional Court is pending, and will be heard next week; I do not understand what you mean"—he said, "Well, you will b—well handy up, and we shall get in somehow"—I said, "If you attempt to break into my place you know what the result will be; you had better see me at Chadwick's in the morning" he said, "Very well," and went away—at a little after eleven I heard a knocking at the front door, and went to it, and Wrench again said he would get in somehow—my wife came out of the breakfast parlour, and Parry said, "What b——y cow is this?"—it is a corner house—I spoke through a hole as large as my hand in a broken window which opens on to the front area—about 12.30 or 12.45 I found there was a man at each door; they had leaped over a wall at the back, and there were two or three men at the washhouse door; I heard them talking, and there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189003030096"/>
               <p>were three or four at the back kitchen door—I saw all three prisoners at the back door, with Gleeson and Hewitt, and went to the w. c., over it I could hear then hammering and pulling the glass out only about a yard from me—I said, "If you dare to break into my house at this time of night I shall apply for a warrant against you, and you will have to suffer for it; you are all drunk"—Parry then took his coat off, and Gleeson put it over his head to protect it in putting it through the broken window—he is a very little man—when I went in they had hung a coat over the window—they were all at the kitchen door—I went into the kitchen, and warned them again, and then bolted the door, and said, "I am going to bed"—I put out the gas, and we looked through the blinds in the back parlour, which is over the kitchen, and could see them damaging the place—my wife was terrified, and my children were clinging to me; I have seven children and an aged mother of eighty, and they were all in a state of fear—when my wife looked out of the window Parry said, "Who the b—hell are you looking at?"—she said, "You, you vagabond; if you dare to break into this house"—he said, "Don't look at us"—I left her and my oldest son there, and went down to the breakfast parlour again, and heard a crash, and the whole woodwork came through—I opened the kitchen door, and found the three prisoners and two more in the kitchen, who we have not succeeded in arresting—I said, "Well, now you are in possession there is an end of it; you see what you have done'—I lit the gas, and saw them all under the light—they spoke to each other and said, "You did it;" "I did not do it; it is not my fault," all blaming each other—I said, "I shall apply to the judge to-morrow for a warrant against you"—I applied to Mr. Justice Day, and obtained an unconditional order for them to go out immediately, brought it back, and Parry said, "We will do for you if you apply for a warrant"—in the morning, when I was preparing the information, I said to Wrench, "You had better see what I am going to do, and what I am going to say"—Parry picked up some of the pieces which were wrenched from the side of the window, and I said, "You dare to touch any of that I will have the police here"—he picked up one of the pieces of wood with glass in it, threw it outside, and said, "You see what you have done; you did that in fighting us outside"—after they got in I said, "You are in now, and I have my remedy," and the police came and took their names and addresses—they asked if they might have a fire; Mrs. Monk said, "There is the coal-cellar, you can take the coals," and then they lit the fire—in the morning I went down at seven o'clock, and saw them burning part of the woodwork; there was a fire all night, and they were burning the sashes—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the wood; this is where all the glass was picked out—I got the information in the morning, and: in the afternoon I applied to Mr. Bridge and obtained a warrant—Mrs. Monk had to go to the station for the police—the Sergeant said he should have to interfere if they did not behave themselves, and Wallace took his coat off and went upstairs after my wife, and said he was going to bed with her; she said if he came up he would get the poker, and she screamed—the two others have absconded—a similar bill of sale has been held by the Court of Appeal to be invalid—the company to whom I gave it was the Consolidated Credit and Mortgage Corporation, Great Tower Street, and then they altered the name to "The Consolidated Company";</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189003030097"/>
               <p>the interest was 60 per cent.—I had paid it nearly all, and they claimed £40 as interest—litigation was actually pending at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have had twenty-two years' experience of the law—Mr. Everett has been admitted since 1884; he comes to the office every day from eleven to five—I borrowed £30 from this company at first, and I paid all the capital, and it was renewed again, resulting in the bill of sale which led to these proceedings—my wife also signed the bill of sale; I did not read it, it was a printed form, and they would not alter it for me—I do not deny that when "Wrench came into possession it was a legal possession; I have nothing to say against him beyond this transaction, as far as I know he is a respectable professional man—I did not get him out by a trick; he said, "I am not going to stay here," and walked out—I did not provide him afterwards with his journey money backwards and forwards, so that he should not go into possession again, I only paid him 3s. 6d.; I did not give him any money; he was not there, he was taking his money from Chad wick—he met me at the Law Courts; not by appointment—I did not ask him to serve writs for me; but one day Mr. Binks gave him half-a-crown to serve a summons at Clapton—I did not expect he was to go into possession again at my place—this telegram is my writing: "Lock door; let no one in; not Wrench; home soon. Monk"—I sent that to my wife, because I thought after this order had been renewed, "Wrench might go into possession again—I said at the Police-court, "I did not send a telegram to my wife, telling her to keep Wrench out of possession. "but I remembered it afterwards; I said I did not send one from the Royal Courts—I went to Justice Penman's house and got a summons for an interim injunction; the injunction was refused unless I paid £52 into Court, or gave security—I went to Messers. Chadwick; I did not ask them not to do anything for a time—I gave notice of motion, which was heard before the Divisional Court and decided against me, and I was ordered to pay the costs, which I have not done; but I appealed on the 4th, and got this injunction from Mr. Justice Day on their breaking into my place—there was a summons, but it was adjourned <hi rend="italic">sine die</hi> till the case of Hazlewood is settled—I am not a carpenter, but I should say the damage done to my place was £7 or £8 or more; the men trampled on the carpets and cut them with glass—I have not sworn that it was under £5—I have left it in the same condition—I have brought an action against my landlord, who has asked me to settle the matter, and it is practically settled; it is about trespass; he gave me notice to quit, and I paid the rent up to the date of the notice, and then he distrained for a quarter's rent and put a man in possession, who was in four days, and I brought an action—I had offered him the rent and he would not take it—I have not settled that—immediately he found he was wrong, lie withdrew the man—I made an exparte application, and the Judge ordered him out—that action is still pending—the prisoner was drunk—it was foggy at ten or eleven o'clock—I heard what the man said through the broken glass of the parlour door—I was perfectly sober—I did not expect anybody to come from Chad wick's; I thought they would let it be till the appeal was heard—I am fighting the bill of sale—I have brought an action to set it aside, on the ground that it is void—the panneling and woodwork is damaged and wrenched away, and the oilcloth cut to pieces by trampling on the broken glass; we had to take it away—three panes of glass were broken.</p>

I am assistant to Mr. Smith, pawnbroker, of 155, Woodstock Street—I took those earrings in pledge on 22nd February, a little after one o'clock, from the prisoner; I have no doubt about it.

I thought you were abed"—she said she had been out to post some letters and to have a blow—she asked me would I give those letters to anyone that should come in the morning—she gave me these two (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and said if it was Polly came, I was to give them to her with her mother's love, and tell her that she was not so black as she was painted—I then went back to my room—on the following morning I made some tea to take to her—I knocked at her door, and said, "Mrs. Bevan, are you not going to get up? It is half-past ten"—she said, "Come in," and I went in—I asked her how she was, and when I got near her I said, "Oh, dear, how ill you look!"—she said, "I have done it, I have done it! I have taken the lot!"—I said, "For God's sake, what have you done?"—she said, "I have poisoned myself, and I have poisoned my child!"—I saw six glass bottles on the table—I took them to my room—they had "Laudanum; Poison" on them—I called to my little girl to get the mustard box, and I made an emetic and gave it to her, end she vomited very freely—she was in bed at the time; the baby was lying by her side; I sent my little girl for Mr. Passmore, the chemist, and I picked up the baby from the bed; it looked as if it was dying—I shook it about—I sent again for Mr. Passmore, and when he came he fetched an emetic, and gave it to the baby and to the mother—I then sent Mrs. Pyne for Dr. Hooker, and went to the Police-station and brought a policeman in a cab; the prisoner and baby were put into the cab and taken to the hospital—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the pillow upon which the baby was lying—the two letters which the prisoner handed to me I gave to Sergeant Fraser.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">One of these letters was put in, and read as follows</hi>:—"My dear Polly,—This is the last time I shall trouble you, and I do not know whether you will get this. I think you might have told me what he intended doing, as I am quite willing he should have the children, and as he thinks he can do well without me. God knows I can end it, as I cannot live without him or the children. I think you might have left me a clean collar and my old flannel petticoat; you could have kept the other things. Not even a comb to do my hair with; but no matter, I do not require anything; and fancy your taking that money of me in the morning, knowing that I should have sixteen shillings rent to pay on Monday!

I am a chemist, of 89, Union Road, Newington Causeway—on Sunday night, 12th January, about twenty five minutes to nine, the prisoner came to my shop for one pennyworth of laudanum; she brought a bottle for it; I gave her one penny worth—I asked her if she knew it was poison—she said, "Yes"—I said, "You won't take it then?"—she said, "It is for the toothache"—this is the bottle—one pennyworth would be one drachm, 33 grains to the ounce, roughly speaking; that would be about four grains and a half—she left at once—next morning, about half-past nine, a little girl came for me, and afterwards Mrs. Pyne, and in consequence of what they said I went to 115, Rockingham Street—I went up to a bedroom there, and found the prisoner in bed; she appeared as if she had been awakened and was just getting drowsy again—at the same time my attention was called to the child—it was comatose, pallid, and blue about the lips; it certainly presented the appearance of suffering from poison; it was very ill indeed—I at once sent for Dr. Hooper, went back to the shop, prepared an emetic, and brought it back to the house, and gave some of it to the mother and some to the child, to the child first, it was in Mrs. Hampshire's room; it vomited on its night-dress—the mother vomited, but not sufficiently, and I returned to my shop and prepared a stronger emetic, brought it back, and gave her nearly the whole of it, that was quite effectual; what was left I gave to the child, but it did not vomit; I think it all returned through the nose; it did not go down the gullet—I told Mrs. Hampshire, who had the child in her arms, to keep it in motion—I assisted the prisoner out of bed, and walked her up and down, to keep her moving about—she asked me to let her sit still—she said I wanted to take her away—I said I did not—I asked her how much laudanum she had given her child—she said about half a teaspoonful—I asked her when she gave it—she said at eleven the previous night—I asked her how much laudanum she had obtained—she said six separate pennyworths—I asked her if she had had much difficulty in obtaining it—she said yes, at one place, because she was so nervous; she then tried to be as cool as she could, and then obtained it elsewhere—she said she had taken all except half a teaspoonful, which she had given to the child—I asked her why she had given her child the laudanum—she said because her husband had taken away her home and her children—I asked her why he had taken away her children—she said because during his two years' imprisonment</p>

               <p>children may live twelve hours under opium; it is not unusual that they should; opium is a vegetable poison, and quickly absorbed into the blood; it generally produces symptoms within half an hour—opium chiefly passes off in the urine in a few hours; that is how it disappears.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman L</hi> 112). On 28th January, about 2 a.m., I was on duty in York Road, Lambeth, and saw three men, of whom the prisoner was one, at the corner of Griffin Street, near the Duke of York public-house—the prisoner was in the doorway in Griffin Street, the other two were in the York Road—as soon as they saw me they went up York Street, the second went into York Road, and the prisoner went down Griffin Street; he afterwards returned into York Street, where he rejoined his companions—two of them went towards a coffee-stall—I kept them in view—I spoke to Wingrave, a brother officer, and he kept them in view—they stood at the coffee-stall about fifteen minutes, then left and went back to York Street, they separated, and then the prisoner went back to the coffee-stall—the other man stood in the middle of York Road—I and Wingrave went up to him, searched him, found nothing on him, and told him to go about his business; we the returned along York Road—I saw the prisoner approaching us, coming from the direction of the coffee-stall towards the Duke of Kent—he turned into Griffin Street, and walked along by the dead wall and came to a lamp-post there, he stopped there close by the lamp-post, where there is a window, and lit his pipe—I crossed over and asked him what he was loitering about for—he said, "Nothing, what for?"—I said, "I have been watching you and another man for the best part of an hour in a very suspicious manner, and I am going to see what you have got about you; unbutton your coat"—he had along coat on; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he unbuttoned his coat, put his hand to the pipe that he had in his mouth, took it out, and was about to put it in his breastcoat inside pocket, when he made a step back and said, "Will you, you b—?" at the same time drawing a revolver—I saw it shine by the light of the lamp close by, and shouted out to Wingrave, "Look out!"—I made a quick step to my left, and as I moved he immediately fired—he held the revolver as nearly as possible about level with my belt; he pointed downwards like—I saw the flash and hoard the report; Wingrave was on the left side of him, I was on his right, he was facing more towards York Road, a kind of half turn; I was almost close to the wall when I stopped, he was nearer the road; as soon as he fired towards me I rushed at him, and took hold of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189003030111"/>
               <p>his right arm; he swung himself sharp round towards Wingrave and fired; he had the revolver in his left hand—I was holding his right arm at the time he fired the second shot; I saw the flash and heard the report of that shot; it was then we both seized him—Wingrave put his right arm round his neck, and he took hold of Wingrave's left hand; there was a struggle, rather a short one, and we all three pitched head foremost into the road, the prisoner still having the revolver in his hand; when we were struggling on the ground he tried to work it round so as to get it into position to fire again, towards both of us—I was on the top of the prisoner, the other constable was at his side—I could not say that I saw his finger; I still kept hold of his right arm—he made a desperate effort to get his right hand free—after a short struggle, White came up and assisted me; he first struck the prisoner on the leg, and then took the revolver from him—Inspector Martin then came up and the prisoner was taken into custody, taken to the station, and there charged with having housebreaking implements in his possession—I searched him, and found on him six skeleton keys, a picklock, a memorandum-book, a watch, and a chisel—he was also charged with shooting at me and Wingrave, with intent to murder—he made no reply to the charge in my hearing—he was detained, and I and Inspector Sennett went, about seven in the morning, to the doorway of the Duke of York, in which I had seen the prisoner standing; we took this chisel with us; I saw three marks on that doorway near the keyhole, and the chisel exactly fitted those marks—I then returned to the station—about half-past eleven that morning I went before the Magistrate and gave evidence; the prisoner was brought up and charged—I had been on duty for fourteen hours consecutively, from half past nine the previous night, and I left out part through being cross-examined by the clerk of the Court, as to the position in which the revolver was, and so on—the prisoner's coat was taken from him at the station and examined by the Inspector.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The chisel only fitted one mark, the other two were broken roughly—the door at which I fitted the chisel was in Griffin Street—there are two doors in Griffin Street; it was the one nearest York Road—when I first saw the prisoner he was in the doorway in Griffin Street, close to the corner—I passed him twice before I arrested him; he must have seen me, because I had my cape on; it was a wet night; I did not mention at the Police-court that the prisoner used the expression, "Will you, you b——?"—I was about to give it when I was stopped by the clerk, and when I started my evidence again I was muddled like—the prisoner's pocket was on fire; I have the pipe here; I don't think there was much tobacco in it when I found it; I did not look much into it—his coat was taken off, and White carried it to the station; it was given to the prisoner after he was charged, when he was going into the cell; I had never seen the prisoner before to my knowledge—I first saw him shortly after two, and I arrested him at three—I did not arrest him when he was at the coffee-stall, because I wanted to watch his movements a little more; my suspicions were aroused when the other man disappeared so suddenly—I have been twelve years in the force; I did not know he had attempted the public-house until after he was charged—I was not confused and excited during the struggle; when I was on the top of the prisoner it was rather an exciting moment—I did not seize his arm till after he had fired; I asked him to unbutton his</p>

               <p>coat, and he did so at once—when he put his hand into his; pocket I did not think he was going to get a revolver, or I should have stopped him; it was all done at the same moment, it took me off my guard—after he fired the first shot I took hold of his right arm; his left arm was free—he might have fired a second shot at me, but he did not; he turned it round the other way; he wag about two feet from me; he levelled the revolver as near as possible at my belt; the revolver did not go off in his pocket; he fired after it was out of his pocket—I think the undercoat he had on is the one he has on now—he said nothing about there being a hole in that; he said, "Can't you see my coat is on fire?"—he did not ask anyone to take the revolver from him; it was taken from him before the Inspector arrived—shortly before I saw these men there had been a disturbance in the neighbourhood; a prostitute had been making a noise there—I sent her away; she was not locked up—I should not think that brought the prisoner out of his house, because he passed by his house afterwards.</p>

On 28th January, about twenty-five minutes past two a.m., I was on duty in York Road—two men passed in the direction of the coffee-stall, the prisoner was one of them—after that Warren came up and spoke to me; in consequence of what he said to me I kept them in view, following them towards the coffee-stall; they remained there some little time and then returned, going to the earner of York Street; there they parted, the second man stood still at the corner of York Street, the prisoner returned in the direction of the coffee-stall—I searched the other man, but found nothing on him; I then returned towards the Duke of York—I saw them look round several times, which excited my suspicion—I saw the prisoner come to the corner of Griffin Street, I was standing on the opposite side—he turned down Griffin Street about thirty yards, near the lamp-post, and I saw him light his pipe in the window—after that I and Warren went up to him; Warren said, "What are you loitering about here for?"—he said, "Nothing, what for?"—Warren said, "I have been watching you and the other man loitering about for nearly an hour, and I want to see what you have upon you; unbutton your coat?"—he unbuttoned it with his left hand, took out his pipe and dropped it into his breast-pocket, at the same time he took out the revolver and said, "Will you, you b—? I heard the report and saw the flash, and the prisoner then turned sharp round and fired in my direction, aiming both times at the lower part of my body—I did not see the revolver at the first shot; I saw the flash, and when he fired the second one I saw the revolver, and it was pointed in my direction—I then seized his left hand, and Warren his right, and there was a struggle between us, and we came down into the roadway—I could not say exactly about his finger being over the trigger, he kept trying to get it round, and I forced it back three or four times; then White came up and took the revolver from him; then Martin came up, and he was taken to the station—the prisoner said, "My pocket is on</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had seen the prisoner just over half an hoar before interfering with him; I was not with Warren from the first, I was with him from twenty-five minutes past two—I accosted the prisoner, I think, just over a quarter of an hour after he left the coffee-stall—I was not more than two feet from him when the revolver went off—his arm was free at that time—Warren was not more than a foot from him; as he fired he went back, and Warren went forward with him—he fired at about Warren's belt; I can't say how he came to 'miss him, except it was having the pistol in his left hand—I have never expressed the opinion that it was used to frighten us—I have had no conversation with Rogers about that, I might have mentioned the pistol to him—I mean that he fired with a free hand at Warren when only a foot from his body, and missed him, and then he turned and fired at me, and missed me; the lamp was almost at our back, and he had his back to the wall; I was on his left and Warren on his right; he fired with his left hand—I think Warren and I seized him about the same time; I seized his left hand with my right, and my left hand I put round his neck; that was after the revolver had been discharged twice—I was first examined on the remand on the 14th, a week after—I think I was the first witness that used the words, "Will you, you b—?"—at the next hearing Warren said those words were used—I had seen the prisoner about before, but did not know who he was—I should say the struggle lasted about three minutes—there was fire in his pocket—I did not smell the place where the holes were.</p>

I was in charge of Kennington Lane Station on 28th January—about a quarter-past three a.m. the prisoner was brought in by Warren, who made a full statement—the prisoner was searched, and a number of things were found on him—after that he was charged with the possession of housebreaking implements by night, and shooting at the two officers—he said, "I suppose I can have bail; I can explain the possession of these things to the Magistrate in the morning"—I said, "Certainly not"—he made no remark about the shooting—I examined the revolver; it was still loaded in four chambers with ball cartridge—in the other two I found discharged cartridges—he was asked his address, and he gave 46, York Street—I went there with Sergeant Ward—I searched the shop parlour, and under a sack, lying on a couch, I found this canvas bag, containing seventeen keys, eight of which are skeletons.</p>

I live at No. 2, Pembridge Square, Bayswater, and have offices at 3, Verulam Buildings, Gray's Inn, where I carry on the profession of an architect and surveyor—the defendant was employed as a nursery governess about the end of September, 1888, and was with us for three years and a month—she left at the end of October, 1881—after leaving she went to a lady at Hendon, and afterwards to North Germany, to improve her qualifications as a governess—she returned in 1884—my wife died in June, 1882—when the defendant returned my daughter, to whom she had been nursery governess, was alive, and is still living—I met her on her return at her request—some time after her return there was intercourse, and in April, 1887, a child was born—Dr. Coker attended her, not at my request; she appointed him as her surgeon—I made her an allowance prior to her confinement, and some time after that I made a settlement on her; I think that was in August, 1888—Dr. Coker and Miss Emslie, a schoolfellow and friend, who had been in Germany with her, became her trustees—the settlement was £2,000 absolutely invested for the child, and £1,000 was given to her to go into a business with, and £600 to purchase the house in which, she was then residing—subsequently she came to the House of Commons to see me—she had an allowance of £200 a year at the time I made the settlement—she came to the House of Commons to represent to me that she could not live on £200 a year, and I must increase it, and I ultimately consented to make it £400 a year during my life—I think that was in the year following the settlement—I have taken the trouble to cast up the cheques for the last year, and I find them considerably in excess of that sum; £930 5s. 8d. is the exact figure up to the 8th October—a portion of that was for furnishing her house—on 5th October I received this letter by post; it is her writing—before that she had spoken of her approaching marriage.

The truth is an amalgamation of circumstances has made me thoroughly ill, and it is absolutely impossible for me to live on here, and I want to talk the matter over with you, and I shall never get better while I have it on my mind. I do not intend asking you to advance my next month's allowance. Pray do not further delay, but make, as you suggest, an appointment for the beginning of the week.

               <p>in pursuance of an appointment I went to Richmond on 8th October—I reached her house between half-past four and five—I had been there twice before—she kept a servant—I had never seen the young man she was about to be married to; I had only seen his portrait on a bracelet—on 8th October I knocked at the door, and it was opened by the prisoner—I entered the house, and the front door was closed after I entered—I went into the dining-room; she followed me; when she got in she immediately locked the door, and took the key out, and deposited it in a cabinet—she then produced a revolver and said, "You and I are alone in this house, and if you wish to leave it alive you will sign this paper," pointing to a paper on the table—I read it—I said as to the opening paragraph, alleging that I had seduced her with violence, I would rather suffer a thousand deaths than sign it, and I tore it off immediately—she was at the other end, lengthways, of the dining-room table, which was probably 7 to 8 feet long—she then asked me to sign a simple declaration that I had seduced her—I said, "I cannot see the benefit it would be to you; but if you wish it, you shall have it," and I wrote on another paper an admission that I had seduced her—I then signed this paper, which is her writing, and from which I had torn the top part. (<hi rend="italic">This document was read, as follows:</hi> "The sum of £20,000 in the following sums: I give her now a cheque for £200, payable at once, and a cheque for £1,800, payable the day after to-morrow, Thursday, October 10th, 1889; and I undertake to pay her the balance, £18,000, on Tuesday, October 22nd, 1889, a fortnight from to-day")—she asked me to give her cheques for the amounts stated in the paper, and I said I had no cheque-book with me; she said, "That does not matter; here are pieces of paper ready stamped, you can write the cheques on these," and she brought three blank pieces of paper (halfsheets of note paper, I think, that size), each with a penny stamp on it, out of a drawer—the revolver was in her hand; she had retained it the whole time—she said if I wished to see my daughter alive, and if I cared for the prestige of my name, I would sign and fill in the cheques—she was standing in the same place near the window, by the side of the cabinet and drawer, and the length of the table from me, and had the revolver in her right hand—I was sitting—I saw the whole character and scope of the plot, and felt there was nothing left for me to do but to close with her and get the pistol from her, and get out of the house—I got up and moved towards her; she moved away as I came near her—my leg hit against the table and moved it, and it pinned her, so to speak, between the table and the sideboard—I saw the pistol in her right hand in alignment with my head; it looked to me as being very likely to lead to danger, and I threw up my hand as a guard; I was about four or five feet from the pistol then, I think the table was still between us, but I had moved round, and it was less than the full length—when I put up my hand the pistol was discharged, and I received the bullet in my arm, a little below the wrist—I reached her side and laid hold of her hand, I had only one arm then of any use to me; my right arm became instantly swollen and in great pain, but I clenched her and the pistol with the left hand—I exclaimed, "I am shot"—she said, "Where?"—I drew up my sleeve—she saw the wound and the blood oozing from it; she commenced to scream, before I actually reached her side and before she saw the wound, at the last move I made to close with her—after she</p>

               <p>saw the wound I think she kissed me; she was highly hysterical, and then laid the pistol on the table—then there was a violent kicking at the dining-room door, and a demand from someone to open it—the prisoner took the key from the drawer where she had placed it, and opened the door, and a young man entered the room and demanded to know what it all meant, and who and what I was—I replied that he had better ask the lady—then I began to feel a little faint from loss of blood and the enormous swelling in the right arm—I asked them to give me a little brandy and water—she procured that for me—I then said I would leave the house, and I did so—the young man went with me to the railway-station, where he left me—I went to Mr. Newth, my surgeon, whose house is near mine, and showed him the injury—I was under treatment for some considerable time—the bullet has not been extracted, it is here—I sent for my solicitor the next day, but I did not institute any prosecution until some time in February—prior to instituting a prosecution I had a great many threatening letters—this letter, in her handwriting, was left on my desk in Verulam Buildings by her personally. <hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "You may rest assured after this that a revenge so sure shall overtake you that escape will be impossible.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was fifteen years and about eight months old when she came into my service—she remained with me for three years and one month—she visited me at my chambers in Verulam Buildings during my late wife's lifetime—I deny that improper intimacy took place then—she came to explain a bill in which there was a mistake; she was there more than once—she afterwards went to school as a pupil teacher—I visited her there, and she came to my house while she was there—I and my daughter have taken her out for drives—then she went to school near Bremerhaven, in Germany—I never promised to marry her—my wife was an invalid for many years before she died—I met the prisoner at the boat when she returned from Germany—I went with her to the First Avenue Hotel that day—we had luncheon there—I did not seduce her, nor was there any intimacy there—I quite admit she was a perfectly virtuous upright girl when I seduced her—during the time I was intimate with her, and after the birth of her child, there was a real affection between us—I was very fond of her—I think she was fond of me; I was very fond of her, and passionately fond of the child—then I made her an allowance, including an annuity of £400 a year—I don't think disputes arose about the allowance, but about her buying a house at Richmond without consulting me first—I had given her £500 to buy the house in which she was residing at West Kensington, but instead of doing that she agreed to purchase a house at Rich-mond</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189003030118"/>
               <p>for £2,000; and, having entered into the arrangement, she asked me to come and look at the house—she paid £500 deposit—then she informed me she had entered into an engagement to be married—I don't recollect her saying to me that she was anxious that instead of having an annuity of £400 a year, which might have to be explained to her future husband, a sum should be paid instead—she did not say that to me at that time—what she said was that the £400 was to be paid to her during my life, and she pointed out on more than one occasion what would happen to her in the event of my death, when the £400 would cease, and I said I thought her husband would by that time be able to provide for her—the child lived with her—on the 8th October there was a considerable amount of excitement—I never lost my presence of mind, as is evidenced by the fact that I shielded my head when the pistol was pointed at it—I think the sequence of events was mainly as I have stated; I won't pledge myself to every detail—I am sure the revolver was produced at the early stage of the interview I speak about—I think when I hesitated to sign the blank pieces of paper she said, "Unless you sign them I will shoot you and myself, and make the whole affair public," but it was not the only time she had used such words—I don't recollect her saying anything then about writing a history of her relations with me—I am sure she did not say anything on that occasion about leaving the history of her relations with me behind her, to be published in the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi>, like Mrs. Langworthy—she may have done so on another occasion; I don't know when that was—she was in a badly-excited state, undoubtedly, during the whole of the interview—at all times she was undoubtedly hysterical—I tore off the part of the paper relating to violence; I most distinctly deny violence was used to her—I left the paper on the table; I did not take any of the pieces away—I tore the piece off, and I did not sign it; it was valueless—I have not got it; my solicitor has not got it, to my knowledge—there was no struggle to get possession of the paper I did sign, the struggle was to get possession of the pistol—I did not try to get the paper back after I had signed it—I moved from the top of the table to the bottom, and then to the side, she having got to the top—that was the paper about £20,000—I left it on the able, some distance in front of me, when I had signed it, I being at one end of the table and she at the other—I was seated the whole of the time—I think she took it up—she held it in her hand, as well as the pistol—I cannot say if it was in the same hand—I did not care about that paper till she asked me to sign the cheques, and then I began to think—I cannot say now what became of the paper—I did not try to get the paper from her; I tried to get the pistol from her; my great desire was to get out of the house, that was all I cared about—I chased her round the table; I made the complete circuit of the table; she retreated as I advanced; that was not to get the paper out of her hand; I assure you my intention was to get the pistol, that I might get out of the house—I pushed the table in the struggle—I went as rapidly as I could towards her; I, of course, lost no time in reaching her side, if you like you may call it rushing; when I reached her side there was a struggle—it was not in the struggle that the pistol went off, it had gone off before I reached her side; I was close to her, which, of course, accounts for the bullet travelling as it has done—I cannot swear that the pistol did not go off accidentally; I did not know, of course, what was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189003030119"/>
               <p>passing through the prisoner's mind when it was discharged—I say now, as I said at the Police-court, I cannot swear that it did not go off accidentally—I never lost my presence of mind completely; I was to some degree excited, as would be Natural under the circumstances—I was not anxious that the document I signed should not be in her possession; I have explained with reference to that my mind was pretty easy; I felt that, extorted from me as it was, under the circumstances, it was not much to be feared—I don't recollect telling her that I was anxious that such a document should not be in her possession; I may have done, I don't recollect it; I don't think it occurred; if it is in the depositions, I suppose I did—I may have told her so—it was not a desirable document to leave behind me, I must say that—I did not wish to take it—I said at the Police-court that she said if I did not sign the paper she would shoot herself, and make the whole thing public—she also threatened to shoot me; that was the time when she produced the blank pieces of paper; it was in the same conversation—she frequently said she would shoot me; she is very hysterical.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I brought nothing away with me except the wound in my arm—the paper I signed was left in the room; I did not touch the piece that was torn off—I did not produce the paper at the Police-court; it was produced by the prisoner's solicitor, and I was asked if that was the paper—when I went to the house I did not know that she had got a revolver—I left the torn piece of paper on the table; I never touched it; I did not bring it away—there was no struggle between us before I was shot, the struggle was when I reached her side—the first time intercourse took place between us I used no violence; it happened at an hotel at the west end of the town, a restaurant—we had not gone to dine there, it was in the afternoon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Licentiate of the Royal Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons—in April, 1887, I was called in to attend the prisoner at her confinement, in Percy Road, Shepherd's Bush—I saw both her and Mr. Isaacs for the first time some weeks after the confinement—in August, 1888, I became the prisoner's trustee, at her request; it was for £2,000, when £1,000 was given to her in money; that was done through me—I saw her afterwards from time to time—on 16th October last year I went to 110, Church Road, Richmond, where she was then living, in consequence of a letter she had sent me—I went into the dining-room—she made a statement to me as to what had happened between herself and Mr. Isaacs; she said she had sent for Major Isaacs to come down, and that he came there, and that she presented a paper to him for £20,000—she said she locked the door before that, and that after he had signed the paper he attempted to take it away from her; and that he followed her round the table, and then pushed the table against the sideboard to prevent her escaping; and then she said, "I shot him"—those were the very words she used—I said, "I am very sorry for you, that is the worst act of your life"—I asked her where the servants were, and she said, "Out"—I said, "Where was the woman in charge?"—she said, "Out; there was no one in the house but me"—I think that was all that was said—I asked her where the revolver was purchased—she said, "I purchased it at Beading"—I think I said, "Well, supposing you had killed him, what would you have done?" and I think she replied, "I think I</p>

               <p>should have shot myself, "or something to that effect—the next time I saw her was at Ramsgate, when I was telegraphed for—I saw her at the solicitors' office, about four weeks since, on 10th February—I had previously seen her with reference to signing a deed, and discussed the matter with her—I had consented to be a trustee again for £6,000—at the solicitors' office she said she would not accept less than £15,000, and not a penny of it should be in trust; that he should hand it to her in cash—the solicitor said that he was authorised to offer her £8,500; £6,000 in trust, and £2,500 to be handed over in cash—that was her own proposition to me by a letter—she then wrote to me that she would not accept it—she said, if Mr. Isaacs would not give her the £15,000 he should die; she did not say in what way; she said she would murder the child before our eyes, and she also said she would shoot everyone connected with the business—she then left; she positively refused to sign the deed, or accept the sum offered—one day before that, in December, when in Hertford Road, she became very excited when I advised her to accept what was offered—she said she did not care, she would meet him in the street and deliberately run a knife into him—at the solicitors' office Miss Emslie was with her; she had been one of the trustees.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first knew the prisoner about a year before her confinement—I attended her afterwards in the country, I believe at Ramsgate—I have not been paid for my attendance; I have sent in a claim to Major Isaacs—I was present at the Police-court, but was not called—I was not in communication with Messers. Wontner from October until this prosecution was instituted, nor during any portion of it—the only communication I had from Messers. Wontner was in January, when the deed was sent, that was after she agreed to accept £8,500; then they wrote, sending the deed, and a letter afterwards, stating that I was to meet Miss Vincent at their office—that was the only communication I had with Messers. "Wontner—I was not in communication with them before I went to the Police-court—I was as to what had occurred in their office—I merely saw the statement that was written after my meeting her at the office—I was called to the Police-court on the morning that she was charged—I was not requested by Messers. Wontner to be there, I don't know by whom I was requested—I have the police telegram here; I don't know who called me—it was not issued by Messers. Wontner; it was sent to my house at nine in the morning—I don't know that Messers. Wontner were responsible for my going there—I don't know whether the prisoner requested me to go—the telegram is dated 12th February, 1890—she was then in custody; she was apprehended the previous evening—I did not know that she was going to be apprehended—the telegram was addressed to me; it was sent from Richmond to Starch Green Police-station, and brought from there to my house at Shepherd's Bush. (<hi rend="italic">Telegram read:</hi> "Please inform Dr. Coker Elizabeth Vincent is in custody at Police-station, and will be taken before the Magistrate at ten a.m. to-day; will he come at once? Reply")—I had no communication whatever with Messers. Wontner before that, that I recollect—on the 11th I received a press copy of a note that one of their clerks had made of the interview—I went to Richmond, as I was requested by the telegram—I attended at the Police-court both days, but was not called—I had communicated what the prisoner had said to me about the interview with Major Isaacs —I never thought I should have been brought</p>

               <p>here to give evidence against the prisoner—I told him each interview I had with her from time to time, and her threats—I do not recollect her saving when I went to attend her immediately after this occurrence that she had had a fearful accident since I was there—she may have said such a thing; I don't recollect it—she did not say she had a bad head; she sent for me to come over, to tell me what had occurred—I authenticated the statement sent to me, about ten days since—that was the first time I had any idea that I was going to be a witness—I thought I should be called, and I was not called the second time; I went there without any notice; I did not know whether I should be called or not; as a trustee I thought it better to attend—I did not see the prisoner's solicitor since I received the press copy from Messers. Wontner—oh, yes, I did, on the following day—I never told him anything more than I have told here—I think I told him that—I told him what she had told me—I think I told him that she said she had shot Major Isaacs; I don't recollect quite now, but I think so—I spoke to him at one time about what had occurred at Messers. Wontner's office—I don't recollect whether I told him the story about the knife; I don't think so; I don't know.</p>

Wontner; I correct that, that was not the first time I saw him; I saw him shortly after the prisoner was apprehended, when he wrote to me, then I told him what had occurred at Messers. Wontner's—I think I told him then what had occurred at Messers. Wontner's—I have seen Mr. Dutton three times—I told him, I think, about the press copy the first time I went to his office—I think I made the statement I have made to-day to Mr. Dutton the second time I went, and the first time I showed him the press copy and spoke of her conduct at Messrs, Wontner's—the first time I called I told him what I had known of the case for some years—I don't recollect whether I told him about the conversation I had had with the prisoner in October the first, second, or third time I went—I could not swear I have ever told him about it—I have had a great deal of trouble in the matter since October—I have not been to Messers. Wontner's office more than twice; I have seen Mr. Isaacs at least once or twice a week—I have not expected any pay for seeing him; I have for going to Ramsgate—I am quite indifferent about recompense; I have nothing down in my visiting book—I have no reason to expect payment, but I hope, certainly.</p>

               <p>to, with a view to her signing it—originally it was a deed for £4,000, then it was increased to £6,000, and there were blanks for securities to be mentioned—on Monday, 10th February, about half-past four p.m., the prisoner came to our office with Miss Elmslie—Dr. Coker was present—she refused to sign the deed—I had read through the clause she objected to—immediately after she left my room with Miss Elmslie I put in writing what I considered to be the substance of what passed—this is the actual paper I then drew up; my signature is on it:—"10th February, 1890. Mrs. Vincent called between 4.30 and 5 with a friend (female). I informed her that I was instructed by Major Isaacs to settle the claim, but that he insisted on £6,000 being invested in the terms of the deed which I had before me, and that I should be in a position to hand her a cheque for £2,500 to-morrow morning. She at once said she would do nothing of the sort; that she required £15,000, and would have the money in her own hands. I pointed out that Major Isaacs was acting in the most liberal manner, and in requiring her to settle £6,000 he was studying her interests. She got up, and said she would not sign the deed, and that Major Isaacs should die, and that she would murder the child, and shoot all that were connected with the business. I asked her if she meant me, and she said, 'Yes; I may as well die for a sheep as a lamb.' I tried to reason with her, but she refused to listen; and on my pointing out that she was greatly mistaken as to Major Isaacs' means, she said she did not care, she would have his last penny. Dr. Coker, who was present, called her attention to a letter she had written, to which she replied that she would have accepted the money a month ago, but she would not have any money in trust. I again tried to reason with her by explaining to her the clauses she had objected to in her letter of Saturday, but she said, 'There is no use our prolonging the interview; he shall die, and so shall I! I will murder the child before your eyes! I will murder the lot of you, and will leave a paper to expose the whole!' Upon this she called her friend and left. (Signed) <hi rend="smallCaps">C. W.

I live at 62, Loughborough Park, Brixton, and am an engineering student—on 19th February I was playing in a football match, beginning about half-past two, at Raynes Park, Wimbledon—I had dressed before the match in the pavilion, and hung up my ordinary clothes on a hat-peg in the dressing-room—in my trousers' pocket was my silver watch and chain—after the game was over I went back to the pavilion dressing-room, and in consequence of something told me I at once searched my trousers' pocket, and found my watch and chain, worth about £2, were gone—I found the prisoner detained by the ground man before I searched—we were playing fifty or sixty yards from the pavilion—there was a field between the one we played in and the dressing-room—I had never seen the prisoner before; he had nothing to do with the match to my knowledge—I had no conversation with him; I heard no complaint made.</p>

I was with Bennett on this night—I heard cries of "Police!" and saw the prisoner running, and Bennett catch hold of him—he fell down, and I caught hold of him—the prosecutor came up and said, "He has taken my watch"—we took him to the station—I afterwards searched the spot where the prisoner was arrested, the side of the road to which he ran, and I found this pipe, a portion of the chain, and threepence bronze.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not see you assault the prosecutor; I did not see you with anything, nor attempt to throw anything away—the Inspector asked the prosecutor if he had lost anything, and he said nothing.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Inspector L</hi>). I took the charge on 4th February—I asked the prosecutor if he had lost anything—he said "No"—I said, "Are you quite sure?"—he said, "No"—I directed Cheeseman to go and search the place where the prisoner was apprehended—he did so, and brought back this portion of chain, this pipe, and 3d.—the prosecutor did not appear next morning; the prisoner was discharged and re-arrested the same day—he was placed with five or six other men, and the prosecutor was brought into the room, and immediately picked him out—the prosecutor had evidently been drinking, but was not drunk; he knew perfectly what he was doing—he made the same statement to me as he did at the Police-court.</p>
