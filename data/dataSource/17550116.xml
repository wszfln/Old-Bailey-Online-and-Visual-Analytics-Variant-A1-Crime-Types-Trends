He made several halts till I came up with him; then he said, How do you do, brother-traveler? and asked me how far it was over the common. I said, About a mile, or mile and half. He walked with me about two stones throw. I asked him how far he was going He said, Only over this common. He asked me how far I was going? I said, To Barnet. He seeing the road was clear, took me by the arm, and said, I must have your money. I complained, and said, I was a poor traveler going about fifty or sixty miles, and had not much money. He said, If you don't make haste, I'll stick you, or cut you. Then I pulled out 1 s. 6 d. from my pocket, and some half-pence. He took the 1 s. 6 d. and left the half-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a sword by his side?</p>
               <p>J. Reuben. No. He put his hand to his pocket, when he said he would cut me. He turned down the common on the right-hand, and I went on. In about ten minutes I met two men on horseback, to whom I told of my being robbed.</p>

               <p>J. Reuben. No, he was not. There came three men and overtook me in about a quarter of an hour afterwards. I told them of it: I went with them through Whetstone turnpike. There came a Man after me on horseback, and asked which of us had been robbed?</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this after the robbery?</p>
               <p>J. Reuben. It might be about three quarters of an hour after. The other men told him I had. Then I went back with that man to Brown's-wells; there I found the soldier, which I believe is the prisoner at the bar. He wanted to shake hands with me; but I did not care to do that. The people there said, he of his own accord had told them he had robbed me; and he said so, in my hearing, of several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe, or are you positive, the prisoner is the man that robbed you?</p>
               <p>J. Reuben. I can't swear positive; I believe he is the man.</p>

The post-men rode before, and stopt him; we brought him to my house, and sent for a constable; the prosecutor was fetched back, and I thought the prisoner would have given him his 1 s. 6 d. back again. I heard him say he had robbed a man with a bundle under his arm of 1 s. 6 d. and said, he hoped they would not hang him; but he did not mind being transported.</p>

               <p>Anne Griffiths. On the 28th of December, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into my shop, and said he wanted to buy some silver ware, handkerchiefs, and other goods. I shewed him some silver first; he chose out a pair of shoe and knee-buckles, and desired me to weigh them; I did, and told him what they came to. He said, reach me a piece of chalk that I may put them down, that I may not go beyond my quantity of money. I gave him a pencil, and turned myself about to reach him a slate; he set them down, then he looked out a gold ring, and desired me to weigh it, which I did, and told him the price, and he put that down; then he chose out another large pair of shoe and knee-buckles, and desired me to weigh them, which I did, and told him what they came to, and he put them down; then he chose out two gold rings more, and desired me to weigh them, which I did, and he put them down; then he said he must have some handkerchiefs, and must not go beyond the money he had got to lay out, and pulled out a green purse, it seemed to have money in it, but he pulled, none out, these goods were then lying by me on the compter; by degrees he got the buckles in his hands, and weighed them in his hand, and said, I'll have them weighed all over again for fear of a mistake; I said, to please you I'll do it; then he laid t hem down, and desired me to, weigh another ring, and while I was weighing it he put the three other gold rings on his fingers; I looked at him, he said, I can't say it is right to put them on my hand before I have paid for them, and pulled them off; he wrapped up the buckles, and put the rings in his other hand, and immediately ran out; my children were at the door; I and they pursued him, calling out, Stop thief; I got a terrible fall, and could not proceed very far, but he was taken in Red-lion-street, which is about four or five hundred yards from my house, and the things all found again, except two great shoe-buckles.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the goods?</p>
               <p>A. Griffiths. They are worth about 4 l. ( Produced in court, the two buckles which were fellows to those missing and were shewn to the jury.) These are the goods he cheapened in my shop.</p>

I was at work in Red-lion-street on the 28th of December between five and six o'clock, I met the prisoner, he called stop thief; I believe forty people or more were after him; I had my horse and carriage; as I came back again, I saw something shine upon the ground, when he had passed I took up five silver buckles, all within half a foot of each other; I was told they belonged to Mrs. Griffiths, and I went and carried them there.</p>

On the 28th of December, about six at night, I heard of this robbery, I went to the prosecutrix, she saying she had three children, could not afford to prosecute, and said, if the prisoner would tell her where the other rings were she did not want to prosecute. I went to him and desired him to let me know; he said, if I would go with him into another room he would tell me; then he said he had dropped the three gold rings at such a place; we went with a candle, and they were picked up by different persons, and these are the things the prosecutrix has sworn to.</p>

               <p>Q. Which side did you sit on?</p>
               <p>M. Whitchurch. I sat on the left-hand side, he spoke to me; I did not then see a pistol, but afterwards I did. I immediately gave him a silk purse with only a little silver in it; after this, I saw a man on the other side, I put the glass down which was up on that side, and my lady gave that man a handful of silver, he had a large pistol in his hand, which he put into the chariot, I desired him to take it out, which he did immediately, and desired I would not be affrighted; when they had taken the money they immediately went away.</p>

               <p>Q. How was the prisoner dressed?</p>
               <p>W. Parprit. He was dressed in mourning, or a sort of dark grey; he appeared like a Gentleman's servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take much notice of the other?</p>
               <p>W. Parprit. I did, he was in a light-coloured coat and plate buttons.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take such particular notice of them?</p>
               <p>W. Parprit. Because I could not help it, being behind the chariot.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any others besides the two you speak of ?</p>
               <p>W. Parprit. No, there were not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>W. Parprit. I cannot say whether I have or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at the taking of him?</p>
               <p>W. Parprit. I know nothing of the taking him, he was brought to justice Cox's for me and farmer Emmerton to look at.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. On which side was he that bid you not be affrighted ?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. They both did.</p>
               <p>William Norden. There was an information came to justice Fielding that there were two young gentlemen highwaymen about Twickenham, Teddington, and those parts; the day after this robbery was committed, Mr. Fielding dispatched me and another to see if we could meet with them; we got descriptions of them at Teddington, and was there told that they were born there, and both their names; the other they told us was named

               <p>W. Norden. Mr. Cox knew him before, and said to him, ah, Tom, I am sorry for you; then he confessed directly, and said Holderness drew him in to go a robbing, in order to get money to pay for a bastard child.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your business? Are not you a thief-catcher?</p>
               <p>W. Norden. I think it a very honest employment. I dare say, if you was robbed, you would employ me.</p>

               <p>When I went out of her house, I took the hat and cloak as usual; she has lent me them many a time. I did want a little money, and pawned them to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Did you lend her these things?</p>
               <p>M. Symonds. No, I did not; neither did I know they were gone till I missed them. I never did lend her them in my life.</p>
               <p>Oswald Hill. This morning I went to the prosecutor's house, and asked her how she could be so base to level a felony, where it was but an action of debt? She said, she had sworn it, and that was sufficient. I said, I understood they were only lent. She said, it was a fine thing if she had lent any thing, that it should be paw ned. She did not deny she had lent them to her. I have known the prisoner ever since she was born; she is a simple honest woman, that does not take care of herself; but I never knew any harm of her.</p>

            . About eight or nine days ago, Mrs. Symonds came to me crying, and said, Mrs. Taylor had borrowed her cloak and apron of her, to go to a relation, to get some money for her subsistence; but she got none, so she has carried them to pawn. I knew Mrs. Symonds had frequently lent her her things before, and said she was very welcome to those things at any time.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she to tell you?</p>
               <p>J. Scot. She came to my house, I suppose in order to get some money to redeem them. The prisoner has lived in my house; I took upon her to be an honest woman. She has a husband now living; but he lives with another woman.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Do you now say you never lent her any of the things?</p>
               <p>M. Symonds. I never said I had lent her things in my life. The first and second witnesses I never spoke to but once each. She never went to her relations with my things in her days.</p>

I saw him plain, and know it to be him; Mr. Boxter said, sir, take your pistol away, and I'll give you what I have; there was another man with the prisoner holding another pistol, which is Burk (the man that was wounded in taking of him.) I put my hand to my pocket and delivered half a crown, I can't say to which; upon which the prisoner made use of some very terrible oaths, and said he would search our pockets, and if he found any more we were dead immediately; upon which I gave him a guinea, and said, there is a guinea more, be content and go away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough to distinguish the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>J. Manby. It was very moon-light, and there was a lamp very near; they then made use of more oaths, and said they would search us, and opened the coach-door on that side; I then thought it was high time to make some resistance. I got out the pin and opened the door in order to get out to draw my sword, and I think the prisoner was the first man that came round, he said, d - n you, I know what you are about, I will blow your brains out, for I know I shall be hanged; he took my sword and looked at it, and threw it into the coach again, and held his pistol several minutes to my head.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you drawn your sword ?</p>
               <p>J. Manby. No, I had not, he swore several times d - n you, don't look at me, but I had such opportunities of seeing him, that as far as one man can swear to another, I can swear the prisoner is the man; I saw a mark under his left-eye, which he had when before the justice afterwards. He took from off my finger a topaz ring, with a brilliant on each side, and a mourning ring, and felt in my pocket, and said, d - n you, your watch, I said I had no watch; then I pulled out a stone, and said, it is nothing but a stone which I carry in my pocket for the cramp, and took it out and shewed it him, he said, d - n you, put it into your pocket again; he then took my buckles from my shoes, I am certain he was five minutes about me; he felt in my pocket where was a snuff-box, I said it was but a very ordinary one, he said, then d - n you, keep it, then he went and robbed my wife. I saw also a third man walking upon the hill looking about, and he walked after them when they went away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When he saw me before justice Fielding, he said these were the cloaths I have on now which I robbed him in, but I bought them since he was robbed. I am just come from sea.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Manby. Coming home from upper Brook-street where we had spent the evening, we were stopped on Little tower-hill, a little after one o'clock; I sat forward, and saw the prisoner at the bar the length of the coach and horses distance standing with a pistol cross his arm; when the coach came opposite to where he stood; I gave a little scream, and he sprang cross the way and put his hand to the coach-window. Mr. Manby sat opposite to me, the prisoner made use of very bad oaths, that he'd blow our brains out if we did not give him our money.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Manby. I knew him immediately at justice Fielding's, he was the person that robbed me of a gold ring. I know him by a remarkable shake of his head.</p>
               <p>Court. Speak only to what he took from your husband, he is now trying for that.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Manby. When my husband was going to get out of the coach I was surprized very much, but I remember seeing the prisoner feeling in Mr. Manby's pockets, and take the buckles out of his shoes, and ring from his finger.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baxter. Mr. Manby, his lady, and a little boy a nephew of mine, and myself, were returning from Brook-street in a coach on Saturday morning, between twelve and one. When we were on Little-tower-hill, by the ditch-side, Mrs. Manby screamed out all on a sudden. I thought the coach was going to overturn; but immediately I saw a man with a very long pistol at the coach-side. He made use of many oaths, and said he would blow our brains out, if we did not deliver immediately, and no woods, was his expression. He was immediately joined by a second; one of them put a pistol to me, and said, your money, watch, and ring, deliver them directly. I said, if he would be so good as to take the pistol on one side, he should have all I had. Then I gave him some silver, I believe no more than 2 s. He was very little satisfied, and made use of many bad expressions, and swore we must have more, and bid us come out, and said if he found any more, he would blow my brains out. He did not suffer me to get out of the coach; he put his hand into my sob and pockets, and demanded my buckles. I put my feet out of the coach one after the other, and he took them from my shoes. I had an opportunity to put my watch by, so saved that. I believe it was not the prisoner. Mr. Manby gave them money. I think, twice. I remember he said, here in a guinea for you; but don't know which he gave it to. And I think his lady gave them some. I have some reason to know the prisoner Gill by what follower afterwards. At the time Mrs. Manby and I were robbed, Mr. Manby was endeavouring to get out of the coach. I believe he had opened the door; upon which one of the men swore, and ran round, which way I know not, but I saw him on the other side, with a pistol at Mr. Manby's breast, and he pushed it forwards two or three times; I was afraid it would go off. The man kept feeling in his pockets, and took his ring from his finger, and a little stone from his pockets. After that, he took his sword from him, and looked at it, and throwed it into the coach again. As they were robbing us, they both said, don't look at us. When I was at Mr. Fielding's there was some other people examined on other accounts, and I knew nothing of the prisoner Gill's coming into the room, which was almost full of people. I had my eye towards the door, and saw him come in, and then did not know he was a prisoner. I immediately said to Mrs. Manby, that is the man that robbed us; and should I see him amongst a thousand, I should know him. The other man, that was wounded in Covent-Garden, is so much disfigured, I could know nothing of him. They had both much such sort of coats on as the prisoner has now.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, I took this ring in pawn (producing a topaz ring) of Walter Keen, the prisoner, on the 2d of January; I lent him half a guinea on it. I asked him if it was his own? He (as I had known him six years) said, you know I don't wear such baubles. as these. He said, a gentleman of his acquaintance sent him with it. I said, when you know whose it is. Ay to be sure, that I do, said he.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him the person's name ?</p>
               <p>A. Longate. No, I did not. I went to bed immediately, after which my wife brought up a watch, that she told me Keen and Gill had brought; I let her lend a guinea on it.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>A. Longate. It was between nine and ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Manby. Look at this ring.</p>
               <p>Mr. Manby. This is the topaz ring I lost at the time mentioned.</p>

            . (produced a pair of shoe-buckles.) When the surgeons were dressing Burk's wounds, after he was taken, I took these buckles out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. to Manby. Look at these buckles.</p>
               <p>Mr. Manby. I was robbed of just such a pair that night; but as there may be many of the same pattern, I will not swear to them. I believe them to be the same.</p>
               <p>Gill's defence.</p>
               <p>I was in a publick-house; Burk came to me with this ring; he said he got it of a fellow he had been drinking with; he said he would go and pawn it; he came to Mr. Keen, and said he was going to pawn it, so I desired him to go with it. Keen is quite innocent.</p>
               <p>Keen's defence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gill owed me fourteen shillings, and said he wanted to pawn the ring, and he would pay me. He told me he was mate of a ship. I went down with him to Mr. Longate's; he staid at the door, and bid me go in, and get 9 s. upon it. I went in with it, and got half a guinea. I never put the money in my pocket.</p>

I went on pretty fast; when I came up with them, which was about twothirds on the road, they called out, stand and deliver. I stood still, and said, search me, search me. It was a fine night, the moon was a quarter old. The m en were Gill the prisoner, and Burk. Gill gave his pistol to Burk, and felt in my breeches pocket, and took two-pence halfpenny and two farthings out, then he took out of my buckles out of my shoes, after that my knee-buckles; then he took off my shoes, and there I had put a guinea for safety, which he took out of my right shoe. Then he said, now, you dog, you shall walk home without shoes. No, no, said the other, give him his shoes. The other saw a handkerchief in my pocket, he took that, and said he wanted a handkerchief to wipe his nose with, and he put it to his nose, and then into his pocket. I said to them several times, gentlemen, I hope you will not use me ill. No, no, they said, we are none of your knockers-down. Then they took me about an hundred yards upon the soil-field, where they took a pair of silver buttons out of my sleeves, and took my hat, and gave me an old slapt one. Then I walked about half way up the field, and said, gentlemen, I shall be obliged to you if you will give me my hat. They said, No, no; go along. They said several times, don't look in our faces; and one said to the other, don't let him look at your face; but walking with them down in the field, I got a good view of their faces. My hat was brought to justice Fielding's when Gill was examined, said to be taken off of Burk's head, and the buckles were found in his pocket. (Produced in court.) These are the buckles they took from me that night; here is my name on them.</p>

            . On the Sunday after we had apprehended Burk and Gill, I went to see Burk<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175501160012"/> in the roundhouse, and had a good deal of talk with him. I said, I was very sorry he had not surrendered sooner, and not have suffered himself to be cut and used so. He said he had an English heart in his belly, and that no highwayman will surrender without a blow. I said, all the service you can do for your country is, to let the poor people you have robbed have their things again. Said he, I wish justice Fielding would come here, I would tell him a great deal. I told Mr. Fielding, and he went to him; I was there also. Burk there said, Mayo had got a pair of buckles and they watches; and that Gill and he robbed one gentleman in the Chelsea stage-coach of one watch, and the other they took from a lady in St. George's fields; and a pair of silver buckles we robbed a man of in the new road near Whitechapel-mount; and on Monday Mayo was taken up, and before the justice he produced these buckles the prosecutor has sworn to; and this watch ( producing one) that he said they took from a lady in St. George's-fields.</p>
               <p>Gill. That watch belongs to that lady ( pointing to a lady that had before said she had been robbed of it, before the justice, and to whom it was delivered.)</p>
               <p>W. Nordon. He produced a paper, he said was of Mapo's hand writing, but it was very badly wrote; it was something about borrowing money on a watch; I know it was signed Gill Burk is so very bad with his wounds he received, that he could not be removed to take his trial.</p>

               <p>Gill's defence.</p>
               <p>All I have to say is, I know nothing of the man (meaning Mayo) but what is honest. I came into his house, and had no money to pay him for what liquor I had, so I gave him my watch and things, and gave him from under my hand that he should keep them till I could get the money to redeem them.</p>
               <p>Mayo's defence.</p>
               <p>Gill and Buck ran a reckoning before I would take the things, and when I did, I would not do it without a writing from under Gill's hand.</p>
               <p>For Mayo.</p>
               <p>WilliamLong. About a week ago, Gill and Burk came into my house, the Coach-and-horses in Swan yard, near the Strand; they ran a reckoning of about half a guinea; Gill asked me what was to pay? I told him. He said he had not money enough about him to pay; but he would leave a pledge. I went into the stable, to inform my father-in-law, the prisoner, Mr. Mayo, of it. He came into the house to them, and told them, they ought to have offered their pledge before they had ran their reckoning. They pressed upon him, and rather than I should lose my reckoning, he lent them some money on the watch. They said they belonged to a ship called the Foy, that was going to be paid off, then they would redeem it. My father lent them a guinea and half-upon it, and allowed the half-guinea for the reckoning. As to the buckles, about two days after, Burk came, and a woman along with him, in the afternoon, into our tap-room; he called for a pint of hot; I believe they staid about two hours and a half; they ran to about the tune of two shillings. Burk called, and asked what was to pay? I said, betwixt two and three shillings: Said he, I have no money; but I'll leave my buckles. He stooped down to his shoes, and took them out. I went and called my father-in-law, and told him Burk had no money; but wanted to pawn his shoe-buckles. My father came in, and said, Mr. Burk, how is this? He said, his ship was at Black-wall, and would be paid in two or three days; and said, if you will lead me some more money on them, I'll pay you in that time: upon which he lent him ten shillings, or ten and six-pence, I don't know which. He would not have lent him a farthing upon these things, had it not been that I should not lose my reckoning.</p>

            . I happened to go to Mr. Long's house, there was a man and a woman sat drinking in the taphouse.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>L. Roberts. It was about a week before Christmas, to the best of my knowledge, I sat there the drinking of half a pint of hot wine, I can't say but I heard some dispute about the reckoning; the man said he would leave a pair of silver buckles with Mr. Long; Mr. Long said he would not take them, and called his father, then the man took the buckles of his shoes and gave them to Mr. Mayo, and he lent him about ten shillings upon them to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. West. I have seen the paper they talk of, it was a conditional note given for the payment of two guineas, but he was to redeem the watch in two days, if not, it was to be forfeited.</p>

I passed betwixt the wall and him; he said, what o'clock is it master, I said the watch called past one; I had not walked above ten or a dozen yards before he called hip, he came running and overtook me, and clapped a pistol to my left-ear, and said, d - n your blood, you villain, deliver your money, and if you offer to molest, or speak a word, I'll blow your brains out; the other man came running back to me, and said, what is the matter? I desired the prisoner to spare my life, and said my money he was welcome to, and pulled it out and gave it into his hand. He said, d - n you, you scoundrel, here is nothing but half-pence; I said there is both gold and silver; he said, what gold? I said, half a guinea, he holding the pistol to my head all the time, said to the other man, search his pockets, seel for his watch; that man turned my pockets wrong-side out; then the prisoner said to him, examine his buckles, the man immediately stooped to my right-foot, taking the buckle out, said, are they silver? I said, no; he took it out, and perceiving the stamp, said, d - n you, you scoundrel, they are; then he took the other out, and likewise the buckles from my knees; then the prisoner said, I want a neckcloth, and took hold of mine and pulled it off, and held the pistol all the time to my face; at the time I looked him in the face, he said, d - n you, you scoundrel, if you look me down so I'll blow your brains out; then he clapped his hand to my left-shoulder, and said, go over the way, I went over, and my shoe came off, the prisoner followed me, and the other man followed him. I looked back, and said, for God's sake don't murder or disable me, I have got a wife and two small children; the prisoner said, I will not hurt a hair of your head, we rob a great many men and have not hurt one yet. After I came to the corner of Whitechapel-mount, I was obliged to come back again; I asked the prisoner where I was to go then? he said, behind the mount, and at a turnstile he bid me stand still, then he said, d - n the scoundrel, he says here is half a guinea, let us see; I and the other man stood close together, I don't know that I could know him, but as for the prisoner he had a short cockup hat on, with a sharp cock, thought I, I am sure of thee; he looked at the money and said, yes, here is half a guinea.</p>

               <p>T. Blackmore. Yes, he did, and went out, then the woman went and brought him in, and set him down in the farther part of the room. There were fourteen or sixteen women in the house who behaved very bad.</p>

I felt something at that instant at my pocket; I missed my handkerchief out of my right-hand pocket, she whipped round between him and the shop, Mr. Elliot and I were arm in arm, I was on the out-side, she went towards Temple-bar; I told Mr. Elliot I had lost my handkerchief, I ran immediately up to the prisoner, who was not above five yards from me.

A little beyond the Chapter-house I missed my handkerchief (I had used it as I entered the church-yard); I made a full stop, and said to Mr. Unwin, I have lost my handkerchief since I came into the church-yard. Two boys came up and told me, if I would follow them, they would shew me the person that took it. They running before me, I and Mr. Unwin went after them, and betwixt the Goose-and-Gridiron and Child's coffee-house I met with them. The two boys said, these are the boys ( pointing to the two prisoners) one picked your pocket, and gave it to the other. We secured them immediately; in going to search them, I saw my handkerchief lying about half a yard behind the boy I had hold of, (the handkerchief produced in court, and deposed to.) I did not see it drop from either of them; it is a linen handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they run away?</p>

Immediately after that, I felt my coat turn on one side; I clapt my hand into my pocket, and missed my handkerchief; upon which I turned back, and found this boy behind me. He went on the other side the street; I had my eye upon him, and saw him come back to the same place where I lost my handkerchief. I went up to him as he was standing in the gateway, and took hold of his collar, and said, I believe you have got my handkerchief. He said he had not; his hand was then behind him, under his coat; I took hold of that arm, and brought it from under his coat; in it was this handkerchief, ( producing one ) it was my handkerchief, the same I used just before. He said he had found it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in a dirty coodition, as if picked up from the ground?</p>
               <p>H. Aurbury. No, sir; he said, before the alderman, another boy picked my pocket, and flung it behind him, and he picked it up.</p>

I made inquiry after him, and found him in Piccadilly, at Mr. Hallowell's, about a fortnight ago; he told me he bought him of one Wankford.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>J. Bardwell. I did; he was in my stable but a little before I lost my horse; he lived within two or three miles of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a house-keeper ?</p>
               <p>J. Bardwell. No, he has a lodging. I went before justice Fielding, and swore to my horse. Mr. Fielding summoned Mr. Hollowell to come before him; he came, and there swore he bought the horse of Wankford the prisoner; Hollowell had him in custody in New-prison before I came there.</p>

            . In the beginning of May, I believe the 5th, I heard Mr. Wankford was in town, with a horse to sell, at the King's-arms, by Tyburn-road. I had formerly lent him ten guineas, so I got a warrant and arrested him; after which Mr. Marshall desired I would come to some terms, and let him out. He told me there was nothing to be had; but that there was a horse of the prisoner's at his house, which he had lent him seven guineas towards the payment of, and the horse and he had eat out six pounds more, and he would not part with the horse under that thirteen pounds, and if I would buy him, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175501160018"/> would bring him to my house, saying, he might be worth something more. He brought him, and asked sixteen pounds for him. I said twelve or thirteen pounds was the full value. I came to this agreement to set the prisoner at liberty, he delivering the horse to me, and I to pay to Mr. Marshall twelve pounds, and Wankford to give me a fresh note for eleven pounds, dated May 8. My original debt was ten pounds, or ten guineas, which I lent him ten years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the same horse that the prosecutor swears to?</p>
               <p>R. Hollowell. It is the same; and upon justice Fielding's order, I delivered the horse up to him.</p>

            . On the 13th of last April the prisoner brought a black gelding to my house, and there offered to sell him to divers people. He was arrested at my house by Mr. Hollowell; the next day he sent for me, and desired I would let Mr. Hollowell have the horse at, I think, fourteen pounds. I told him, he said he would not give such money. Then the prisoner said, if he would give him twelve pounds, or twelve guineas, for him, he should have him. I went and told him so; so they agreed as Mr. Hollowell has before said.</p>

I went to Mr. Bolton's house with the prisoner, the officer, and my journeyman. Mr. Bolton and his wife both said the prisoner was the man that brought the goods there.

               <p>Anne Russel. On the 2d of January, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came up stairs into a room where I and his wife were, at Constantine Phipps, Esq; at <placeName id="t17550116-25-crimeloc134">Sion-hill</placeName>

                        targets="t17550116-25-off131 t17550116-25-crimeloc134"/> near Brentford, I live with a lady that is there, the prisoner's wife waits upon Mr. Phipps's lady, and he was principal servant there; he asked his wife why she did not go to bed? her answer was, she could not go for her lady was not in bed; she said, Moody, why don't you go to bed, you have got a nack of sitting up on nights, and my master is afraid you should fall asleep, and is afraid of an accident by fire, and she said she should let her master know it; he said he should not go to bed yet, for he had something else to do.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the words he had something else to do, or there was something else to do?</p>
               <p>A. Russel. He had something else to do. After that, she perceiving something in his breast, clapped her hand upon the top of it, she cried out, Mrs. Russel, Mrs. Russel, here are pistols, and immediately took hold on his waistcoat at the right-side collar, and tore either that or his shirt by pulling of him. I immediately went and laid hold on his left-arm, he strove with me and pushed me away; after that he catched hold on her left-arm, and said, d - n you, here is one for you, and the other for me; he had then a pistol in his hand, and immediately laid it down on the table, and took out the other; she was at the foot of the bed, he still having hold on her, she stooped her head down on the inside of the curtain, he struck the pistol over her head, I heard it snap, but I did not see the fire. I was then at one corner of the feet of the bed on the outside the curtain, which prevented my seeing it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do not know whether the pan flashed, or whether the cock went down only, do you?</p>
               <p>A. Russel. That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. After you heard the cock go down, what was the next thing you observed?</p>
               <p>A. Russel. He immediately let go her arm, and cocked the pistol again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him cock it?</p>
               <p>A. Russel. I saw him a cocking of it; she, as soon as he had let go her arm, ran round the back of him, and she and I both made our escape out of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Which went out first?</p>
               <p>A. Russel. Really I can't tell that, there was a sort of a push at the door which of us should get out first, and the moment we were out of the door, I believe we had not got three steps out, before the pistol went off, we were about two yards in the passage from the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body in the room at this time, except the prisoner and you two?</p>
               <p>A. Russel. No, there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you smell any thing of smoak or fire?</p>
               <p>A. Russel. Both; and I heard and saw the flash of the pistol about my cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing where the ball went?</p>
               <p>A. Russel. The ball made a hole in the wainscot not half a quarter of a yard from the door, on the right-hand of it where it locks; the door opens to the left into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did the prisoner's wife run when you got into the passage?</p>
               <p>A. Russel. We turned on the left-hand in order to go down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door quite open after you were out ?</p>
               <p>A. Russel. His wife, at coming out, gave the door a little pull, which made it stand not quite open.</p>
               <p>Q. Which stairs did you attempt to go down? the great or back-stairs.</p>
               <p>A. Russel. The back-stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner follow you?</p>
               <p>A. Russel. He ran after us, and as we were upon the first landing-place on the back-stairs, Mrs. Moody being first, whether he came down any stairs, or whether he put his hand over the banisters I know not, but he there let off another pistol.</p>

               <p>A. Russel. We might be got about two yards, or not quite so much.</p>
               <p>Q. You made use of an expression, be so good as to rehearse it; when she cried out, Mrs. Russel, Mrs. Russel, here are pistols?</p>

               <p>Council for prosecution. How long is that passage before you come to the door?</p>
               <p>A. Russel. It is a pretty long passage, not so long as this court, but longer than the table ( which is about four yards long.)</p>
               <p>Council for defendant. When did you see the ball that struck against the wainscot?</p>
               <p>A. Russel. About an hour after, that same night.</p>
               <p>Q. How big was the hole it made in the wainscot?</p>
               <p>A. Russel. I believe I could put my two fingers in it?</p>
               <p>Q. How big was that ball?</p>

               <p>A. Russel. It fell between the wainscot and a post, it did not stick in the wall, but rebounded; the mark it made was on the second landing-place.</p>
               <p>Q. After the pistol was snapped, did you observe it to be primed again?</p>

            . I am servant in Mr. Phipps's family; I heard an expression of a pistol that night, being in the next room to where this disturbance was, I heard Mrs. Russel say, dear Mr. Moody, for heaven's sake; the doors being both open I ran to the door of the room where Mr. Moody and his wife were.</p>
               <p>C. Tell the court what you saw.</p>
               <p>E. Lawson. I saw Mr. Moody holding his wife.</p>

               <p>E. Lawson. I can't tell, he presented a pistol to her, and she was with her head down behind the curtain; I heard it snap, and saw the fire also.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the pistol go off?</p>

               <p>E. Lawson. I shrieked, and ran along the landing-place towards the great stair-case, and heard the report of a pistol go off before I got to the top of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive the smoak?</p>
               <p>E. Lawson. I did, it was a sort of a smoak following me.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance is the head of the great stairs from the door of the room you came out at?</p>
               <p>E. Lawson. About four yards; after this I went down stairs into the hall, there I met with my master.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any other explosion of a pistol?</p>
               <p>E. Lawson. I did not, I went from the hall to the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give your master an account of what you saw and heard.</p>
               <p>E. Lawson. I cannot say I did, I was so affrighted.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go with an intent to tell him?</p>
               <p>E. Lawson. I went with intent for help.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the place where that ball penetrated ?</p>
               <p>E. Lawson. I did, it was in the wainscot of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was it to the door-case?</p>
               <p>E. Lawson. I never rightly examined it, I was much affrighted, and can't say how near.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the mark of any other ball?</p>
               <p>E. Lawson. I did, it was on the landing-place on the back-stairs by the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the balls?</p>
               <p>E. Lawson. I saw them yesterday, and not before.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You say upon hearing Mrs. Russel cry out, Moody's wife seemed to have her head down behind the curtain; did you see her face?</p>
               <p>E. Lawson. No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the curtain betwixt she and you?</p>
               <p>E. Lawson. He seemed to be next to me, the foot of the bed fronts the door where I was, I do not know which way she turned her face.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her head?</p>
               <p>E. Lawson. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how do you know he presented the pistol to her head?</p>
               <p>E. Lawson. I saw him holding his pistol presented thus (holding her elbow out, and her hand directed slanting downwards.)</p>
               <p>Q. Which part of the landing-place was the mark the ball made?</p>
               <p>E. Lawson. It was facing as you go down the first part of the stairs.</p>
               <p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Phipps, so was the prisoner.</p>
               <p>C. Give my Lord an account whether you saw any mark or hole supposed to be made with a bullet.</p>
               <p>T. Jeffling. I saw a hole about a foot from the door-case in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way does the door open?</p>
               <p>T. Jeffling. It opens into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this hole on the right-side, or on the left ?</p>
               <p>T. Jeffling. It was on the right-side coming out of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the ball been searched for?</p>
               <p>T. Jeffling. Yes, sir, the carpenter searched for it and found i t, I was by.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it found?</p>
               <p>T. Jeffling. It was found upon the ground behind the wainscot, it had penetrated through it, and fell down behind, here it is ( producing one.)</p>
               <p>Q. Was the wainscot deal or oak ?</p>
               <p>T. Jeffling. It was oak.</p>
               <p>Q. How large was the hole ?</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175501160024"/>T. Jeffling. It was as if bored with a large gimlet, and there were splinters broke from the hole.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before they went to search for the ball ?</p>
               <p>T. Jeffling. It was searched for last Wednesday night.</p>
               <p>Council for prosecution. Had you any time before that seen the hole in the wainscot?</p>
               <p>T. Jeffling. Yes, sir, I saw it in fifteen minutes after it was made, that is, the hole the ball was taken up behind.</p>
               <p>John Brown. (Produced a pair of pistols with barrels about eight inches) these I generally make use of, they are Mr. Phipps's; I am his servant, I was in the kitchen when this begun, the first I heard was the maid-servant shrieked out, I went forward into the servants hall, and almost to the bottom of the back-stairs, then I heard a pistol go off, I turned back again and went into the pantry, which is in the servants hall, to search for my pistols, or get something in my hand; I thought there were thieves in the house. I came out again, and went to the bags in the servants hall, where I had hung them. I then found they were both gone, then I went into the kitchen to a scullery there, then I heard the servants calling murder, then I imagined thieves were got into that part of the house, so I turned back again, and met one of the maids, and she mentioned something about Mr. Moody; the next I met with was my master, I imagined when I heard Mr. Moody's name, he had been mad, or something of that sort.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason had you to imagine he had been mad?</p>
               <p>J. Brown. I can't tell your lordship.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed any madness in any part of his behaviour before?</p>
               <p>J. Brown. He would drink pretty much sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. How would he behave then?</p>
               <p>J. Brown. No way outrageous.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by drinking pretty much?</p>
               <p>J. Brown. I mean by that, that he would drink to excess.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go, after you met your master?</p>
               <p>J. Brown. I went again into the servants hall, my master there desired me to take hold of Mr. Moody, who was in his own room, which is called the steward's room; I went into that room, there Mr. Moody was, leaning on his hand by the side of the door; he turned his back to me as soon as ever he saw me; I took hold of him, and turned him round, and held him by both his arms. Then I saw pistols lying on the right-hand going in, upon a shelf. I brought him out of that room, and some of the other servants got hold of him, and my master and we all went into the parlour. My lady was in a very great fright, and asked him if he was mad? He gave her some answer, but I don't know what. Then we brought him to the Coach-and-horses, a public-house near, and I was ordered to stay with him all that night.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you meet with those pistols you have in your hand?</p>
               <p>J. Brown. I am not sure whether I took them out of the steward's room, or whether I found them in the pantry.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition were they?</p>
               <p>J. Brown. The pans were open, and the cocks down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of those pistols that you saw on the shelf, that they were in that position?</p>
               <p>J. Brown. Yes, I did; I was close by them; two days before, to the best of my remembrance, I cleaned them, and dropped oil in the pans, drew the charges, and fired off some powder in the yard, and put them into the bags unloaded, and hung them up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear when you first met with them, to have had any powder in them?</p>
               <p>J. Brown. I found them in the same position as I saw pistols in his room; I will not swear them to be these.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to have been clean?</p>
               <p>J. Brown. They appeared as if they had been discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to say they had been discharged?</p>
               <p>J. Brown. The pans had powder over them, and the powder looked greenish, the oil being in the pans.</p>
               <p>Q. How did their muzzles appear?</p>
               <p>J. Brown. I did not put my finger into the muzzles, so I can't say as to that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was very much in liquor, and did not know what I did.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175501160025"/>For the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Phipps. The prisoner has lived about nine years in my family as my principal servant; he had the total trust of every thing; he has behaved in the best manner in the world; but for some months past he has got into a habit of drinking, and not so careful as he used to be. He was always extremely honest; but not so diligent in my affairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing of lunacy or disorder of mind upon him, when he was sober ?</p>
               <p>Mr. Phipps. I can't say any thing at all of lunacy.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he could distinguish between good and evil?</p>
               <p>Mr. Phipps. I think he could. I never saw any thing outrageous ? but at times seemed rather flushed with liquor.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner from the year 1733, lately I have been very intimate with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his general character?</p>
               <p>R. Greening. The best of characters.</p>
               <p>Q. What's his temper?</p>
               <p>R. Greening. Always mild and meek.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen any alteration in him of late?</p>
               <p>R. Greening. Lately, since the family came out of Yorkshire, which is, I believe, about six weeks ago, I have observed he has had a little heaviness on his mind, and he has drank a little too freely.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call heaviness on his mind?</p>
               <p>R. Greening. That is as if something grieved him. I think him to be quite a different man from what he was when he went into Yorkshire.</p>
               <p>Q. In what respect?</p>
               <p>R. Greening. In his drinking; and seemed, I thought, disturbed in his mind.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been frequently in his company since his coming from Yorkshire?</p>
               <p>R. Greening. I have not seen him very often since.</p>
               <p>Q. How often?</p>
               <p>R. Greening. Six or seven times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever observe any difference when he had not been drinking?</p>
               <p>R. Greening. No; only when he had been drinking.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecution. Then when he had not been drinking, he behaved like other men?</p>
               <p>R. Greening. Yes; only discontented, which was the reason of his drinking. He seemed lower in his spirits than he was before he went into Yorkshire, when he had not been drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear he was ever out of his senses?</p>
               <p>R. Greening. No; I will not undertake that, only discontented.</p>

            . I am his majesty's gardener at Kew. I believe I have been acquainted with the prisoner eighteen years at least; I have been very often in his company; he once lived in our family; he always behaved with great honesty and honour; I never, to my knowledge, saw him in liquor; he was always very chearful, till within these two years. I invited him some time ago to bring his wife to my house, out of respect to the family, he being an old servant. He brought her. After that, I asked him to come several times since, and he has been several times. This last Christmas he was at my house, I had the honour of seeing Mr. Phipps, who came along with him. I then pressed him to drink, as it was Christmas-time; but he would not; I believe he did not drink above two glasses that time. I never heard any man speak ill of him in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you lately observed any difference in his behaviour?</p>
               <p>R. Greening. I have; a discontentedness of mind; that time I speak of, last Christmas, he was very melancholy; I could hardly get a word out of him. And I remember, about three weeks ago, I met him coming out of Brentford on horseback, without a saddle, with his stockings about his heels; he had a little net, and a couple of carp in it. I asked him that day to dine with me; he said he could not, because he expected the family, and was about to get some fish.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might he be then from his home?</p>
               <p>R. Greening. I believe it was not quite half a mile. On my oath, to my opinion I have observed him much altered; he before seemed very chearful, and at those times I could hardly get a word out of him, especially that time at Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you, from the acquaintance you have had with him, conceive him capable of shooting a person, if he was in his right mind?</p>
               <p>R. Greening. I could never have thought it.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecution. Have you at any time thought him out of his mind, so as to be capable of doing such a thing?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175501160026"/>R. Greening. It is impossible to judge of that; he did not act and behave as he used to do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you sensible answers, when he did speak to you?</p>
               <p>R. Greening. He did; but would not speak freely, or be chearful.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that a token of his being out of his mind?</p>
               <p>R. Greening. I can't say that.</p>
               <p>Q. From what you observed of him, did you take him at any time to be a person out of his mind, and had not the right use of his understanding?</p>
               <p>R. Greening. I never took any notice of him, but that day I saw him was the first, to see a gentleman's steward in such a condition, without a saddle, and his stockings down, and the like.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was that?</p>
               <p>R. Greening. I believe it was between nine and ten in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe he was sober then?</p>

               <p>W. Howel. His temper is exceeding good.</p>

               <p>W. Howel. He was at my house twice since he came out of Yorkshire; I think the first time was about three weeks or a month ago; he was very much in liquor in the morning about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him sober since he came out of Yorkshire?</p>
               <p>W. Howel. He called another time after that; he seemed then to be in liquor, but not quite so much. I can't say I have seen him sober since he came out of Yorkshire.</p>

            . I think, to the best of my knowledge, about a fortnight before Christmas, I was in Litchfield-street, which leads from the end of St. Martin's-lane, towards Graston-street, the prisoner at the bar came riding along, I thought a good deal confused, his cloaths were dirty as if he had fell from his horse. I asked him how he did? he said, his horse had fell with him at Hyde-park corner; I think I asked him where he was going, he said, home, which I imagined to be Burlington-street, where Esquire Phipps lives, when in town. I wondered much at seeing him come that way, which was quite out of his way from Hyde-park corner to Burlington-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be in liquor?</p>
               <p>J. Parker. I did apprehend he might be in liquor?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe during that time any uneasiness betwixt the prisoner and his wife?</p>
               <p>A. Russel.

He said, you must get over the wall. I said, I will do any thing in the world to serve you; but I cannot get over the wall, I am so stiff and clumsy. He took the card out of his pocket, and said, there is a glass window, ten to one if the shutters are shut, then we can get up the glass, and the footman says there is no company in the house. Then he said, let us go to Joe, and ask him. We went; Joe told me, they did not want me to get over, they were two good hands themselves. Then it was proposed I should stand without, and receive what they brought out. Solomon said, you can't expect a whole share. Well, said I, g ive me what you think proper; but I deserve something. He said, you shall have a guinea, or a guinea and a half. I said, I am content. They said, may-be they might give me more. We went to the place where the ladder hung; we staid till the watchman had gone past twelve. Solomon went and got up to a lamp, and lighted up a dark lanthorn; then Joe came and gave us an order to come with the ladder, which we carried to James's-court, and set it against the wall; they two went over, and bad me walk about there and watch. They pulled the ladder up, and I shoved as far as I could; and they set it down on the other side. After some time they came over again; they had a great broad bag, which they set on the ground, and as they were putting their shoes on, I looked into the bag, there I saw many silver-handled knives and forks, silver candlesticks, a silver sabbath-lamp, which we light up on Friday nights, silver spoons, and linen between them, that they might not chink. One of them said to me, are not you ashamed to look in it in the street? I said, but I will look, that you shall not cheat me afterwards out of my share, and say you have had nothing. Then Joe and I took the ladder, and went over Duke's-place, and the prisoner carried the bag. After that, we changed, and I carried the bag. Solomon said he had borrowed the ladder of a neighbour, and if it was not carried safe, it would blow us. The watchman coming round in Duke's-place, calling one o'clock, we dropt the ladder, and went all three together to shoemaker-row; we went through Aldgate, and carried the bag into Joe's lodgings, facing alderman Gascoyne's brewhouse; there he bid us stay, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175501160028"/> said he would come out in less than two minutes. He came out, and said, here is a shilling for you to drink. Solomon bid me go to my mistress's house, and he would call on me in less than half an hour. They both came there, to me; then we contrived to go and put the ladder in its place. We went there, and there stood two watchmen by it, so we let it lie. Solomon went home and lay with me. In the morning about six we got up; he said he would go to Joe. I got up to go to work, and met with Solomon (he is a painter); he ordered me to come to him about six, and said they would satisfy me. I went at the time to the place appointed, that is Marcelous's coffee-house. There they came to me, and took me to the Wool-pack; Joe gave me a thirty-six-shilling piece. I said, I thought I was to have four guineas. Said he, can't you have patience? The goods are not all sold yet; when they are, we'll satisfy you. I parted from them, and went after them the next Wednesday, and found they were gone; then on the Thursday I went to the constable, hearing there was suspicion of me, and surrendered myself.</p>

I missed also three table-cloths, three napkins; the drawer in which these things were put was broke open; they were my master's property.

            . I am a watchman; on the 10th of December as I was calling the hour one I heard some people talking behind me, I staid till they came up to me, there were three men, and the last of the three had a bag on his back, with something in it; I held up my lanthorn and looked at them; I heard the first call upon God to d - n the other, saying, they had kept him too long; the other watchman that called the hour with me called halloo, I said, what is the matter? I went to him, there lay a ladder under a gateway, at the bottom of Cree-church-lane, we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175501160029"/> took it to the watch-house and went out again in quest of the people that had laid it there; finding nobody, we went into Shoemaker-row, as we were there, there came three men from Aldgate way, we followed them across Broad-court to a barber's house in Duke's-place, they knocked at the door, one went in and bid the other two a good night; we followed them, but it being dark they got from us.</p>
               <p>Lion Toby. I am a constable; on the Tuesday morning that this robbery was committed, I was sent for to Mr. Decosta's, he said, he had been robbed, and desired me to see if I could find the persons that did it; the first thing I discovered was where the ladder was hid for that purpose; knowing the person that had that, I laid hold on him, which was the evidence, and told him he was concerned in the affair; his master whom he worked for, said, come, come, we must do our business, and he took him away; in about an hour after he came again, and said, here, I shall have a scandal upon me, they say I am concerned, then I secured him and sent for my watchman, and when the evidence saw him he was all on a tremble, and fainted away, after that he was examined before Mr. alderman Porter, then he denied he knew any thing of the affair; the alderman said to Mr. Decosta, the best thing will be to get his majesty's pardon for the person that will discover it, which the alderman was as good as his word to get for him, accordingly it was printed in the Gazette, after which the evidence made a discovery, I took him before Mr. alderman Porter, there he impeached the prisoner and Joe the old-cloaths-man, as being concerned with him in it; sometime after that, there came a fellow from the country, and told me the prisoner was there, and if I would take him I might, I went as directed, and took him at Whetstone, he was shocked when I told him of it, and he opened the whole affair to me and others; when we were on the road he confessed he had borrowed the ladder of a person in his master's name, and that they three (he, Joe the old-cloaths-man and the evidence conveyed the ladder to the wall, and that he and Joe got upon it, and the evidence helped them over with the ladder, and they went down on the other side, and the evidence stood watching, and that some time after they came over again with a bag full of silver, and that Joe the old-cloaths-man did not use him well, because he gave him but three guineas, and bid him go and travel in the country with that, and he'd see how he could reward him, and that he bought himself some hard-ware to sell in the country; when I took him he had some hard-ware upon him, but I found no plate; we carried him on the Friday following before Mr. alderman Alexander, there he made his confession, and owned it all, and I think it was on the Thursday after that he owned the same before Mr. alderman Porter.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to be so open in his confession on the road?</p>
               <p>L. Toby. He told me he hoped he should be admitted an evidence. I said I can't promise you such a thing, for there is one taken already.</p>

            . I deal in earthen-ware; I was at Dover fair, I had there almost made an end of selling my goods on the 23d of November. I heard of a mare to be sold, I wanted one to ride home into Staffordshire, to a place called Hadley-green, I went and looked at her, and bought her on the 25th at night, at the King's head at Dover of the prisoner at the bar for four pounds, it is the mare Mr. Burchell has swore to be his nephew's. I took her to Deal market, and from thence back again to Dover, from thence to Sandwich fair, then to Rochester fair, then I had sold all my goods, and came to London, and staid here about two days, and riding through Kentish-town by Mr. Burchell's door, on her, going to Staffordshire, he owned the mare, and took me and her to justice Fielding's, this was a fortnight ago last Tuesday; I knew I had good evidence of my buying her, and I thought I could find the man. Mr. Burchell, his neighbour, and I set out, the mare fell ill at Canterbury, but Mr. Harrison and I went on to Dover, there we heard the prisoner was gone over to France; we staid two or three days to wait for his return, which he did, and was taken by a friend of mine, named Tulip, who keeps the Blue-anchor there, whom I had told it to at Canterbury, and who also knew of my buying the mare of him; he was brought to London, and before justice Fielding he owned he bought the mare in Smithfield, and that he sold her to me for 4 l.</p>

I went with him and Mr. Burchell to see for the prisoner; Mr. Burchell's mare fell sick at Canterbury, Bullock and I went on to Dover after he had told Mr. Tulip the mare he bought of the prisoner was stole; Tulip knew the prisoner, and also the buying the mare of him, and left him an indemnification if he should see and apprehend the prisoner; we could not meet with him at Dover, we came back, and Mr. Tulip and the constable brought the prisoner to justice Fielding's the Sunday following.</p>

            . On Tuesday the 10th of December, about eleven in the morning, I being overseer in our parish of Epping, the prisoner's horse was shoeing at a blacksmith's shop; he was suspected to be a highwayman. A person came and told me; I went and viewed him. He was in very mean apparel, and had a watch, which was thought to be gold. I got the constable and apprehended him; and in searching him, I found a pistol in his pocket, (produced in court) it was not loaded. This watch I found also (produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.) I found in his pocket these pair of silver shoe-buckles, (producing them.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I lost exactly such a pair the evening before; I believe them to be mine; but as there may be others of the same pattern, I will not swear to them.</p>
               <p>B. Hobson. The prisoner's horse was a black gelding, about fifteen hands high, with two white feet behind. There was about seventeen shillings in silver, and some halfpence found upon him. I asked him if he had ever a friend that could come to his character? he said he had lived to bury all his relations, and had not a friend in the world.</p>

I am hostler at the Queen's-head, Gray's-inn-lane, a livery stable; the prisoner had an acquaintance just by me; they came together to the tap-house on the 9th of this month, the prisoner asked me if I would buy a horse? I said, I would, if I liked him; if not, I would go along with her, and give her my opinion. I went with them both to the White-horse inn in the New-market. As soon as I saw him, I said he will not do for me. I said, may-be he may be worth four pounds, and her best way was to take him to the market on the morrow. She asked me if I would give her three pounds ten shillings for him ? I said I would not buy him. She asked me if I could recommend her to a friend? And this Mr. Jones having bought horses of me, I recommended her to him, who I suppose bought the horse. I was not there.</p>

               <p>J. Armstrong. That fellow will give an account of a dozen robberies, his wife * was hanged amongst the last people here, he has been a thief these seven years.</p>

               <p>J. Courtney. About ten minutes after came the prosecutor Mr. Hall, Welch and I stopped him and brought him to the same place, we stopt the other at coming in at the gate, Armstrong laid hold of his bridle to bring him in, the prosecutor was a little obstropulous, and Welch struck him and laid hold of his bridle, and Armstrong went on the right-side, and I on the left; I took out of his left-pocket nothing but a penknife, Armstrong took out what money there was in his right-pocket, all the money I saw was one shilling and a penny; then I took hold of the bridle and led him to the gate again; I told him to make no words, and bid him a good night; he said, gentlemen, I wish you a good night, and thank you for all favours; then we went to the Thistle-and-crown near Charing-cross, there we had a nogin of rum, a pennyworth of gin and a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Do you remember any such words passing when you was robbed?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. By them words he mentions he must be there, for I repeated those words that he says; the least man struck me, and the tallest took my money away, I suppose that to be Armstrong.</p>
               <p>Note, Armstrong was the tallest man by about two inches, but at the time of these words speaking, he lowered his body down, and the other made the best of his height, so that they seemed much of a size, but in ten minutes time the court perceived the difference, as at first.</p>
               <p>On his cross examination he said, that after the robbery they stopped at a house in Holborn, and had two pots of beer, that he never saw the man at the Thistle-and-crown in his life before, that Armstrong bro ught them there, that he himself was taken up upon another robbery, that Armstrong and he were first acquainted at Bristol.</p>

I lent him money since, and to make me amends he gets acquainted with thief-catchers to take away my life. After I was taken into custody he came to me, I asked him how he came to do this? he said, he did it to save his own life, but he would deny it all in court.</p>

               <p>Welch's defence.</p>
               <p>I have no more to say than what I am going to tell you; I met the evidence at the Shepherd and dog below Tower-hill, with three or four men along with him; he had on a new jacket and a new pair of Trousers, singing very merrily. He asked me if I would drink? I said, I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175501160036"/> care if I did. He said, he was just come home from the West-Indies, and that he had got thirty pounds to receive in Broad-street, and he wanted somebody to get his R off. I gave him directions to call at my lodgings the next day, and I never saw him since, till I saw him before justice Fielding. I don't know whether he is a bad or a good man.</p>
               <p>Q. to Courtney. Did you meet Welch as he says.</p>
               <p>J. Courtney. The gentleman that keeps the Shepherd-and-dog knew Mr. Welch and I resorted together at his house more than five or six weeks ago several times. We never went in at his lodgings till dark night, because he did not care to be seen himself.</p>
               <p>For Armstrong.</p>
               <p>William Hailey. Armstrong had lent me four pounds and six pence, he took me up, and sent me to Whitechapel prison. I remained there five days. He wanted the money, and I could not afford it him then; in the mean time, he took compassion on me, and came to the prison and relieved me upon my note, which the gaol-keeper is a witness to. When my lodger came home, I got a little money; I sent him word to come, and I would pay him. He came on the 9th, and remained with me to the 12th of December. I paid him the money upon the nail, and he returned the note; I remember it on account of the date of the note.</p>

               <p>Q. Where is the note?</p>
               <p>W. Hailey. That I have burnt.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with him every hour of that time?</p>
               <p>W. Hailey. I can't say I was; he lay every night in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not go out in the time?</p>
               <p>W. Hailey. Not above a quarter of a mile in the time, to the best of my knowledge. He told me also he had a pain in his knee, and I had salves from the hospital, which he had applied to it, and thought they did him good.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>W. Hailey. I live in Southwark.</p>

I told him that the Warden had locked Mr. Hunt up, and he would not let it be a public-house any longer. He asked me if I had any leather chairs to sell? He went up into the dining room, and looked at some, after that we went both down stairs. He called for half a pint of wine; then he said, Mrs. Robertson, I have got an exceeding good public-house, I will let you have, with a hundred pounds stock in it; but it is out of the freedom of the city. Then he said, I see you are so full of business, there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175501160037"/> is no opportunity to talk to you; and asked me if I would go with him any where else? And mentioned some place up in Holborn, a great way off. I answered I would not go there for ever so much. I said, if any other place would do, I would go. Then he mentioned the Leg in Fleet-street; but did not say whether it was a tavern, or what; and I never knew there was such a house as the Leg tavern there before. I said I would meet him there. I went, and at the top of the market I asked a woman where the Leg tavern was? She said it was a little higher up in Fleet-street. After that, I asked at the Tin-shop. When I came there, the prisoner was not come; I took a chair and sat down in the passage, where I staid some time, and finding he did not come. I threw down six-pence for a glass of wine and came away; I met Mr. Jones in Fleet-street, fronting the Saloop-shop, he clapped his hand on my shoulder, and said, Mrs Robertson, where are you going? I said, my business was so urgent I could not stay; I went back with him, when we came there we went to the upper end of the yard, in a private room, a ground-floor, I don't know whether there are two or three windows, they opened fronting the tavern-door.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is the yard?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. The room is about thirty yards from the bar; the prisoner called for a pint of wine directly, a Dutch woman followed us up the yard, we sat down with it, she did not stay at all, then I said, let me know about this house; he said, Mrs. Robertson, there is a hundred pound stock, and you shall have it for one night's lodging with me; I made answer, I would not do such a thing for the world, I would not live or cohabit with any man living, neither would I wrong Mr. Hunt's bed.</p>
               <p>C. Explain what you mean by that.</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. Mr. Hunt is in the Fleet, and he is the person that I am under contract of marriage with.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner do to you?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. He made no more ado but took and pulled me forward and unbuttoned his breeches, and forced my hand to his private parts, and pulled my petticoats up before in order to lay with me, I cried out as loud as I could, nobody came to my assistance, nor did I see man, woman, or child all the time I was in the place; I struggled very much, and got myself disengaged, then he got my cloaths up behind, in order to lay with me backwards; after that I called out again, and struggled, so that living a new pair of shoes on the heels came off with struggling, he always kept hold of my petticoats, so that I could not get away from him, then he took and threw me cross his lap, with my head upon the ground, and had hold of both my hands, he took my petticoats up all round me, I was as much exposed as ever any monster was, then I found him enter my body, as my husband, as I lay with my head on the floor, and one leg down on the ground betwixt his knees, he kept my hands fast in one of his, that I could not stir them, and he held me fast by my middle, and with the other hand was forcing his private parts to me. I am a widow, I was married to one man nine years all but three days, and have had four children.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive he did enter your body?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. I am very positive he did. I got one of my legs down, that which was cross his knee, and forced myself down on the ground, and said, for God Almighty's sake don't, you'll ruin my soul and body, when I got up from the ground, he got me on his lap again, and my right-hand he forced to his private parts, but I clinched my fingers fast, so he could not make me, then he said, d - n it, I can do nothing, I can do nothing, and d - d his eyes and limbs and swore he would st - h me; he endeavoured it again, but did not succeed; I told him I did not think he would have brought me to a house to use me ill; he said, what did I mean by using me ill? I went to lay hold on the decanter and glass to break the window, but he pushed them out of my reach; I told him it did not signify, go I would, or I would raise Fleet-street about his ears, he said, I should not go at all, many times over, and said, he would lay with me. I begged and prayed as much as possible, and told him my business lay at six's and seven's; I got away at last by swearing an oath that I would return back again to sup with him, and he was to get a fowl for supper; when I got out of the house I never returned, I saw a woman in the room close to where we were; when I got out I went as fast as I could go, fearing they should bring me back again, and went home directly, and made complaint of it in about two hours afterwards, and cried sadly, for my cloaths were torn from off my back; I complained also to Mr. Hunt and Mrs. Slayter in the Fleet; the prisoner came again that evening about six or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175501160038"/> seven o'clock to buy some pots, Mrs. Slayter sold him them, one Gwin, that came with the prisoner, wrote a receipt, and brought it up for me to sign it, I refused signing it; after they were gone Mr. Hunt beat me unmerfully, and said there was some meaning in my refusing to sign it, then I told him the reason why I would not sign it, Mr. Jones had used me ill at a tavern, so he called two or three more people up, and I told the story there, and the Monday after I went before Mr. alderman Janssen and made my complaint to him.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at the bar of that house in Fleetstreet.</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. No, I was not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you be there in the whole?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. About an hour and half.</p>
               <p>Council. I can't conceive how there could be any possibility of his penetrating your body.</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. He did enter my body a little.</p>
               <p>Q. To what degree; describe which way it could be?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. He did indeed a little way.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might he get within you?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. I tell you but a very little way.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you apprehensive you could be with child by him?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. I am not that I could, because it is a thing impossible, for where a woman has no inclination, it is impossible there can be a child</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you that?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. Because I have been a married woman a great many years.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing you had consented, have you any reason to think you might have been with child by the consequence of it; you say he entered your body as your husband did?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. I don't say I am with child, I don't think I have any reason to think I am with child. My husband never used me in such a manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he did not lay with you in so complete a manner as your husband did?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. No, he did not, because of my struggling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive - ?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. I know what you mean; no, I did not.</p>
               <p>Council. Look upon that piece of paper.</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. This is my hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is the body of the note wrote by?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. It was by Mr. Gwyn.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this letter; do you know this name at the bottom?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. This is Mr. Hunt's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Here is another letter; whose hand-writing is this?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. This also is Mr. Hunt's handwriting.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you read the date of that receipt when you signed it?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. I did not look at it; I was forced to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Hunt a married man?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. Upon my oath I don't know the he is; he always denies it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known him?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. Ever since the 8th of October was twelve-month.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not set you up in that house in the Fleet?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. He did not; the goods and effects were great part of them his, and some were mine; for he had a great deal of money of me.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his business ?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. He had a place in the commission of bankruptcy I think, and he dealt in brandy and wine, he bought the liquor in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know him a bailiff, or sheriff's officer?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to be locked up in the Fleet?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. I don't know that; I think it was a linen draper did it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was the prisoner discoursing with you before he became so violent?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. Not a great while; not above a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been seated before he talked about the house?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. I had drank one glass of wine before, and so had he; we had but one pint of wine in all.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you be in the room with him?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. To the best of my knowledge about two hours, or two hours and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did no body appear in this time?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. Never a soul.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of having any command of the yard?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. As I sat, I could see the bar and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175501160039"/> the kitchen sideways; but I did not see any of the family moving in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the bar-bell ring in the time?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say, when you cried out?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. I said, for God's sake some body come and help me! as loud as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he attempt to stop your mouth?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. No, he did not, he said, d - n you, why do you make such a hire noise?</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you in this struggling position?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. I don't know whether it was not ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door fascened ?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. I believe it was only shut.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he entered your body a very little way; what do you call a very little way?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. He did just enter my body.</p>
               <p>Council. Will you swear he was the length of his thumb-nail in you?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson, Yes, sir, more than that; but it was but a very little way. My senses were gone for a good while, it might be for five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he attempt to throw himself on the floor, in order to lie with you?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. No, sir, my petticoats were towzed all round me, and my legs tangled in them.</p>

            . I was sent to sell Mrs. Robertson's goods on the 5th of October; I remember Mr. Jones coming between three and four in the afternoon, and bought some pots. He went out, and returned about dusk. He came again on the 7th, and said he had been quarelling with his wife concerning a letter sent her about a rape on Mrs. Robertson; and said he could have laid with her over and over; but she was a little dirty b - ch, and he would have nothing to say to her. I said, if you know yourself clear, go to Mr. Hunt in the Fleet, and clear yourself.  He went, and I was there. Mr. Hunt asked him several questions; he said, may-be she might sit on my knee, and my breeches might be open; and said to me, you may put your hand in, if you will, and pulled them open.</p>
               <p>On her cross examination, she said she did not take any notice of Robertson's cloaths that evening being torn.</p>

            . On the 5th of October last, Mrs. Robertson was selling some houshold furniture for me; I was then a close prisoner in the Fleet. She came to me on the close of the evening, and fell a crying but said nothing then. About candle lighting came Mrs. Gwyn and the prisoner; he had bought some quart pots, and desired a receipt. I desired Mrs. Robertson to write one; she would not; but with a great deal to do she did sign one. After Jones was gone, she cried, and said he had used her very ill at the Leg in Fleet-street. I said, I had before cautioned her to take care how she went into that house. She said she had forgot it. To know the truth of this, I was willing to get the parties together. So I sent a letter on the 6th of October to Jones's wife, and made the scene look black against him. I sent her word Mrs. Robertson was then in keeping by the prisoner, and if she would come to me, I would acquaint her with the whole, and where she was. The messenger returned, and told me she delivered it to Jones's wife's own hands. Jones's wife came to me, and I desired the prosecutrix to repeat to her the whole transaction; which she did. On the Monday after that came Jones; he said he did go to the Leg tavern with Mrs. Robertson, and they there had but one pint of wine, and she might sit on his knee, or kiss his lips; but as to any thing else, he never did attempt. I desired her to tell her story before him; there she charged him with abusing her, and lying with her; but he denied it.</p>
               <p>On his cross examination, he said he was a married man, that his wife was then near him in court, that he had two children by her, and that he, notwithstanding that, had made a contract with the prosecutrix to marry her; and he had been acquainted with her eighteen months or two years; that he went from his wife the 16th of January, and made the contract with Robertson on the 8th of October following; that he wrote two letters to Jones's wife; that he struck the prosecutrix some pretty hard blows, because she did not tell him of Jones's lying with her when Jones was there, that they might have it face to face, and for being concerned with him, and not because she would not sign the receipt. That the prosecutrix had once lived in Red-lion-court, Fleet-street, which is ten or a dozen doors from the Leg-tavern.</p>

               <p>The prosecutrix wanted to talk about this house alone, and desired me to go with her to the King's-arms or Leg tavern, which I pleased. I went there with her; I called for a pint of wine; the two windows were open that join to the kitchen. All that she has said of this ill usage, is a contrivance of Hunt's and her's, to make a property of me. Please to let the two letters he sent to my wife be read.</p>
