            . Q. What are you. - A. I am an officer of Worship-street. I apprehended the prisoner at Hammersmith on the 24th of July, when he came in he asked for the letter that was left there; Haley was in the room behind the door; I called to Haley and asked him if that was the man, he said yes; I pushed him in the door, I told him I apprehended him on charge of robbing Mr. Hall; he then said what he had done his wife was the cause of it. At the public house, next to the office in Worship-street, he acknowledged in the presence of the prosecutor, having the sack and the boilers on his shoulders; he said he found them, and the gardener told him, they did not belong to him he then put them down and went away.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Haley) Are they the things that you brought to your master. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The boilers are mine; they are worth about a guinea and a half; I cannot speak to the glasses.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that the same shilling that the woman gave you. - A. I have not a doubt of it; I laid it by itself on the ledge of the window, and it laid there till the woman returned again; that might be an hour and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Heath there then. - A.

Yes, a shilling; I had a doubt of its being a good one; I tried it on the steel and cut it, and found it to be a bad one, in her presence; I said to Mrs. Heath, in the presence of the prisoner, is not this the woman that gave you the bad shilling just now; then she said yes, here it is; I took it and tried it upon the steel, I found that to be bad too; I sent for Franklin directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Before Franklin came did any conversation take place between you and the prisoner, or your wife. - A. My wife said she thought she had got the veal that she purchased; she denied it, and afterwards she said she believed it was the shop, and that was the veal in the basket that she had purchased in the shop. When Franklin came, I told him we had got what I believed they called a smasher. When he searched her he told her to open her mouth, she would not; he took hold of her chin and she swallowed something; then he searched<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160005"/>her pockets and found some halfpence; he searched her basket, there he found sugar, potatoes, spinage, and the bit of veal that she bought of Mrs. Heath; they were all in 'the basket in small quantities; I delivered both the shillings to Franklin, and he took her away.</p>

When I came there Mr. Heath said he had got a woman he believed they called a smasher: he gave me the two shillings that he said he and his wife had taken; I produce the two shillings; I have kept them separate ever since. I opened the basket, I found some spinage, I put my hand to the bottom of the basket and found the veal; Mrs. Heath said that is the veal she bought of me. I found in her pocket ten pennyworth of halfpence, all good. Mr. Heath said, never mind, send her about her business; I said I did not think that is right, I shall take her to Worship-street, and told him he must be after me directly. I desired her to open her mouth, I was apprehensive that she might have something in her mouth; she said why; she swallowed very hard; I heard something nick against her teeth. Going over the fields she said why should you wish to hurt me, the man does not wish to hurt me, what would be the use of you sending me to goal for a twelvemonth; I shall see you another day and make you amends.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had not any more in my mouth than any of you gentlemen have.</p>

            . Knapp. You are the monier of his majesty's mint. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. You have got the two shillings that have been produced in court, tell us whether they are good or counterfeited. - A. They are both counterfeits.</p>
               <p>Court. Are they of the same sort. - A. They appear different.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He had more bad shillings that he wanted to bring against me; the people of the shop said it was not right. I knew no more of them than a child unborn. I beg for mercy of the court; I have been sixteen weeks in goal and fed upon bread and water.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you see any of these things before you missed them. - A. I had seen them on the Sunday when I shifted myself, they were all safe then. On Wednesday morning, when I came out of bed, I looked down by my bed, I saw my handkerchief on the ground; it should have been in my box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before. - A. Yes, he lodged in the house; I told the people of the house that my box was broken open; they said the soldier had not slept in the house that night. We went into the prisoner's room, we saw a bit of an old handkerchief and a bit of tape that I tied my pocket book with; I kept the bit of handkerchief at the bottom of my box, I used to wipe my razor with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your things again - A. Yes; I went along with one of the soldiers to some jew at Knightsbridge, and there were the shirts and waistcoats.</p>
               <p>JAMES GILLMORE. On the 24th of July I was sent for, and the landlord or landlady gave me this turn-screw, which I found in the prisoner's room; I tried it to the box to see if this was the instrument made use<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160006"/>of; I found it exactly corresponded with the marks on the box; the box was lined with blue paper. On the end of this turn screw was this piece of blue paper, as if it came off the box; I asked the prisoner what he had done with the prosecutor's watch; he said he had slept with a girl the very night he had taken it, and the girl had taken it from him. This is the bit of handkerchief and red tape; I have three pounds eighteen shillings that was delivered to me as part of the change of the five pound note; it was delivered to me.</p>

About an hour after, as I was going down Tothil-street, I met him again, he shewed me a silver watch, a five pound note, and a guinea; he told me he had that in part of payment of the hundred pounds. We went to a public house, he called for a shillingsworth of gin and rasberry, he said we should drink together before we parted; he changed a guinea, I got the five pound note changed at

On the day of this indictment I had occasion to go to Mrs. Macarty's, she keeps <placeName id="t18070916-8-crimeloc42">the Bell public house, Ratcliffe-street</placeName>

                        targets="t18070916-8-off39 t18070916-8-crimeloc42"/>; I went there about seven o'clock, I remained there till seven o'clock the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went into the house had you any property in your possession. - A. I had fifty-two guineas in gold in my left hand side coat pocket, and I had sixty pounds in bank notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a twenty pound, a ten pound, two two pounds, and a one pound bank note. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose had you that money in your pocket. - A. I was to pay my brewer the next day; the notes were in my left hand breeches pocket, and there was a letter from Boyle, a seaman, that lodged with the prisoner. As soon as I came into the house, Bell came into the house directly, and said the room would be vacant just now, and he would settle between him and me; there were some money accounts between him and me. We went into the private room and called for a pot of ale. Me and Boyle and another man were together then.</p>
               <p>Court. Not the prisoner. - A. No, he came in shortly after.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you continue in that room. - A. The best part of the night; I was going to come away at twelve o'clock at night; Boyle stopped me at the parlour door and said he would toss me for a bottle of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160007"/>wine; we tossed, there was a dispute in tossing, and Boyle called for two bottles of wine. When we had finished one bottle the prisoner came in the kitchen, and there were other persons there at the time; the prisoner remained a quarter of an hour, and had a glass or two with us.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they remain with you. - A. The prisoner called Boyle out between one and two o'clock in the morning (as I understood) to speak to him about some business; when they went away I had no one to keep me in conversation, I laid my hand to my head and went to sleep; I was alone during the time I slept.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. While the prisoner was there, and the other men remained with you, did you take your money out. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he an opportunity of seeing where you put it. - A. Yes. I awoke between six and seven in the morning, I put my hand in my pocket, and found I had lost twenty four guineas and thirty-five pounds in notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was then in the place at the time you awoke. - A. Nobody but myself, only the maid servant sweeping the room.</p>
               <p>Q. On the evening of the next day had the prisoner been drinking at your house. - A. He and Boyle had two pots of porter; the prisoner gave me a one pound note, I gave him change, and put the note in my pocket; as soon as the prisoner went out, Boyle said, be particular of that note, I know the prisoner had no money (the prisoner did not hear him say it.) I looked at the note I said I cannot swear to the number, I should soon recollect the indorsement; it was endorsed RAB; then it came to my recollection that it was one of the notes I had lost the night before. On the second day after I received the one pound note from the prisoner, I went to the prisoner's apartment; the landlady and Burke shewed me his box, I asked him to let me search his box, he replied that he had got none of my money; I told him if he would not let me search, I would send for an officer; in consequence of that he let me search it, and underneath the new clothes there was taken out a purse; I told him if there was not a Queen Ann's guinea, 1713, with a dent on the edge of it, I would lay no claim to the money. The landlady examined the purse and found the guinea in it, in the presence of the prisoner in the purse there was twenty three pounds, chiefly in guineas, and all in gold. I found no notes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you discovered these new clothes and money did you ask the prisoner how he came in possession of them - A. I did; he gave no answer. This is the one pound note, it is marked A R B; that is the note he gave me in payment for his porter. On the day of the second examination, before the examination, he said he would make restitution for the rest of the money. I have got a watch and a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not find them upon the prisoner. - A. I found the handkerchief in his pocket; this pocket book and that card I found in the prisoner's hat, he confessed that he bought the watch with my money; I went to the shop, and here is the gentleman's hand writing that he changed a ten pound note.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, I am a Spaniard by birth; I served in his Majesty's navy thirteen years; I was discharged from the Superb. Since then I served in the Invincible of Deptford. The prosecutor alledges the money to be lost at a public house where I lodged; I was with him on the Tuesday evening, where he gave me change of a one pound note; he did not assert that it was the one that he lost untill three days after, when he could have found me on any day or hour at that house. It is not probable that I robbed him, and called at his house and changed the money that he lost; I had money of my own also, I had seventeen pounds prize money, and nine doubloons I brought home with me, which I saved up during the time I was abroad. Under all these circumstances, I trust you will acquit me; and at the time he charged me with the robbery, the prosecutor said if I would give him all my clothes and watch, he would not prosecute me, or else he would hang me. I am innocent of the charge; here is a letter that will shew where I received the money.</p>

             came into my apartment with Mrs. Day, she came as a slight acquaintance, her excuse was to ask me how I did, it was on a Sunday; Mrs. Day staid a short time, she said her dinner was ready, and went home; the prisoner staid, I asked the prisoner if she would stop and have a bit of victuals; she did, and we had a pot or two of porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she a stranger. - A. I am a watchman: I had seen her once or twice before. I had been up two nights and two days, I was very drowsy, I had a little liquor, not much; I laid myself down and fell asleep, leaving the prisoner in the room and nobody else; I slept till the dusk of the evening before I awoke, and then I found the prisoner was gone. I went to the place where I hung my key, I opened my box, I missed my purse and the money altogether; the box was locked, and the key hung in its usual place.</p>

               <p>Q. What was in the purse. - A. One guinea, two half guineas, three seven shilling pieces, and nine shillings in silver. From information of Mrs. Day she and I went to a house in Little Saffron-street; the prisoner was up stairs, Mrs. Day fetched her down to me; I charged her with robbing me, she denied it; I got a constable, he took her to the watchhouse; she denied it there some time, till the constable said he must strip her to see-whether she had any money about her; on that she put her hand into her pocket, and counted out one guinea, two half guineas, three seven shilling pieces, and four shillings in silver, she said that was all she got from me; the purse was not found.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no mark on the money, I suppose. - A. They were all new money except one seven shilling piece, and that was an old bent one.</p>

Between eight and nine o'clock he and Mrs. Day came; Mrs. Day came up to me and brought me down stairs, he was there, he said he had lost his money, and that I had robbed him; I said I had not robbed him, before they searched me at the watchhouse: I put my hand into my pocket and took out the money; I said that was all the money I had got.</p>

               <p>Q. The prisoner at the bar was in your employ. - A. He was; I employed him principally to melt silver, and to work at his leisure hours at his trade; he was a <rs id="t18070916-12-deflabel61" type="occupation">watch case maker</rs>

               <p>Q. How many years had he lived with you. - A. He served his time with my father, and has been with me about twelve years. On the 29th of July last, from a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160009"/>knowledge that I had been robbed a few days before, I took the numbers of the notes that I had in my pocket book; that was in a tin box underneath the desk in the accounting house.</p>
               <p>Court. You took the dates of the bank notes, number, and value. - A. I did: I have the book here. Having taken down the dates and number of the notes, I put them in the pocket book, and the pocket book I put in the tin box which was underneath the desk. On the 29th of July I was absent after two o'clock in the afternoon; I returned about eight in the evening.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. In consequence of some information that you received did you examine your pocket book. - A. I went up immediately on my return and examined it; I found all the notes there, wanting one. I missed a one pound note The next morning I went into the neighbourhood where the prisoner lived, and enquired at the public house nearest his dwelling, Mrs. Milley keeps it; she produced to me the second note, which corresponded to the date, number, and amount of that note I lost; the officer has the note (note produced), it is dated the 12th of June, 35,100.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. What year. - A. I did not take the date of the year.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you not to take the date of the year. - A. I have not taken the date; I only swear to the 12th of June, 35,100; I have no doubt of its being my note. The prisoner's lodgings were searched, I was present at the time; we found sixteen guineas, and a small piece of coin, which I have every reason to believe is mine; it is a particular coin, I do not pretend to swear to it. The prisoner was entrusted to melt two quantities of that coin.</p>

            . Q. You are an officer of the city of London. - A. Yes. On the 7th of July, I apprehended the prisoner, between eight and nine o'clock at night, in Cutler's-street, Houndsditch; he was sitting on a carpet; I asked him what he had there, he said it was nothing to me, it was his own property; I told him he must go along with me to the Counter; he said he would go along with me any where, and he would not tell where he had it from; I had two officers with me; I took him in charge, and gave the carpet to one of the officers. I had hold of him; we walked five hundred yards from the place where we first stopped him, he made a sudden spring and got away from me, I held his jacket, the jacket tore all the way up; I then catched hold of him by the collar and the jacket gave way again; he ran away from me into Cammomile-street into a mews, where there was no thoroughfare; there I got hold of him I never lost sight of him; I asked him why he run away from his property: when I went up to him he hit me down when; I got up he hit me down again. I had got a stick, I was obliged to make the best of it I could till I secured him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that carpet you found upon him that night the same carpet you shewed to Mr. Broom the next day. - A. It was; I saw him coming along with the carpet before he sat upon it I was watching for him two hours before. I knew at eleven o'clock that he was to bring it there.</p>

               <p>THOMAS BRERETON. I live with Mr. Downes, Fetter-lane. On the 25th of July, between nine and ten o'clock, as I was passing through Fleet-street, there was a post chaise past me; I saw the prisoner at the bar and another person, now and then alternately look into the chaise; they followed it till it came to <placeName id="t18070916-16-crimeloc81">St. Clement's church in the Strand</placeName>

               <p>Q. There was no body in the chaise, perhaps. - A. I suppose not; when he had taken the coat he returned a few yards, called some name; upon which the prisoner at the bar come and received the coat. They came through Temple Bar into Fleet-street, where a patrol stood; they went of the opposite side of the way when they saw me, I informed the patrol; we went after the two men and we took the prisoner with the coat in Chancery-lane under his arm; the man that stole the coat ran away. We asked the prisoner where he got the coat, he said he found it in Fleet-street. The patrol took him to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. What part of Chancery-lane was it you overtook the prisoner. - A. Towards Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark at this time. - A. It was duskish.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not see whether there was any body in the chaise or not. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you could not tell whether any body might not hand it out; the coat belonged to the driver. - A. Yes, it appeared to be an empty chaise, but I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you call out to the driver. - A. Because the men went the contrary way; if I had done so they would have got off.</p>
               <p>ANTHONY M'DONALD. On the 25th of July last I ran up Chancery-lane after the two men, they turned up a dark court; as soon as they saw me come up the court they both came out into Chancery-lane; I followed him that had the coat; when I caught him, I asked where he had got that coat, he said in Fleet-street, it was laying in the dirt, he kicked his foot against it; I produce the coat.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

About ten minutes before that a man came to my house, he had a glass of porter, he gave me a shilling, I refused that, he gave me another, and I gave him ten pence halfpenny; I found that to be be a bad shilling.

Mr Charlton came in, then I left him for the purpose of getting the other man; I returned in about ten minutes unsuccessful; When I came back we searched him. I found three other shillings that were like the same that he tendered me, and there was a good sixpence and ten pence halfpenny; I said to Mr. Charlton you had better step with him to the magistrate.

               <p>Q. While you were gone did not he put that shilling with the other three. - A. No. The magistrate asked me if I knew it; I had mixed them; I told the magistrate that I knew it by the marks of my teeth.</p>

               <p>Q. During Mrs. Ore's absence at Brighton, did you visit the prisoner. - A. On Monday the 15th of June I was there a very short time; she asked me to take wine. I refused; she immediately took a key from her right hand pocket, she told me to follow her; I did, to the wine cellar door, she unlocked the door, I was very much surprized, I asked her if Mrs. Ore left the key of the wine cellar door with her; she said no it was the key of the garden, she said she had access to it in that manner whenever she pleased; the took out a bottle of wine, she told me to look in at the stock; I did, it was large; she said there was wine and spirits of every sort. I refused to drink the wine with her that day; I came away, and informed my mistress the next day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. You had been an intimate acquaintance of the prisoner. - A. No further than going backwards and forwards for my mistress.</p>
               <p>Q. You seem very comely and well made - you are not a friar - it is very singular she made this free confession to you - she knew you were a servant. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a very sober young woman, you are not fond of drinking at all, it is a character you deserve - did not you drink tea with her. - A. No, I only called in to know how she was; she met me and took me to the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Although you are a sober woman, she would take you to the wine cellar and show you how she opened it - you never tasted it. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you undertake to say it was wine. - A Because I saw it in the glass. She did not make use of it then; I saw her put it in the copper hole.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Mrs. Ore, did you receive the information from this servant. - A. I did.</p>

I let her go on till she came into Shoreditch; I then went up to her and said you have got something that is not your own. At that instant Mr. Alexander came up and took it out of her lap.</p>

My three friends stopped, thinking there was danger, they would not go any further; I being tired I said I wished to go home. I left my friends upon Starch-green and went towards home; as I was going home I heard somebody run behind me; I turned round, I said to the prisoner for God's sake do not meddle with me, a poor old woman like me; he said blast your eyes I will; he knocked me down with his fist, or stick, I cannot tell in the fright I was in which; it struck on my head. I think he wrestled the bundle from me, out of my hand as I laid down; then he ran away immediately, knowing the witnesses were after him.</p>

            . I am a constable of Hammersmith. The prisoner was delivered into my custody by the three witnesses on the 25th of July; it was one o'clock when they brought him in.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was the 26th of July. - A. Yes. This handkerchief and three pound of beef was delivered to me. I kept the handkerchief and Davey had the beef.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (read in court). My lord, and gentlemen of the jury - on Saturday night the 25th of July, between twelve and one o'clock; after leaving the pay table and drinking pretty freely, I drank with two women and two men; the prosecutrix was drinking with us; we passed some jokes together. When we came out I took the prosecutrix by the arm, thinking by the liberties she let me take I might. She left her companions, I gave her a shilling; when she was out of sight of her companions she consented to let me have connexion with her; she was very much intoxicated in liquor, and when she saw her companions coming she cried out. At the time she took my shilling she threw the bundle behind the dunghill; her companions came up and swore I had taken the bundle; they found the bundle behind the dunghill, where the prosecutrix throwed it. I hope you will take my case into your humane consideration, as my prosecutrix intends taking my life if she can by false swearing, for the sake of the reward. I had no intention of taking the bundle from her.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Are you are a married woman. - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at any time watch or use any means for finding out the persons that robbed you. - A. Never before that morning; I found them out on Saturday morning the 4th of July; my wife sat up till three o'clock in the morning, she came to bed then. I concealed myself in the parlour below stairs; about four o'clock the two young men came down stairs it was day light; they began dusting their clothes. One of them put his hand into the window where there was a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160015"/>pane of glass broke; he said there is a double curtain here; that was the parlour where I was. The other came back through the passage to the bottom of the stair case, where there was another broken; he put his hand and said here is another curtain there is two windows to that parlour. I was concealed in that room under that window; there are two windows in that room, one in the yard and one in the passage. I saw them, but neither of them could see me. He then went to the tap-room; I

             the curtain of one side, I saw him through the window, it was the same man; the other man was walking backwards and forwards in the passage at the time; he went through the tap-room to the bar door, he took this file and put it between the bar-door and forced it open.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see at that time where the instrument was. - A. No, he took it from the fire place and forced the door in the wrong way: it was locked when I went to bed; he was in the bar about a minute and a half; I heard the halfpence jingle: the other went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they speak to each other at the time. - A. Not till they went up stairs. As soon as he came out of the bar he fastened the bar door again, he put this file on the mantle piece and went up stairs to his comrade and said all is well. I went for an officer, he came and took them in the room; I pointed out the man that went into the bar; the officer found five halfpence which my wife had marked the night before, and a bottle of rum under the bed head; we took them to Bow-street. When we came back we found another bottle in a hole in the floor by the bed's head; they had drawed it off the cask. I had gauged my cask the night before, I guaged it again in the morning; there was a deficiency of a pint and a half. I had lost rum frequently before, and halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. These two bottles must contain more than you missed out of your cask. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of your rum. - A. I valued it at three shillings a bottle.</p>

On the bed I found a waistcoat; Williams owned it, with five halfpence in it; he said they were his halfpence what he had got in change the over night. I shewed the halfpence to the landlady at the time I took them down to Bow-street. I came back again; I found another bottle under the floor; that was corked.</p>

On the 2nd of September, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I found a piece of printed cotton furniture in the pantry below, stairs facing the kitchen; there was a flag stone put upon it, it was in a corner and I saw it by one of the corners of the furniture sticking out. I left it there.</p>

I was watching in the kitchen facing it; in about three quarters of an hour afterwards, I heard a noise in the pantry; I saw the prisoner at the bar come and take the cotton into a long passage adjoining the pantry; I went into the shop and informed

I did; I went to the further end of the passage to the privy; on opening the door, the prisoner endeavoured to rush out; I stopped him and asked him what he had got in his apron; he answered nothing.

               <p>Q. Did you give your wife any bank notes or money on the 19th of August. - A. Yes; I delivered to her all the bank notes I was in possession of; there were four ten pound notes, two five pound notes (all of them bank of England notes), and a country note of five pounds; and there were some small notes, but I could not ascertain what quantity there was. The prisoner was the only person present when I delivered them to her; I gave them to her in the small bar; he saw me give them to her.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. On this Wednesday when you gave your wife the notes, I believe you went out upon some foot race. - A. That is quite irrelevant to the question.</p>

I went to the corner of the bar to give the man change for a shilling that had the gin; when he had got the change he went away immediately. While I was giving change I heard a rustling; I said to Weston, what are you about; the table linen and books fell down, they were placed on the top of the drawers; Mr. Weston went out immediately; on his going out he clapped his hand to his coat. I said why do you come in to knock my things down; I picked up my books, I went to put the silver in the box in the drawer; I found the property gone. It was all done in about four or five minutes.</p>
               <p>Court. How was the drawer, open or shut when you went to put your money in. - A. It was shut, but the key was in it.</p>

            . - Mr. Const. Q. What are you. - A. I am out of business at present, I live opposite Mrs. Lingard; she sent her servant who said she wanted to speak to me, I went over, she informed me that she had been robbed; I went to Kew-bridge to endeavour if I could learn any thing of the robbery, and in consequence of information from Mr. Smith I went down to the water side; I met the prisoner his carriage stood at the bridge with the horses heads towards the water; he was returning from the water. I said Weston how do you do, nodded to me and immediately went into Mr. Dunn's stable yard and set upon a place that is erected upon a dunghill. When he came out of there, Mr. Lingard came down and accused him of robbing him; Weston said he had not, and he was very willing that Mr. Lingard might search him; Mr. Lingard did not search him - Mr. Lingard and I went down to the water-side to see if we could find any of the property; we could not. I advised him to apply to a Bow-street officer; we went up to the turnpike-gate, and afterwards Bacon the officer came in about three quarters of an hour.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you after that at any time go to the water side. - A. I went with the officer to the water side where I saw Weston come from; we went into a market garden this side of the water, there I found the bottom of a paper box. We there discovered two more pieces: I took them to Mrs. Lingard, she said it was part of the box that the property was in. The pieces of box were afterward given to Bacon the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. The coach had stopped at Kew bridge some short time before you got there. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Which way they went, or whether they went into the market-garden, you cannot tell. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was this market garden that you speak of; I understood it to be of the left hand side of Kew-bridge from London. - A. Yes before you get to Kew-bridge you turn round to the left hand.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first went to Kew-bridge you saw the prisoner coming from the water side - was that on the right hand side. - A. No, on the left; the same side as the market garden is.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of that garden did you pick up these pieces. - A. About two yards from the wall in the garden; the wall parts the garden ground from the road.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. There is a path-way by the side of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing occuring about the race from Bath to London. - A. In the coach that I was going there was a man, he said Lingard is one. When the coach got to the Roebuck at Turnham-green it was four o'clock; we stopped there, I was outside passenger, but when a storm of rain came, one got out, and I went in; the inside was full; that was this side of Turnham-green; two the coach stopped at the Roebuck Turnham-green; two of the passengers went out; I knew one of them, his name is Parker, we went in the bar, and Parker wrote a note; the third passenger went in the bar; 
               <persName id="t18070916-25-person277">Weston</persName>
             the coachman went into the bar first, he was standing by the side of the fire place when I went in; and there was a thin elderly man. Mrs. Lingard doing of. - A. She was talking about the race; and serving her customers; she mixed a glass of brandy and water, and gave it to the coachman. I perceived that she never measured it; she put it into the glass, I said to Parker, that the landlady gave more for sixpence, then I could get for a shilling; she was all of a tremble; she drawed a glass of ale for the other passenger, and a glass of gin for me; I was in the bar about eight or ten minutes, and there were four or five coming in and out. The coachmen set on the right side of the fire, and the thin man on the left hand; the thin man was not a passenger. Parker sat in the left hand corner of the bar; the coachman asked the landlady of the house, if she knew the thin elderly man that she was talking to about the wager; she gave him four-pence out of his sixpence he said they will not do, he put them back; the coachman I think, came out first; we all nearly came out together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing falling in the bar. - A. There was not a thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if any person has talked that there was only the coachman in the bar, that is a mistake, because you are certain that there were four in the bar altogether. -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160018"/>A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. What day are you speaking of. - A. The wager was decided, Thursday, the 20th of August.</p>
               <p>Q. Any particular reasoning for recollecting the day of the month. - A. I was going with Mr. Snowden a grocer, he had a little bill.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw the man before. - A. I did not know the man at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You went away from the coach, how came you to hear any thing of the coachman. - A. I heard of him at night; I was at Kew bridge; I went so far home that night; I heard he was accused.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know it was your coachman. - A. They told me it was the coachman that I come down with; the landlady of the Star and Garter told us so; she saw me come out of the coach, the coach was about twenty yards from her door; she was out talking to a young woman.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you hear about the coachman. - A. They accused him of taking the money, I said I stopped there; I think it was impossible for it to be done; they said they had been after him they were suspicious that he had done it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Why did you say it could not be done. - A. Because I think it impossible, when so many people were there; there were four or five people there.</p>
               <p>Q. What size bar is it. - A. A largish bar; it is on the right hand side, as you go into the house; the bar would hold a dozen people, according to what I see of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did Mr. Weston find you out to be a witness. - A. The day before yesterday, by Mr. Parker mentioning of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect going on to the prosecutor's house. - A. I recollect it very well; I went into the house, there were two or three there; there was another gentlemen besides Mr. Rice; the coachman went in first, I wrote a few lines there in the bar. I went there yesterday, for the purpose of enquiring whether it was the bar or not. As soon as I had done my writing they were all ready; the coach went off.</p>

               <p>Q. Is he a house-keeper. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember at any time the prisoner at the bar coming to your house to take lodgings - A. Yes, on Tuesday the 28th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the 28th of July. - A. It was either the 28th or 27th of last July; it was about twelve o'clock in the day; he asked me it I had got any apartment to let, I told him I had the first floor; he went up and looked at it, he asked me if I could let him have the use of the parlour, I told him I would; the prisoner looked round the parlour, and said he wanted a book-case, I told him I would get him a book-case; at last as he was going out into the passage, he looked very poorly, he asked for a glass of spring water.</p>
               <p>Q. How hid he appear to be poorly. - A. He pretended to be faint; I ran down stairs to get the water, when I came up, the prisoner was gone. I missed the watch from the mantle piece before I put the water out of my hand; it hung in the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been in that room. - A. Yes, that was the room in which he wanted the book case.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the watch in the back parlour while he was there. - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he in your apartments. - A. He was in the house about a quarter of an hour; he went up stairs, in the second floor, I did not want him to go up; he did go up, he said he wanted a room for two servants; and he found his own plate, and linen, and he wanted the use of the kitchen; he went down to see it.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw him before had you. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the same man. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a watch was this. - A. A metal watch capped and jewelled.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the name of the maker. - A. Tuck, No. 10766.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the watch since. - A. No. It was a gilt case, just coming home from being gilt, with gold hands; it opened at the back.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after your loss did you see the prisoner. - A. About three weeks after. I saw him in Clerkenwell prison.</p>

            . Q. What is you business. - A. I am a pawnbroker, I live in Chandos-street. On Tuesday the 28th of July, about half after one, to the best of my recollection, the prisoner brought a metal watch to pledge made by

             of Cockspur-street; it is a remarkable watch dome, capped by a spring; you open the back and by another spring you open the cap; it does not open by the glass.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the number. - A. I did not; they were plain gold hands. To the best of my recollection it was a gilt case; he wanted seven pound upon it; I asked him how it was possible he could ask seven pound for a watch like this; which had it been made by a watchmaker he would not charge more than that, much more when it was made by a silversmith; I asked him what he gave for it, he said fifteen pound; I no ways credited the story; still the genteel appearance of the prisoner made at that time, I thought though he told that plain story it might be that he thought my judgment might be such that I might go by what he said, rather than my own judgment. I offered him three guineas and a half; with which he was not satisfied; he took it away and I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the prisoner is the person. - A. I am sure the prisoner is the person.</p>
               <p>Q. You offered him three guineas and a half for it, of course you thought it was worth that. - A. The value of it according to my judgement was about four guineas.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (read in court). My lord, supported with confidence that the serious charge that is alledged against me will meet with a just discrimination of mercy and justice, that is always exemplary distributed to every unhappy prisoner, and I trust that my case will be considered with humanity and attention from the honourable jury; I having served his Majesty's army most of my life. By a succession of distress I have been obliged to sell my commission to support my wife and family; the difficulty of procuring for them lodgings, I was under the necessity of looking at a great many; for while I was continuing in London I was under some considerable expectation. My lord, many cases collected together to implicate a criminal must without any other effect reduce his character to a great question of integrity, and is a great state of disparagement to him. My lord and gentlemen of the jury, in such case I stand before you. I happened to be apprehended in one case under suspicion of stealing a watch; a vast number of people that kept lodging houses appeared at my examination, in order to see if they might identify my person to lay their charge against me; the present prosecutrix appeared; she deposed that she missed her watch about ten minutes after I left her house, that her husband was making enquiries after the watch at the pawnbrokers, get no watch has ever been produced.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor). While the prisoner was in your house and you saw your watch to the time you missed it, had there ever been any other person there. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.(to pawnbroker). Did the watch appear to be lately gilt. - A. It had not the appearance of being lately gilt; it had the appearance of a new watch; it wound up in the back. I am sure it was on a Tuesday he came to me; my young man was out on the Monday.</p>

On the 11th of May, about ten o'clock in the morning, as I was coming to the accompting house I met Mr. Levit, who is a gentlemen in my accompting house, who informed me that my accompting house had been broken open. When I reached my accompting house I saw that the door and the desk in my accompting house, were open; I observed on the face of the desk several bills which had been taken out of my desk on examining my bill book I found that a check of a hundred and twenty pound, and a bill of exchange for twenty pound, were missing. I sent the clerk to the bankers to stop payment of the check; he presently returned and told me the check had been presented and paid; the bill of exchange had never been presented; the check was upon Messrs. Were, Bruce and Co.</p>

            . Q. Are you in the accompting house of Messrs. Barry and Wilkinson. - A. I am. On Sunday night the 20th of May, about eleven o'clock, I was returning home to my lodgings I went down Mincing-lane to the accompting house door, I tried the accompting house door; I found the staple of the door had been forced; the door opened to my pushing. I immediately called the watchman and went into the accompting house; I found Mr. Barry's desk broken open; a black leather case on the desk and several bills were strewed on the desk. I opened the case, took out the bill book, examined it, and found there was a twenty pound bill missing. I made the entry myself when I received the bill; I gave the bill to Mr. Barry and it was put into the desk that was broken open; I did not know of the hundred and twenty pound check, we do not put the cash into the bill book. On Monday morning I went to the banker to stop payment and there I found it had been paid.</p>

            . I am porter to Messrs Skipper and Bull, Great Tower-street. On the 10th of May I was standing at the gate, just before six o'clock. I saw the prisoner Cook standing at No, 9. Mincing-lane facing the house of Barry and Wilkinson; I saw no other person in the lane at the time. I was looking at him for the course of a minute; I cast my eyes on the other side of the way, I saw a man standing with his back towards Mr Barry's door; they were both coming down Mincing-lane I went down St. Dunstan's-hill into St. Dunstan's-alley into Idol-lane; when I came to the top I was stopped by Cook, he asked me who I was looking after; I made him no answer he said d - n your eyes are you looking after us. I told him I lived in the neighbourhood, I had a right to walk where I liked: then Squeers came up, he says this is the bl - y b - r that is looking after us, do not stay let us go; they went a few yards distance, I was going to follow them towards my home; Squeers turned round and said you bl - y b - r if you follow me I will stick a knife in your bl - y guts and let them out, and tie them round your neck. With that I slopped; the prisoners went up Mincing lane. I then went to our own gate again The prisoner Cook saw me, he turned round and turned the tail of his coat over his back, signifying I might<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160020"/>kiss his backside.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that Cook was the man that you saw on one side of the street, opposite to Mr. Barry and Wilkinson's door. - A. Yes, I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that Squeers is the man that stood with his back against Mr. Barry's door. - A. Yes. I gave over watching them and went in doors.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Pooley. This was on a Sunday afternoon. - A. It was Sunday morning, just before six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen this man before. - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you never saw him from that time till you saw him at the House of Correction. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that you saw him at the House of Correction. - A. I do not know; it might be a month or six weeks. I went with Mr. Nalder.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not in the month of 
               <persName id="t18070916-27-person300">August. </persName>
            - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went there you saw several people. - A. I saw three men.</p>

               <p>Q. At that time you could not tell which of the three men were the prisoners. - A. I was not positive at the first sight; I stood at one end of them; I did not see their faces. I knew them in the course of a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. You never having seen them before you saw them in Mincing-lane, and not being certain of their persons when you first saw them in the prison, will you venture to say they are the men. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. When you first saw them you did not see their faces. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you saw their faces you knew them. - A. There were three brought out; I looked at them; I stood at one end of them, I did not see their faces. Mr. Aris took two away; I said the one that was left, Squeers, was one of them, and then they brought the other two, I said Cook was the other; when they first brought in the three men I said no, when they asked me if I knew the three men; when they were separated I was asked if I knew them, I said yes; I am certain they are the men.</p>

            . I am a porter at the Saracen's Head, Aldgate. On Monday morning, between eight and nine o'clock, after the robbery, I was coming up Whitechapel, I saw Cook; he asked me if I was busy, I said no; he said he had got a job for me, if I would do it, I said I would; I asked him if I should take my knot, he said no, it was only to go and see a gentleman upon Cornhill; we walked together till we came to Cornhill; he went into Bartholomow-lane, when he gave to me a hundred and twenty pound check; he asked me to go into Were, Bruce, and co. bankers in Bartholomow-lane. I looked at the check and read it, I did not like to go in; he said I had no occasion to be afraid, the check was good; he had got it to discount for some gentleman in the country; he was to have twenty guineas, and if I went in I was to have ten guineas; I said I did not like to go in with it; he said I had no occasion to be afraid, the check was good, and the parties would not be in town before eleven o'clock. I gave him the check and wished him good morning; he went away; I did not see any more of him. I knew the man before. I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Jury. Should you know the check. - A. I should if I was to see it.</p>
               <p>Q. When he offered you the check, was any body i company with him. - A. Squeers was in company with him when I returned the check: I knew both of them.</p>
               <p>Court. Young man, you have described that Cook asked you to go to Cornhill, did not you see Squeers in Petticoat-lane. - A. He was in the public house at the corner; I saw Cook at the door, he came out of the public house to me. I had seen them together in the Saracen's Head tap; that is the way I became acquainted with them.</p>
               <p>MR. ABERNETHY. I am a merchant. All that I know, that check which I had issued was returned to me paid, by the bankers, Messrs. Were, Bruce, and co. I produce it; I paid it to Mr. Barry; it is my hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. to Barry. Look at that check, do you know it. - A. I do, it is the same check I lost out of my desk.</p>
               <p>- LEVITT. I saw Mr. Abernethy write it; the moment I saw it at the bankers I knew it to be the same. I have no doubt whatever but that is the check that was taken out of my master's desk.</p>

            , I met the two prisoners and another man, that is not here, he is in custody; I laid hold of Cook and the other man in each hand; that moment I got hold of them two men Kennedy got fast hold of Squeers; I observed a handkerchief drop from Cook, it fell on my toes; this is the handkerchief. In this handkerchief is a crow (producing it); Kennedy said hold tight, here is something else. That moment we were no great distance from a watch box, I called the watch, being rather dark, it was close to a gentleman's house; that gentleman came out with a light; I had no opportunity of searching them. I saw things go out of Cook's hands, and the other man's hand that I had got hold of, over in a field; I begged of the gentleman to be careful and look in that field, to see if he could find something that I suspected had been thrown away. The gentleman is in court, and I have been ill since. This is the crow that fell from Cook's hand.</p>

            . On the 15th of July Ray and I were in company together at half past eleven at night near the two mile stone on the Bow road, we were coming to town; we met the prisoners at the bar, and another in their company. I came up to Squeers, I asked him who he was, he told me he was a master and worked at Bow; I then said we were officers, and we must see what they had got about them. I proceeded to search Squeers; in his right hand coat pocket I found this bag, and in his left hand inside coat pocket I found this iron crow; I then called out to Ray who was standing with the other two, to hold them fast, for I had found something not right. I then seized fast hold of Squeers, and I joined Ray with the other two; we brought them to a watch box, and secured them all three together. I saw the handkerchief drop from Cook between his legs as Ray was securing him, and a man who is now in the house of correction. When the handkerchief was picked up this small crow was in the handkerchief at the time. He gave his name to me

There was a gentleman of the name of Adams that lived next door to the watchhouse; he assisted in giving me a light; he gave me a bundle of picklock keys that he picked up where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160021"/>they stood in the presence of the prisoners. Here is a bottle of phosphorus he found, or was likewise found, just upon the spot; we brought them to town and put them in the watchhouse for that night.

               <p>- ADAMS. I am a waiter at the London tavern. On the 8th of July I was up stairs. I heard a knocking at the window on the leads; I saw this prisoner with a piece of lead of about three or four pounds; he concealed it under his jacket. I went down stairs and told my fellow servant to go up stairs into the Small (that is the name of the room) to see the fellow sacking the lead. I informed Mr. Terry of it.</p>

            . I am a waiter at the London tavern; I went up stairs in one of the tavern rooms between eleven and twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner on the leads, he was collecting his tools together apparently; after that he removed his jacket, and under his jacket lay a piece of lead; he took the piece of lead up and put it into his breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other man besides him on the leads. (The lead produced.)</p>
               <p>- TEMSEAD. I am an officer, I took the man in custody; these two pieces he took out of his pocket, and the large quantity was in the front of his breeches; it weighs somewhat more than a quarter of a hundred: he said he was going to get some nails for his work, he said he had measured more lead than the measurement of the place; he was going to take it to his master's and put it in the melting pot, in order that there might be no words about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was sent to measure this lead; I went to the shop to cut it out, I was called away. When I came down again I cut out the remainder, as I thought, and rolled it up together; I took it to the premises, and when I opened it I found I had made a mistake in some of the pieces; and I could do nothing to it till I got some nails; so I doubled up the piece that was to spare, and went in order to get the nails. As it was not booked I made a memorandum, I knew Mr. Chapman was very severe, he would not like to see me take the cuttings home. I thought to take it home, I doubled it up and put it in my waistcoat to carry it to my master's shop, unknown to my master and the surveyor, or any body else.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

On the 8th of July my mother was out of town; between eleven and twelve o'clock I went into the cellar to get a bottle of rum: it appeared to me that a considerable quantity of spirits were missing. I counted five bottles of brandy that were missing, two bottles of rum, and a considerable quantity of port wine. From information of the cook, my suspicion fell upon the man. The following morning I procured an officer. We examined his trunk; there we found a bottle of brandy, two bottles of port wine, and an empty bottle; the corks were cut off the bottles, as they are now; the top of the corks were marked with a B for the brandy, and the top of the corks are cut off.</p>

I only know about the wine and cyder; he asked me to have a bottle of wine, I told him he had better not do it, for they were too good a judge of what was in the cellar. I saw him take three bottles of cyder while the man was bottling of it.</p>

               <p>Q. That is in Middlesex, is it not - A. Yes; I was walking in the road by myself. The prisoner, in company with another man, stopped me, and demanded my money; and the prisoner held a bludgeon to me; the other man held out his hand, as if to take my watch, he did not say any thing; I said do not take my watch, be satisfied with my purse, there is about seven guineas in it; he continued to hold out his hand, and I gave him my watch. The prisoner said, when he presented the bludgeon, I do not wish to take any man's life. One of them told me then not to stop, but to go about my business; I cannot recollect which.</p>
               <p>Q. They took your watch and you purse. - A. Yes, the other man did; the prisoner took nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Neither of them touched you. - A. One of them struck me at the first, not the prisoner. They left me and went towards Finchley Common. I ran home to my father's house, at Coney hatch; I got the assistance of my brother and servant, and pursued them across the common, towards the Bald-faced Stag.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not overtake them. - A. No; on returning from the Bald-faced Stag, we saw two men in the opposite side of the road; we went up to them: I said these are the fellows that robbed me; I seized the prisoner, and when we got him down, I searched him. I found my watch upon him, and the bludgeon which he held up to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the bludgeon. - A. It was inside of his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same sort of bludgeon that he held up to you. - A. Yes, about the same size. We took him to a public house close to my father's house. The other man got away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before. - A. No, I had never seen him to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it, a light night, or a dark night - A. It was dark; there were some high trees that were on the road, it was not dark on the common.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it so dark that you could not distinguish the figure of the person, or the countenances of the persons that stopped you. - A. By the figure.</p>
               <p>Q. You said it was the prisoner that stopped you - can you speak to their persons, or their countenances. - A. Not to their countenances; they were in dark dresses, both of them, nearly alike.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me that at the time the prisoner held up the bludgeon to you, he was the person that spoke to you; the other was the person that held out his hand,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160023"/>and who took from you your purse and your watch - how do you know it was the prisoner that spoke to you. - A. I heard him speak to me when we took him, then I knew his voice directly.</p>
               <p>Q. If any body else had taken him, could you have told by his voice whether he was the man that stopped you. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has the watch. - A. I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you had that watch. - A. About four or five years.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it is your watch, what do you know it by, do you know it by either number or mark, or what is it you know it by. - A. I can swear to it; it is a singular face, I never saw a face like it.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot swear to it by the number. - A. No. I can by the maker's name.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it a chain, or ribbon, or what. - A When I found the watch upon him it was in the state it is in now, so that I only found the watch, not the ribbon. We went to the place where I was robbed; there I found the ribbon, seal, and ring, which is mine; the ring is torn off.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt but that watch is yours. - A. Not a doubt. I said to the prisoner, after I had taken him, this is a bad evening's work for you, my friend; he said, indeed it is sir. That is all that passed.</p>

Then the man shoved the cask, but he could not see the child of the other side, for it was quite the other side of the tub; then I cried out, Mr. Arnaut there is a child, but the tub was too much gone, he could not save it; it hit the child, the tub rolled off the child; the man and me run to take the tub further from the child; the man took the child in his arms, and his wife took it; there was some women took the child into Wellcose-square to the surgeon.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 18th of May I bought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160024"/>four hogsheads of a grocer in Broad-street, St. Giles; he sent them me in Cartwright-square. The man laid them two by two, the tierce he laid in one of the hogsheads, which came higher up than the hogshead; I came to take them into a yard that I had; there was a number of children about the hogsheads; I warned them to get out of the way. I laid hold of the bottom of the hogshead to bring it towards me, unfortunately it went, and unfortunately the child came out of the yard right facing, and the hogshead rolled upon it; I took the child up in my arms, and enquired who it belonged to; I gave it to my wife, and desired her to take care of the child; I went to Dr. Warner, and told him of the accident; I entreated him to come to the child, and any thing it come to I would give to him; he told me it was of no use; before I came back, the child was taken by the parents (I was told) to the hospital; I went to the hospital, I met the father of the child, he told me the child was dead; I said I was very sorry for the accident.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>MR. SKILLET. - Mr. Pooley. You are an apothecary. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner's wife before she died. - A. I did; I was first of all sent for on Friday the 17th of July, between two and three o'clock, I found her very ill, and rather convulsed; I first of all examined the child that she was delivered of, a female child; I found it very well; after that I found a black mark on her right eye. I sent her some medicine, and told them to let me know how she was at eleven o'clock; they sent me word that she was something better; I went the next morning, and found her something better; she complained then of a very sore throat, and a compression across her breast; on Saturday I called again, and found her worse, and very much convulsed; on Sunday morning I found her dead. I believe she died with an inflammation of the chest, and convulsions.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible that the blow she received under her eye, could be the occasion of her death. - A. No, it could not.</p>

            . Q. What are you. - A. I am a salesman, I live at Mr. Gower's in Holborn, my own residence is 26 Compton-street. On the night of the 25th of May I was at my benefit club; I came through Holborn, near to Middle-row, I came up to the waggon. After I got through the row I saw a man in a mixture coat, he came up to the waggoner, asked him where the waggon came from, and who the waggon belonged to, he answered; the man in the mixture coat said he knew the owner exceeding well. I got a-head of the waggon, and I stopped at Chancery-lane, and the waggon got before me again; I heard him ask the waggoner to have something to drink; the waggoner drawed up to the George and Blue Boar; I told him to go about his business for they wanted to rob the waggon; the waggoner went on. The man that was in the mixture coat flew round the back of the waggon, went over the road, and went into the Red Lion public house; I went on a head of the waggon as far as Turnstile; there I told the waggoner to keep his course and not stop for any one. I saw no more of the waggon till I came to Smart's-buildings; there I saw the man in the mixture coat.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160025"/>Q. Did the waggon stop there. - A. No. I did not see the face of the man in the mixture coat; I saw him come round the waggon. As soon as I saw this man in the mixture coat he struck him in the face and knocked him down with his fist between the wheels, with intention to knock him under, but he did not do it. The man retreated, from that I retreated, and went to the watchman at Smart's-buildings. After the watchman came up I went round of the other side and took the waggoner away, and went up St. Giles's. At the time the waggoner was knocked down I saw no man but the man in the mixture coat.</p>
               <p>Q. After he knocked the man down what became of him. - A. I cannot say; the watchman sprang his rattle; in two or three minutes afterwards the spring of the rattle at the corner of Smart's buildings brought other watchman, and the inhabitants out. I told the waggoner to come out of the narrow part of Holborn, I told him he was in a dangerous place.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw several people assemble. - A. Yes; I do not know how many.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was this. - A. It was about half past eleven. it was a fine night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough for you to describe the men. - A. No, I should not know them by the face at all; he had a dark mixture lapelled coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. Look to the men at the bar, and tell me whether you can speak to either of them. - A. I cannot speak to either of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. It was dark. - A. Yes, I could not take any observation at all.</p>

            . - Mr. Andrews. What are you. - A. I am a bookseller in Holborn. On the night of the 25th of May I was standing at my desk in my shop, I heard a waggoner apparently stop his horses; the man was crying out why do you use me ill, or why do you knock me down. I went out of the side door, I came round the corner (my house is the corner of a court), and at the next door there stood two men by the shutters, and opposite that there stood the waggoner and Mr. Watkinson, and the next door was an alamode beef shop with a patent lamp each side the window, and a patent lamp in the shop. I saw the persons of the two men.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the waggoner say or do to these two men. - A. The waggoner seemed to describe the assault that these two men had been making to him; the waggoner was very bloody in the face, he said that one of these men had knocked him down.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the two men at the bar, and tell me whether you recollect the persons of the two men that were present. - A. I will tell you as it has struck me all along; I imagine I stood next to Caddick.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe him to be one of the men you have described. - A. Yes, to the best of my belief.</p>
               <p>Court. Will you swear positively. - A. I could not take upon me to swear positively to a man whom I had seen but once. The waggoner said he had knocked him down, and he would swear to it; the men were both impertinent. I seeing the waggoner bloody, and they impertinent, I said, my friend, there is a watch-box, you had better charge the watch with him. At that time the watchman was coming with his lanthorn; young Mr. Watkinson said, here is a watchman; I said now you charge him with the watch. As soon as I advanced a step or two to the watchmen these two men run off; the shorter man stood near me, he had a kind of a speckled frock coat on, and they both had the resemblance of gentlemen's grooms; I perfectly recollect the dress they had on. I stood still myself; I had no apprehension of the danger that took place. The watchmen pursued them, and young Mr. Watkinson pursued, and in a very few minutes Mr. Watkinson came back; he said he was struck; I thought he said he was stuck. He took his hands off, and I perceived he was wounded.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the two men you have described after they run off. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you at all describe the tall man. - A. Why. the tall man had a dark dress, I cannot say the colour of the coat. I only think they are the men; when I saw them at Lambeth-street it struck me they were the men, they were dressed different to what they are now; I believe Caddick is in the same dress, I cannot say positively. Briant was dressed in a suit of black there.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak to the tall man Briant. - A. I cannot speak to the countenance only. From the general appearance they were like grooms. It has struck me all along that they are the same men. I cannot say more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. You had but little time to observe these men - how much time had you. - A. About two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. That person that you describe to be Caddick was next to you; had you the opportunity of observing him better than the other who was farther from you. - A. Most likely.</p>
               <p>Q. You were alarmed. - A. I had no alarm then.</p>
               <p>Q. These persons you had never seen before. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. These persons are now trying for their lives - do you mean to have it understood that you mean positively to swear to the persons of these men that you saw only two or three minutes. - A. I cannot say; I think they are the men, and it has struck me all along so.</p>
               <p>Q. Where next did you see them after this night. - A. At Lambeth-street. I saw them before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not their persons pointed out to you as the persons against whom you were to appear. - A. Yes. I saw another man, but I could not point him out; I believe they resemble the men that I saw that night.</p>

            . - Mr. Gurney. I believe you live in High Holborn. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the night of May the 25th was your attention attracted by any thing. - A. Yes, I was coming down Broad St. Giles's at about half past eleven at night; in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160026"/>the narrow part of Holborn; I perceived four or five people standing together, by the alamode beef shop. When I went to see what was the matter, I saw two persons, and one of them stood by Mr. Cawthorn's shutters; they appeared to me to be suspicious characters; the alamode beef shop was open; the waggon was stopped, and the waggoner was standing off the curb; when he came near the short man, he said you are the man that knocked me down, I will swear to it; Mr. Kettle who was standing by, said you have been ill used, you had better call the watchman; a watchman came from the corner of Smart's-buildings; I said to the waggoner, there is the watchman; the waggoner turned round, he said watchman take charge of this man; that was the short one. The tall man took hold of the short one, turned him round, and gave him a push up Holborn, the opposite way from where the watchman was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the light of the alamode beef shop give you any light so as to speak to their persons. - A. Yes, the short one; the tall one was standing towards St. Giles, he was rather out of the light.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look, and tell me whether either of them are the persons. - A. If either of them are the persons I have lost my recollection; the prisoner at the bar answers to the two men in height; I do not recollect their faces.</p>
               <p>Court Are they unlike the men. - A. They are like the men; I cannot recollect enough to say they are the the men; I think the tallest of the two prisoners is not so lusty as the tall man was. The short man appears to be of the same size.</p>
               <p>Q. Now pursue the story. - A. The watchman came up, and the waggoner gave charge of him; the tall man gave him a shove, the short man ran off; I pursued him; when he got the distance of four or five houses, I laid hold of him by the left side of his collar; the instant I laid hold of him, some man came up and struck me in the back; it appeared to be the same man that stood behind the shutter; that man went away from me; upon that I left hold of the short man. I was stabbed in the back, and was under the care of the surgeon some time.</p>

               <p>MARIA - . - Mr. Andrews. Where do you live. - A. I live at the Windsor Castle, I am servant to Mrs. Atkins.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that near the alamode beef shop. - A. It is almost opposite of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a waggon stopping there on one evening in May last. - A. Yes, about twenty minutes past eleven; I saw the waggon stop, I saw the waggoner and a man talking; the waggoner pointed to him, and said he could swear to that man, that he knocked him down; he said that he had been used very ill; he took up his smock frock and shewed the blood upon it; there were several people told him to charge the watch with him; as soon as the watchman came the man ran away; then young Mr. Watkinson came up, and he said he was hurt.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at these two men at the bar, will you swear to either of them; was the light of the night sufficient to enable you to observe the persons of these men - A. I cannot positively say it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the dress of the men. - A. He had a light coloured drab coat on; I cannot recollect any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Turn round and see if you see any men that resemble the persons you have described; have you looked at these men at the bar. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Should you know them if you saw them. - A. I should know one of them if I was to see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen that person since the night this affair happened. - A. Yes, I saw him at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then speak positively to him. - A. I did; his name is Briant; that is the man (witness pointing to Briant); he ran past me in Holborn, and almost knocked me down; I am sensible that is the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Where were you in Holborn, at the time that you supposed he was running by you. - A. This side of the alamode beef shop; about two or three yards to the farthest; there was no one run but him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen that person, whom you supposed to be Briant, before in your life. - A. No, but he came with his face right towards me, that made me observe him; I only saw him as he rushed by me. I afterwards saw him at Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you told before you went that you should see the person who assaulted the waggoner. - A. By all means.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came there, was the persons who are present now, then at the bar. - A By all means; there were four there; I looked round to be sure, and then I recollected Briant; he was the person that run by me.</p>

            . - Mr. Gurney. I believe you live near the alamode beef shop. - A. Nearly opposite.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you standing at the door about the time the waggon was stopped at your house. - A. Before the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160027"/>waggon came up I stood in the middle of the street, I saw the waggoner with a tallish man, I saw two or three others about the waggon; there was two of this side of the waggon. As the waggon passed that short man Caddick was at the tail of the waggon; the waggon passed me. I stood still at the alamode beef shop door and Caddick passed me; there was a good light at the alamode beef shop, and the lamp at my own house (I keep a public house), and it was a moon light night; I saw him, I was as close to him as I am to this gentleman; I have no doubt of his being the man. I returned to my own house and stood on the steps; in two or three minutes I saw Mr. Watkinson walk into the alamode beef shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of the scuffle. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the waggoner knocked down. A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. At the time that you first saw the man that you now speak of (Caddick) you had not seen any thing improper take place. - A. Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he standing still or walking along. - A. Walking along.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no other opportunity of seeing him than as he was walking along. - A. No other.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know how you came to take such particular notice, you had no particular attention drawn to him. - A. No. There were four men scattered about the waggon.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in consequence if they were scattered about the waggon, your attention must have been divided. - A. If you was to come to see the situation that I stood in the street, there is a parting in the houses between the potatoe warehouse and the pawnbroker's; the reflection of the light came down so that I could see him; had the waggon came the other way I could not have seen him; but the moon glared.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure it was a moon light night. - A. It was a moon light night.</p>
               <p>Q. You may be positive, and you may be mistaken, it has positively been proved by the witnesses that it was a dark night, how long was it after this that you saw the man in custody. - A. About a fortnight or three weeks afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Give me leave to ask you whether at that time you did not say you could not venture so swear to him. A. I said Briant appeared to be the man. I was asked by the attorney of the prisoners whether I could swear to the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you said that although Caddick bore the appearance of the man, yet you could not venture to swear to the man. - A. It was Briant; I did not say so of Caddick. I always said Caddick was the man that passed me; I did not know whether or no he was the man that did it.</p>

On Sunday after he had eat his dinner he took hold of the table cloth and wiped his knife he said that knife should either end his life or mine; after that he laid himself on the bed, and I came out. I did not return till eleven o'clock on the Monday morning, and then he had a pint of beer before him; he asked me if I would shake hands with him; I did; he asked me if I would drink with him, I told him I would, he said I should not have beer, he would go to Mr. Murphy, and get some cherry brandy; he went out and returned, and said he could not get a bottle; he turned back into the passage and sharpened his case knife; he returned, into the room and said he would have my life, Hannah-Black was in the room. She went to take the knife out of his hand; he cut her knuckles with it; she went out to call assistance; he laid hold of me with his left hand by my head he had the knife in his right hand, he went to put the knife across my throat; I put up my arm, it cut my arm in two places; as soon as I could run away I did; there is the mark of one of the cuts; the other you cannot see.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he paid you for the lodgings. - A. He had paid me on the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take him up afterwards. - A. Three days afterwards; I catched him in a public house in Spital fields.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find any of Stevens' clothes. - A. Not any of them. I asked the prisoner what he had done with them; he would not make me any answer.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I heard him when I was coming down stairs, I spoke to him; I said Joe, you are sick, and his wife said he was drunk the over night. There was five slept in the room where I lay; there were two that went out before me; I told one of the men to give me a call; he called me. I have subpoenaed this man; he sent me word he was indebted to the landlord, and he would not come forward, for fear the landlord would turn him out.</p>
               <p>Munen. When I came down and found my door open, I went up stairs; I found the lodgers in bed; Stevens was asleep, and Collins had absconded. I was as sober that night as I am now.</p>

On the 5th of August last the prisoner came and hired a chaise for the afternoon, to go to Hampstead, and to return at eight o'clock in the evening. I never saw no more of the girl, till I saw her in possession of the officer at Hatton Garden, She brought a horse with her; she said she was going to drive the chaise herself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you enquire who she was, or what she was - A. The labourer in general does, or me; I omitted it that day, else I generally make the enquiry. I left the prisoner to go to a gentleman at the other part of the shop I ordered the man to deliver a chaise to her, which he did.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the woman. - A. When I enquired about the horse, she said that the horse was her mother's, she gave twenty pound for it; I said to her the horse has a bad eye, you had better have some advice, or else the horse will loose the eye. It was by the mark of the horse over the eye that she was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do not know the woman at all. - A. Yes I do; she was drest like a person in business; as if she was used to cows, or horses. I am sure it was her.</p>
               <p>- HOARDER. I am a wheelwright, I live in Upper Thames-street. On the 10th of August the prisoner drove herself a chaise into my yard, and left it there; and took away a cart which she had previously agreed to give ten pounds for.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MAYHEW. I am a collar maker. I live in Upper Thames-street. On the 10th of August the prisoner came to our shop, and bespoke a new harness to be made; she left the harness that was on her horse at that time, till she called for the new; I lent her a harness to use in the mean time: the harness that she had was not fit for use, for the cart that she then had. I did not see her for a week afterwards; then she was in the custody of the officer. The officer took the harness that she had left, saying that the harness had been stolen.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton Garden office. On the evening of the 27th of August, I received information of the prisoner. There was an advertisement of two guineas reward, for apprehending the prisoner for running away with a one horse chaise of Mr. Brownnutt, in Blackfriars Road. I went to the White Hart public house, Leather-lane, Holborn; where I found the prisoner standing at the bar; I laid hold of her by the arm, and told her I wanted to speak to her, I asked her what she had done with Mr. Brownnutt's chaise and harness; she told me that she had left the chaise at Mr. Horder's, a wheeler, in Thames-street, and she had left the harness at a collar makers in Thames Street. I went there and found the harness, all but the bridle and the collar.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) Have you ever seen the chaise and the harness. - A. I have. They are mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had not the least thought o defrauding Mr. Brownnutt of the chaise; when Mrs Wood came to take me, I was going to Mr. Brownnutt that night.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Wood) What is this young woman. - A. She is the daughter of a very honest woman, with five children.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160030"/>I am sorry to say the mother gave her the worst of characters.</p>

               <p>JOHN FORRESTER I am a constable. On the 2nd of this month, near five o'clock, I was walking in Leadenhall-street, towards Aldgate. At the corner of St. Mary Axe I met the prisoner and two of his accomplices; I made a full stop, and looked at them; I could see by their manner that their intention was to rob Mr. Holmes. I turned about and kept company with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to them. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they see you. - A. Yes, but they did not happen to know me. Between that and Cornhill they made two or three attempts; when they came to Corn-hill Mr. Holmes stopped at No. 73, a picture shop; the prisoner stood close to Mr. Holmes, and the two accomplices stood on each side of him; I saw the prisoner at the bar with his right hand in Mr. Holmes's pocket; he made off then; I knew they had done the business. He walked off pretty sharp towards the Exchange, I walked after him and passed him, then I turned round and laid hold of him by the collar, he asked me what I meant by that; I told him that I suspected that he had something about him that did not belong to him; says he, you are mistaken in me, I am an officer of Union-hall, and there is my authority.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he produce his authority. - A. Yes, here it is in my hand. I told him he might be an officer, but I believed I should prove him to be a thief. I shoved him against a window; he said you will not expose me in the street, I said it will be of no consequence to you; I went to search him, he took something out of his pocket, and let it fall on the grating of the window; I picked it up, I said that is all I want. Mr. Holmes still kept looking at the picture shop, and I held him till he made his way towards the Exchange. I asked Mr. Holmes if he had lost any thing, he said he had not; I told him to be satisfied, and shewed him the pocket book; he said that is my pocket book, and to convince you it is mine, there is a bill of exchange in it for fifteen guineas. I opened it and found it corresponded; then I took him to the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other men. - A. They went off, I had no time to look after them, if I had gone after them I should have lost the property.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a city constable - A. I am.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. That pocket book I never saw; a boy found it; directly he laid hold of me, he searched me, he found nothing on me.</p>

               <p>Q. Then each of these bill were taken by you, and the bills of parcels were taken by you, and you left them together. - A. Generally so; I cannot say every time.</p>
               <p>Q. Now fix upon any one time, and upon any one of them that you delivered. - A. The first, that is for one hundred and eighty-nine pound, nineteen shillings and two-pence; that I am certain I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to receive the money afterwards. - A. I went after it was returned from the bankers; I asked if Mr. Bullock was at home. I was answered he was not.</p>

He said that it was on an aukward business that he had up the Baltic; some payment of money; I could not rightly understand him. I understood that was the case. I believe he had forwarded some rum to a man up the Baltic; he said there were bills coming due, that was the reason he was there, and did not attend the accompting house.</p>

               <p>Q. When you gave them to Mr. Bullock, how many had you received. - A. Two or three at the latter end; he told me I had better apply to Mr. Low; if I was dubious any harm would come to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told him you was afraid of any harm coming. - A. I told him, I did not know what might be the consequence.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you in the month of May assigned over or transferred any thing except sales in the ordinary course of your dealing. - A. I sold and transferred to Wallis, Lang, and company, all my stock and trade; to Mr. Ralph, a dock warrant for ten puncheons of brandy and rum; and nothing else has been signed or transferred by me in any other manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other consignment coming forward. - A. None. The property delivered to Messrs. Ralph, the dock order, was on the 6th of April, and the dock order of brandy was on the 6th of May. Mr. Low in law expences and money advanced by him in law proceedings.</p>

               <p>Q. The same balance of course is carried forward from the latter end of April to the beginning of May. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What appears to be the difference in the month of June. - A. Eleven hundred, forty-eight pounds and eleven pence halfpenny; but the balance at the time of examination was different, because there has been some addition since.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the balance then. - A. Twelve hundred pounds and a fraction. The entries appear to be the same hand writing, which is Wallis, who used to keep his books.</p>

             so much money that would make in the whole one thousand and fifty pound, because he had borrowed of him at different times money to that amount, and that Mr Jones was a particular friend of his, and he considered it a matter of honour to repay it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said respecting the assignees applying to Mr. Jones for the payment of that money - A. I believe there was.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say upon that subject. - A. The exact language I cannot recollect; but he wished not for the application to be made by the assignees to Mr. Jones, but that he himself would apply for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the assignees request him to do with respect to his affairs in general. - A. I have a minute in writing of the proceedings on the 24th of January (the memorandum read) that Mr. Bullock do bring the cash book and adjust the bills, and make out the debts in town separate, and the different bills owing in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do any such thing. - A. Not to my knowledge. I believe Mr. Wallis made out the list of the town and country debts. The bankers checks were not made up; the cash book was never brought up, and the deficiency at present is eleven hundred odd pounds.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you as solicitor ever received from the bankrupt that eleven hundred, odd pounds. - A.Certainly not, nor any part.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor has any person received it on the part of the estate. - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend the last meeting of the commissioners upon the 18th of July. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the bankrupt appear then. - A. He did not, or else I should have seen him (this is the certificate of the commissioners.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. When these questions and answers were taken down, I ask you whether he did not state that he did not wish to prejudice the commission. - A. No; I think not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160037"/>Q. Do not you remember his saying something of that sort. - A. No, he showed a reluctance of being examined.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether he did not state - I give these answers to the best of my judgment at the moment, but I must have power afterwards to rectify them, and then the next day he gave you that memorandum, the next day as something that mistook his recollection. - A. I do not think he did; but it is very probable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at any time do any more than bankrupts do ask for time. - A. No more I believe it was explained to him that without that surrender he could not obtain his commission (the memorandum read.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did you afterwards search for them things. - A. Oh no.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been able to recover these things. - A. Mr. Bullock gave me, that has being an advance; Mr. Bullock has not secreted this.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever tell you what become of the money, except the account of this payment to

               <p>Mr. Const. Did he never say (I will give it you in words that will perhaps bring it to your memory) he said he was not insolvent. - A. I have rather an imperfect recollection of his declaring himself not in a state of insolvency, I have still a mere imperfect recollection; I cannot say one way or the other.</p>
               <p>Q.(to the commissioners.) Do you remember any such declaration. - A. I do not; every thing that he stated is certainly taken down in writing; I recollect he objected being examined at all. (a paper shewn to the commissioners.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury. It seems to appear that the law does not allow my counsel to urge what I might have to say in my defence, perhaps for me very unfortunately. Gentlemen, you have heard the evidence that has been adduced in support of the prosecution; you have also heard the objections that have been stated; you must be aware that men like me, unaccustomed to speak in public, must feel greatly at a loss; and the state of my mind, which is not most at ease, I trust will have some weight, and no undue consideration with you, when you consider what I have got to say. I flatter myself, while I am addressing a tribunal like this, all of them Englishmen, that if I state any thing that is not correct, in point of form, or any thing that I may have omitted for my defence, will not be forgotten by you.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, it is not unworthy your notice, one thing I shall state to you. It is for the breach of an act of parliament, for which I am accused I will say that law is severe, it is partial. You, gentlemen, are like myself, men that get your living by buying and selling. There is every man, even the greatest bulk of society, may buy as many goods of you and me, and other tradesmen, they may pledge them, keep them, embezzle them in any way they may think fit; there is no criminal attachment to them, they may go to prison, and live upon our property. It seems to me very hard, when we, who are subject to so many misfortunes, should be liable to loose our lives, when they may go at large; I trust that will have some consideration with you; I am coming now to speak to you of the motive under which I I have acted; and you will surely while I am doing that fully and freely excuse me of going into general matters. In the first place, I did not consider myself insolvent; for that reason I did not wish to be a bankrupt. This I think you have heard in evidence; I am not aware that any act of bankruptcy I ever committed; I did not in this go on by my own judgment, it was upon the repeated opinion of my solicitors, and whom I believe there is none in the profession more respectable than these gentlemen I am quoting, Messrs. Cooper and Low in Chancery-lane.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, this refers with more peculiarity to my situation after I had been declared a bankrupt, and it may be worth my while to make an observation upon the evidence upon which I was declared a bankrupt. It struck me in this way; the law has expressed on that subject, as I have since heard, that a creditor cannot be an acting man to establish a bankruptcy; that gentleman who did give that evidence, on which that declaration was founded, has since been found to be a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160040"/>creditor to the amount of one hundred and fifty pounds, and in this court he has averred that he was a creditor; then, perhaps, it does not become me to reason on the subject I am bound to give an historical account of facts I reasoned in this way, my lord, and gentlemen of the jury that if a commission of bankruptcy, issued against me, upon evidence that was not legal; that every proceeding upon that declaration must in itself be illegal also. Under that evation did I refuse to attend the summons of the commissioners, and when compelled by force, I made them terms. Gentlemen, I am not insolent; I have committed no act of bankruptcy, I will not submit to be examined; the answer was, you have no alternative, but to submit, or to be committed to Newgate; for that is our duty; my answer was, gentlemen is is immaterial to me whether you do or not; and when I submitted to be examined, it was with this condition, that whatever I might say with regard to the state of my affairs, in answer to any of those questions that were put to me, that I should at any future time be at liberty to revise and correct. I confess that when I made these conditions I did intend to revise the examination; I at the said time, when I entered into the said examination, was not aware it had so much consequence, as I see it has to day; I considered myself at liberty, to revise and to correct them; I hope you will take this with what I before said, not considering myself insolvent, I avoided any further examination.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen I think I may with some propriety state by way of refuting the allegation, that I have acted with no intention to defraud my creditors; I may state to you that it never was my intention to defraud my creditors; and this, I shall not state without calling evidence to prove it. When I met the gentlemen, who are now my petitioning creditors, I told them I was not insolvent, I was applied to by Mr.

            , to give in the state of of my affairs; I told them I was averse, and never had been of committing an act of bankruptcy; but if nothing else would do, I would give up my whole estate, without being insolvent After this declaration of bankruptcy was made against me, day after day, was I hunted to attend upon the assignees; two or three times did I attend upon them; every time I met them, they and their solicitor, imposed new difficulties, and new hardships. In short it was carried on in that way, that the intent was not to get a full and fair disclosure of my estate, as to drive me into some corner, as would drive me into the prosecution I am now in. I therefore discontinued attending their meetings, I disregarded their summons's; still under the notion, that I was illegally declared a bankrupt, and that I was not an insolvent man, I still kept in my mind that I would resist. This was the ground and motive upon which I acted which will be satisfactorily proved to you, and when I have done that, I trust and hope that the breach of the vindictive part of the act of parliament, will appear to you to be done without manifesting any intention of defrauding my creditors; I trust that will have its due weight with you. Gentlemen, it may not be altogether foreign to the purpose; when I state to you that so far from showing a total disinclination to account to the creditors; that when the officer apprehended me, he having no warrant against me, I made no resistance; he said he was come to take me; well, I said take me; in this he will not contradict me.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, it may be asked why I went to Scotland; I will state my reasons, and my motive. Having as alledged against me, refused to attend the meeting of the assignees, they threatened me all manner of things; and particularly one of the assignees, threatened me in these words; that on the 18th, he should take care that I should not be to look after. I thought it a hard case, acting as I did, I was doing no wrong, not submitting as I thought to a hard case; considering myself innocent, I was unwilling to submit to so long imprisonment, with this idea I went to Scotland, with a firm and determined purpose of returning in December, and to stand while the commission was disputed; which I was conscious would be the case.</p>
               <p>There was another view, gentlemen, which by no means appear unnatural; had I surrendered on the 18th, I must have given up every thing, or have perjured myself; it was not unnatural, to reason in this way; here is a great many months, I must be stripped of ever thing for no purpose; for when the courts of law again meet, it will be disputed, and it will be upset and while that is going forward, I and my family must be starving; I do not mean to urge this in point of law, because I am no lawyer. I considered an aged parent a tender offspring, that when there is no provision for them, I trust you will not think unreasonable in me for to think myself fairly entitled to be the guardian, of whatever little property is left rather than to squander, it away in law; I wish you understand me in the way I mean it, and the way in which I understood the act of bankruptcy, as declared against me. It occured to me the furious proceedings of the gentlemen who conducts this prosecution of the invalidity of the commission that was one reason more why I was induced to resist it prowers. Gentlemen I apprehend it would be idle to occupy much more of your time; I have stated to you, the spirit in which I was guided; I therefore believe I had better call the evidence to justify what I have said, and then to leave myself in your hands; I have no doubt but that I shall meet with all the justice that my case can meet with.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any quarrel between the prisoner Field and Warwick. - A. Not at first. On Sunday evening the prisoner and I were at the Clown public house; we were sitting there some time, and the deceased and an old man got to words; the deceased had chucked some ale over the old man, that was sitting there. The prisoner, on seeing the old man ill used, got up, and wished the old man to sit down, and the deceased to sit down, and not to have any words: the prisoner then came to me and sat down again. After that the deceased and the old man got to words again. The prisoner said to the old man, you had better go out of the company. The old man went in a very few minutes afterwards: after that the prisoner and I went away. In about an hour we returned with a young man. We took seats nearly opposite to the deceased. The deceased got in conversation with him concerning interrupting him with the old man. The prisoner told the deceased to keep his own company. The deceased said, why not you keep your own company this afternoon? The prisoner replied, I did not like to see an old man used ill. The deceased said, I'll serve you the same, and I will split your nose. The deceased arose to strike the prisoner, I got between them to prevent them from fighting. The deceased said he would fight him for five or ten pound, or one pound: the prisoner said he did not wish to fight, he had no money. The deceased then ill used the prisoner and his company; he said we were beggars; he insisted upon fighting him for one pound. I put the money down, and they went out to fight. They continued to fight for an hour, or an hour and a quarter, then the second said he would not fight any more. I went with the prisoner.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160043"/>Q.What became of the deceased. - A. I do not know; I did not see him when I took the prisoner away.</p>
               <p>JEFFERY MORGAN. Q. Were you in this company at the Clown. - A. I was; I saw all that passed, as the witness has related, except the beginning of using the old man ill. I heard the prisoner at the bar say it was cruel of him using the old man ill. The deceased said, I will serve you ten times worse, I will split your nose. The prisoner said, I do not think you can do that. With that the deceased got up, and tried to strike the prisoner; the people stopped them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them afterwards fight. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the deceased when his friends said he would not fight any more. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any more blows struck after that. - A. No.</p>
               <p>JOHN LEVER. I was standing at the Clown public-house door with a friend. He said there was a fight in the field: I went into the field and they were just done. I saw the prisoner there. The deceased was standing on the ground, held up by two or three men of his acquaintance; he seemed to be quite senseless. I am an officer: the prisoner surrendered himself to me the next morning after I heard he was dead.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CROFT. Q. Was you at the Clown public-house. - A. I was there when they fought.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the deceased give in. - A. I heard the words said, that he could fight no more. I went immediately and fetched a doctor. The doctor ordered him to the hospital. I went with the deceased to the hospital, and stopped with him till the doctor ordered me away. I saw him no more. The next morning I went there, I heard he was dead.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not know John Green. - A. No, I never saw him till I saw the accident. On Monday the 7th of September, I was walking up <placeName id="t18070916-50-crimeloc253">Aldersgate Street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18070916-50-crimeloc253" type="placeName" value="Aldersgate Street"/>
                  <interp inst="t18070916-50-crimeloc253" type="type" value="crimeLocation"/>

                        targets="t18070916-50-off251 t18070916-50-crimeloc253"/>. I heard a coach coming violently up the street: the driver was violently whipping the horses; as he drove by me the horses were upon the gallop, and he whipping them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the man that was whipping them. - A. The <rs id="t18070916-50-deflabel254" type="occupation">coachman</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"
                        targets="t18070916-50-defend510 t18070916-50-deflabel254"/> there at the bar. After he had passed me a few yards, I saw two men coming across the street, and the coach was so near them, that in my apprehension at the time it appeared that he must run over them both. One of the men stepped on one side, and the old man, the deceased was knocked down by the coach and horses; the near horse and the near small wheel went over his head. The coach was instantly stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. Who stopped it. - A. I believe the prisoner stopped it as soon as he could; and as soon as the man got up we perceived two wounds, one large wound on the left side of the upper part of his head, and the lesser wound on the right side the lower part.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not die on the spot. - A. No. After the accident the coachman turned the people out of the coach, and put the deceased in; the prisoner then drove him to St. Bartholomew's Hospital. After the accident the prisoner did every thing that a man could do.</p>
               <p>

            . I was with the deceased crossing Aldersgate Street on Monday last week, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon. I ran as quick as possible, and by some means or other this man was run over; before I could turn and recover myself he was picked up.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a young man and you ran; he was an old man and he could not. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. SQUIRE. Q. You are the surgeon of St. Bartholomew's Hospital. - A. Yes. The deceased was brought to the hospital; he died of an inflammation arising from the wounds he received on the left side of the head, and the other on the right side of the head.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There was neither of the horses a galloping; facing Bull and Mouth street my, off horse made a slip, and I gave him a whip or two, that gentleman has swore as false as God is true.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Watts) Did the horses gallop. - A. I could not see.</p>

In about half an hour some people assembled about the door, and then I related what I had seen.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see the pocket book notes, or purse afterwards. - A. No.</p>
               <p>JAMES HARVEY. I am a Chelsea pensioner. I received six one pound notes; I gave them to my wife, and the change I kept. When we got home my wife put it on a shelf, she told me; I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner's pocket book. - A. No. After I was upon the bed my wife went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner lay on the bed when you did. - A Yes, he came to me and laid by me on the bed; I went to sleep while she was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time of her absence, did you take the purse or the pocket book from the shelf. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember your wife awaking you, and telling you she had lost the pocket book. - A. I do not recollect her coming into the room, but as soon as I saw her in the room, she cast her eyes towards the shelf, and said the money was gone; the prisoner said it was a pretty job if all the money was gone, he was ruined.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 22nd of July, in the prosecutor's house. I asked him if he had any money or notes, he denied it; there was a soldier in the room that insisted that he had notes about him; he still persisted that he had not, I searched him, and found upon him three one pound notes, two seven shilling pieces, and three shillings and sixpence in silver. I produce the notes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 21st of July I went to Chelsea; I received a pension of four pound six shillings and eleven pence; I put it in my pocket. I parted with Harvey, and went into a cook's shop, from that into a public house; I drank pretty freely. Going home I met Harvey and his wife very much in liquor. We went into a coach, and ordered it to drive to the Fox, Wardour-street, where I live; we stopped there, drank half a pint of gin, then they went round to Green's court; they alighted, and went up that court; several of my friends took me away; she could not walk she was conducted up the court; I went to the Fox. After that I went and asked her for my pocketbook. I gave her my pocket-book to take care off; there were twenty duplicates in it, there was no other property in it. When I asked for the pocketbook, she said she put it and her husband's money on a shelf; it was all gone; I asked her who had been in the place, she said a woman up stairs; I went home to my own place and treated a friend; I never mentioned the word money to her; I had my notes in my pocket when I was at my home. I asked a tailor to buy my boy some things that night; I pulled out my notes to change at the Fox; the landlord would not change them that night.</p>

            . Q. Do you remember the evening when Bantin had been to Chelsea. - A. Yes, I remember his coming to the sign of the Fox the corner of Wardour-street, Peter-street, Soho, it was about three or four o'clock in the afternoon; they came in a coach, Mr. Harvey, his wife, Bantin, and his boy and another man; they had half a pint of gin in the coach, the coachman led the horses round to Green's-court to Harvey's habitation; the prisoner at the bar did not go into the house with them, he returned with me to the Fox; I was with him there upwards of three hours.</p>

Yes, it was on the counter before they came in; we served Bush with the article they wanted, and they waited for change; I went into Mr. Cook's, a linen draper in the same street for change. After I came back I detected the prisoner Bush with the gingham; after I stopped her I looked down, and the gingham had fell down close to her feet; I looked about, I saw the gingham lying on the ground.</p>

No, it was close to Bush's feet; after that Bush went down upon her knees and begged pardon, requested us to let her go, and she would never do so any more. She confessed that she took it. After the constable came, I saw Mr. Cook take a remnant of printed cotton from Bush.</p>
               <p>MR. COOK. Q. You were called in. - A. Yes; I saw the gingham drop on the ground, but I did not see it drop from her; I searched Bush, she endeavoured to take some things out of her pocket; I took the remnant of printed cotton from her, as she was taking it out of her pocket.</p>

When I had them both in the coach I corrected the father, Stanley, for encouraging the son to do this. The father said no, my son gave it me, and I am very angry that he should place me in this situation; he told me he found it. I went to his lodgings in West-street, at a bird cage makers; Mrs. Stanley gave me the chain and seal. The father said he had been looking every morning in the papers to see if it was advertised.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoners at the bar. - A. I know them both; Ellison lived with us four years, and Steinback about two years, as <rs id="t18070916-57-deflabel290" type="occupation">porter</rs>

               <p>Q. Did you at any time discover a piece of Irish in a particular situation in your warehouse. - A. Yes, it was put behind the boxes in which the cloth is usually put; I let it remain there to see what would become of it; I saw it every evening, it was there about the time we first discovered the cloth; Ellison was taken ill and was confined up stairs about ten days; he resumed his calling last Monday week. On this day week in the afternoon I discovered the piece of cloth was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at any time when Ellison was accused of having taken this piece of Irish. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Did you tell him if he would discover who the receiver was, you would let him off. - A. No, he acknowledged having taken it, and that he had given it to Steinback.</p>

               <p>Mr. Stork. What has been the character of Ellison during these four years. - A. A very industrious useful man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You had an opportunity after this man was taken ill, to discover that this piece of Irish linen was in a very unusual situation, you choosed that it should remain there; you left it there expecting that it would be stolen. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. In point of fact it was stolen; because if it was taken out of the box it was stolen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Ellison did not confess at first what he had done, but the terror of a prison, and your kindness towards him, he told you. - A. I suppose it was his contrition, and seeing we had the goods, and we were in possession of some of the facts.</p>
               <p>Q. You could prove that he was the person that stole it, but your object was not so much to punish him as the receiver. - A. There was no such remark by me nor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160047"/>any body else.</p>

               <p>Q Did you see this piece of goods as described by Mr. Barker. - A I did; the porter under Ellison discovered it by accident; I marked it. I believe it was taken from a box, No. 3. I found a piece deficient in the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual for you to mark off the goods that are sold. - A. Yes; this was marked off. I had not marked it off.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first miss it from the place where it was concealed behind the box. - A. This day week I found it missing about nine in the morning; he was accused of it, at first he denied it; he was told if he told the truth it would be the better for him; he then said that he had taken it, and had given it to Steinback.</p>
               <p>Court. Who told him he had better tell the truth. - A. I did for one</p>
               <p>Q. In the hearing of your masters. - A. I did.</p>

               <p>Mr. Barker. These goods were in the house on Saturday morning. The prisoner had the charge of the house on that morning, from seven till nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS NALDER. Q. Did you at any time go to the lodging of the prisoner Steinback. - A. I did, this day week, he lived in Ironmonger-lane, he came home about four o'clock in the afternoon. I and some officers, and Mr. Poole the partner went up after him; I secured him, and then I pulled out the warrant. I said I must search the place for a piece of goods; I searched, and in a dirty sheet was concealed this piece of linen. Mr. Poole looked at it, and said this was the piece of goods that he had lost.</p>
               <p>Q. to Reader. Can you say whether that is the piece that you marked. - A.It is the piece that I marked, after it was found in the place.</p>
               <p>Q. to Nalder. When did you see Steinback again. - A. On Monday, when he was brought before the lord mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. What was said was taken down in writing. - A. I cannot say, Mr. Hobler warned the porter to be particular cautious in what he said in his confession, that there was no fair hopes of any favour, and as such he should speak unbiassed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then this confession, whatever it was, was read over in the presence of Steinback. - A. It was.</p>

            . Q.Did you accompany Mr. Nalder to the lodgings of Steinback. - A I did; nothing passed at that time; I took him to the compter; returned to Mr. Nalder at his lodgings; I saw Mr. Nalder find this piece of linen, it was covered over with a sheet.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see him. - A. On Monday morning; he was then before Mr. Alderman Birch; I took him to Newgate from there. As we were coming along in the coach, in company with Leadbetter, Sherrin, Ellison, and Steinback, Steinback said to Ellison, what a fool you must be, to say any thing about it; Ellison replied, how much would you have given me out of it, or what could you have sold it for; he said he should have sold it for about three shillings a yard, and they had made a mistake at the Mansion-house, they had called it twenty-five yards, and it was twenty-six yards; Leadbetter said he should be very glad if he could get such a piece at three shillings a yard, he thought it a very good one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. This conversation began by Steinback asking the other why did he say any thing about it - then you tell us Ellison replied, what would you have given to me if you had sold it. - A.

            . I am servant to Mr. Lane, 135, Drury-lane. On Tuesday afternoon the 7th of July the prisoner came to sell two tea spoons; I told him there was Hatchett's hotel on them; he said was there. He desired me to let him look at them; no, said I. I turned round to get my hat, and the prisoner went out of the shop. I pursued him as far as Brydges-street, Covent Garden, and then I laid hold of him; he said do not say any thing. I then took him to Bow-street.</p>

On Saturday August the 22nd at one o'clock I was coming from the first floor to the shop; I discovered the prisoner with some part of the harness on the bend of his left arm; he was in the act of taking down the bridle and the reins when I called to him; part of the reins was on his arm, and part on the ground. I had passed it two minutes before, and then it was hanging on the pegs. I called halloa, then he dropped it; I ran to the door and gave an alarm to my neighbours.

            . I am a carver and gilder, I live opposite Mr. Westall. On the 22nd of August I was standing at my door; hearing Mrs. Westall calling particularly loud I looked towards the door, I saw the prisoner drop part of the reins, I ran after him, he took up Angel-court, I brought him back immediately. I lost sight of him for a minute and a half, when he turned the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after he first began to run, was it before you took him back to the shop. - A. Not more than six minutes. I am positive he is the man that dropt these things upon Mrs. Westalls alarm and run away.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Situated as I am and impeached with so serious a crime as this, and being the first time I ever was before a court, I am obliged to trouble the court with a written defence. I am a painter by trade. On the day afternoon of the mentioned in the indictment went to Mr. Quin, Angel-court, to borrow a brush which I wanted to use that day; as I went through the court I heard a cry of stop thief; there was a man past me in full speed; at the moment I had not the idea to stop him, if I had it would have been prevented me from being tried, and had I thought I should have been tried for this offence, I would have taken him. I went to the top of the court to see what was the matter; I saw several people, but I saw nothing of the man; therefore I returned to my acquaintances abode. On my return I was met by two men and charged with the theft. This is a simple state of the fact, and I hope your enlightened minds will be cautious if in this great populous city one person is to be mistaken, or to be taken in custody for another. I solemnly declare I never saw my prosecutrix till I was brought to her; nor I never was in her house. Therefore I hope for my acquital, to be restored to my family.</p>
               <p>Q. to Bushnan. At the time that you were pursuing this man, did you find any man running before him, upon the cry of Stop thief. - A. No, that you may rely on. There was another person that went round another way to meet him, as he was coming out of the court.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar. - A. Yes, on Saturday the 22nd of August, about a quarter before five in the afternoon, he presented a check upon Messrs. Prescott and co. to me; I produce it; I have had it ever since. I suspected that it was not the hand writing of Mr. Griffiths, I shewed it to another clerk; then I was satisfied that it was not a good one. I took him into the back office and asked him from whom he had it; he said he had it from Mr. Soames, a hatter in St. John-street; I asked him if he lived with Mr. Soames, he said he did.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160049"/>Q. What did you do with the prisoner. - A. It was desired that he might be detained; I went to Mr. Griffiths in Houndsditch and made some discovery; I then asked the prisoner the number of Mr. Soames house in St. John-street; he hesitated, he said he did not know. He then said that he did not live with Mr. Soames, but that he had the check of a gentleman in Bartholomew-lane, whom he did not know and that this gentleman desired him to say that he came from Mr. Soames. I asked him how he was to meet the gentleman, and how he was to give him the money; he said he was to take the money to an eating house in Bartholomew-lane and there meet the gentleman. I went with him to the eating house; there were several persons sitting there, he looked about, but he did not fix upon any person; one person sitting asked him who he was looking for, he answered Mr. Soames. Upon leaving the house I asked him if he lived with any person in the neighbourhood; he answered that he lived with Mr. Simpson in Coleman-street; I told him he must go with me there. In passing the bank he said he did not work for Mr Simpson, but that he lodged with him, he worked with Mr. Dutton in Bartholomew-lane; we were in sight of Mr. Dutton, he was standing at his shop door. I then desired the prisoner to write his name, he wrote

               <p>Q. Had you been drinking. - A. I had one pint of beer, no more.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be out so late at night. - A. I had been out upon business, and a friend of mine detained me some time. The prisoner at the bar accosted me; she spoke to me, or I to her, I am not certain; I believe she spoke first. We walked on together; when she told me she had been seduced by a gentleman who brought her from the country. We walked on a bit till we came to a yard, we walked down there, I there gave her a shilling, she saw me take the money out of my pocket, out of a small bit of newspaper. I put the remainder into my pocket and hearing a noise in the house, we stopped to hear what it was about, and during that time she took my money out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. You felt her hand in your pocket. - A. I did not. I never saw my money after I put it in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you miss it. - A. A very few minutes after; the watchman came up; and as soon as the watchman came up she said it was her uncle, and if he saw her with any body he would not speak to her again, and her aunt would turn her out of doors, and she a poor girl out of the country what could she do; she begged me to leave her; it was Hanover-yard we were in. I considered with myself what was the best to do; I was determined to go with her. I was for turning to the right hand, where I saw a watchman at the corner of Rathbone-place; she saw him as well as me, and refused to go. I immediately accused her of the crime; she said she knew nothing of it. I told her she had picked my pocket and insisted upon her returning it immediately, or I would give her into the charge of the watchman; she walked on about the midway to the box, at the corner of Rathbone-place, Tottenham-court-road, when a woman came towards her; she held her hand out towards her to give her something; I held her hand and would not let her. We were going on a little way farther, then she said she insisted upon going home; this I refused, and immediately called the watchman. The watchman came, and the sergeant of the night; when she saw them coming she dropt the two guineas behind her; the watchman was just soon enough to see her drop the two guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear them fall. - A. No. she stooped very low; the ground was dirty, you could not very well hear; the sergeant of the night picked it up; said he, it is two guineas. I said to the watchman it is my money. He asked her what property she had of mine; she gave up a shilling, two sixpences, and five pennyworth of halfpence from her hand; he then took her to the watchouse. There she denied any knowledge of the two guineas. The constable of the night told her to turn out her pockets, which she did; on her pockets being turned out there was a hazel nut, which I had in my pocket for a year and a half, and likewise the splinter of a pencil; the pencil had come undone in my pocket. The constable of the night asked me if it was mine, and when I turned out my pocket, I found the splinter that matched it, and likewise the pencil. This is the pencil, and the constable has the two remaining pieces; one that came out of my pocket and that which came out of her pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you suppose that she throwed the two guineas away. - A. I had hold of her, because she should not make her escape, and I saw her stoop.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you lose. - A. I lost two guineas, a shilling, two sixpences, and five pennyworth of halfpence.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER M'DONALD. I am sergeant of the night in Marylebone. I saw her stoop down, and I picked up the two guineas.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The splinters of the pencil matches; I have no doubt of it being mine.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He asked me would I take any thing, I said no; then he asked me if I would have something to eat. I declined his offer; he put his hand in his pocket and gave me a shilling and two sixpences and some halfpence, and some nuts came with it; I did not wish to accept the money, I was wishing him a good night; he stopped me, he said if I would go with him he would get a bed for him and me for half a crown or three shillings; he insisted upon my going with him. I would not he took very indecent liberty with me in the street, I begged him not to behave so rude to me; he made use of very improper expressions and asked me for what purpose did I think he gave me the money.</p>

On Monday the 5th of July I took this great coat out of Mr. Standborough's chaise, I hung it in the coffee room upon the curtain. In about an hour afterwards the prisoner came into the coffee room and set himself by the coat; he removed from where the coat was hanging, and presently I saw him take the coat down, tie it up in a handkerchief, and walked out of the room. I followed him with the great coat upon him. Then I gave him in charge of the street keeper.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Monday the 27th of July Mr. Williams gave me in charge of the prisoner. On searching him I took out twenty one pieces from his coat pocket. Tipper has some, that he found in his lodgings; one of the pieces corresponds with the piece he was working.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never denied to Mr. Williams that I had taken the matter in question; I asked him if he did not allow it, he told me he did not; I then told him if I had known his refusal of it, I should not have took it, for journeymen generally do it. I have been a master, and my partners as well as myself never disanulled the custom; I asked Mr. Williams if he meant to send me to prison, he told me yes; I told him I hoped he would think of my family, a pregnant wife and six children. I had a strong recommendation of character to Mr. Williams; I had been only in his service six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. I am bound to ask you whether it is a custom in the trade for such perquisites. - A. Never since I have been in the trade.</p>

               <p>Q. Are there any rooms in that chapel. - A. Yes, two; they are even with the first gallery over the door; one is the vestry and the other the study.</p>

I saw the tongs lying by the side of the drawers very much bent; the shutters of the lower window of the chapel were open, the bolt was very much bent, it appeared that the shutter had been forced. I had fastened them shutters when I left it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any way to get to that study but by getting in the chapel. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing in the morning when you came. - A. Yes, a candlestick and a bowl; nothing else was in my care.</p>

               <p>Q. On the morning of August the 1st were you calling the hour of two behind this chapel. - A. Yes; it was break of day, I observed the shutter of the chapel to be open; I tried the door, that was not fastened. I acquainted the woman that is in care of the chapel, the pew opener; then I got a light and went into the vestry, and found the drawers forced open, and the top quite broken off, and the fender was bent.</p>

            . - Mr. Gurney. We understand sir, you are the minister of this chapel. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you sleep occasionally in that study. - A. I live there on the sabbath day, my residence is five miles from the chapel; I have a bed in the study, in this chapel that I may sleep there on Saturday or Sunday evening, in case of bad weather. There is two galleries to the chapel; the vestry and the study are on a level with the first gallery; I built it for the convenience of going into the vestry, without going into the body of the congregation.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave any bank notes there. - A. There was about three guineas and a half there in the drawer.</p>
               <p>Court. When had you seen this money there. - A. There was always a little money left in the drawer in the vestry, to defray the expences of coals, or any thing that might be wanted; I cannot speak to the money; it was very much under the management of one of the gentlemen of the chapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose candlestick is that. - A. It is mine; there were three tea spoons and a sugar spoon, one of them belongs to me, the others are his mothers.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On Monday the 3d of August, I apprehended the prisoner; I sent a man into public house where he was, to identify him; when the man came out, he immediately followed, and tried to get away. From the description I had of him, I told him that I suspected he had robbed Mr. Huntington's chapel; he said he had not; I took him to the office. In his fob pocket I found the duplicate of the candlestick; I went to the pawnbrokers, and there I found the candlestick; when I came back, I told him I had seen the candlestic, that a person who was in the habit of going to the chapel bad identified it, therefore he must be the person who took them. I asked who was with him, he said it was the lame fidler that was in the public house with him; I asked him what he had done with the bowl, he said he had sold it to a person that kept an ironshop, a few doors from the pawnbroker's; I asked him what he had done with the spoons, he said he knew nothing more than of two spoons and if there were more taken the fidler that was with him had not made him acquainted with it. One of the spoons he said he had given to a girl, who went to pawn it; she immediately came back and said the pawnbroker would not take it in, and a man who was sitting in the same box with him and several others, took the spoon from the girl it was given from one to another he never saw it afterwards, and the other spoon he gave to another woman. He said it was between eleven and twelve o'clock when he went with the fidler, and he broke the drawers open with the poker.</p>

On the 1st of August, in the afternoon, I went to a field adjoining the church; there I saw the church had been stripped of a quantity of lead: a soldier took me to a ditch; I found the lead lay there. I and several of the inhabitants watched from half past nine at night till half past eleven. While I was watching with

            , I heard a cart come into a bye-lane, opposite of where the lead lay. About ten minutes after I heard the cart, I saw a man come into the ditch; he took a piece, and threw it on the bank; he threw out another, and then he put it on his shoulder, and was going across the field with it. Then I sprang the rattle, and all came that were on the watch, and Wood took him. The lead was compared with the lead on the roof; it tallied; I have no doubt but it was the lead. There was about four hundred pound weight in the whole.</p>

When I came to the White Lion, he told me to wait there; I thinking the delay too long, went on to meet him. He told me that he had not got the apples, but he had got something in a field there. I went with him, imagining it was his own, and that he was responsible for the act. I went for it. The people sprang a rattle, and fired a pistol.

On the 15th of August last, between twelve and one o'clock, the prisoner passed by me in Grove Street, with the goose under his arm; it was tied up in a handkerchief. I asked him what he had got there; he replied a goose. I asked him where he got it; he replied he would be d - d if he could tell; he told me it was gave by a woman; afterwards he said he gave a woman half a crown for it. I took him to the watch-house.</p>

            . - I am a carpenter. I was at work by the side of Captain Dobree's field. I perceived them both running as fast as they could; the witness cried out stop thief, I joined in the pursuit; he then did not run above an hundred and fifty yards before we took him by the collar; he said do not collar me, I will go without. As we were coming home, the last witness asked the prisoner where the wet linen was; he said, I am not the man. We went out of the field into the road, till we came to Pound Lane, we went about an hundred yards down; the witness said, I think it is somewhere here where you throwed the linen; he answered, upon my word I am not telling you a word of a story, I saw a man throw the linen over between two trees. The witness left him in my care, and he found the linen exactly where he described it to be.</p>

               <p>JOHN GRIFFITHS. On Saturday the 1st of August, I was sent for to Mrs. Levy's house; I went up one pair of stairs. In the room I saw the prisoner, with another soldier, sitting in Levy's room; he had got a small quantity of rhubarb before him; I believe it was in the scale: she gave charge of him for stealing this bowl; I took them both to the office. The prisoner said in the clerk's office to Mrs. Levy, that he knew the man that stole it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord and gentlemen of the jury, never was a case before a rational jury more to be pitied than mine. My prosecutrix knows well I am not guilty of the crime. I went to her house on the 1st of August, a very unlikely thing for me to do if I was guilty. Mrs. Levy asked me where the tall soldier was, that came to her house; I told her I did not know; she told me if I did not tell her she would have me taken into custody. I told the officer, that

He wished to look at some seals; I shewed him some; he selected some of them; he said his name was Evans, he was a messenger of the Secretary of State's office; the seals were not for him, they were for a gentleman at the Secretary of State's office; he said the two that he selected out he must take to the office, and he would return with the seals or the money.

               <p>Q. Did you go with the prisoner with a couple of gold seals. - A. Yes, by the direction of Hancock, to the Secretary of State's office. As soon as I got into the landing place of the Secretary of State's office, the prisoner took the two seals, and bid me to wait outside while he went in and shewed them to the gentleman in the office. I waited about two minutes, he returned, he said the gentleman was not there, but if I would call at twelve o'clock I should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160055"/>have an answer; then he would either return the seals or the money. I went to the office at twelve o'clock; I could not see the prisoner, nor could I hear any thing of him at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you part with these seals to this man believing that he wanted to shew them to another. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again. - A. On the Friday following at Bow Street.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Knapp. You say you did not see the prisoner afterwards till you saw him at Bow Street; do not you know that the prisoner called at your house with the seals. - A. Yes, but I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Hancock) Did you see him. - A. He called at the other house in the Strand; I was not present. We have two shops, one 63, Charing Cross, and one 127, in the Strand. My master lives there. I heard Mr. Rogers say he did call there.</p>
               <p>Mr. ROGERS. Q. Did the prisoner call at 127, in the Strand. - A. Yes; that was the next day after he had the seals. Then he came mounted upon a very fine horse; I went to the door; he began by explaining himself very politely, that his name was Evans, that he had a couple of seals from my shop at Charing Cross the day previous, that he had procured them by the order of Mr. Nepan, that he had accompanied my servant for the purpose of shewing them to Mr. Nepan at the Secretary of State's office, that when he came there he was gone, and he had not had an opportunity of seeing him since; he described himself as a messenger at the office, that I need not be under any alarm for the safety of the seals, that he should certainly see Mr. Nepan that evening or early in the morning, and that one or both of the seals would be returned or the money. I considered him to be in the situation as he represented himself to be, and upon that I gave him credit for the seals.</p>
               <p>- WOODLAND. I am a porter to the Secretary of State's office.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this man messenger in the Secretary of State's office. - A. Not since I have been there.</p>

On the 24th of August, a little after eight in the morning, I left my watch in the privy, and in less than half an hour I recollected I had left my watch there, I went to the privy, it was gone. The privy is in the yard; there are two gates that open to the road. The prisoner was in the public house that day. I missed my watch about eight o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner. - A. He is a <rs id="t18070916-77-deflabel402" type="occupation">carpenter</rs>

I asked the prisoner if he had seen any thing of my watch, he said he had not, if he had he would give it me; immediately he left the house. In consequence of information, I pursued the prisoner, brought him back; he was searched, and the watch was found upon him. I have known this man eight years, I never heard any thing against him before.</p>

            . On the 24th of August, between seven and eight o'clock, I lost a double Gloucester cheese; a person came in, which took my attention from the window, it is an open window; a child informed me that a boy had taken it. I went out to the door; I could not see him. In about a quarter of an hour I was sent for to Worship Street; there I saw the boy and the cheese.</p>
               <p>BARNARD GLEED. I am a patrol. I was going to Worship Street. I saw the prisoner by the window of Mrs. Moores, and another boy standing in the road; he said to the prisoner Now is your time; they did not see me: the prisoner then went up to the window, and took this cheese; he crossed the road with the cheese to where I was standing, I took him and the cheese to the office, and then I sent for the lady.</p>

            . I am a cabinet-maker; I work for Parrarer, Hatton Wall. I was standing looking at a print in a broker's shop, Cow Cross; the prisoner asked me if I belonged to the shop, he said he had got a deal for sale on his cart; he shewed me the plank, he said it was his own; this was near eleven o'clock in the day on the 12th of August; afterwards he said it was not his own, he was hired to sell it. I gave information to an officer, and then I bought the plank. I asked him what he asked for it, he said half a crown, I told him I would give him 2 s. I cautioned him not to sell the deal unless he came honestly by it, he must face the deal again, for I should be stopped by an officer; he took the 2 s. the officer came up and stopped the deal, and took the man.</p>

               <p>Q.(to Moore) I suppose the quantity of deals that you have in your yard, you cannot miss one piece. - A. Impossible; it is not of the same description as he had in the cart; but we have many hundreds of the same sort in our yard; he had no right to take a deal of that description, it is worth 5 s.</p>

               <p>- BINGHAM. I am shopman to Mr. Sherrlnan. I received a two pound note of the prisoner on the 4th of September, to redeem these things that were in pledge.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met the prosecutor betwixt twelve and one o'clock, he was very much intoxicated. When we came home he gave me a shilling to get something to drink; it was too late then to get something; in the morning, as soon as I could, I went out, about half past four, and when I returned the prosecutor was gone; he gave me a two pound note for being with me.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you give her a two pound note. A. No; I do not believe I had one; I received all the money at Messrs. Drummonds.</p>

I saw him no more from the Monday morning till the Wednesday following. I went to his lodgings; the landlady told me he was gone to Tothil fields to a green stall, a house where he used; when I saw him I asked him the reason he did not return me the change on the Monday evening; he told me he could not let me have it before Thursday morning, he had not changed the note, he had it in his chest; I asked him to return the note, he refused; while I was talking to the prisoner I received information from Ashton that Mr. Hylet had the note.</p>

            . I am a victualler in Tothil-street, Westminster. The prisoner came to my house on the 12th of August, between the hours of seven and eight o'clock, and told me that he was going down to Leiscester to settle; he shewed me the corner of a forty pound note, I saw it was a forty pound note; he said that little score I owe you I will send you up a little present from Leicester and that will satisfy you; I told him I would rather he would pay me, it was five shillings and two pence farthing; he then went out of the door into Tothil-street; he returned again, gave me the forty pound note, said give me the change for it, and take your score; I told him he should call again when he was sober, being so large a note I did not like to change it for him. He was very angry that I would not give him change; he says here is a seven shilling piece, take your score, and give me the forty pound; I said I will not till by and bye. The prisoner left me. In the course of half an hour in comes Ashton and the prosecutor; he asked me if the prisoner had left a forty pound note in my hand. The young man explained to me how he came to have the forty pound note; I believed his story. I went into the parlour to come round to the front door; we found either in the tap room or in the passage the prisoner; the prosecutor came round, and the prisoner and he had a pint of porter together. I said to the prisoner, now if it is agreeable I will give you the change; the prisoner gave me a wink, got up, and went towards my parlour; I followed him; he put his fingers upon the parlour table and said, now, give me the change here; I says, there is something very singular in this, I shall call the young man in the tap room; the young man came; I says is there any money matters between you and Atkins; the prosecutor said I trusted him with a forty pound note to get it changed. I was to lend him ten pounds; he never returned it. I said to the prisoner now is this true; he replied No. I never had a forty pound note of him, and what is more than that, I do not know him. Then I thought it most prudent to take him to Queen-square to have the magistrate's opinion of the note. The prisoner was very unwilling to go; when he was at the office I told the magistrate the same as I have now, he denied receiving the note before the magistrate from the prosecutor; the stock broker came forward to prove that he had paid the forty pound note to Spanton. I produce the note.</p>
               <p>MR. WATSON. Q. Are you a stock broker. - A. Yes. I know the number of the note I gave to Spanton on the 4th of August, it is 4716, it is a forty pound note, I believe that to be the note.</p>
               <p>Spanton. It is that number; I received that note from Mr. Watson; it is mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Spanton lent me the forty pound, on condition of paying him six per cent interest.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

On Wednesday night, I was going my round in Red Lion-market, I saw the prisoner with the till under his arm, when he saw me he ran away, and I ran after him. I caught him about fifty yards distance; when I caught him he dropped the till. I found two seven shilling pieces in it, and a note. I gave it to the officer of the night.</p>

On Tuesday last about twenty minutes before four in the afternoon the prisoner came into our shop to look at some flannels, about a shilling, or fifteen pence a yard; I showed her some at a shilling, she said it was too coarse, she would look at some at fifteen pence; I could not find any of that price. I told her to wait till the young men were disengaged; she waited about a qarter of an hour, I saw her continually watching the young men, I saw her moving a piece of gingham about, but I did not see her take it; I went to the door where there were several customers; I saw the prisoner come out of the shop with the gingham under her arm; I saw it through a hole in her cloak. I informed one of our young men; she went towards Southampton Buildings, she looked at our shop; I believe she saw us; I and the young man followed her into the Grotto pulic-house, Southampton Buildings; she went against the table in the tap room. I picked the gingham up from under the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether that gingham was you master's. - A. I know it was the same that was on the counter; I looked on the counter before I went after her, and it was gone.</p>
               <p>THOMAS OWEN. Q. You are shopman in Mr. Craig's house. - A. Yes. He has no partner. I followed the prisoner with the boy to the public house; directly she entered the tap room she fixed her back against the table; I said to her I think you have got something that belongs to us; she said she thought that she had something of great bulk, but she was afraid to bring it back again; I gave her a push of one side, I saw it drop on the ground; I think it came from under her cloak. The boy picked it up.</p>

               <p>Q. The prisoner I believe <rs id="t18070916-94-deflabel497" type="occupation">keeps an eating house</rs>

                        targets="t18070916-94-defend834 t18070916-94-deflabel497"/> there. - A. Yes. On the 5th of August, about a quarter before four o'clock, I heard a woman of the name of Evans say to the watchman that there was a fire at the cook's-shop; I opened the window, I asked Mrs Evans if she said there was a fire, she said yes, the cook's-shop was on fire, I immediately alarmed the lodgers and servants that the cook's shop was on fire; I then ran down Clements-lane and tried to rush open the door.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you went to the door in Clement's-lane, is that the front or the back door of the prisoner's house. A. It is the back door, I believe; he has an entrance in Clement's-lane and in Boswell court; I tried to force the door, I could not; I returned to Boswell court, crying at the same time Fire and Watch; I went to the front door and got admittance; I then saw at the door in Boswell-court that the stairs were on fire. About this time a watchman came running up Boswell-court, he sprang his rattle, that brought the neighbours around us in a moment; neighbour Stentiford came down with two children; he fetched two pails of water; he forced the door open; I assisted him; he knocked in the pannels of the door with his staff, he went in, and Stentiford and I jumped over the door; he asked for an axe to chop down the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Who provided an axe. - A. Some person, I believe his name is Coombes; he began to chop down the burning stairs, they were burning behind; the moment the door opened the flames burst through the stairs. As soon as the stairs were taken down, I desired somebody to go down and examine where the fire began; Crawford and Stentiford went down; they called Bucklow; then I went down.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there another part of the house on fire. A. Yes; after we got the stairs out we went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe another part of the house in flames. - A. Yes, in the coal cellar I observed a candle burning in the joists, there were three candles placed, but two of them were gone out, under the floor; I have got the things that the candles were standing on (producing them); this is a piece of coal, and a potatoe standing on it; there is a hole in the potatoe in which the candle might be placed; these candles were gone out, the tallow was running over the coals, and the floor over it was scorched very much, but not burnt through. The candle that we found alight had burnt through the floor; we have got the piece of the floor here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. How soon after you broke in the house did you see the prisoner. - A. In about a quarter of an hour; we had put out that fire on the stair case when the prisoner came down. From the time of our bursting open the door till we had extinguished the fire on the stairs, I think it was a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you during that time made a great noise. - A. Yes; I called the prisoner and his wife, supposing she was there, and I called his lodgers; I made as great noise as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. And he did not make his appearance till you had put out the fire in the stair case. - A. No; when he came he seemed desirous of going into the cellar; I took hold of his arm, and asked him how this could happen; he could not speak, but seemed desirous of going down stairs.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you described to him what was in the cellar - A. No, I had not been down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you let him go down stairs. - A. No, Mr. Crawford went down stairs, and I followed him and Stentiford.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was attempting to go down did you prevent him. - A. No, I do not know that any body prevented him; he did not go down.</p>
               <p>Jury. You say you took hold of his arm and asked him how this could happen, did this prevent him from going down. - A. I do not know that prevented him; he was so he could not speak; he seemed to want to go down; Crawford went down, and pointed out these three candles, and he called out Bucklow.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did Gilson come down in the cellar. - A. I never saw him in the cellar, I never saw him but in the shop near the stair case, where the fire was put out.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw these candles in the cellar, what other place besides the stairs was on fire. - A. None as I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other marks of fire in any other place. - A. Yes, in a little place from the stairs, on a plank; it seemed to be a separate fire from the stairs; the firemen tore the board up; the end of the plank is burnt.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see from what part that fire communicated. - A. It appeared to me that some laths which were hanging down from the plaster, there was tallow on them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these laths hanging down when you saw the search on the boards. - A. Yes, between that and the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you tell whether one fire had communicated with the other. - A. By appearance I do not think it could.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in your judgment a separate fire. - A. I think so.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the candles alight in the cellar. - A. In the coal cellar, rather higher than I could reach; I got on a stool that was standing in the cellar, and took down the candles and the coals; the coal was standing on a beam.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the coal from the floor. - A. About six or seven inches; the stool was in the coal cellar, just under the place where the candles were placed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it require a stool to get all the candles. - A. They were all of one height, and near together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing that laid near where the candles were. - A. I did not; there was about a bushel of coals in the cellar.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160062"/>Mr. Fielding: Now, gentlemen, it will be more satisfactory to have the immediate pot pointed out where the candles were found (a model of the premises produced.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. How long have you lived where you reside. - A.(Bucklow.) About five years and one month.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has Gilson inhabited the house that was on fire. - A. I think in September last.</p>
               <p>Q.What did his family consist of. - A. His family consisted of a son, a wife, and two servants.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. When you came into the house you observed the house was on fire. - A. I saw it before I saw the flames then.</p>
               <p>Q. And you say the prisoner came down towards the cellar, and appeared agitated. - A. Yes, very much indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it occur to you as any thing exceeding extraordinary that a man should be agitated when his house was on fire. - A. No, it was most likely.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Have you seen the model before. - A. Yes, I think it is exactly like it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who made the model. - A.

            . - Mr. Fielding. Take this model in your hand, give the jury the specific description of all the parts - first of all the ground floor, hold the Boswell-court front to the jury. - A. This is the Boswell-court front; this is a sash over the door, that was broke.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bucklow. That is the door that Mr. Stentiford and I got in by, we got over the bottom part of the door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Harrison. These stairs that are represented black here, are all down; some of the bottom steps were part burnt, and one of them burned through.</p>
               <p>Q. How many stairs Mr. Harrison does there appear altogether burnt. - A. There were six of them down; I cannot say how many were burnt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Mr. Harrison, when was it when you first saw it, how soon after the fire. - A. On the 5th of September.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The model was not made till then, that is just a month.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q.(to Bucklow.) You understand the description of this model likewise; these stairs were burnt. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now be so good as to look at the place where the laths were broken down below with the tallow upon them. - A.(Witness pointing to the place).</p>
               <p>Q. How far was that from the other fire. - A. A very few inches, two inches.</p>
               <p>Q. From the second fire. - A. No more.</p>
               <p>Q. Now Mr. Bucklow describe the spot exactly where you saw the candle burning, when you got down into the coal cellar. - A. The three candles were placed here, upon the top of that partition; the vacancy between the wall was the height of these rafters, about the heighth of six or seven inches, as I said before, there were three of them burning here, in the coal cellar, about twelve seat from the fire on the stairs; two of them were burnt out, and one was burning; I took it down.</p>

            . Mr. Pooley. Where do you live. - A. I live at No. 4, Boswell-court, about twenty yards from Gilson's door.</p>
               <p>Q. On the morning of the 5th of August was you alarmed. - A. Yes, by a terrible noise, I heard the alarm of fire in the street; I came down into the court; I fetched some water to Gilson's house, when I first went down into the court, I saw the smoke come through the two pair of stairs window of the prisoner's house, that is the first I saw; the windows were shut; after I assisted in carrying water, I got into the prisoners house, the door was broke, as it is in the model, by the assistance of Mr. Stentiford and another man; they broke the other part of the door. Mr. Stentiford went in first, and I went in.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state did you find the stairs. - A. In flames These stairs that are marked black were in flames; then Mr. Bucklow's lad was coming across the shop with a lighted candle in his hand, Stentiford said somebody go down and see whether there is another fire; I took the candle out of his hand and went into the cellar. That is the cellar (pointing to the model), this part is lath and plaister that, is not. I went into this part and saw a candle burning, that is where the candle was burning where my finger is; there are two pieces here where there apparently had been two candles more burnt; there were three pieces of potatoes with coal under them; the coal stood here (pointing to the model,) with a potatoe and a candle burning; I thought it was burnt an inch and a half, but when the board was taken up I saw it was burnt through, and three or four other places were burnt on that spot; it was burnt with a candle, and I saw the fire at the stair case.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a third place, did you observe any laths broken down. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was upon the laths. - A. That I cannot say, till I saw them with the fireman afterwards; then I saw a piece of tallow grease sticking on one end of the laths. The fire in the cellar was four yards from the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the fire from where the laths were burnt - A. I saw no laths burnt, the beam was burnt where the laths were hanging down; I suppose that was about a quarter of a yard.</p>
               <p>Q. As far as you can judge from the appearance of that fire, where the laths were, and the beam was burnt; was there any apparent communication with that on the stairs. - A. I cannot say; there was a light fixed here, where the stairs was burnt.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was it that saw the prisoner after you first went to the house - A. I saw Gilson in about ten minutes, as near as I can guess. The fire was got under before ever I saw Gilson; I saw him after I had been in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you hear any person call out for Mr. Gilson, before the fire was put out. - A. That I cannot say.</p>

            . - Mr. Fielding. Where do you live. - A. I live at No. 14. Old Boswell-court, next door to Mr. Gilson. On the 5th of August last, a little before four o'clock, I was alarmed by the cry of fire and a knocking at the door, saying Stentiford get up or you will be burnt; I immediately went up and fetched two of my children down four pair of stairs. I brought them cut into the street and returned into my own cellar and got two pails of water.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any pump in the court. - A. There is about two yards from his house I went to the door which the watchman was forcing, he forced the glass and the shutters of the prisoner's door in; I threw in the two pails of water on the fire, seeing it on a blaze; I directly called for a hatchet and cut down the stairs which had a communication to my house; formerly it was one house I stood throwing water on to extinguish the fire. Mr. Crawford that brought me water, said he would go into the cellar and see what is there; hearing him call Bucklow, I ran down and perceived a light burning. This<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160063"/>is the light that was burning (producing it); it is a candle stuck upon a potatoe, upon a piece of coal, just as you see it now.</p>
               <p>Q. Show us where you saw that candle burning. - A. I saw the potatoe with the candle between this joist (pointing to the model) that hole was burnt the wood was quite red at that place, the other was only burnt. The other two candles were both gone out and had run down what it rested on. There were two laths hung down, they found some grease upon them, seemingly as if a candle had been stuck there and above it, it was burnt to a round hole, seemingly through the board.</p>
               <p>Q. Where that round hole was burnt how far was it from the stairs. - A. Ten or twelve inches, as well as I can say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any communication between that fire and the fire on the stairs. - A. There was no communication whatever, it was clear and distinct from that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that fire in your judgment where the laths were compleat and distinct from the stairs. - A. It was, to the best of my judgment, from the appearance that I saw. I saw the prisoner coming through the door of the shop from Clement's-lane as I was descending into the cellar, I saw him come about half way in the shop, he did not go into the cellar, as I understood; he was upon the top of the cellar stairs when I came up.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him, when he came up from the cellar, what did he do. - A. He was standing looking at it, I said, I should take him in custody on suspicion of setting fire to his house. He had his clothes on, I think he had his apron in his hand, but I cannot say whether he had or not; he was compleately dressed in other respects only without his hat. From what I saw I immediately gave him in charge of the watchman on suspicion of setting fire to his house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. I believe that after the alarm was given first, the prisoner at the bar came as soon as he could from the situation he was in. - A. I do not believe it; there were several people there before he came.</p>
               <p>Q. That may be, he but came. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At the moment you saw him you said you would take him in custody. - A. No, never till I saw the candle burning.</p>
               <p>Q.He was in the house then. - A. He was in the house, and he went half way along from the back door to the cellar stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. You have described that there were two other candles burning. - A. There were</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon you to swear that they had been burning that night. - A. I can swear it, the grease was running down, and the boards were hot at the time, the place was hot; at the time where the two other candles were, it was extinguished, and the boards over it were warm.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. When you first saw him you did not say you would take him in custody. - A. No, I was sorry for the man, it was on suspicion of seeing the candle burning and nothing else.</p>
               <p>Jury. How high is the house. - A. Four story high; he came down from off his own leads, through a back door.</p>
               <p>Court. He cannot tell how he came dow stairs.</p>

               <p>Q. After it was extinguished did you go down stairs. - A. No, not till we returned from the watchhouse; then I went down into the coal cellar, I got up upon a bench and saw were the candle was burning, but there had been candles placed in four or five places, the candles had been placed between the second and third joist. I found a bundle of chips and paper, there were several potatoes cut in two, but one with a hole in it which I produce. It was exactly over the dust hole, which is under the cellar stairs, and the cellar stairs are under the stairs that were on fire; it was a little black, it appeared to come from a candle, but there was no grease there.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see Gilson. - A. I saw him as soon as some gentlemen and Mr. Bucklow come out of the cellar and called for him to be secured; I turned round Clement's-lane and met them and went to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Gilson dressed. - A. He had all his cloaths on; I believe his apron was across his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his waiscoat buttoned. - A I think it was.</p>

Up two pair of stairs; I went up stairs to bed first, my fellow servant next, and my master with the till under his arm; he seemed to go into his own room, and I bid him good night.

He hallowed out as loud as he could, and told the watchman to spring his rattle, or we should all be burned. Then I was very much alarmed, I set down and put my things on. I do not know what became of him then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. At the time you were putting on your clothes he went down the other house. - A. Yes, and I lost him, I did not see him any more. I went down that way.</p>

I live at No. 5. opposite the prisoner's house; I saw the the prisoner stand upon the leads, about a quarter before four. On the 5th of August, as I looked out of the window, the watchman sprang his rattle, I saw a smoke and a man upon the leads, at the top of the house; he was going by the side of the chimney; we begged of Gilson to come down and open the door, he said he could not come down, the stair case was on fire; he had a night cap on his head, and his jacket on. I saw him come out of his own door, that comes into Clement's-lane, with a sack on his left shoulder, and a box under his arm, he staggered very much, as if he had got something of great weight; he pitched the sack and the box on the ground next door to Mr. Bucklow's and I saw no more of him</p>

This end was close against the joist, over against where the laths were broke; this place was on fire; that candle had been alight, there is the scorch of it where the candle candle went out; the hole that was burned was quite warm. These are the laths that I took down, where this board had been taken off, there was a great deal more grease upon them at that time.

On the 20th of August I went to Covent Garden market; I got rather more goods than one woman could carry; the prisoner stood by, she agreed to take part, I was to give them eight pence between them, one load was more than the other; they agreed to change loads at Newport-market pitch; after they had rested there they set off again; when I got to my shop I turned to assist them down with their load; the prisoner was missing. The other basket woman and me looked for her and could not find her; from information I found her at a public house in St. Giles's intoxicated; I asked her what she had done with my things, she said she had lost them; I never found what she had done with them. I went with her to Newport-market pitch; she asked me to treat her, I would not; she said she knew my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160066"/>way; I went on and thought she was following.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she sober when you hired her. - A. Yes.</p>

When I was a servant, I lived in Castle-street, Falcon-square, I left my place to go to Hornsey; and left my box in the prisoner's care some time the latter end of June. Being destitute of clothes, I came to town on the 7th of August; not finding my things as I left them, I left my box locked and corded; but I left more clothes that were not locked fast; when I enquired for them, she said she had pledged them; distress had drove her to do it; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160068"/>should have them in a week or a fortnights time.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them said that. - A.Elizabeth Davis; the box was left in her care. She sent me them things according to her promise. Being unable to search my box when I fetched it from her house, I did not miss any thing directly. When I missed the things, I sent to her directly.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after that you missed them. - A.Three days; she said she knew nothing about them; I sent to her; then I came to town in a fortnight before I was able; I had laid in. Afterwards Davis owned she took them out of the box, and that Dent had part of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Davis, the woman. - A. I do not know, her husband is a glass cutter; they lived in Nelson's-passage, Arthur-street, Goswell-street. I do not know what the other woman is; the things that were pawned the pawnbrokers gave them up. I lost a one pound bank note and a half a guinea out of my box.</p>

It was about eleven o'clock at night when I missed the money as we were in bed together; she said somebody was throwing stones at the window, she got out of bed several times. I got up; I saw the rule lay out of my breeches; I pulled the purse out of my pocket, then I missed the eight guineas and a half and the seven shillings; there were two one pound notes, she left them in the purse; I searched her, I could not find any of my property. When I went into the house it was ten o'clock, I saw Rigby there: he kept the house. Going home I met him; I told him I had been robbed, he said he knew nothing about it, he had got none of my money. There was a young man came with me from Waltham Cross.</p>

            . I am a harness maker; I live in Worship Street. On the 27th of August, about half past eight in the morning, Mr. Dagley's servant came to me, requesting I would lend his master a harness, he informed me that his master's premises had been broken open; I lent him a harness. About half an hour after he was gone, I saw a person coming down Curtain Road, with a harness on his back, he came to my shop, and asked me if I bought such things; I told him I had suspicion that he had stole it, he said his master gave it him; he told me his master was at the corner of the street, I took him to the corner of the street for him to shew me his master, he could not find him; then he clung hold of the railing, and wanted to get away; I secured him; I took him to the public-house in Worship Street: I searched him, I found this tinder-box with tinder in it; I found a steel upon him, he said he had it to light his pipe with it, and he was a shoemaker, he heated his tools with it. The man that he represented to be his master, is a man of a very bad character.</p>

             for victuals and instructions. I had been with him about three weeks to instruct myself in shoemaking. We worked in a stall, therefore it is necessary to have a light, I put the matches and tinder-box into my pocket, and just as I was going to open the stall, he wanted me to go with him to dispose of the said harness; thinking it was his own property, and knowing that he had a horse once, I went with him; he went into a shop in Old Street, he came out and said they could not agree for the price; my master sent me into this shop in Worship Street; there I was stopped; I told Mr. Botts my master was out of doors; when I came out he was gone, and since I have heard he has absconded.</p>

               <p>- READ. I am apprentice to Mr. Harrington. The prisoner came into the shop about the 25th of August, between six and seven o'clock, and ordered two trunks and a box for Captain 
               <persName id="t18070916-114-person1003">Crawford</persName>

             engraved on a plate and put on one of them; I took it home at ten o'clock the next morning, he was not there, I am sure he is the person. When I returned from Mrs. Crawford's, the prisoner was in our shop; he told me to call at two o'clock, I did not call till four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enquire if Captain 
               <persName id="t18070916-114-person1005">Crawford</persName>
             lived there. - A. He only lived there when in town.</p>

             to Russia; I was in the habit of purchasing what he wanted; knowing he wanted this trunk and box, I purchased them, and sent them to Sheerness; the ship sailing prevented me from sailing with him.</p>

He offered them to me; I told him I should have no objection to buying them, if he could refer me to any honest tradesman that he bought them of; he said he received them in part of payment for his wages; he said his master's name was Jackson, that he lived in Surrey. Not believing him, I took him to the office and searched him, on his person I found a pair of plated spring hooks, three balls of hemp, five skins, and a pair of clams. I received information that he had sold a dozen of thongs to Mr. Judd, in the Strand, I went with the prosecutor, and there I found the thongs. I found another skin and a razor in his lodgings.</p>

            . I live at No. 5, Union Street, Middlesex Hospital. On the 11th of July, near dusk, me and another young woman stood at the door; she asked him if he would walk in, he came into her apartment; he sent her servant out with a shilling to get something to drink. After that he went into my apartment; he gave me a 20 l. note for myself, he sent it out by my servant to get it changed, she brought in the change, I told her to give them to the gentleman, he told her to give them to me, and told me to lock them up, that I might not lose them; he staid with me that evening. On Sunday morning he and I, and a Miss Row, rid in a one horse chaise to Brentford; he staid with me that evening when he came home.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you set off for Oxford. - A. On the Tuesday morning. My friends live there. We went in a one horse chaise; we got to Oxford on the Wednesday, he was taken on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid your expences to Oxford. - A. The prisoner. The officer asked me if I had any property, I said yes, it was at my mother's house, and I would fetch it. I went to my mother, she lives at Oxford, I fetched him 15 l. I told him I had laid out 5 l. I told the officer I did not know it was not his own money.</p>

When I arrived at Sheerness, I received 47 l. four 10 l. notes and seven ones; they were Bank of England notes; the prisoner was with me, and saw me receive the money.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did he receive. - A.Between three and four pounds. We came together in one boat to town, and we lived together at the Dundee Arms; then from there we went to Mrs. Hill's, <placeName id="t18070916-120-crimeloc643">123, Wapping</placeName>

               <p>Q. When you arrived there, had you these four ten pound notes and seven ones in your waistcoat pocket. - A. Yes, I felt them when I was in bed, about two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160072"/>o'clock I had my dinner, they were all safe, then I fell asleep.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you been drinking. - A. No, I had only one pint of porter after my breakfast. Between four and five o'clock I awoke, I observed a letter that was wrapped round my money, and my invaliding ticket, they were laying on the bed; the handkerchiefs that I had in my pocket were both taken out, all my cloaths were scattered about, and my money was taken out of my pocket; the wool was taken out of my wooden leg to see if there was any thing there.</p>
               <p>Q.What money had you in your pocket. - A. Five or six shillings, and some half-pence; in short, they left me nothing. When I had found every thing was gone, Mrs. Hill brought me up some tea, I told her of the robbery, she told me not to alarm myself. Presently after I saw the prisoner; he was charged with the robbery; he denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or any body tell him it would be better for him to confess. - A. Not that night; he went out, and stopped out all night; he came the next morning, and was put in the charge of the police officer; then he denied it; he desired Mrs. Hill to give me 30 l. she did not, as it was a robbery done in her house.</p>

The prisoner and another black man were together; I asked them whether they had any money, the prisoner replied he had but 8 l. and he was capable of taking care of it himself.</p>

            . Q. You are clerk at the Thames Police Office. - A. Yes. The first account that the prisoner gave, which was voluntary, was, that he received three 10 l. notes of a captain of a vessel at Cork in Ireland for his wages in last December. He was asked by the magistrate, whether the notes then produced were those identical notes that he received of the captain, he said they were; on examining the notes it appeared that one was dated subsequent in April. On another examination, he gave the account to the magistrate of 15 l. he had received of a captain of a ship, and a pig, for his wages; he afterwards said that he received the money in Scotland; this was at three different examinations.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I cannot speak good English, if I could I could speak what I please; well, I was with my captain, sir, three voyages, and I never had a copper of him. This last voyage I came to Scotland, I was going to the West Indies, I scalded my leg, I was sick, the captain turned me on shore in Ireland; what little money I brought on shore, I spent it all. When signal was making for the ship to sail, I wrote a letter to my captain; he came to me; I said, Captain, I want some money, I am very bad with the rheumatism; I said I had been three voyages with him, twenty-one months. Do you know what I am indebted to you? No, I says; he took out ten notes, he said it was 20 l. I told him I did not understand these notes, I wanted change; he said if he gave me all silver I should spend it all, these were better. I took the notes of the captain; he said, I am indebted to you 17 l. and I owe you 3 l. for a pig, and you owe me for blue trowsers, jacket, shoes, and handkerchief; he gave me one single note, that made eleven. I was on board the Trident, guard ship, three months; from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160073"/>there I went on board another ship; I receive three notes at Sheerness. I do not understand the notes.</p>

I did; he was perfectly sober, he would not put his mark till he had twelve shillings for taking out the indictment; I saw him receive twelve shillings; he said he understood Young was guilty, and he thought this girl was innocent, and being all neighbours alike, he said why should he hurt her, he would go out of the way and would not prosecute,</p>

I afterterwards was informed Mrs. Lawrence had lost a watch and five shillingsworth of halfpence.</p>
