Harvey, 15, Sutherland Place, Pimlico"—that is a lodging-house—the prisoner's real name is Robert Douglas Harvey—he gave the name of John Judge, of no fixed abode—he had been at Sutherland Place about three weeks—he was lodging there at the time of his arrest—he was known there as Harvey—next morning he was placed among six other men and identified by Hawes—I first charged him with attempting to obtain the £6—he said he had no cheque, so he could not have obtained the money—he also said, "Had I got the money I was going back to get the cheque"—I did not then know that he was the man who had obtained the money; I knew it had been obtained—when I said attempting to obtain £6 I referred to another charge—when charged with this offence he said it was a mistake, that he had never been to 48, Pimlico Road in his life, and did not know Mr. Hawes—I showed him the cheque—he said, "I have never seen that cheque before."</p>

Warner Street—Gregory called me, and I saw Williams and King—Williams had something under his coat, and said to me, "If you don't go back I will smack you in the eye"—I had seen Williams before—after that I saw King go up Baker's Row with a large brown parcel—I went to see where King had gone, but saw nothing of either of them—King was walking quick, I knew him before—I know Brook but I did not see him—I went</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P. I am Assistant Medical Superintendent of the Isleworth Infirmary—on December 3rd a female child was brought to me by Mrs. Cox, the matron of the Infirmary—it had been washed and the umbilical cord had been cut—it was a full<lb/>time child and still alive—I examined it and found a cut two inches long above the right ear, a swelling on the right side of the head and oozing—at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination I found beneath the cut a zig<lb/>zag fracture of the skull three inches acoss the side of the skull—beneath the fracture the brain was practically pulp—a portion of the skull was depressed and there was a certain amount of brain substance external to it at the base of the skull in front of the attachment of the spine—that was a second fracture—in my opinion those fractures could not 'have been caused by the child falling from the body of its mother in the act of delivery, because the first-named fracture was at the side of the head instead of on of where the skull would naturally have come in contact with the ground—there was extensive laceration of the brain beneath the fracture—I came to the conclusion that the injuries had been caused by a blow with some blunt edged instrument—the injury above the ear was the cause of death—beyond the injuries described there was a fracture of the upper ribs on the left side of the body close to their attachment to the spine—in my opinion that was caused by external violence, the child probably had been trodden upon as there was some bruising—when it was first brought in it was very cold from exposure—it got quite warm, but at 3.30 p.m. that day I was called urgently and found it dying, as the result of that first injury.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The child recovered from the exposure—the cause of death was the injury to the head, which might have been caused by a kick not accidentally, but deliberately—I could not say from looking at a fracture whether it was done by an accidental or a deliberate kick—a newly-born child's ribs are cartilage, and a slight pressure would cause them to bend out of shape, and the head would be very soft—I have seen the yard, but I do not think that if the child had fallen on the step of the water-closet it would have caused the injuries—it is possible they might have been caused by the child falling on the edge of the step and the mother, from weakness, falling upon it.—.</p>

Ravenscourt Park, W.—the goods were then claimed by Johnson, and on the advice of our solicitors we did not contest the claim—we have never received any part of our account or any of the costs incurred.</p>

Evans against Mrs. Wilson—I produce the writ dated October 21st, 1901—we got judgment on November 26th—on December 2nd Mrs. Wilson was examined before Master Lawford as to her means, and we then came to the conclusion that we could get nothing out of her—Johnson attended on her behalf—I produce an office copy of her depositions—an attempt was made the same day to garnishee her salary, but we have never got anything.</p>

Evans—at 27, Chancery Lane, I found four receipts for rent at 61, Regent Street—the dates range from August 31st, 1901, to April 24th, 1902.</p>

I am single, and a domestic servant, of Stanley Villa, Finchley—last year I found myself pregnant—I saw an advertisement in <hi rend="italic">The People</hi>, and in consequence I wrote to Claymore House—I subsequently called there and saw Sach—the terms arranged were £1 1s. a week, and £3 3s. a week for a fortnight during the confinement—when I got to Claymore House, Sach asked me what I was going to do with the baby—I said I was going to have it put out to nurse—she said she knew ladies who would adopt it if I would agree—I had seen the words "Baby can remain "in the advertisement—I considered the matter of the adoption—subsequently Sach said she still had ladies who would adopt it if I would agree to it—I afterwards agreed—she said she knew a lady who would adopt it for £30—I asked who the ladies were—she said they did not like the mothers to know their names or where they lived in case at any time the mothers wanted to take them from the ladies who had adopted them, and that I should have to sign a paper giving up all claim to the child—she said they were well-to-do ladies who had no families and wanted children to adopt—I asked her what, the money was for; I thought if the ladies were wealthy ladies £30 would not be wanted and she said the ladies liked to buy presents for the babies—I agreed to pay £30 and asked Sach what clothes I should require—she said I should want a full set, and I made a full set—she said it was not the quantity which was wanted but that they must be very good—she said she kept sets in the house at £3 3s. a set—I said I preferred to make them, and I made them while I was at Claymore House—on Wednesday, November 12th, about 8.30 a.m. my baby was born—Sach attended to me—I had no doctor—the baby was a girl—Sach took it straight away—she just lifted it up for me to see and then took it downstairs to wash it—she brought it back and told me to kiss it good-bye—I did so—it was taken downstairs and I never saw it again—in the afternoon Sach came up and asked me for the paper which I had written out, to give to the lady when she came to take the baby away—I gave it to her and asked her to ask the lady for a receipt, but I never got one—I had written to the father of the child, and by the 14th I had the £30—there were two £10 notes and two £5 notes—I gave them to Sach—I told her that I hoped, the baby would be good and that they would be kind to it—she assured me that they would be very kind—I did not ask</p>

               <p>if the child was in the house then because Sach had told me about five o'clock on the Wednesday that the lady had been down to fetch the child—on Sunday, November 16th I was not so well and asked Sach if I might see a doctor—Dr. Wylie came and saw me—Sach came in with him—he asked what was the matter and examined me—he then turned to Sach and asked where the baby was—she said at once, "Oh, her mother has taken it"—I did not contradict her because I thought she did not let the doctor know all about it—I remember Miss Galley coining and the baby being born on Saturday, November 15th—I heard it crying—on the 16th I heard a knock at the door, and later on I saw Sach when she brought up my breakfast—I said, "You have had an early visitor," and she said, "Yes, the lady has been to take away Miss Galley's baby"—on the Saturday I had asked her if Miss Galley's baby had gone, and she said it was much too cold and damp for the baby to go out, and she said she had sent a telegram to tell the lady to come on the Sunday morning to fetch it—these clothes (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) are some of those I made—this shawl and this flannel gown are what I provided for the child—this is my rent book—I have seen Walters in Sach's kitchen.</p>

I am wife of William Spencer, of 11, Danbury Street, Islington—that house is kept by Mr. and Mrs. Seal, a police-constable and his wife, who take in lodgers, of whom I am one—on October 29th Walters came to lodge there—she told me she had a pension of 15s. a week, and had been a nurse at St. Thomas's Hospital, and that she was going to have baby, which she was going to transfer to a lady—she said the baby was to come from her friend Maude, and she was going to transfer it to a lady at Piccadilly, who was going to give £100 for it, that she was to have 30s. for transferring it, and that the mother of the baby was to get the £100 less the 30s.—she told me that she herself was a widow—she stayed in the house till November 12th, and on that day, between 10 and 11 a.m., she showed me a telegram—this is the original (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "Walters, 11, Danbury Street, Islington, London.

"oor, indeed: if one of yours was as well off"—I asked her if they were pleased with the baby, and she said, "Yes, delighted with it"—I then said something about not having seen the baby before it left the house in the morning—she said she had overheard a conversation between Mrs. Spencer and I in the morning, and that she hated liars and deceit, and that Mrs. Spencer would have to pay for it if it cost her a few shillings—I never heard any cry or sound from the child from the Wednesday night up to Friday morning, and I did not see it except when it arrived—on Saturday morning Walters came down as usual for her newspaper—she took in <hi rend="italic">Dalton's Newspaper</hi>, and about eleven o'clock that morning a telegram arrived which one of my sons took in and took up to Walters—she had old me when she had received the first baby that she expected another and that she would have a telegram about it—she said the second baby was to go to a coast guard at Kensington—on the Saturday, having re<lb/>ceived the telegram, she left the house about 6 p.m., and returned shortly before 10 p.m., bringing another baby—when she showed it to me, I should think it was then a few hours old—she said it was a girl, and was going to the wife of a coast guard at Kensington, that £10 was to be given to Mrs. Sach for it, and that she was to receive 10s. for it from Mrs. Sach.—she then went out for about an hour, leaving the baby with me—I have a neighbour named Mrs. White—I sent for her and we examined the child—we found that it was a boy—when Walters returned I was warming the child in front of the fire—she appeared agitated and said, "You have not undone the baby, have you?"—I said, "No"—she took it from me and I saw it no more that night—on Saturday night or Sunday morning I heard a child's cry—on Sunday morning I passed Walters' door, and she asked me if I had heard the baby crying in the night, and if it had disturbed me—I said it had not—I did not see the child on the Sunday—the last time I heard it cry was at 4 a.m. on Monday—it cried loudly then—in the morning Walters asked me if I had heard it cry in the night, and I said I had heard it cry at 4 a.m.—she said the child had a cold, and she should not take it away that day—I did not see the child on the Monday, but about 9 a.m. on Tuesday I saw Walters leave the house carrying a bundle wrapped up in a shawl—I immediately afterwards went to her</p>

                  </hi>, F.R.C.S. I am a Master in Surgery—on November 21st I made a post-mortem examination on the body of a male child in the presence of Dr. Caunter, the acting divisional police surgeon—I came to the conclusion that the child was only a few days old; the body was well nourished and free from disease—there were no marks externally, except some swelling of the right cheek and temple, which was most likely due to the use of forceps at the time of delivery—the child was full time; its hands were tightly clenched; that suggested an asphyxial death; the larynx was considerably congested, and there was congestion of all the organs of the body; the membranes of the brain were congested—those indications suggest death from asphyxia—there were some small spots of hemorrhage on the surface of the lung, which was still more conclusive—the toes were turned down in a similar condition to the hands—there was no doubt the child died from asphyxia and suffocation—the possible cause of the asphyxia was the taking of any narcotic drug which had opium or morphia as a constituent—morphia is derived from opium—the primary effect of a narcotic drug on a child of very tender days of life would be to send it to sleep—that might be the only effect according to the dose; the further</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190301120052"/>
               <p>effect would be continued insensibility, from which the child could not be awakened—the next would be the action of the poison upon the nerve centre in the brain and also directly upon the circulation of blood to the heart and lungs, and it would cause the lungs to become choked and so impede the respiratory organs, when death would result—sometimes narcotics produce convulsions, and are very likely to do so in young children—con<lb/>vulsions might kill the child at once by asphyxia, of which the narcotic would be the occasioning cause—I heard the noise made by Mrs. Spencer in Court; assuming that she correctly represented the sound, I should say that they were the child's dying gasps, and that is consistent with the administration of a narcotic—I am familiar with chlorodyne—one of its constituents is chloroform, and it smells strongly of it; morphia is also one of its constituents—I should say that two drops of chlorodyne would be fatal to a child of this age—it is a patent medicine—I am judging from the dose which is recommended to adults, the maximum dose being thirty drops—it states on the bottle ten to thirty drops—I have never prescribed it—people take it for diarrhoea—the proportion of the drugs in it is not stated—I should say it ought not to be given to a child of this age except under medical advice, and then in infinitesimal quantities—if the child was suffering intense pain it might be advisable to give it a dose of some form, but not that form of chloroform, because it is a patent medicine—if a child was crying, and, therefore, thought to be a nuisance, it might be given in a way as other sedatives are—I did not form any precise opinion as to how long the child had been dead, it was a question of a few days at the most—Dr. Caunter had previously made an examination, but the body was perfectly fresh for examination, there was nothing to prevent my making a reliable examination—there was no food in the stomach or small intestines—I should say the child had not been fed for many hours before its death—unless the child had taken food and vomited it, I don't think it had been fed within twelve hours, and there were no signs of its having vomited—there was a large bruise in and under, the back of the scalp—I think that might have been caused by the forceps in delivering the child—there are two blades to the forceps, and one would grasp it in front and the other behind—it may have been caused by some other pressure, or by a blow; but more likely by pressure on account of the width of the bruise—there had been no operation for hernia rupture—a surgeon would not operate on a baby a few days old for hernia unless it was strangulated—a patient who had been operated on for hernia would not be allowed to move after it, he would be confined to bed for a fortnight or three weeks—a very small quantity of chloroform would be required to make a child of this age insensible—it would probably go off in less than a minute—if a child had been put under chloroform for an operation it would not be allowed to be moved while still under the anaesthetic: it would be ex<lb/>ceedingly unwise and even dangerous for the child—it would be dangerous to take it out while under the influence of an anaesthetic, whether it had had an operation or not—if a child as young as this one, was required for a long operation, and had to be kept under chloroform for some time, it would be allowed to come round a little and then go off again, and in that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190301120053"/>
               <p>way it might be kept sufficiently insensible for an operation for one and a-half hours, or even longer—it is nonsensical to say that this child would awake at 5.30 if it had undergone an operation before three o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STEPHENSON</hi>. The child might be sleepy or drowsy after an anaesthetic, but it would depend on how it was given—my opinion that two drops of chlorodyne would be fatal to a child of this age is not based on my experience, but upon what I read upon the bottle; but I know what the general effect of it is—if the two drops were dilute it would take longer to absorb; if it was put in a baby's bottle the effect might be less, as the child would probably not take the whole bottle, and so would not get the whole of the drug—in those circumstances it might not be fatal—chlorodyne is a very powerful sedative—I do not think the mark on the head had anything to do with the cause of death, because there was a considerable amount of blood extravasated under the scalp—there was none inside the skull, and that is why I thought the mark was due to pressure and not to a blow.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi>

If the two drops of chlorodyne had been given to the baby in a bottle of milk and had proved fatal, I should have expected to find milk or the remains of it in the stomach and the small intestines; but they were both quite empty—it is quite possible that death may have been caused by other means than a narcotic, such as the direct interference with the passage of air into the lungs.</p>

On November 18th, I was acting divisional surgeon of police, and was called to the station to see the body of the de<lb/>ceased—I agree with Mr. Pepper in all particulars except one, and that is that I think the injury to the back of the head was not due to forceps, unless they were put on and taken off again and then put on again; but was assured that was not the case—I agree with Mr. Pepper that that had nothing to do with the death—I think the injury to the head was due to severe pressure, if it had been done by a blow I think there would have been marks externally as well as between the scalp and the skull—I saw the body at 11 a.m. on the 18th—I should say it had then been dead from eight to twelve hours, and I should think it was nearer the twelve than the eight—the body was still warm—I think it could not have been dead much longer than twelve hours.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a news agent, of 67, Great Ormond—on December 6th I was in the Mechanic public-house, and Pipe came in and spoke to me—he was a stranger, but I treated him and several others—he went out, and came back and beckoned me to the door saying,</p>

               <p>"ome on, old boy"—when I got outside he said, "Come to my place; I live just here in Sidmouth Street"—he put his arm round my neck and attempted to pick my pocket—Hicks came up and knocked me down, and put his hand over my mouth while Pipe tore my trousers pocket and took my purse containing £1 8s.—Hicks made several kicks at me—I got his hand away from my mouth and shouted for help—he hit me and kicked me on my jaw and fractured it—I was a little deaf before the assault—I had not seen Hicks in the public-house—the police took me to the Royal Free Hospital—I picked the prisoners out at the station from several others, and am quite sure they are the men.</p>

                  </hi>, I live at 96, Browning Road, East Ham, and am now a draper's assistant—in October, 1899,1 saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> for a man and wife to manage a milk business—I answered it and got a reply, and came up to London from Walthamstow—I went to the office of Messrs. Abbott and Co., 79, New Oxford Street, and saw both defendants there—I said I had come in reference to their letter, and asked what my duties would be—Payne said, "My milk business which I shall want you to manage is at 4, City Road, Birmingham"—he said there were six rounds, and he was doing a fair business there—he also said he had two other businesses in Birmingham—Abbott said he had known Payne for a number of years as an honourable man who had a large dairy farm at Dowles Farm, Budeley, and a lovely looking place overlooking the Severn—Abbott said he had been there for rabbit shooting—Payne asked me if I was prepared to invest £100 in shares in the Farmers' United, Limited—I said I was prepared to do so—I went down to Birmingham where Payne promised to meet me, but he did not turn up—I saw the premises at 4, City Road, Birmingham, but I did not see any books, and I came away—after I returned to London I wrote to Payne, and received this answer (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "October 27th, 1899, Dowles Farm, Budeley: Dear Sir, Messrs. Abbott and Co. will post your agreement to-night and you will receive it to-morrow morning. Kindly let me know by early post if it is satisfactory, and what time you will be prepared to meet me on Monday, and oblige.—Yours truly, E. M.

               <p>businesses in Birmingham—the milk came to me in churns from the station, but it went through their hands first, and they had the opportunity of taking the labels off—some of it came from the Chetwynd Mills and Creamery Co.—before I went to Birmingham Payne told me his son was managing the business there—I gave notice to leave before the supply of milk stopped, because I saw the thing was a complete fraud and was losing money from the first day I went there—there was nothing to pay the three men and myself with—we started selling about 35 gallons a day at 3d. a quart, and it dropped down to 17 or 18 gallons a day, and in December it stopped altogether—after the business stopped I met Payne at Birmingham railway station and told him I was wasting my time, and asked him if he was going to pay me my wages—he said, "I am going to see if I can open up the business again; you shall have your salary all right if you will only wait"—in January I went with my wife and saw Payne at the Colonade Hotel, Birmingham—my wife charged him with being a thief, swindler and fraud, and she said she would go to Budeley with him as she was not going to starve—he aid, "Will you have any money to be going on with?"—she said, "Yes." and he gave her a £10 note and gave us some acknowledgment that he still owed us £90, to be paid on March 8th—in the meantime I was to go on trying to work up the business in the City Road, and he gave me this docu<lb/>ment, "olonade Hotel, New Street, Birmingham, January 23rd, 1899, I hereby agree to give Mr. Mustill 30s. per week wages, provided he does his best to improve the City Road business, and having this day given him £10, I agree to give him £90 on March 8th next, or at any previous time if the business is sold"—I then made another attempt at the City Road—he sent about 12 gallons of milk a day and some eggs and butter—that supply continued for a week or ten days and then ceased—in March the churns, trucks, &amp;c., on the premises were all taken away and sold at public auction—they were taken by some men from the Main Street business—that was another shop of Payne's—no notice was served upon me—I knew the men and thought they were justified in taking the—thing's away—after that I consulted my solicitor—I got back another £10, making £20 altogether, out of which I had to pay my solicitor—I did not try to sell my shares—the company was afterwards wound up—I returned to London on April 1st and called on Abbott in New Oxford Street—I there saw a similar placard to that at Birmingham announcing the sale of utensils, &amp;c, of the Farmers' United. Limited—I asked him if he knew what sort of man Payne was, and said he was nothing more than a swindler and a fraud—he said, "I have not found him altogether straight with me," and he opened a drawer and showed me a cheque with which he had tried to save Payne's furniture—I said, "If I had a £10 note or two I would go for you; you knew very well the position he was in, and the business at the time I took it was on the verge of bankruptcy"—he said it was an undesirable thing for him to touch upon, and I said, "You have even got the bill stuck up for the sale of the things; you know the thing is a complete swindle and fraud, and you bought the utensils within two or three days of my parting with my money"—ho then said he had an appointment to keep—that was the last I saw of him till this case came on—I called several times after that, but</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190301120059"/>
               <p>could not find him—I went back into the drapery business of Messrs. Hunt and Co., Hammersmith, and Payne came in one day as a customer—I called him a thief again and accused him of stealing my money—he asked me to be quiet and not shout so much—I said, "Such men as you ought to be shown up"—he bought what he wanted and departed, and has not been in since—when I left the business £24 was due to me for wages—I borrowed the money which I invested in Payne's business—at the time I parted with it I believed the business to be genuine—I did not know Payne was an undischarged bankrupt.</p>

Marshall Payne," not under seal—there were two other businesses in Birmingham, one in Main Street and one in Ethel Street, the headquarters—they were substantial businesses—Payne said the City Road business required working up—he did not say it was not paying—at Payne's suggestion I went to Birming<lb/>ham to see the business before parting with my money—I found the books were not up to date, and they had not a secretary—I took Payne's son's word that the business was financially sound—after that I paid the first £49—I went to Birmingham again on November 6th, and stayed there about a week before I took over the business—I did not go to the business during that time—I was told not to interfere, and I did nothing at all that week—I do not think it was a bogus business—we were selling the milk at the market price—I had to account to Mr. Payne, junr., for the takings, and sent in a daily report—I never refused to do so—I never kept the men waiting for their supplies—Mr. Payne never complained to me that I was—not running the business properly—he did live at Dowles Farm—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is a catalogue of the sale of utensils and produce there on January 12th, 1900—Payne complained of my paying a woman 2s. 6d. a day to clean up, and of my allowing the customers for the bad milk—he did not complain that I was not sending in the takings; I sent in all the money I took, and explained that I had to make allowances for bad milk—when. I wanted to go the rounds with the men they threw down the churns and refused to go round or to give me the customers' names and addresses—they left, and I had fresh men and went round, but the rounds got lost to the business, and there was less demand for milk—I believed the business could have been worked up—when I agreed to it being sold it was in a.</p>

I have not been to Stubbs since I returned from Birmingham—they gave me the same information as Mr. Abbott did—I went to Stubbs' because I was not satisfied with Abbott's information—I do not think Abbott had anything to do with the businesses at Birmingham—I had four interviews with Abbott altogether—the first was when I made inquiries about Payne; the second when I signed the agreement, the third when I paid the money, and the fourth when I re<lb/>turned to London—the offices in New Oxford Street consisted of one room and Abbott's private office—when I went there and asked for Payne he was in Abbott's room—when I went there on October 20th I did not expect to find anyone but Payne—all the conversation I had was with Payne except when Abbott told me he had been to Budeley to shoot rabbits—when I paid the £50 Abbott said he would forward it to Payne, who would give me a receipt in full, and refused to give me a receipt—in the agreement, Abbott's name is only there as a witness.</p>

My complaint is based upon the account he gave to me of the business at the first interview—when I put the matter into my solicitor's hands it was with a view of taking civil proceedings—if Payne had paid the bill he gave me I should not have taken criminal proceedings—Payne said he had sold his farm in Oxfordshire, and had invested £1,000 in the business—he did not say, "Both I and my son have put in all the money we could spare, and I and my family have 1,000 shares in the business"—he distinctly said £1,000—there were five creameries, Narberth, St. Clears, Langharne, Letterstone, and Llanbody, covering a radius of thirty miles, practically the whole of the milk producing district—I only saw two creameries—they were properly fitted up—when I saw the advertisement I thought it was a provision business, of which I had had experience—if I had thought it was a milk business I should have had nothing to do with it—that was not my reason for wanting to get out of it—the place was pleasant enough to live in if the business had been good—at the first interview he arranged that my salary could be £3 10s. a week, but he put £3 in the agreement—the St. Clears premises had the name up of St. Clears Butter Factory Company—there was no mention of the Welsh creameries—Payne did not own the premises; he told me he did, but he had them on an agreement, and the rent was in arrear—I heard it discussed by the proprietors—I understood him to say that the balance sheet showed a <hi rend="italic">net</hi> profit of 40 per cent., not gross—after the bill matured he asked for a renewal, and said he was trying to reconstruct the company, and would give me a first charge on it—I got judgment on the bill, but agreed not to enforce it if he paid £5 a month.</p>

Uxbridge Road, which was the Company's registered office; that they had two cream vans on the road in London, which were the means of bringing in a considerable amount of business, and that his son was managing the business in South Wales—the result was that I parted with the balance of £175, by a cheque for £160, and the rest in notes, in exchange for which he gave me these four share certificates (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) for £50 each, made out in favour of Mr. Lancelot Smith—he said the secretary of the company was away on his holidays, but at the nest Board meeting the certificates would be made out in my name—we then went out to see a Mr. Harrison, a solicitor, and when we returned I saw Abbott; Payne introduced him to me as Gurrin, the Chairman of the Welsh Creameries, Limited—Gurrin read over to me this agreement, and they "both signed it (<hi rend="italic">This was dated June</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1902, <hi rend="italic">between the Welsh Creameries, Limited, and A.

I believed what he said in his letter to me of May 23rd, and in other letters, and what he told me at the first interview—I sent the £25 and signed the agreement before seeing him, because he said the agreement was not considered settled until I had paid that amount—I knew then that I had become liable under that agreement to take the 200 shares, and to fulfil the terms of it—I agree that if there had been a capital of £5,000 or £6,000 the business might have been a successful one—the debts were about £2,000 when the company was wound up—I do not know whether that amount included £500 due to Payne—there was a good market for the milk if there had been sufficient money to pay the farmers and inspire them with confidence—I do not know that they supplied the leading firms in London—I saw the name of the Cream Dairy Company in the books—I do not recollect about Horner's, Rothwell's, and Welford's—Payne did pay some accounts when he came down—he paid R. Davis £10 17s. 7d., and the rent of St. Clears £15 7s. 6d.—at Narberth he paid D. Morris £9 17s. to redeem a cheque which was dishonoured—he also gave me £5 for current expenses, and £2 10s. for railway fares, and sent £6 for four weeks' wages—I do not know that he paid out considerably over £100—I only saw him pay two accounts—I say his motive in paying those accounts was to inspire con<lb/>fidence—I do not agree that if £200 more had been put in by Stevens it would have had any weight, because I had found out that £2,000 was owing—it was not difficult for Payne to know the exact state of affairs—I only saw one book there—I received a letter from him dated July 19th, asking me to send any important letters and cheques to him at 109, Great Russell Street, as Mr. Stevens, the Secretary of the Company, was so seldom at the office—there were several accounts outstanding and difficult to get in—I did not know that it was so much as £400—he wrote saying that there was three times the amount owing to the Company than what was due from the Company, but I found out that that was incorrect—I do not dispute that Horner's and Rothwell's had been paying as much as £70 a week, because I did not see the books—he mentioned about a reconstruct<lb/>tion of the Company, but I did not discuss it at any length—I agree if the company had been reconstructed and all the back debts had been paid off there was a good chance of it succeeding—there was an arrangement that</p>

               <p>in the event of a reconstruction I should take 200 shares and become the managing director, provided he could get the other capital—he Sent me £20 to buy milk for the new business, but I kept that as I was not buying any milk, on account of the collapse—at Payne's suggestion I drew up a circular stating that a new company was going to be formed, entitled "he Western Creameries Company," with £1,000 capital, but that would not have been sufficient to pay the debts of the old company, which were about £2,000, and a further £3,000 would have been required to inspire confidence and pay expenses, which were very heavy—I am still carrying on business myself at St. Clears, as a butter factor, buying butter from Ireland, from people I am acquainted with there, and sending it out all over the country—I have done business with only one customer of the Creameries—there is no particular advantage in having my business premises in St. Clears—I must keep myself going, and I might as well start at St. Clears as anywhere else—I have bought nothing from persons who were supplying the Welsh Creameries—I went to Mr. Stokes, a solicitor there, to see what the price of the leases would be of Langharne, Letterstone, and St. Clears—I did that on behalf of a gentleman in London—I was not thinking of forming a company myself—it is my opinion that if I had had the capital I could have made it pay—I do not consider that Payne was making an energetic effort to establish confidence in the farmers and pull the business round.</p>

Proper agreement to be drawn up and signed by both parties"—he said he should want me to invest £20 besides the £100, and that he would invest the same amount him self—on September 8th I commenced my duties there, signed this three years" partnership agreement (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), and gave him a cheque for £80—this is the receipt: 109, Great Russell Street, London, September 8th, 1902. Received from Mr. E. H. Orchard £80 by cheque, which together with cheque for £20 previously paid, equals £100 as per partnership agreement, in dairy situate at 113, Uxbridge Road. W. Payne"—the first week's business came to £12 or £15—I asked him how it was it was not as stated—he said that the business had been neglected—I paid the further £20 into my account at the London and South Western Bank, Shepherd's Bush Branch—Payne did not pay in his £20, as he said he was going to buy a pony and trap for the cream round—he did not buy them—a small profit was made—when I paid my money I thought the business belonged to Payne; I understood he had bought it from a company which I did not know the name of—in September I heard from some liquidators that Payne had no right to sell the business—they have not claimed it yet—on October 1st bailiffs were put in for rent—I saw Payne about it and he said he would try and settle it—I eventually paid £19 to the brokers—soon after Payne said he was willing to sell his share in the business for £50; I offered him £45 with a £10 rebate if paid within a month, and I eventually paid him. £34 10s.—he allowed me 10s. off for paying sooner than was stated.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 25, Upper Bedford Place, and am engaged at present as joint liquidator with Mr. Morse of the Welsh Creameries, Limited—on February 22nd, 1902, I saw this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph:</hi> "Partner.—Energetic and smart man wanted as director and secretary for established and thriving private company; experience not necessary; present profits 33 per cent and rapidly increasing; liberal salary to suitable man; must take £300 in shares, absolutely secured. Address for interview, A., 79, New Oxford Street"—I answered that, and in reply received this letter—(<hi rend="italic">Dated February</hi> 22<hi rend="italic">nd</hi>, 1902, <hi rend="italic">and stating that he had just formed five creameries in South Wales, his son and himself holding most of the shares; that he required a secretary and director to take the London end, at a salary of</hi> £150 <hi rend="italic">a year; and that the present turn<lb/>over showed over</hi> 40 <hi rend="italic">per cent. profit, and he expected to do four times that amount without more expense.—Signed, W.

My connection with the business lasted about five months—I saw a good deal of Payne during that time—he appeared to be making an honest effort to make the thing a success—I agree that the real difficulty in the way of making the business a financial success was the want of working capital—I do not suggest that any books were kept back, but Payne might have had a better idea of the state of the business than the books showed.</p>

                  </hi>: I am a chambermaid at the Covent Garden Hotel, Southampton Street, Strand—on December 4th, I think, about six p.m., the prisoner and her husband and child arrived there, but I did not see them then—Mr. Chandley rang for a drink about 8.30—they were occupying room 64, which has two beds in it—I went into the room, the child was on the bed and the prisoner was leaning over it, apparently trying to get it asleep—the baby was talking—as far as I could see the prisoner was treating it with kindness and attention—Mr. Chandley was standing by the window; he ordered some whisky, and asked his wife if she would have a drink—she refused—I went away to get the whisky and took it to him—the state of things in the room was the same then—I went away, and about 9 p.m. there was a ring from No. 64; I went at once towards the room; as I was going along the corridor I heard screams—I opened the door—Mr. Chandley had the child in his arms, he put it into my arms and said, "ook what she has done"—the prisoner was standing by the bed—the child's throat was cut—I do not think it was conscious—it was covered with blood, and Mr. Chandley, who was in his night shirt, had blood from the child on him—I did not notice any blood on the prisoner—Mr. Chandley had a razor with blood upon it in his hand—he gave it to me, and later on I took two more out of the room—they were on the dressing table—I gave the child back to Mr. Chandley and said I would go and get a doctor—I went and communicated with the hall porter, and then returned to the room—Dr. Betts arrived—I think he was visiting a friend in the hotel—when I returned to the room the prisoner was still by the bed, she was crying and seemed very much distressed—I spoke to her after<lb/>wards, and asked her if her head was bad—she said she intended doing away with herself, or something to that effect—the child was afterwards removed to the hospital.</p>

               <p>was bleeding freely—a great deal of blood was on her clothes as well as upon Miss Brown's clothes and on the prisoner—the wound was dangerous—the child was very nearly dead—I ordered hot blankets and a hot water bottle, and treated the child—Dr. Hamerton afterwards arrived.</p>

Hotel—I went to a double bedded room, No. 64, on the second floor—before going into the room I met Dr. Betts, who told me the circumstances and the child's condition, which was very bad—when I went into the room I found the child in bed with its clothes on there had been con<lb/>siderable bleeding—the prisoner was standing in the opposite corner of the room to where the child was—she seemed dazed and stupid—she did not seem to appreciate anything that was taking place—some information was given to me with regard to her—after a premature confinement puerperal insanity sometimes comes on—in nearly 80 per cent, of such cases the patient recovers—it occurs about six weeks after the confine<lb/>ment—it is generally temporary, unless there is a tendency to insanity—in that state of mental aberration it is possible for a woman to commit an act of this kind, not being conscious of its character—the effect of puerperal insanity is specially directed to those nearest to them, especially their progeny—the prisoner's attack on her child she loved best was con<lb/>sistent with this form of temporary mania—the mania, as a rule, comes on suddenly, but sometimes there is irritability or depression beforehand—it generally comes on without much warning—in those cases that come on early after a confinement they generally recover rapidly.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The mere effect of the premature delivery is sufficient to bring on puerperal mania—I cannot say whether a sudden shock from, a fall would produce it, but it would make it worse—depression is often an indication of it, accompanied by restlessness—I was not present, but I understood that the child's first cry in the hospital was for its mother—its age is about three.</p>

I am a plumber of 13, Scots Road, Leyton—on Decem<lb/>ber 23rd, at 4.30 p.m., I was in the Hope beer-house, Maryland Point, Stratford—I saw the prisoners there—Mortimer asked me for a cigarette—I gave them two each—I changed a sovereign at the bar to get a drink—I had some other money but I wanted some change as I was going to make one or two purchases—the prisoners could see the change which was given to me—I left the house alone about ten minutes after I had received the change—I left the prisoners in the bar and went down Windmill Lane towards my home, which is about two minutes' walk from the beer-house—I went into a urinal—the prisoners came in after me and Mortimer struck me in the eye with his fist and cut my eye—he did not say anything—Biterlick struck me in the mouth and knocked me down—I called for help while I was on the ground—Biterlick held me down and Mortimer put his hands into my pocket and took part of my money—I struggled, and Mortimer then held me down and Biterlick took the rest—they then knocked my head against the wall and I became unconscious—they left me in the urinal—when I came to, nobody was there—I went to the officer on point duty and reported it to him—he referred me to the police station, where I made a report—about 6.30 p.m. I went again to the Hope beer-house and saw the prisoners there—I went out and found a policeman and returned with him to the beer-house, but only Mortimer was there—he was taken into custody—he did not say anything—I gave a description of Biterlick to the police, and next saw him on Christmas morning, about 12.30 at the police-station, when I picked him out from nine other men—I am sure he is the man.</p>

               <p>about 10.40 p.m. I saw the prisoners together loitering about—I kept them under observation till 11 p.m.—they went within about twelve yards of the automatic machine, standing outside 109, Grove Lane—Lane left Claxson and walked up to the machine, punched it three or four times with some instrument he had in his hand, then went back to Claxson, then back to the machine, striking a blow on the back of it—that broke the iron, which fell to the ground—as he went to the front of the machine I went towards him within three feet—he struck me across my face, and said, "Take that you f----g bastard"—that knocked me down—he ran away—I got up and ran after him for about 160 yards—in Grove Crescent I saw something in his right hand which he threw away towards the church—I caught him about thirty yards further along the Grove—he said, "I did not know it was you, Mr. Mitchell, or I would not have it you like that"—I took him into custody—in another five or six yards he struck me in my mouth—I procured assistance and took him to the station where he said, "I did not know it was Mr. Mitchell, or I would not have hit him like that"—when the charge was read to him he said, "ow can you make it stealing I think it is only attempting to steal"—Claxson made no reply to the charge.</p>
