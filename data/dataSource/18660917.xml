                  </hi>. I am a widow—previous to the 30th July I was liv<lb/>ing at 5, Eagle Street, Holborn—I have known the prisoner for seven years, I think—he married my youngest daughter near on seven years ago, I think—there was the little boy, who is dead, by the marriage—there was one before, which I thought was by him, but I do not know whether it was by him or any one else—he would be eight years old—the boy that is dead would be six years old on the 22nd of November—his name was Arthur Richard Jeffery—I saw his body when I went before the coroner—he was born after the marriage—after the marriage my daughter and Jeffery lived together for two or three years, but not a very comfortable life; they were very unhappy—at the end of the two or three years he sold off all the things, and then she came to live with me, because she had no home to go to—they have not lived together since—I had the care of the boy Arthur—he had been backwards and forwards to me ever since he was born—his father brought him to me about five months before his death, and said he would pay me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, but he never did—he has not paid a farthing—for the last five months he had lived entirely with me—while he was with me his father came and took him away once or twice for a day—he did not come to see the child only when he took him away—they were the only occasions when he saw him—on Sunday 29th July the prisoner came to my house, 5, Eagle Street, Red Lion Square, at half-past eight in the evening—the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186609170006"/>
               <p>boy was in bed awake—he said, "Dress that child," three times—I said, "Cannot you leave him till the morning and come for him?"—he said, "No; dress that child," again—the child said, "Don't take me! don't take me! granny, don't dress me"—nothing more was said then—I dressed him, and his father took him away—after he left I followed him as far as Bloomsbury Court, Holborn, and there lost sight of him—he went through the court—I did not see the child alive after that night—the child had been out to dinner with me on the Sunday—he was in very good health—he had been ill, but during the last week he was very lively indeed, and in good health up to the time of his going away with his father—it was about half-past eight when he took him away from me, and it was about nine when I lost sight of him—I dare say he was in my house a quarter of an hour while I was dressing the child—from the time he left my house till the time I lost sight of him I did not speak to him—he saw me follow<lb/>ing him, and that made him run away with the child in his arms—he was present when I spoke to a constable—I said, "Will you take the child from that man?"—he said, "Why?"—I said, because he was not fit to have the child, he was in liquor, and that he had used the child very ill before, and I wished him to take the child away—the policeman said, "It is his father, I cannot"—the prisoner did not say anything, he walked on—on the Monday morning a man asked me if I had seen little Arthur—I said "No," and he told me he was in the dead-house—I went there and saw the body—I saw the clothes—they were the same that he had on on the Sunday night—the prisoner is a tailor by trade—I did not know where he was living at the time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long had they been married before you went to live with them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About a twelvemonth—they seemed pretty happy before that—after I went they were not so happy, they used to quarrel—I do not think he knew that his wife had had a child before they were married—she told me she told him of it about a twelvemonth after—I did not tell him, she told him herself—I did not tell him that his wife had had a child before marriage, and it was in the Foundling, and I had kept it secret for three years—the child is in the Foundling—after I went to live with them she wanted to go out to work, and he would not let her—that began the quarrelling—I went to confine her—she was in the family way—I never threatened to part them—I wanted to go away, but they would not let me—I do not know where the wife is now—I have not seen her for nine or ten months—I do not know whether she is living with a man named Salter—I do not know whether she is out of London or not—the prisoner was not kind to his wife—I never saw him kind to her in my life—he was not fond of her—they seemed pretty happy at first—I saw unkindness on both sides—I never had any words with him about my pawning his work—I never pawned anything—he never said I did—some-times he would quarrel with me for nothing, if I only sat on a chair—I never used strong language to him to my knowledge—I do not know Mr. Fraser, who is connected with the City mission—I knew his father, who used to go to chapel—I have never used threats towards the prisoner in the presence of the missionary—I never threatened that I would hunt him through life, or persecute him, or any words like that—I never liked the man, so I never took notice of him—I never said I would hunt him to his death—I never said that in the presence of Mr. Fraser—the prisoner often took the child out for a day—I do not know what for—it was not for an excursion—I have seen him bring back oranges—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186609170007"/>
               <p>might bring a cake or a bit of sweetstuff—I have seen cakes now and then, and sweetstuff that he has bought for the child—there was unkind<lb/>ness on his part to the child, once when he came home—there were bites on his bottom and about his legs, bitten with teeth—I told a person of the name of Mason of it—I could not help the boy going out with the prisoner, because he was the father—I might have seen Mr. Fraser, but not noticed him—(<hi rend="italic">he was called in</hi>)—I do not remember him, he might know me, but I do not know him—he never read the Bible to me, or called at my house—I do not remember the man at all—he never read the Bible to me, that I remember—I never said in his presence that I would hunt the prisoner to death—I strongly deny it—the prisoner did not bring the child any clothes on the Sunday night, or any other night—I do not think I said before the magistrate that I asked a policeman to take the boy away—I said that I did not think he was fit to have the child, and that he was drunk—he was intoxicated—I have not noticed anything queer about his manners, except when he was intoxicated, and a little after, when he was like a madman—he always seemed rational enough, except when he was intoxicated—he was often intoxicated—I can't say that I have ever seen him take a poker up, and say people were following him—he once took a knife out and sharpened it, and took the boy up and said he would cut him up, and then he would serve me the same—that was when I lived with him—he would quarrel with me for nothing—I never heard him speak of things following him, and shutting the door and say they were coming.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say it was about a year after they were married that his wife told him she had a child? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—they lived together two years after that—they did not live together before they were married to my knowledge—it is very seldom any one comes to read the Bible to me—an old gentleman generally calls on me—the prisoner was a tetotaller for some time, and he was very quiet then, but of late he has taken to drink—I think he was the worse for liquor on this night—I told the coroner that I spoke to a policeman, and the magistrate too—I am sure of that—I do not know where the prisoner lived at the time of this murder—he did not live in the Seven Dials.</p>

                  </hi>. I am lodging in Queen Street, Seven Dials, I am married to the prisoner's sister—on Sunday, July 29th, I was living with my wife at No. 15, Great White Lion Street, Seven Dials—I have known the prison seven years—I do not know where he was living on this Sunday night—he has lived at Maynard Street, New Oxford Street, that is in St. Giles's parish, about five minutes' walk from Great Earl Street—I had seen him about a fortnight previous to the Sunday night—he called on me where I was living—there was some conversation about the boy, but I think it was more with my wife than me—I do not remember anything he said about the boy—there was an observation made about the boy not being a trouble to any one—Jeffery said the boy should not be a trouble to any one much longer—I do not remember any more on that Sunday night—he had made an observation that he did not believe the boy to be his son—he said that on a previous occasion, a fortnight before he com<lb/>mitted the deed—I remember his coming on this Sunday night with the boy—my wife was at home—it was after nine o'clock—I think it was before ten o'olock—when he came I was out fetching a little beer, and when I came back he was there, and had made arrangements with my. wife for him to sleep there that night, and she granted it—shortly afterwards my wife went into the next room to a neighbour's, and we had some con<lb/>versation</p>

               <p>about religion, and the little boy was put to bed—he asked the little boy if he had said his prayers, and the boy said, "Yes," and repeated the prayer, "Gentle Jesus, meek and mild," and the father asked the boy what he said them for; the boy said he wanted to go to bed; he asked him if that was all he said them for, and the boy said, "Yes," and I advised him to let the boy alone, not to bother him, and let him go to sleep, and the boy went to sleep—the boy was in bed at that time, he went to bed first—the prisoner went to bed some time afterwards, about half-past eleven o'clock—he slept with me, the boy slept between us—my wife was not well, and we pulled the mattress off, and he slept with me on the floor—the prisoner got up about one o'clock—he had a sound sleep previous to that—he had been drinking—I could see he was in drink when he came to our place—when he got up he made an observation that he could not sleep for the bugs—he told the little boy to get up and dress himself—I remonstrated with him, but he would have his own way—I said, "Richard, for God's sake, don't take the little child out at this time of night, stop till the morning at any rate"—he said, no, he should do as he liked—my wife also talked to him, and said, "Don't take the boy out at this time of night"—he swore at her and told her to mind her own b—business—he said, "You must be a bad woman yourself to think that I should do anything bad"—she had made an observation that she hoped he was not going to do anything wrong to the boy by taking him out at that time of night, and then he made that observation—he said he was going a long way in the country, the boy would never see his aunt again—he went to the cupboard, and asked the little boy if he was hungry, and the boy said, "No"—he put two potatoes in his pocket, and said the little boy might want them on the way—when he got up there was very little candle left, and he went out and bought a candle, and cut it in half, and put the half in his pocket—he got the candle at a chandler's shop, next door—I do not know whether he got the candle at that shop, but they keep open till one o'clock—he came back and cut the candle in two, and put one piece in his pocket and lit the other—he also brought a box of matches and put a few in his pocket, and threw the rest down on the floor, and seemed in a sort of passion—he then went and opened the door, and put his hand out and said, "March!" to the little boy, and went straight to the street door—I never saw the boy after—I did not see him when he was dead, my wife did—the boy said, "Good bye," and shed a few tears—it was between one and two o'clock that he left with the boy—it was after one.</p>

Q.</hi> Have you known the prisoner since his marriage. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Since my marriage with his sister; nearly as long—I remember his mar<lb/>riage—at first they lived happily together, but afterwards the grandmother went to live with them, and they were not so happy after that—he used often to speak about his wife leaving him, especially when he had been drinking, and I think it preyed on his mind—he used to cry about it—I remember him very well on one occasion barricading the door, and putting boxes and chairs against it—I asked him what he was doing it for, and he made an obser<lb/>vation about the police, "If they come in I will shoot the lot of them"—there was no pretence for any police coming in as far as I know—I attributed it to drink—he showed evident signs of having been drinking then—I have seen him with a pistol, but not on that occasion—I remember his saying on one occasion that he owned a place called "Cromwell Hall"—he took his wife somewhere, I think it was to Brompton, and when he got there he said, "Well, it is all up; we must go to work"—I do not know</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186609170009"/>
               <p>that he said the estate was in Essex—I was not with them—I cannot tell you who told me he had been there, he did not tell me he was going—I heard it afterwards—I never knew him by the name of "Mad Dick" until I saw it in the papers—he was not known by that name—his manner was re<lb/>markably eccentric at times—I remember on one occasion about some money, 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that he was endeavouring to get—I thought it a very unfeasible thing—he said he had money, something about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot remember whether he offered to lend me money—I often thought at times he was not in his right mind—I have had great occasion to think he was not in his right mind—I cannot call to mind any particular occasion—on several oc<lb/>casions I have noticed the manner of his speaking, and the look of his eye—that gave me the idea that he was not in his mind at all times—he has spoken much about religion on several occasions; he has told me he would be damned and would go to hell—I have seen him often—I have seen him walk up and down the room in a very excited state, and make an observa<lb/>tion without any apparent meaning—he was out on one occasion with my wife where there was building going on, and he went up the scaffold—I was not with them, I was told of it in the evening—he used to bring the child oranges and cakes, and was a kind and affectionate father, except one Christmas he slapped the boy for mocking an old woman—with that excep<lb/>tion he was a kind and indulgent father, but he used to behave better to himself—I have heard complaints of the father's conduct, but not from the child.</p>

               <p>about the time that his wife went off with Salter—I remember one night when he slept at our house his barricading the door and putting boxes and chairs against it—I did not hear him say the police were coming, and he would shoot the lot of them—I heard my husband say he said so—I was in the room at the time, in bed—I did not hear what passed—I was between waking and sleeping—I do not remember going with the prisoner to Brompton—I did not notice any change in his manner within the last year or two.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you notice him doing anything extraordinary, as if he was not quite right in his mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, for the last year or two, about money; he said, when my mother died there was money coming in for us; there was none—we did think there was money—by the way my brother talked it was supposed and expected there would be some money coming; I did not know—she died in Suffolk six years ago last Christmas—my brother has often said my mother left money—I think I have sometimes heard him speak about religion, and say that he would go to hell, when he has had drink—there was no reason for his saying so that I know of—he used often to speak of his wife having left him; he seemed distressed about it—he was always very fond of the child—he used to take it out with him a good many times—I had the child at Christmas-time and he used to pay me every week for it, and seemed very fond of it—he used to bring oranges and cakes for it, and for my children too—I would have trusted my children with him, he seemed very fond of them—I heard the child complain once that he had beaten him; that was not for mocking an old woman—I can-not remember anything he did that struck me as being extraordinary or eccentric.</p>

                  </hi> (Police Sergeant F 13). On Monday, July 30, about a quarter-past seven in the morning, I was called to a cellar in Neale's Passage—I went in at a door in Neale's Passage that is always open day and night, it is never properly closed, it is in the public thoroughfare—when you get down the stairs from the street you are in an outer cellar—I passed through the doorway into the cellar where the cistern is, and there found the body of a child hanging to the post of the cistern—at that time it had not been interfered with at all—the rope was once round the neck, and it was tied about three times round the post—I produce the rope—there was a <hi rend="italic">nick</hi> cut in the post, not recently, and this rope was tied round that—the boy's head was hanging from this part—it was not quite tight—I could get my two fingers in between the neck and the rope—the loop in the rope was larger than his neck—the face was towards the post—the knot was just at the back of the neck, rather inclined to one side; there was a dent in the neck of rather a livid hue, rather a reddish cast—it was at the back of the neck that I could put my two fingers—it was tight in front—the feet were about fifteen inches from the ground—the hands were tied behind with this handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>), not close together—I could not say positively whether the palms were outwards—the handker<lb/>chief was tied round both wrists—the two knots were preserved by Dr. Harvey—they are very firm—one is a weaver's knot—he was com<lb/>pelled to cut one—each hand was tied separately—these are the knots—from the way in which they were tied, they got tighter the more you drew them, they would not slip—the doctor took off the handkerchief—the boy was dressed in an old plaid jacket, an old black waistcoat, and old trousers, I think brown or grey, very old, a pair of old shoes, one of which had a piece of cloth stitched on it with white thread, and there was an old cap on the floor—there was a basket in the cellar, about four or five feet distant from the body, but there were no marks on it whatever—I noticed to see whether there were any marks of feet or anything on it, but there were none—it was a kind of market basket, that would hold a bushel of potatoes—I took hold of the body, and, not having a knife myself, I asked a by-stander to cut it for me—the place was very full of people at the time—he cut the rope round the boy's neck—he cut it close to the knot, and then the whole of the knot appeared to slip through, it came undone—I then sent for Dr. Harvey, and then removed the body to the dead-house, under his instructions—I afterwards examined the cellars—there was a small area grating, which admitted light to the front cellar, about three feet in length and about six inches in width, and each iron bar was about a quarter of an inch from the other—there were about fourteen or fifteen steps to descend into the cellar—as I was standing in the cellar without my hat the level of the street would be about a foot higher than my head—the grating was the only means of lighting the front cellar—that grating was in the thorough-fare—both cellars run the same way—no light is derived from this grating in the back cellar, the only light there is from the street door—when the door was shut there would be no light—in going down it looks very dark—it is a dead wall in front of you at the bottom of the stairs, quite dark—I examined the child's waistcoat, and saw two small spots of tallow on it; but two lighted candles were in the cellar at the time the doctor was examining the body, and I concluded that those two spots might have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186609170012"/>
               <p>dropped from them—after the discovery of the body Inspector West had charge of the case, and he took steps to find the prisoner—I saw him at Bow Street Police Court after he was in custody—I had not seen him at all between these times—I have been on duty in this neighbourhood—I did not know the prisoner before this occurrence—I speak of the door leading to the outer cellar being always open, from my knowledge of the neigh<lb/>bourhood—none of those houses are ever shut—you can walk in at any time or at any hour of the night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I think you have not said before to<lb/>day that the rope was twisted round the post? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did say so at Bow Street to the best of my belief—I don't believe I said it was tied round two or three times, but it was—the doctor slipped one hand through one knot, but the other was so tight he was compelled to cut it—if the child had been hanged while alive I should imagine he would have struggled violently—I think, from the appearance of the child, somebody must have had their hand over his mouth; that is the best of my belief—I could not say whether he was partially or entirely dead at the time he was hung up—the palms of the hands were open, they were not clenched.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Southampton Street, Strand—on this Monday morning I was sent for to this cellar—I got there about half-past seven—I went into the cellar where the cistern was—the boy was then cut down, and lying on his back—his wrists were tied behind him—he was dressed—he was quite dead—his limbs were rigid, but he was slightly warm—I did not undo the hands then—I found that he was dead, and I sent him to the dead-house, and there made a more careful examina<lb/>tion—the hands were tied behind him with this handkerchief—I slipped one hand through this opening, which has not been disturbed—the other was tied more tightly, and I cut it—I believe these are the original knots—I found the mark of the cord about three parts round the neck, the anterior two-thirds coming a little behind one ear, the back part of the neck being free from the mark—it was a mark that might have been made by a rope—the jaws were clenched closely—the stomach and chest were slightly warm—I should imagine the child had been dead about four hours—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I found all the organs healthy, other than there was congestion of the lungs and congestion of the brain—the heart was also full of blood—suffocation was the cause of death—the congestion would arise from that—I saw no marks on the mouth—probably the suffocation was produced by compression of the wind-pipe—the stomach contained food—I had an idea that the suffocation must</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186609170013"/>
               <p>have been partial before he was hanged up—why I came to that idea was the calm expression of the countenance and the pallor—life could not have been extinct, or we should not have had the mark of the cord ecchymosed—I mean the red mark, it was a deep red—the jaws were clenched, the eyes were not protruding—in hanging that is generally the case, and the tongue is generally hanging from the mouth—there was a little dilitation of the pupil—I imagine the boy was about six years of age.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Except the signs of having been suffocated, there was none of the ordinary inditia of death by hanging? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only the mark round the neck—I judged that the child must have been alive at the time he was hung up, from the deep colour round the neck.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you agree with this:—"We learn from these experiments, as well as from those performed by others, that the mark which is usually seen upon the neck in hanging during life, not ecchymosed, may be also produced by a ligature applied to the neck of a subject within two hours, or even a much longer period after death; consequently the presence of this mark on the neck is no criterion of hanging during life or after death"? (<hi rend="italic">Taylor's Medical Jurisprudence</hi>, p. 660). <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it says "not ecchy<lb/>mosed;" you have a scorched mark, I think Orfila mentions, but I believe the red mark I speak of here is absent; this was decidedly ecchymosed—by ecchymose, I mean the effusion of blood underneath the skin, it is simply a pouring out of the blood; that shows that the blood must have been in circulation—it is a condensation of the cellular tissue—you may get that after death, as it sets up within two hours after death—the ecchymose is not a change in the skin or in the cellular tissue, it is an effusion of blood underneath the skin—that was seen simply by the mark of the rope—that discolouration was the effusion of blood, there is no other mode of obtaining discolouration. Taylor says, "The changes in the skin beneath the mark are also destitute of any distinctive character. There is the same condensation of the cellular membrane, whether the hanging has occurred in the living subject or dead. These changes are simply the result of physical causes, mechanical compression." The parchment-like appearance that you see after death is simply produced by condensation of the tissues by pressure, there is no ecchymosis—I consider the child must have been half suffocated before he was hanged up—I should imagine you would get no ecchymosis if it was hung after death—I should think not within a minute after—if you have no circulation you get no bleeding, not through minute vessels—the circulation in the minute vessels ceases instanta<lb/>neously—I state it decidedly as my opinion that if you hang a body up two minutes after death the appearances would be different to what they would if it had a little life in it—I form my opinion from the outward appearances.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were rather glad to get rid of him, I believe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, he used to do such funny things, I don't say when he was tipsy, but at other times as well—he had such funny ways—my husband used to say to him, "Don't talk such stuff; you are mad, you are"—he used to tell us such funny things—he would begin to sing psalms, and get up from his meals and walk about the room, and get a Bible and read in it—during the time he was in our place I never heard him make use of a bad word—he told me a long history about his wife and his mother—he appeared in grief about it—he was always saying he should like to see her, to see what she was doing, but that she did not behave well to him, she went away with another man—he appeared to suffer grief and sorrow from it—I never saw him cry—he used to sit and think for a long time—I never heard him say any-thing about his going to hell or being damned—I never heard him make use of any bad words—he has said he was unhappy about his wife—he has not said anything about what would happen to him in the other world.</p>

               <p>know where she was—the first Monday he came to our place he was going back with my husband to work at Gravesend—he stopped and had some dinner—I had never seen him before—he said, "Well, Mr. Ingram, you seem very happy with your wife, but I had a wife once; I wish I was as happy; don't never let anything put you astray from one another"—he was not brought home drunk by the police—I did not see him, but I could hear—when he was tipsy he used to be just like a madman—he was drunk twice while he lodged with us—he was working as a tailor for a person in the Goswell Road—he went out in the morning and came home early at night for a fortnight, till he broke out—he used to read his Bible—he used to tell us what Mr. Spurgeon preached about, and he said he once stopped a funeral from being buried—he was not drunk then—he was sitting by the fire one evening, and he said, "I got myself in trouble one Sunday, Bill. What do you think in foolishness I did? I went and stopped a funeral from being buried"—he would get up from meals and walk about the room, and not sit still like other people—he said he had got a boy, and he was fond of it, but he did not believe it was his own, for his wife had got a child before he was married, and it was in the Foundling—when my hus<lb/>band told him not to talk such stuff, he was talking about what he had done—he was quite sober then—he was only tipsy twice during the time I knew him.</p>

I am a tailor, and live at 15, Great White Lion Street—I have known the prisoner about eight years—he was at my place one night, at 26, Tower Street—he slept along with me—I woke up in the night and found him sharpening a knife on his sleeve—I asked him what the hell he was going to do with it—it was between one and two o'clock in the night, about this time twelve months. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am a police-constable in the West Riding constabulary, and live near Halifax, in Yorkshire—on Saturday morning, 8th September, the prisoner came to my house, about nine o'clock—I was in bed, my wife showed him up to my room—he said, "Well, are you the policeman?" I said, "I am"—he said, "I have a very serious charge to make against myself; do you think I could murder my own child?"—I said "I don't know what you can do"—he said, "Well, before I make any further state<lb/>ment, will you allow me to go out to the public-house? for I have left some thing there that I want to bring in, and give to you"—I said he could go—when he went downstairs I immediately got out of bed and told my wife to watch where he went to—I dressed myself and came downstairs—in about two or three or four minutes after the prisoner came back to our house again a second time—he had a Bible in his hand, and he put the Bible on the top of a table—I asked him what was his name; he said, "They call me John Richard Jeffery, or otherwise Samuel Mortimer; I was born in Richmond, in Virginia, in America; I am a Yankee, but before I say any more, will you allow me to go out again?"—I allowed him to go out as far as the door, and then I said, "John Richard Jeffery, I charge you with being the murderer of your own child at St. Giles's, in London, from the statement you have made to me"—he said, "Mind you, I don't say I am the murderer of my own child, but there is nothing impossible to man"—I asked him how he knew he was the murderer of his own child—he said he saw in <hi rend="italic">Lloyd's Newspaper</hi> that he was the murderer of his own child in London—he said, "I am charged with the murder of my own child"—he mentioned St. Giles's when he was making the statement to me in the first onset—he said he was charged with the murder of his own child at St. Giles's, in London—he said he had been in a public-house, he could not say whether it was a public-house or a private house, but from underneath the settle he pulled this paper out, and he read in the paper that there was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. offered for his apprehension, and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he said would do me a good deal of good, and he would give himself up to me for that—there is such a paper as <hi rend="italic">Lloyd's</hi>—I never saw it—I said, "Now, mind, it is a serious charge, and whatever you say after this I shall take in evidence against you if it is required hereafter—"Well," he said, "I am a married man, and I am the father of one child, and he is six years old; I was married about seven years since in London, and I never had an easy mind, and I never was content since I was wed, since my mother died especially; my wife went away with another man, who was a German, but I have broke the law, and the law shall decide my fate; I don't mean to say no more at present, but when the judge puts the black cap on, then I will tell a tale"—he said the last time he saw his son was about half-past two o'clock in the morning of 30th July, at St. Giles's, and he bought him a new suit of clothes—he said he left his sister's house at that time, to the best of his knowledge, but he could not exactly say to an hour or an hour and a half—I took him on to Halifax then, and on the road, as we were going by a place called King's Cross, he kept continually asking for a gill of beer of anybody he met on the road</p>

               <p>—I told him to be quiet, and the next public-house we got to I would give him a glass of beer, if he would come quietly on with me, so when we got to the place he sat himself down on the road, and he dressed himself there, and I could not get him on for a bit—that was at Colonel Edwards's gate, at Poyners's Walk—when we went up to the "Wellington" inn Alan Midwood, the landlord, was standing at the door—I told him to fetch this man a glass of beer out, and the prisoner said he had a halfpenny in his pocket, and he would want a gill and a half—at the same time the landlord came to the door with a glass of best ale in his hand, and that was three-halfpence—I told him not to take the halfpenny from the prisoner, I would pay it—the landlord asked me what I was taking the prisoner for—I said I did not know exactly, and the prisoner said, "I am charged with being the supposed murderer of my own child at St. Giles's, in London"—Midwood said to him, "How did you do it?" the prisoner said, "I hung him," or, "I hanged him"—Midwood said, "Then, d—you, you ought to be hung yourself, if you did such a thing"—at that time there was a crowd, and I took the prisoner away—a man of the name of Tasker was there at the time, and was present when the conversation took place—I took the prisoner on to Halifax—he was locked up there—I was sitting up with him on Tuesday morning, and he commenced talking about the murder—it was between six and seven o'clock in the morning—he said they called his child Richard Arthur Jeffery, but he said, "I have a great doubt whether it was mine or not"—he said it was a good job the child was put out of the way, as it would never have to be put in his face about his mother having gone away with another man—I reported the matter to our superintendent, and a photographic likeness of the prisoner was sent on to London—when he came to me he was under the influence of drink—I think he must have been drinking for a day or two before, from his appearance—he walked with me to Halifax, a distance of four miles—he was not what I call drunk, but like a man getting out of a drunken spree.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I have been expecting you down; I thought you would have been here before this"—after he was identified by Ingram I told him I charged him with wilfully murdering his son by hanging him in a cellar in Great Earl Street, Seven Dials—in answer to that he said, "But I have surrendered myself; I knew I must be taken some time or other, but I don't mean to say that I am the murderer of my own child," or, "my child," I am not sure which—he said, "It was from seeing the accounts in the newspapers that I gave myself up, charging me with having murdered my child; that was why I gave myself up, but the laws of the country must prove me guilty"—on turning round to leave the cell, the prisoner said to Ingram, "Ah! Bill, old boy, I thought it was you that gave my description that was in the papers, but shake hands, I bear you no malice"—that was all that took place—I brought him up to London in custody—as far as I saw of his manner, he was perfectly rational, and also, from what I knew of him in St. Giles's, he was a very quiet inoffensive man, I never knew anything in the least otherwise—I always took him to be so, and quite rational.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 5, Lawrence Street, and am a carpenter and joiner—I have known the prisoner about two years and a half—I saw him very frequently—I very often preach—I saw the prisoner after I had done preaching one Sunday evening on the Seven Dials—I met him on several occasions—I observed such peculiarities in his manner as</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186609170020"/>
               <p>the following:—at first he stated to me that he was a Jew by birth, a Jew by religion also, being extracted from Jewish parents—that was after I had been preaching—after our conversation on the subject of religion, he frequently used to visit me at my shop, and it has been frequently the case that when conversing with me for a considerable time rationally he would become incoherent and exceedingly abstruse—I mean by abstruse an in<lb/>coherency both of manner and expression; for instance, he would get quite off the subject on which he had been speaking to something quite irrelevant to it, as, for instance, he would say, instantly rising from the seat on which he was at the time, "Barwell, I am a lost man, I shall be sure to go to hell"—he was once living only three doors from myself—he had to pass and repass my shop to and from his business, and as he was passing perhaps he would stop short suddenly and say, "Barwell, I wish your house was a thousand miles away from me"—I said, "Why so, Jeffery?"—he said, "Because I always feel so miserable when I pass it"—in talking on religious subjects he would suddenly break into something quite different; if you wish for an instance, I will give you the following:—"Barwell, I think you are a d—rum fellow"—that was in the middle of a serious conversation—I have notes here by which I have refreshed my memory since—I did not make them at the time—at these times there used to be a very peculiar glistening of the eye, and an agitation both of mind and body—he would stamp about the shop or street and seem thoroughly agitated, and it would be some time before I could get him to be calm and sit down again, and then he would burst into a violent fit of tears and cry like a child—my wife has frequently made remarks to him—she invariably calls me "my dear" when she addresses me, and the prisoner has frequently said, with tears in his eyes, "Oh! Barwell, how miserable I am! I wish to God I was dead"—he frequently spoke to me in reference to his wife—the mention of it appeared to distress him very much—I recollect his little boy very well indeed—he frequently brought him to our house—he always seemed remarkably fond of the child—I have allowed my children to go out with it and play in the streets—he never offered to lend me money—he offered me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as premium if I would take the child as an apprentice to learn my trade—it was a child six years old—I always had an idea, from what he stated to me, that he had money in prospect for the child—he has told me that he had money in the funds belonging to the child, and when it came of age it would come into possession of it, that he was very unhappy with his wife, and she wanted to have command of the money, and he being determined they should not, it made things very unpleasant, but he was determined to see the child righted—I have often heard that the prisoner was designated as "Mad Dick"—I never heard anybody personally call him so, but I heard it said that he was usually designated so by several of his shopmates.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How did you first become acquainted with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the following way:—after I had done preaching one Sunday even<lb/>ing, and was going home, the prisoner followed me, touched me on the arm and said, "May I speak to you, sir?"—he had some conversation with me about religious matters—I think I have preached every Sunday, health and weather permitting, for five years, generally in Somer's Town, near the Brill, in open air—I did not know that he was a tailor—I know that he has recently, unhappily, taken to drink—I have seen him drink over and over again—I have never seen him, I think, but once drunk—I saw him staggering—I do not know that I ought to say I have seen him the worse</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186609170021"/>
               <p>for liquor over and over again—I never had any proof of it—I don't know that I have ever heard that he had been drinking—he used to have his work at home generally—I believe he earned his living as a tailor—I do not think the boy was living with him at all—the conversation when he spoke about being a Jew was on the first Sunday, when he introduced himself to my notice as we were walking from the Dials up Great St. Andrew Street—I could not tell whether he had been drinking then—I used to see him almost daily for a considerable period—when he said I was a d—rum fellow I had not been talking to him about being drunk—I can-not tell how he came to say it, he volunteered it—I have not seen men who are in the habit of drinking very often, perhaps once or twice during my life—at the time he said he wished he was dead and was very miserable he had been talking about his wife—I did not know from him that she was living with some other person—he wished me to take the boy as an apprentice then and there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lay preacher at the Gospel Boom, Bedfordbury—I am a master coach smith by trade, and still work for my living—I have known the prisoner five years—I do not know when he was married—I know that the grandmother lived with him and his wife for some time—I never visited him, but I visited the grandmother and wife, which was the first occasion of my ever meeting with the other members of his family—I have read to that woman, and prayed with her too, I think; not on more occasions than one—that was fixed on my memory by circumstances I can never forget—it was in a yard called Spencer's Yard, in Crown Street, one Sunday at dinner time, between two and three years ago—the prisoner had come home in the morning, and said he had got his child—I said, "Tell me what is the matter with you, friend,"—he said that the mother of his child and her mother had had his child from him for a long time, that he had sought everywhere and could not find him, but that morning he had discovered where he was, and he was going to take him and do him a great deal of good—I went to the grandmother's house and told her that the prisoner had promised to be at my house in the afternoon with the boy, and if she would come there I would try and make a reconciliation between them—there was a forewoman of the boy's mother in the room at the time, and when she had gone I began to talk about the prisoner having the boy, and about his being willing to live with his wife quietly and comfortably if she would be comfortable to him—the grandmother then said that she hated him—the wife said so too, and the grandmother said she would hunt him to death—I once had the prisoner under surveillance for twenty-four hours—I think that must have been about three years ago—he came to a place where I was—he was very excited—I took him home, and was sitting down by the fire, talking to him kindly and cheerfully, trying to divert his mind from the subject, which I always thought led him into a wandering state of mind, and all at once he took up the poker and began to rush round my room—my wife began to scream and the child to hallo—he made a rush to the pendulum of the clock, saying, "There they go," and began to smite the wall with the poker, which rather alarmed me, and I said, "Open the window, and I will put him out"—that appeared to frighten him, and I overpowered him, and sat him down and watched over him, and</p>

               <p>gave him some tea—I took him to a lodging-house, and in the morning I took him to my workshop and kept him under my eye all the day through, allowing him to have nothing but eggs, bread and butter, tea, coffee, &amp;c.—I am not able to say whether he was drunk at that time—he might have been drinking previously—he certainly walked into my room like a sober man, and he walked home with me like one—I did not attribute his acts to drunkenness—at the same time he used the expression, "Don't you see they are running round? They are following me!"—I remember his once telling me that he was the owner of a place called Cromwell Hall, an estate in Essex—he told me how many acres of ground there were connected with the estate, that he was lord of Cromwell Hall, and that I should have a suit of black to reward me for the trouble I had taken with him, which caused a deal of jealousy among the young men I was acquainted with, that they had not taken a deeper interest in him—I always believed him to be insane, so much so that, although he was very fond of my little girl, and caressed her, and took her up, and gave her pence, I told my wife not to leave her in his possession—I would not trust him, though I thought he was right in his feelings he was wrong in his mind—he said his mother-in-law told him after he had been married a few weeks that his wife had a child in the Foundling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You knew that he had taken a good deal to drink? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At times—I never saw a man suffering from <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—I am not aware that he had taken too much to drink when he flourished the poker about—I have said that he walked home with me like a sober man, but I was not a judge—he may have been drinking, because he was suffering from the influence of drink—I may have a doubt about it, because I had not been in his company—he certainly did not seem to be drunk—he was not what men call drunk—I don't know whether he was under the influence of drink—drink may leave its effects for days, for aught I know—I never was drunk, so I don't know the feeling—I gave him coffee and other things simply because I thought they were most suited to a man whose mind was wandering and uncalm—I once had him lodging at my house for a month, during which time he was a teetotaller—that is two years ago—I don't know whether he took to drinking directly he left—he did not always attend to his business like other men—I have seen him leave a good black coat and get a soldier's coat and do that which in my estimation no person would do, put aside good work to do that at which he could scarcely earn his bread—I know what he was paid for his work—he told me he worked for some one near Portland Place—he made me a suit of clothes, for which I paid him, which tailors have remarked as being first-rate work-man ship—I have not seen him since he has been in custody—the last time I saw him was about last June twelve months—I was then a master shoe-maker, and he came to me and said, "My little boy is likely to get cold," and he bought a pair of new boots.</p>

Q.</hi> Is the receipt book open to anybody in the office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is usually kept in the office, in the safe—the book-keeper has charge of the safe, although it is not always locked—Mr. Roberts is the present book-keeper, he is here—no doubt other persons could get to it; I can do so at any time—the receipts may not be filed im<lb/>mediately they are given, it would depend upon how prompt the book-keeper was in his duties—the prisoner was book-keeper at this time—considerable amounts passed through his hands, perhaps 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—that would be made up of several items, usually of sums not less than 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he would also have to pay out the expenditure of the week; that would be, perhaps, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—it would be his duty to pay the balance into the bank, or hand it to me—all cheques were paid into the bank, and sometimes cash—when I wanted cash I asked him for it, and he entered it in the cash-book, and I initialed it, and what was not required he paid into the bank—I think the whole of this cash-book is in his handwriting—I cannot tell by looking at the cash-book whether the entries were made on the day on which they purport to be entered; they should be made the same day as the money is received—these are not copies from any other books, they are original entries—these entries, on the 28th, may have been made at different times, or he may have put his pen into a different inkstand—I am not in the habit of examining the cash-book every day—I don't think it is balanced every day—there might be two or three days elapse without any entries being made in the cash-book, if there were no receipts, or if the book-keeper did not do his duty—the prisoner's duties did not take him out a good deal—I never knew him go out for orders, although he may have done—his duties were to remain in the office, receive moneys, and pay out—he went to the bank—if money was paid during his absence it was handed over to him on his return—I or Mr. Martin, my salesman, might attend to his duties during his absence, or the females in attendance might; if they sold a dozen needles they would receive the money—I don't know that they have ever received 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Martin would usually be in attendance—money has often been received in the prisoner's absence—I could not say what sums—in his absence Mr. Martin might pay on account, or I might—I don't know that any one else would—I think no one has ever made a payment for adver<lb/>tisements except the prisoner and myself—I have made most of them, usually when he was present—I usually gave cheques for them—it would be his duty invariably to make the entry in the cash-book—any pay<lb/>ing money would probably report it to him and hand him over the vouchers—that is supposing everything done correctly—he would put the voucher in the book, which we call filing it, and from that he would make the entry in the cash-book—I cannot tell by looking at the order book what sum was due to the <hi rend="italic">Nonconformist</hi> on 28th April, because I cannot tell</p>

I am a police officer"—he said, "Oh! I had it from that gentleman," pointing to Graves—I said, "I shall take you both in custody; a lady has been recently robbed of that cheque, having had her pocket picked in the City Road"—Graves shortly afterwards said to Brown, "What's the good of telling that lie? You never had the cheque from me"—Brown then said, "No, I did not have it from that gentleman; I picked it up in a taproom of a public-house, and a highly respectable tradesman saw me pick it up"—I asked him for the name and address of that gentleman—he said he lived somewhere in London, but he could not give me his name or address—Brown was not wearing a watch—he had what they call a <hi rend="italic">duffing</hi> guard, and a metal ring on—a purse with nothing in it was found on Graves.</p>

I should, you b—fool"—she took it after that without my consent—I left the house, and after I got a few yards they rushed on me behind, knocked me about, scratched my face, and knocked my hat in—I had a hand-saw in my hand—Winterbourne held my other hand while Mills twisted it out of my hand—Mills ran away with the saw—they did not take anything else from me—they did not hurt me a great deal, only by scratching my face—Mills ran away with the saw—I held Winterbourne, called a policeman, and gave her in charge—this is my saw (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have had it some time—I know it well—I was quite sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Winterbourne</hi>. The prosecutor met me at four o'clock, took me to a house, and called for a pint of fourpenny ale, and then Mills came in with another man—the two men entered into a dispute about who would make the best four-inch door—he wanted me to pledge his saw, as he had broken the pledge and wanted to keep up the <hi rend="italic">spree</hi>—I would not pawn it, but he gave it to Mills, who had pawned a handkerchief of his before. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. Mills never pawned a handkerchief for me—I did not go to a pub<lb/>lic-house with Winterbourne—I had not been at Mills's house—she never pawned a handkerchief for me—I had never seen either of the prisoners before—it was not quite seven—it was broad daylight.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a potman, and work at No. 255, Euston Road—I have known the prisoners for about eight or nine years—I have seen them together frequently—nearly three years ago I gave evidence on a trial against two girls named Murphy, whom I have seen in company of the three prisoners—since that Nolan has spoken to me on the subject, but only when he has been in liquor—he said he would give me a good hiding the first time he got a chance—he said that every time he was in liquor, not when he was sober—on Sunday night, the 12th August, I was at the corner of Tottenham Court Road, smoking my pipe—it was near on half-past twelve o'clock—I had not seen the prisoners on that day beforethen—I saw Nolan, Gairdelli, Cane, and two others coming from an ice shop about twenty yards from me—they came close against me, and Nolan began to bully me, and called me a b—policeman's <hi rend="italic">nark</hi>—that means a man who watches out for the police—I told him I was not a policeman's <hi rend="italic">nark</hi>, and why should he come up insulting me as he had done for the last three years, and he then repeated that I was a policeman's <hi rend="italic">nark</hi>—(the other prisoners were within hearing)—I told him I was not, when Gairdelli seized me by the collar with his left hand, put his hand to my stomach and stabbed me with a knife—I saw the knife in his hand when he was coming from the ice shop—he was spinning it in his hand, throwing it up and catching it—it was an open pocket-knife, with a spring back—I had seen him throwing up the knife before Nolan spoke to me, and when he caught me by the collar I saw the knife in his hand—he caught me in this way, saying, "Take that; I will rip your b—guts up"—I felt as if water was trickling from my stomach, and found there was blood from my hand when I drew it from my stomach—I showed it to them, and Gairdelli then said, "Take that, you b—that will do for you"—when he said that, the knife was in his hand—Nolan then said to Gairdelli, "Give me the knife and take your b——hook"—Gairdelli threw the knife to Nolan, who was close against him—it did not fall to the ground, it was caught by Nolan—it was open then—Nolan wiped the knife, closed it, and put it in his right-hand trousers pocket—Gairdelli stooped down among the gang of chaps that were there, and got away—there were three more besides the five I have mentioned—while this was occurring Cane was standing amongst them; the other three came up after I was stabbed—at the time I was stabbed there were only the three prisoners and the two girls—Cane was near enough to hear all that occurred—after Nolan put the knife in his pocket he went away—Cane stood at the corner, and as I was making my way to the hospital he followed me, and came behind and kicked me in Tottenham Court Road, as I clung to a cab, while staggering to the hospital—he did not say a word to me—I said, "All right, Ted; I shall know you"—I was taken into the hospital and properly attended to—Nolan was in liquor—Gairdelli and Cane were sober.</p>

I live at 21, Earl Street, Old Kent Road—I was the driver of the van belonging to the Brighton and South Coast Company—I saw the shaft of the cab catch the deceased in the right shoulder—he had not passed in front of my van—he came down the side, as near as I could judge—he must have been walking at the side of my van in the street, the same way as the horses were going, not on the pavement—I thought he was trying to get in front of my horses—I was going towards Eastcheap—the cab was meeting me, and when I turned my head I saw the shaft of the cab knock him down, and before I had time to pull up my horses my near wheel went over him—I do not think he had time to get out of the way on the pavement—my van was on one side of him, and the cab on the other—I thought he was going to cross in front of my horses; he was going straight ahead—the cab caught him before he got by and knocked him down, and I had not time to pull up—I could not swear as to how the cabman was driving.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Hare Court, Temple, and am a bar<lb/>rister and professor of Hindoo law—on Saturday evening, 25th August, or the morning of the 26th, about half-past two o'clock, I was in Oxford Street, on my way home, and saw a fire—I was anxious to see if it would affect the locality of the British Museum—I turned a little way down Broad Street, and found it was in Museum Street—I stood looking at the fire not many seconds—the crowd appeared rather thinner at one place, in consequence of a plug being drawn—I skirted the crowd, and, seeing an opening a quarter or half a yard wide, I went along it about nine feet, when I found the people in advance of me were stopped, and I thought I had better go back, as the people were rather restless—I had taken my chain off before going into the crowd, and put it into my waistcoat pocket, so as not to offer any attraction to them, and I put my handkerchief in my hat—I had a silk umbrella in my hand, of which this is the handle—I</p>

               <p>turned round and took two steps in retreat, when a man on my right said, "Now then," and seized my umbrella—I saw the prisoner there, but whether he actually seized me I cannot say—one man said, "Give it to the governor"—another said, "Go in, go in"—five or six others advanced to me—the man pulled at my umbrella with great violence, and left the handle in my hand—I found that they were feeling my waistcoat, and said, "That is your game, is it?" and struck blows out, which kept them away about a yard, but somebody came behind me and bonneted me—I turned round, and I believe I hit that man with my left fist—the prisoner then came behind me and gave me a violent blow on my hat, which I should have felt if it had not been for my handkerchief—I turned round and saw the prisoner behind me, and saw 113 F a yard and a half before me—three or four people were trying to prevent him coming—he said, "All right, sir, I see him," and pounced on the prisoner, caught him by the collar, and held him till another constable came—the prisoner said, "Do not take out your truncheon, I will walk quietly"—113 F pushed him out of the crowd and took him to the station—I then missed my emerald shirt pin, which was worth, I should think, considerably more than 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> (Policeman 117 E). I was employed to watch the post office at 26, Oxford Street, from the Friday preceding the 11th September—I was watching on the 11th September, at about half-past five in the morning, and saw the prisoner picking up straws—he then went to the post office, turned his back to the aperture of the receiving-box, looked up and down the street for half a minute, and then turned towards the slit in a stooping position, when I immediately saw smoke arise as if from matches—I saw something white in his hand, and saw him place it in the box—I quietly crossed the street—he ran away as soon as he saw me—I followed him 300 yards, and caught him at Regent Circus—I charged him with at<lb/>tempting to set fire to the post office—he said, "Not me"—he had some</p>

               <p>straws in his left hand at the time—I took him to the station and found these two stones and some paper and straw on him—I then went to the post office, and found in the box these six matches, three burnt and three not burnt, this paper, and I should guess over twenty letters.</p>

I am assistant to Mr. Cooper, who keeps a chemist's shop and post office at 26, Oxford Street—for six or eight mornings prior to 11th September I found straws, firewood, matches, shavings chips, and paper in the letter-box, and on two occasions matches—I was not there on the 11th September, but I afterwards found a mark as if a match had been lighted—there were letters in the box on each occasion—nothing could be put in from the inside, as the box was locked—we had large quantities of turpentine, spirits of wine, and perfumes near the box, and if the window had caught fire it would have been blown out—there was only half an inch of deal between the letters and the spirits of wine.</p>

I produce three labels, numbered 10, 377, 10, 399, and 10, 363, which I took from three mats of sugar which I found on a barge at Lee, on the Middlesex side of the river, about 9.45 on the morning of the 4th September—the barge had been lying at Wheatsheaf Wharf, Wapping, on the 4th August—the mats were full of sugar, and one of them was cut open—they were taken to the station—they belonged to Thomas Pillow and Sons, master lightermen—I received information, watched the barge, and in about an hour saw the prisoners come into Wheatsheaf Wharf—they walked on to the jetty, and I saw George slide down a pole into the barge</p>

               <p>—he then walked to the head, lifted up a flap, and pulled down this bag of sugar (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and cut it open—he then pulled down this empty sack and ran away—Charles was looking at him, and could see all he did—Charles ran away, and George got up, climbed up the pole, and was run<lb/>ning through the wharf when I stopped him—I am sure he had not seen me—I asked him what business he had in the barge—he said that he never was in it—the barge in which the sugar was was on the opposite side of the river.</p>

               <p>very likely—I did not describe it as a flourishing business, because it was not flourishing—the shop is in very good order, and if it had been conducted well it would have been a good business—I described it as a baker's business—of course I concealed the fact that it was a bad business—I wished to have another tenant—I did not say to the prisoner, "I have got a gentleman with 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to invest in the business, and we must not lose him; we must make things look as well as we can; you must tell him the rent and taxes are paid"—I knew Mrs. Loose, the prisoner's mother—she was living in the house—I did not in her pre<lb/>sence tell the prisoner that a gentleman was coming after the busi<lb/>ness, and that he was to be sure and say that the rent and taxes were all paid—I swear positively I never said so, or anything like it—I did not on any occasion in her presence tell the prisoner to order flour and sign my name to the letters—I have seen James Loose, the prisoner's brother—I don't know him—he lives in the house—I did not in his presence say to the prisoner, "Make use of my name in any way you like to get flour, and sign my name to the letters"—certainly not—I don't know a person of the name of Eliza Downing—(<hi rend="italic">called in</hi>)—she is the niece of the prisoner—there were half a dozen living on me—she is one of them—I did not say to the prisoner in her presence, "If you are going to write about coals or flour you can sign my name to the letters"—I don't know Alfred Downing—(<hi rend="italic">called in</hi>)—I don't recollect his face, and I don't think I ever saw him—I did not in his presence, about twelve months ago, give a paper to the prisoner, and tell him to make a fair copy of it, and sign my name at the bottom—these premises were about being pulled down—for three years they have been going to pull them down, and that was the reason why I did not put in an execution—I would not take the chance of being murdered, perhaps, by these people, when they would be sent out by the company—that was the reason the prisoner agreed to forego any claim that he might have for compensation for the pulling down of the premises; but what claim could he have?—he agreed to forego any claim of his—he had no business—I did not offer him anything—I was always asking for money—I had no understanding with him—I put in a distress for rent when I heard of the forgery—that was too strong—I may have said I would allow him 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for bread and potatoes if he would give up pos<lb/>session to Mr. Smith—I was always trying to get him to give up possession—I did not offer it myself—I was telling him to get out of the place, and do the best he could, if Mr. Smith would take him; but Mr. Smith would have nothing to do with the shop since the forgery—the distress may have been put in before the forgery—I don't know that it was before the distress was put in that I told him if he gave up possession he would have some allowance made him—very likely I said that I would make an allowance to him of all that was due, if he would give up possession quietly—I promised him nothing myself, except to forgive him all that was owing to me—I always said that, before and after the distress, and begged him to leave the place quietly—he owed me 89<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had discovered the forgery before I put in the distress—I never promised to let him go for the forgery—I always said that if he would leave the house I would forgive him all he owed me—he always refused to give up—I never spoke to him after the forgery—I sent my coachmen to him, and said, "Tell that man to go quietly out of the house, and I will not ask him for a penny of what he owes me; he owes me 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I make him a present of it; but he must leave the place quietly"—my coachman brought me back word that he would go, but he never</p>

I live at 17, Winchester Terrace, Kentish Town—on 3rd August, in the afternoon, I was hanging some birds out at my back window, and saw Mrs. Edwards and the prisoner in the yard, where some clothes were hanging—Mrs. Edwards was taking her clothes off the line, and the prisoner began smacking her face with her hand—Mrs. Edwards said, "I do not want to hit you," and was walking backwards towards the kitchen door—the prisoner gave her a good smack, and ran and got a clothes prop, took hold of the thick end of it, aimed at her face, and caught her in the eye—she said, "I will have my revenge," and Mrs. Edwards fell on her knees, with her face covered by her hands—I did not hear her say anything about her eye—I was only at my window at the beginning of it, and then I was by the wall, not ten yards off—the prisoner then took two large quilts off the line, and threw them over the deceased as she lay on the ground—the deceased's sister was looking out at a window, and the prisoner threatened her with the same if she would come down—the deceased did not take hold of the prop at all—she was taken upstairs, and there was a doctor and a female or two there.</p>

I am a warehouseman to Mr. Mungo McGeorge, of Friday Street, London, Manchester warehouseman—the prisoner was in his employ as assistant warehouseman, and had been there between nine and ten years, I think—on the evening of Friday, 24th August, I saw the prisoner leaving the warehouse, and followed him—I noticed an unusual bulk in his coat pocket—I followed him to the corner of the Mansion House, then stopped him, and said, "What have you got in your pocket, William?"—he said, "I have got a paper"—I said, "You have got more than one paper"—he said, "Yes, I have got two"—I said, "It is more bulky than that, William; you must show me what you have got"—he then hesitated for a moment, and then said, "Shall I go back to the warehouse with you?"—I said, "Certainly"—he then walked back to the warehouse, and he took this</p>

I live at 14, Lismore Road, Kentish Town—I have known the prisoner for twenty years, or something like that—about the 14th of March the prisoner's clerk Anderson brought me this bill—upon that I went to the prisoner with it, and said, "Mr. Curnock, this acceptance seems rather different from what your brother's usually is"—of course I had done a few for him before—he said, "It is all right, it is my brother's acceptance "—he said the bill had been given for manure, I believe, and gravel—upon that I gave him a cheque for 137<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., less 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. dis<lb/>count—I gave him 132<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in two cheques, one of 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the other of 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that bill was dishonoured—I afterwards went to the prisoner and saw him about it—I heard there were forged bills out, and I asked him whether that was a genuine bill, and he said no, it was a forgery—I then asked him how much had been forged—he said, "About 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "Mine is more than that"—he said he hardly knew then what amount his</p>

                  </hi> (E 9 Sergeant). On the 25th August, about eleven o'clock, accompanied by Constables Foley and Blissett, I went to Castle Street, Long Acre—I saw Perrot come out of the house No. 24, Castle Street, with two parcels under his arm—I watched him to a pawn-broker's in Cranbourne Street, Leicester Square—he returned to 24, Castle Street—I did not see him come out of the pawnbroker's—I returned to Castle Street—he had not the parcels in his hand then—he went into the house, and came out again in about two minutes with Rogers—they both stayed in conversation in the street—I went up to them and took them into custody, with the assistance of the two other officers—Foley spoke to them in French—I took them back to 24, Castle Street, to the second floor back room, which the landlady pointed out as the place where Rogers lived—he opened the door with a key, which he brought from his pocket with my assistance, as he was handcuffed at the time—I found a large sheet on the bed tied up, containing this property (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—a great deal is marked "Henry Selim"—I then took both of them to the station—I afterwards went to 24, Arthur Street, Oxford Street—I found Rousinot living there in the second floor front room—Foley spoke to him in French—I saw a bench fitted up, and on the top of the bench there were a number of files and rasps (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I also found in a drawer of the same bench a number of skeleton keys and other keys (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I also found three crucibles—I took him into custody—I then went to 45, London Street, where Perrot lived—in the front parlour, which I was informed of by the landlady, in a box I found the whole of this property, dresses, shawls, and other things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I found also there this rope ladder (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have no doubt that this was used in committing the burglary—I found this under the bed in a bag—there was not a passport or any papers in the bag.</p>

I am a seaman—on the evening of 28th August I was at No. 11, Ship Alley—the prisoner also lived there—when I came in I heard a quarrel between prisoner and the landlady, about some money—I said to him, "If you don't pay her you are no man"—he asked me what I had to do with it—I said, "I am no more in the house than you are, but I like to see things go on in rights"—I used no gesture in using these words—the prisoner then got hold of me and tried to heave me over the table—I said, "Hold on," and pulled my coat off—nothing unfair in the fight occurred till he hit me under the chin—after I got my coat off I hit him back and made his nose bleed—I took a candle and went out in the yard with him because he said he did not want to fight me—I said, "Neither do I you"—I then went into the yard and washed his nose—we shook hands and got friends again—when we got into the house again the mistress said, "All are quiet; if you want to sleep go up in the berth "—he said, no, he did not want to sleep in the house any more—he says to me "I want you to come along with me to the man who told you I was trying to cheat the mistress"—I said, "All right, I'll come along with you"—he went before me, and I was going to follow him, but when I saw him putting his hand</p>

I am surgeon to the H division of police, and reside at No. 2, Spital Square, Spitalfields—on the morning of 29th August I was called to the Arbour Street station to see the prosecutor—I found an incised wound on his forehead—it appeared to be produced by some sharp instrument—this knife is a likely instrument to have produced it—he had also a wound in his head, and a more serious punctured wound at the back of his shoulder—for the wound on the forehead and the wound on the shoulder some considerable violence must have been used—the one in the head was slighter in its character—there were three distinct blows.</p>

Are you the master of the house?"—he then struck me in the face, that my mouth and nose bled—directly afterwards he said, "You want to cheat the mistress, and you don't want to pay her anything"—I then said to him, "Who has told you so?"—he then named another man—I said, "Of course if I want to cheat her I can do so if I like "—he then struck me a second time in the face, and made my mouth and nose bleed—I then went into the yard to wash my face—he went with me—we then made it up together, and I said to him, "Come and show me the man who has told you so"—I then went into the house, and he followed afterwards—I then went outside the street door, thinking he was going to follow me—when he came outside I said, "Come and show me the man"—he then opened the door, and with one step out of the door got hold of me by the hair of my head—I then laid</p>

               <p>day—he came home before my husband, I think when he got paid—I saw him leave the house, and go out about four o'clock—he was then sober—I think he returned about eight, tipsy—I saw him in the passage as he was going out, partly lying down—me and my husband assisted him on to his feet, and he went upstairs into the room with us—it was then that my husband told me to fetch half a gallon of beer—while the prisoner was in the room he made an offensive remark about me having slept with a man named Murray—it was very bad language that he made use of—he told my husband to kiss his—my husband became angry, and told him to leave the room—that was about a quarter-past eight, or rather better—there was no quarrelling at that time—the prisoner did not leave the room when my husband told him to do so—he remained in the room about a minute, and was then taken up to his own room by his wife and another person—he made use of some bad language on the stairs, and my husband put one foot on the second step, and said, "You scoundrel, if you make use of that language to my wife I will bring you down by the leg," and he kicked my husband over the eye as he was on the stairs—I and my hus<lb/>band then went downstairs, and remained there above an hour—I then heard Mrs. Murphy call out, "There is Murphy in Sullivan's room, breaking his things"—my husband said, "My God! breaking my things?" and he turned round and went upstairs very quickly—I followed him in about a minute—when I got up I saw my husband lying down, and Murphy lying on the top of him—my husband's head and shoulders were in his own room, and his legs on the landing—I had not heard any words of quarrelling, or any blows struck before I went up—if there had been any quarrelling I think I should have heard it, as I was coming up the stairs—I took the key out of my door, and struck Murphy in the head with it as well as I was able, to make him let my husband go—I heard my husband say, very slowly, "Murphy, you have bit me; don't bite me"—when I found he would not desist, and let my husband go, I chucked the key away, and I rose Murphy off my husband by the hair of his head—I pulled him off; my husband tried to stand up, but he reeled and fell, and put his hand under his head—he spoke no more—it was about half-past nine at that time—it was dark, but there was a candle on the stairs—my husband was sober when he went upstairs—he had been out at the door before this, but not above two or three minutes—he had drank nothing but his tea whilst he was in the house—I did not find that he was bleeding from a wound in his side until the doctor came—it is a very dark landing where he fell; it is not so narrow—there were other lodgers in the house at the time, and they came up, and I said my husband was dead—a policeman came—I afterwards found a blade of a knife where my husband was killed—I found it next morning when I was wiping the landing—the prisoner went downstairs after my husband fell—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the blade I found—I had seen the prisoner with a four-bladed knife previous to this that had a white handle, but it was dirty, and it had like silver at the bottom of it—it was something like this knife (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>), but not the same handle—I saw the knife in Murphy's pos<lb/>session in my room at the time I had a child lying dead about eight weeks ago—I found this blade in the flannel as I was wiping the passage—at that time the crack on it looked quite fresh, but it got wet—I took it to the station-house myself.</p>

I could not exactly say where I struck him, I was very much excited, and I struck him everywhere I could—I had a knife in my hand that night eating my tea with it, cutting some meat; but that was a large table knife—I had that in my own room at my own table—I did not take the knife upstairs when I ran up—I had not taken it downstairs with me—it was in my own room that I had it—I believe there was a bite on my husband's hip—there was no blood there, only very small drops indeed—Mrs. Gale was the person who helped the prisoner's wife to take him upstairs—she was not in my room—there was no one in my room but Murphy, me, and my husband—I do not know whether there is any other person here who saw Murphy with a knife—I found this blade on the landing outside our room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Maurice Game, a labourer, living at 34, Royal Mint Street—I saw the deceased on the evening in question about eight o'clock—he was in drink, but he was often <hi rend="italic">drunker</hi> than he was then—the prisoner was very tipsy indeed—he was not able to walk or talk—he could hardly tell where he lived—when he came up to the house he could only say, "Thirty-four, thirty-four"—a man brought him to the door—he went away, leaving him standing there—he had to lay in the passage, and Mr. and Mrs. Sullivan, I believe, carried him upstairs—about nine o'clock I came to the door and saw Mr. and Mrs. Murphy going upstairs—Mrs. Sullivan was dragging him up, hallooing that her husband was dead—he was not dead at that time—I saw him when he was dead—it was about twenty minutes or half an hour afterwards—I had heard Mrs. Murphy cry out, "Oh! my God, my husband is breaking Mr. Sullivan's things," and with that Sullivan ran upstairs—I was upstairs at the time—I heard a row, but did not go to look at it—I heard a lot of things break<lb/>ing when Sullivan ran up and while he was running up—Byrne was not there at that time—he came up shortly after—he was there before the deceased was dead—Mrs. Donoghue told him to go upstairs, and I saw him run up—Mrs. Sullivan was upstairs then—I do not think it was above five minutes after that she went up that Byrne went up—I did not go up till I heard Mrs. Sullivan halloo out, "Oh! my God, my husband is dead"—that was about twenty minutes or half an hour after she ran up, as near as I could judge—I saw Murphy go out to go to the doctor's—it was not until after he came from the doctor's, and had gone up to his own room, that Mrs. Sullivan called out that her husband was dead—I did not go up before that—she had not been upstairs above five minutes before she hallooed out—Murphy was in his own room at that time—when I went up there was only there Mrs. Sullivan and another Mrs. Sullivan who lives at the top of the house—I did not see Byrne there then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the College of Surgeons—I was called into the deceased on Saturday, the 1st September, about twenty minutes to eleven—I found him dead—I examined the body externally—there were four wounds, one an incised one, behind the left ear, a contused wound over the right eyebrow, one over the right or left hip, I forget which (that was a lacerated and contused wound; the teeth would have done that),</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186609170089"/>
               <p>and one on the left side of the chest punctured—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—death was the result of a punctured wound of the heart—that corresponded with the wound on the left side under the nipple—I found the body was otherwise healthy, comparatively speaking—there was a good deal of internal hemorrhage—such an instrument as this knife-blade might have produced that wound—it seemed to correspond with it, as far as length and breadth went—I think a knife similar to this could scarcely cut through the rib without breaking—it had cut through the rib, which is rather unusual—it completely divided the rib—the blow must have been given with considerable force—death would be almost instantaneous—it was the left ventricle of the heart that was punctured. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would you expect if it was broken by the collision with the rib that it would be rejected by the wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot speak as to that point—I see no reason why it should be rejected, unless possibly by the heart's action it might be thrown out—it punctured the bony part of the rib, completely dividing it—before the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> I was unable to discover whether the chest had been punctured or not, on account of not being able to penetrate into the rib, as it had closed again—I do not think the rib would be depressed before the knife would go through it—I do not think the rib was elastic enough to allow of that, being in the nature of an arch—there is no doubt it was a punctured wound, and such an instrument as this might have caused it—the knife might possibly be rejected from the wound—the knife might have been broken in withdrawing it.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at No. 5, James Street, Hyde Park—I am a member of the College of Surgeons, and an M.D. of Aberdeen University—I am also one of the governors of St. Mary's Hospital—I have been in the habit of attending the Craven Hill Chapel, at Bayswater—the prisoner Cracknell was a member of that congregation, but has not been for some time—there was a youth's institute connected with the chapel, at which there have been soirees given from time to time—I and the prisoner have attended those soirees with the other members of the congregation—I was first secretary to the institute for the first year, and afterwards vice<lb/>president—in December, 1864, in consequence of my position at the insti<lb/>tute, I gave a soiree at my own house, to which all the members of the institute, without exception, were invited—amongst the others, Cracknell came—his father is a plumber and glazier, and I employed him to do some work for me at my house—Cracknell assisted in doing that work—after-wards some work was to be done; I was to pay for the materials, and Crack<lb/>nell was to find the labour; that was the arrangement—I was dis<lb/>satisfied with the charges, and I declined to employ the father any further—I employed another tradesman of the name of Stevenson instead, two or three doors off Cracknell's father—I cannot remember the date at which Cracknell was last employed for me, my solicitor has the bills—I should think it was about four months since—the prisoner afterwards applied to me for a character for honesty and integrity, and I declined to give such a character—while he was employed at my house the dog of a friend of mine that I had charge of, bit him—on Wednesday, the 5th of this month, I came home from evening service at Craven Hill Chapel about a quarter to nine—I did not find the two prisoners waiting in my dining-room when I got home—I was subsequently informed that they were there waiting—I went into the dining-room and found them there—I had never seen Walker before, and did not know who he was—I had not seen Cracknell for some three or four months before—when I went into the room I said, "Oh! Cracknell, how are you? Will you be seated?"—the prisoners were very much confused apparently—Walker said, "He has come to speak to you, sir, upon what took place some time ago"—I said, "What do you mean?"—Cracknell said, "You know what I mean"—I said, "How should I know what you mean?"—Walker said, "He has come to speak to you, sir, about what you did together some nine months back"—I said, "What's that? Why don't you speak out?"—Cracknell hesitated and seemed not at all</p>

               <p>inclined to offer any explanation, and Walker said, "The fact is, sir, he accuses you of an abominable offence"—I said, "Surely, Cracknell, you have not said such a thing as this of me?"—Cracknell said, "Yes, you know you did, and I will swear to it before any judge, but don't make a noise; nobody knows anything about it, and I should like to see you by yourself"—I said, "You vile fellow, what can have possessed you to make such a false charge as this?"—he said, "I would rather speak to you by yourself"—I said, "Mrs. Juler is in the next room, but I will ask her to step out if you wish"—I asked her and she stepped out—I then opened the door and Cracknell and myself walked in—Cracknell shut the door after him—I immediately opened it, and said, "I can't see what you have to say to me alone; if you have got anything to say, why not speak out"—I found he would say nothing, and therefore Walker, who had entered the room when I opened the door, left it, and closed the door after him—I then said, "Now, Cracknell, what have you got to say?"—he kept his eyes fixed on the carpet, and played with the carpet with a stick that he had in his hand—I said, "I understand that you accuse me of indecent conduct?"—he said, "Yes, you know you did"—I said, "Tell me what I did. Do you intend to go so far as to accuse me of sodomy?"—he said, "I don't know what that is"—I said, "You cannot have been in workshops without knowing what that means"—he still hesitated, and said he did not know what it meant, and said, "Well, I will tell you what it is" (<hi rend="italic">the witness here described the offence in question</hi>)—he hesitated a minute or two, and then said, "Well, that is what you did to me"—I said, "Oh! pray, for God's sake, Cracknell, don't accuse me of such a thing as that; you surely don't know what you are doing; I never did such a thing as that in my life"—I then opened the door and said, "He accuses me of an abominable offence"—Walker was then in the next room, the front room—there are two folding doors between the rooms—Crack-nell said, "We will come and speak to you again; we will come again, sir"—I said, "What can be your motive for preferring such a charge as that against me?"—Cracknell said, "I was thinking of some compensation"—I said, "What do you mean by compensation?"—Walker said, "You see, sir, he has been ill, and a few pounds would be very useful to him just now"—I said, "Oh! I see your motive," and Cracknell said that he was prepared to swear before any judge, and Walker said that they intended to see it to the end—Cracknell seemed somewhat frightened and anxious to leave, and he said, "Sir, we will call again; when can we see you?"—I said, "You can see me at any time"—Cracknell said, "We will come to-morrow night"—Walker said, "You know I cannot come to-morrow night," and Cracknell said, "Well, come on Friday night"—Walker said, "Yes, we will come on Friday night." Because, "said Cracknell," as you have joined me in this matter, I wish you to come again with me "—Cracknell then told me who the other young man was, that he was his cousin, and that his name was Robert Walker—I said, "Where does he live?"—he hesitated, and then said, "He will tell you that himself"—they then agreed to come at eight o'clock on Friday night—I said, "I cannot think, Cracknell, what has possessed you to make such a false charge as this against me," and I said to his cousin, "I have to thank you for telling me what his motive was"—I said, "I have been a good friend to you, Cracknell," and Cracknell held out his hand and said, "Dr. Juler, I don't wish to be unfriendly with you"—I said, "How can we be friends? You must withdraw your statement, make an apology, and hope</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186609170092"/>
               <p>for my forgiveness"—Walker said, "Yes, you cannot be friends; you must apologise and ask his forgiveness"—I believe my servant Wesley then shewed them out of doors—I did not take Cracknell's hand—directly after they had gone I communicated with my son, and arranged for him to be at home on the Friday when they came—On the Friday evening I was in the back drawing-room, and my son in the front room, a curtain being between—they both called about eight o'clock that night, and were shown up by Wesley, the page—I entered the back drawing-room and said, "Well, is it the same game to-night?"—they said, "Yes, sir, I suppose so"—I don't know which one said that—I said, "Have you well considered this matter?"—Cracknell said, "Yes, sir, and we intend to go on with it"—Walker said, "Yes, so would I"—I said, "Well now, what do you accuse me of?"—Cracknell said, "Well, sir, the same as yesterday"—I said, "Well what is it that you accuse me of? Just state what I did, "and Crack-nell said, "I don't know in what words to put it, sir," and then he said, "It is sodomy, sir"—I said, "Well, go on"—he said, "You did it to me several times," and Walker said, "You pulled * * * as you know what would happen"—I kept asking them to go on, for I was anxious to hear the full statement, what they had to say—Cracknell said, "You un<lb/>buttoned my trousers as I was leaning against the mantelshelf, and did it again"—when he said, "Sodomy, "he said, "There it is, it's out," and Walker said, "That's plain"—I said, "Well, that is what I did; now what do you want?"—Walker said, "He want's compensation, sir"—I said, "What is compensation? What do you mean by compensation?"—Crack-nell said, "I don't know, sir, what such a thing as that is worth; I would not have such a thing as that said of me for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I am inexperienced in these matters"—I said, "Perhaps"—Walker said, "Well, we do read of things, where sometimes from 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is given; I do not know what a judge would give in such a case"—I said, "Well, what do you want? How much do you want?"—Walker said they had not made up their mind as to what to ask—I said, "Oh! you have made up your minds what sum you were to ask before you came in"—they hesitated a long while, and I stepped out of the room a moment, and when I returned I said, "Well, how much?"—Cracknell said, "Well, sir, between 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "Oh! 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? I should think 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a handsome sum"—Cracknell said, "Well, if you look at it in that light, perhaps 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is a handsome sum when you consider that I had not any work to do for it," or words to that effect—Walker said, "The gentleman is only offering you a quarter of what you ask; take half"—they exchanged glances, and then Cracknell said, "It must be between 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., sir. I would not have such a thing as that said of me for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "Well, 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Now what are you going to do for this 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—they both seemed astonished, and Walker said, "Do, sir?"—I said, "Yes. What protection are you going to give me for this 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? How do I know that you, Cracknell, have not mentioned this to some one else?"—he said, "I will give you my word of honour, sir, I have not mentioned it to any one"—I said, "Why you have mentioned it to your cousin"—he said, "Ah! sir, but only to him"—I said, "How do I know that Walker has not mentioned it to some one else?"—Cracknell said, I will pledge you my word that he has not; have you?" (addressing Walker), and Walker said, "No, I am sure I have not"—I said, "How do I know that you will not mention it to some one else?"—Walker said, "Well, we will give you a paper; we will write on a paper," and the boy Wesley brought me up the inkstand and paper—Cracknell said, "Draw</p>

               <p>up something yourself, sir"—I said, "No, I have nothing to do in it; you come here for money, you give the paper"—Cracknell then took the paper and commenced writing, and after having written a paper he pushed it to me and said, "Will that do, sir?"—I said, "No; you have not mentioned here what you charge me with; you have not mentioned the sum of money you require"—Walker said, "No, you must put both them in"—Cracknell said (addressing Walker), "Perhaps you will draw out the paper yourself"—Walker said to Cracknell, "You must put both in, both the nature of the offence and the sum required"—Cracknell kept writing on this piece of paper, filling it up, and he then handed it to Walker to transcribe it on to another piece, a clean sheet, and said, "Perhaps you will write it out"—Walker said, "Oh! no; you draw it up"—Cracknell then tore the piece of paper into many pieces, after having copied it, and after writing the paper he pushed it to me, and asked if that would do—I said, "Yes, I think that will do if you will sign it"—they hesitated a little, particularly Walker, and then affixed their signatures to the paper—I have omitted to say that before this I said to them," Supposing I don't give you the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., what will you do?"—Cracknell said, "I intend to push it; I can swear to it before any judge"—and Walker said, "Yes, we will give you in charge and see it to the end"—that was on the Friday, after the writing was suggested by Walker—he asked me what sort of protection I should require, and I said the kind of protection I should require would be a retractation of the statement, an apology for having made such a statement, and an expression hoping that I might forgive him, and Walker said, "Why, if we were to admit that statement to be untrue, you would call in the police, and we should be transported for life"—and Cracknell said, "No, I am ready to swear it before any judge"—This is the paper that was signed by the prisoners—it was drawn up and signed in my presence. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>) "September 7, 1866. Robert Walker, of 91, Cirencester Street, Harrow Road, and Horatio Cracknell, of 8, Sheldon Street, Bishop's Road, hereby pledge themselves not to divulge or mention to anybody whatever the indecent conduct of Dr. Juler towards Horatio Cracknell upon one occasion of sleeping together, upon condition of having received a sum of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the same. Signed: H. W. Cracknell, Robert Walker." That document was pushed towards me by Cracknell, and I immediately rose up, and said, "Edward, will you witness this"—that was to my son, who was behind the curtain; he is twenty-four years of age—he rushed forward, and Cracknell, turning very pale, reached his hand out and seized hold of the paper, and, looking at Walker said, "I told you this would be so when we came in"—Walker rose and seized hold of Cracknell's hand to wrest the paper from him, and eventually my son took it away from Cracknell and placed it in his pocket, Walker saying, "It is no use"—I took the paper from my son, left the room, and showed it to my wife—I sent for a constable—my son locked the door, and put the key in his pocket—the constable came, and I gave the prisoners into custody—after they were in custody the constable asked them when this occurred, and Cracknell said, "About nine months ago"—they were ultimately taken to the station, and after some time the charge was entered by the acting inspector—I think I was at the station an hour and a half—some law books were consulted—the officer said he did not know how to take the charge—I did not pay the prisoners any</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you known Cracknell? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think nearly two years—I think I first knew him about the early part of '65—I am sure of that—I might have known him in '64 (<hi rend="italic">referring to a paper</hi>)—I am looking at a programme of a <hi rend="italic">soiree</hi> that was held in '65 at the church, and I think that it was in the early part of '65 that I knew Cracknell—I think it is very likely that I may have known him at the latter end of '64, but I cannot call it to memory—he tells me now he is about seventeen years of age—he would be about fifteen in '64—I knew him first by his father coming to put in a pane of glass at mine—I cannot tell whether it was in'64—my solicitor has the bill; he can tell—the father said his son was at the institute, of which I was co-secretary (<hi rend="italic">looking at some bills</hi>)—the first bill is not amongst these—these are partly Cracknell's own bills, and partly his father's—the last I have got here is February 28th, 1865—I am not sure whether that was the first bill or not—that was not the first time he did work at mine—the institute consisted of a number of young men who attended the church—they thought they should like a discussion class, to attend on their spare evenings—it was not held in any particular month, but generally in the winter months—it was kept up while there were any attendants, in November, December, and January—there are meetings held in February and March, but generally after Christ<lb/>mas there are not so many attending—I think I first saw Cracknell at the next meeting of the institute, at the discussion class—the <hi rend="italic">soirees</hi> I speak of were evening gatherings, sometimes at my house, and sometimes at the chapel—there was one in February, 1865—it is impossible for me to say whether it was at that <hi rend="italic">soiree</hi> that I first saw Cracknell—I do not exactly remember when I first saw the father, therefore I cannot say—there was a <hi rend="italic">soiree</hi> in November, 1864, at which I met the boy—there might have been one in December—I will not undertake to swear that I did not see him there—I was in the habit of bringing the boys up to my door after the <hi rend="italic">soiree</hi>, when they left me and bade me good night—they accompanied me voluntarily; I did not bring them—I did not bring Cracknell home to my house to supper after a meeting at the chapel at the latter end of 1864, not to the best of my recollection—his father did not come and ring the bell and ask for him, nor did I answer it and tell him that his son was going to stay all night: I swear that—I have not the least remembrance of it—it is not likely at all, because I do not answer my own door—I never told the father on any occasion that he was going to stay all night, or anything like it—I say most emphatically that he never did stay all night—I did not state at the police-court, in the presence of three constables, "I admit the boy stayed at my house all night"—the sergeant did not reply, "What! in your bed?" nor did I answer, "Yes, in my bed"—I know that man (<hi rend="italic">Sergeant Eames</hi>)—I saw him at the station—he put questions to me and I answered them—I did not say that to him—it is quite a mis<lb/>apprehension—they kept me talking for an hour and a half at the police station—the sergeant said, "Has he ever stayed a night at your house?" and I said, "He may or may not; but not to my knowledge," that was all—it is not at all likely that he said, "What! in your bed?" and that I answered, "Yes, in my bed"—I swear I did not say it—I know James Millard—he was in my service at the latter end of 1864—he left at the beginning of 1865—I gave him verbal notice to leave me on the 10th of December, and I gave him a written one on the 19th of December, 1864, and</p>

               <p>he left on January 19th, 1865—I do not remember while he was in my ser<lb/>vice in the winter of 1865 bringing Crackwell home to supper on the evening of a meeting at the Craven Hill Chapel—I will swear to the best of my recollection that I did not—I am sure I do not know that Millard left Cracknell and myself in the dining-room at supper—he was not always up when I came home from the meetings—he did not leave me there with Cracknell at supper; I swear that—it is a long time ago—it might have happened, not at supper, if the boys had walked home with me to my door from the institute I have some-times had coffee waiting for me and I have said, "Children, will you stop and have a cup of coffee?" and they have generally refused to do so; and as to supper, I have no set supper, I never take suppers—I can state that Cracknell, to the best of my recollection, never came to supper at mine—to the best of my recollection, he and I were never left alone in the drawing-room by Millard—I swear that Cracknell was never with me in my bed—Millard did not bring up a jug of hot water in the morning and see Cracknell in my bed—Cracknell and I did not breakfast together in the morning at my house—I never breakfasted with Cracknell; I swear that—I have never been in the habit of giving boys cigars to smoke—I gave one boy a cigar to smoke who suffered from asthma; that was Ross—I have never given Millard cigars to smoke—I did not like him well enough, and there was no occasion to give my ser-vants cigars to smoke—I swear I never gave him brandy-and-water to drink—he was never in my bed—I never saw Mrs. Cracknell in my life till the other night—I do not know John Kirk, a railway porter (<hi rend="italic">Kirk was called in</hi>)—I do not know that man—I have never seen him until he has been hovering about this court—I swear most positively that I do not know the man—I never saw him till I saw him hovering about here for the last two or three days.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then I suppose it is not true that in the summer of last year that man found you and another man standing under the railings of Kensington Park practising or committing some indecency? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You ask me if it is true, nothing could be more wretched and abominable, and it only shows plainly the line of defence that you have been asked to take in such a case—nothing could be more abominable—I deny it most posi<lb/>tively—I thought he was something of the police kind by the look of him, hovering about outside, and peering into the windows where I was, in a most extraordinary way—but this is a most abominable thing to say, a most cruel thing to say—I swear I never saw him before—at the first part of the conversation Walker said this occurred some time ago, and then afterwards he said nine months ago—that was further on in the conversation—I could not say whether I made use of the expression, "Nine months ago," before the magistrate, unless I saw my deposition—I know that what I said before the magistrate was true—I spoke from the best of my memory—I cannot say why I omitted it before the ma<lb/>gistrate—I was about two hours in giving my evidence, I had been up all night, and had been in a dreadful state with these young men before-hand, and I may have omitted it—I did not call in a constable at the first interview, because I could not clearly understand what he meant by his statement, and because I thought, as he came with a witness and made such a statement as that, I would have it repeated before a witness, and I thought I would go and consult my son what he would advise me to do under tile circumstances—they came creeping into the house, they mights</p>

               <p>Cracknell wrote this paper—I did not dictate it or suggest a word—he asked his cousin whether he should put their address, and he said, "Yes, you had better "—it was the constable who took them in charge who asked Cracknell when this happened, to which he replied, "Nine months ago"—I do not know his name.</p>

This is just what I expected you would do if you were innocent"—my father gave them a good talking to, and he took the paper from me and went down-stairs—I locked the door, and remained in the room with the prisoners—in about twenty minutes a constable came, and they were given into custody.</p>

I am a daughter of the last witness, and live with him—on the 17th August, about six o'clock, I was peeping out at the side of the kitchen window—I had drawn the blind down, as I was frightened, because Mrs. Harper came up about ten minutes to six, when I was mangling at the window, and put her first in, and said that she would smash all the b—windows, and put a piece of steel across my throat if I went out—I went into the back room, as I was frightened, and said, "Mother," she said, "Go and draw down the curtain if yen are frightened"—Mrs. Harper went away then, when she found nobody was there—there was only one there then—I did not see where she went to—when I went back to the front window I saw a sack of shavings brought round the corner by women, but I do not know who; but I saw Mrs. Harper holding it over our fence, and Anna Hitchcock struck a match and put it to the shaving in the middle of the bag, where there was a hole—Mrs. Harper then ran with it to our door in a blaze, and placed it on our doorstep.</p>

I live at 57, Castle Street East—on the evening of 20th August, about half-past nine, I was in Margaret Street, Cavendish Square—the prisoner came up to me, used abusive language to me, and struck me in the face—his three companions came up to me and took my watch from my pocket—they were with him at the time he struck me—my watch fell on the ground—I scrambled for it with them—one of them got it and ran away—I immediately caught hold of one of them and held him—another one came up to me, struck me in the back, and threw my cap away—then they all got away—I looked about for my cap, found it, and hallooed "Stop thief!"—I could not see any of them then—I saw the prisoner again on 27th August, a week after, at George Street—he Was mixed with twelve others, and I picked him out—I had never seen him before the night of the robbery.</p>

I am a ship-keeper, and live in Corder Street, Poplar—on the night of the 14th August, about half-past eleven, I was in Naval Row, Poplar, with a steward of a vessel, whose name was Slade—we were in the "Prince of Wales" public-house—when we came out several seamen followed us out—as I went up the street I called the steward—I was followed presently by that tall man on the right (<hi rend="italic">Collins</hi>), he was called <hi rend="italic">Scotty</hi>, and two or three others—as I got a little distance up he came up to me and flung me on my back—I got up again directly, and said, "Where is my cap?"—he said, "I have not got your cap"—I said, "Some one has; it is a villainous trick to serve a man that way"—I walked on a little farther, calling to the steward, and had got about seven or eight yards, when I was knocked down again by Collins—he jumped on me and said, "I want your money, and I must have it"—I said, "I have got no money"—he said, "You have," and he felt in my pockets, and turned them out—I pulled at my pocket myself as well as I could, but there was another one on me, and that young gentleman there on the left (<hi rend="italic">Young</hi>), he was in the presence, but there was another young fellow much like him, and I can't swear whether it was him or the other—Young was with them at one time, but not at the time of, the robbery—I have been looking ever since to find the other one, but he can't be found—I lost 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. (that was all I had) and my cap—the men got up, and one of the men belonging to the ship said to Collins, "Scotty, leave that man alone, or it will be a bad day for you," and he said to me, "If you molest me I will settle you another time"—with that I got up and ran away, and found a policeman and made a report to him—we went back, and the prisoners were apprehended directly afterwards—Slade is not here to-day—I don't know where he is—I have been trying to find out—he sent no a letter to his lodging to say that he would be there on Sunday evening, but he has not arrived yet.</p>

I live at 9, St. Leonard's Avenue, Bromley, and work on the river—on the night of the 14th August I was near the "Prince of Wales" public-house—I saw the prosecutor come out, and seven or eight men followed him—when they got him out into the road they knocked him down—Collins said to Gray, "You have been robbing that man" (meaning Slade)—he said, "No, I have not; that is my mate, and I am with him"—Collins then struck the prosecutor in the face, and knocked him on the ground—he said, "Now give me your money"—he said, "I have none," and Collins felt in his pocket; what he took from him I can't say—while he was doing that another man knelt on his breast—I don't know who it was—Young was there, and another party very much like him—I did not see any one else but the prosecutor—after Collins took his money he picked him up and knocked him on the ground again, and struck his head on the kerb—I followed them—they beat the steward after that—then the prosecutor got up and ran away—I followed the men till a policeman came up, and saw him take them all—Young was not taken at the same time—the other three are the three who were there.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 35, Friendly Place, Mile End and am a plumber and painter—on Tuesday, 31st August, I went to bed about ten or eleven o'clock—my window was then fastened with a latch and a bolt outside the shutters—on Wednesday morning I woke, and opened the window and shutters—I looked at my watch, it was twenty-five minutes to five—I thought I would have another half-hour in bed, and I closed the window and fastened it—about twenty minutes past five I was awoke, and saw the prisoner in the act of taking my coat from behind the door—there was another man standing by the window, which was open—I jumped up and said, "What is this, and who do you want?" and the pri<lb/>soner jumped out at the window—I looked round, missed my watch and guard, jumped out after him, and ran, with nothing else on but my shirt—a policeman stopped him, and he was taken—the other man got away—my watch went away as well, it was worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was a pane of the window cracked, just behind the fastening.</p>

About five o'clock on Saturday afternoon, the 8th September, I was on duty in Bishopsgate Street Within—I met the prisoner coming from towards Bishopsgate Street Without, close to Wormwood Street—he was carrying this box underneath his arm—it was wrapped up in some brown paper, and also covered over with one of these napkins—I followed him till he got the other side of Thread-needle Street—he then went into a gateway in Bishopsgate Street Within—I followed him there—he then spoke to me, and said, "It is a very wet afternoon, sir"—I said, "Yes, it is"—I then told him I was a police officer, and asked what he had got underneath his arm—he hesitated for a couple of minutes, and then said, "Oh! it is a thing"—I asked what it was—he did not tell me—he was uncovering it at the same time—I said, "Is that silver?"—he said, "Yes"—I asked where he got it from—he said, ""From home"—I said, "Where are you taking it to?"—he said "Home"—I then asked whether he had had it given to him—he said, "No"—I said, "Have you made it then?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Have you bought it?"—he said, "Yes"—I asked where he bought it—he said, "I refuse to tell you"—I then said, I shall take you to the police-station"—he said, "Oh! I knew that"—he also said, "I know where you are going to take me to"—I took him to the station—he then said he had had it left to him by his great grandfather—I searched him, and in his coat pocket behind I found this cruet-stand, mustard-pot, and castor, also this bouquet-holder, three spoons, a pair of scissors, and two napkins marked "Marshman, 12, 65, " also a pocket-book containing this duplicate for a tablecloth—he refused to give his address or any account of himself, and I have not been able to find where he comes from—from inquiries I made, I found the property belonged to Mr. Marshman.</p>

Newbury and Starke, of Doctors' Commons, had called that day, and wanted to be recommended to A florist who could supply him with a large quantity of plants, and that it was Captain Goldsworthy, of the 91st Highlanders, 4, York-Street, St. James's (hand<lb/>ing me his card, which I have lost), who had taken a house at Wimbledon, but had no plants in the garden, and wanted to make a show at once, and had instruted him to get them, and to see that they were large and bloom<lb/>ing—he said that they would be paid for on delivery—I went with him to look the plants out, he selected 3600, there were 50 dozen verbenas, 50 dozen calceolarias, 100 dozen scarlet geraniums, 50 dozan variegated gera<lb/>niums, and 50 dozen large fuchsias—I took that order down in penoil in my pocket-book—no one was with him—he said, "What is the commis<lb/>sion on this order?"—I said, "The usual commission is 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent., but if it is paid on delivery I will allow you the odd money, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. "—he said that he did not want all the money at once—he wanted 12 dozen bedding plants for his ground, and one dozen for his window, which I afterwards supplied him with—the prisoner kept writing letters, telling me not to send the plants to Captain Goldsworthy's, as he was out of town—I found out that the Captain was at Brighton, so there was some truth in it—I did not send the plants, as my suspicious were aroused—I sent the prisoner 13 dozen plants at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen—I have lost the sale of the 3600 plants, they are of no use whatever—I refused taking customers for them—it was two months before I found out that it was a false order—the prisoner wanted his plants at once—he said that he had a week's holiday, and wanted to plant them out—I should not have parted with them had it not been for the representations he made.</p>

On 10th September I went to apprehend the prisoner's daughter, a girl about twelve years old, for stealing a watch—I told her the charge, and she screamed, when the pri<lb/>soner came out of her house and endeavoured to rescue her—she said that she should not go, she would take her home—I told her to be quiet, we were going to take her to the station—I did not, notice anything in her hand at that time—we moved on a little further, and she said, "I will take my daughter home, " and she put her hand round against me—I put my hand up to save myself, and I felt a stab in my hand—it made a deep cut right across my four fingers, in the front part of my hand—I took the prisoner by the wrist, and took this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from her right hand—it is a common shoemaker's knife—if what she did with the knife was done accidentally I should not have attempted to take her into custody—she made a direct blow at me—I still suffer from the cut—it is getting on very well.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, in the employ of Messrs. Stanford, hay and straw dealers—on the evening of the 10th I was in Mr. Giltott's yard, talking to him, and heard a very loud scream from a young girl—I went towards Gunn Street, and there saw this young girl in the hands of an officer in private clothes, and there were two in uniform—she was screaming, "Let me see my poor mother; fetch my poor mother" pre<lb/>sently the mother came running across the road, and said, "What has my poor child done, that she should be taken away?"—no satisfactory answer was given her, and one of the men turned round and said, "What do you do with that knife in your hand?"—she said, "I have been shelling of walnuts"—he said, "Give me this knife"—she said, It is my knife"—he laid hold of the blade of the knife, trying to take it away from her—she held it very fast in her hand—I saw his hand flinch from the knife, and he twisted her arm round, and said, "I will lock you up as well as the child"—I said to him, "Don't hurt the poor woman; she has done nothing wrong"—no answer was made to me, and a man with me said, "Don't you interfere, Bill"—I saw the woman go away, and she was treated very cruelly by the officer—they are total strangers to me—I know nothing of them—I can declare that the prisoner never made any attempt to stab the policeman—I saw him take hold of the blade, to try and take it away.</p>

I am barman at the "Duke of York" tavern, York Road, Lambeth—on the 11th of September, about nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came in—I have known her four years, but I have been in my present situation two years, and during that time I have not lived with her, as I slept at my situation, but I have visited her—we had had words on this day, as for three or four weeks I had not visited her at all—I have provided her with money—there was a report that I was going to get married, and she was jealous—I did not pay any attention to what she said, as I was attending to my business—I was rather off-handed with her—she had something to drink, and stayed about a quarter of an hour, but no conversation passed between us—after she had drank it she threw something, which I believe was vitriol, over me—it went on my back, and burned my waistcoat, and some went on my neck, but that was very slight—this rag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was in the bar, and this is part of the prisoner's dress—they are both burned—I did not see a bottle in her hand—I saw it at the station—I had turned my back on her when this took place.</p>
