On the 10th of February I had a black mare in my possession - my boy turned her into the orchard that night, but I did not see her there; I missed her next morning, the 11th: the prisoner had been at my house twice, but I was not at home the last time. I saw him there nine days or a fortnight before the mare was stolen; I missed her on the Friday morning, and on receiving information I went and watched the prisoner's mother's premises all Friday night; she lives about two miles from me; he had been living there a few months - I should think two months. In the morning I went home, and then went to Coleford, and got an advertisement drawn up. I went to Gloucester on Sunday morning, and to Cheltenham the same day, and then to London; from there I went to Andover, in Hampshire, and got back to London on Saturday morning, about eight o'clock, and saw the mare in possession of Ellis, an officer, at Bow-street; it is the mare I lost: I had her two years last September. She did not look so well as before; she appeared to have been worked hard: her tail had been trimmed and cropped, and her mane a little cut. I am positively sure she is mine. I have seen her here this morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Where did you get her? A. I bought her two years ago last September; she was black, with some little white about her: she had been roughly used. I cannot be mistaken in her; there was a particular mark on her, which I had not noticed before, but my son had. I could pick her out among a thousand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear your wife say she had lent the mare to Probert? A. Never, on any occasion whatever.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife, and know the prisoner; he resided in our neighbourhood some time, at his mother's house; I saw him first last hay making time: he was at our house three times. On Tuesday, the 8th of February, he came about a quarter to eight o'clock in the evening; the mare was then in the fold: I was helping my son to pull her out of the shafts - the prisoner came into the fold, with a candle and lantern in his hand, and his little son with him; he asked me if that was where we kept the mare; I said Yes, sometimes, and that sometimes we turned her out in the orchard; he said nothing more about the mare - he came into the house, and stopped there till a quarter before ten, and then left; my husband was not at home then. I saw the prisoner on Thursday, the 10th, at half-past twelve o'clock in the day time, at his mother's house.</p>

            , JUN. I am fourteen years old, and have known the prisoner a long time - I remember his coming into the fold one evening, when my mother was there - it was dark: he came on Tuesday night, and we lost the mare on Thursday night. I heard him ask my mother if that was where we kept the mare; she said, Yes, in bad weather we kept her there, but of a fine might we turned her out in the orchard. He came into the stable after that, but did not speak to me - I was pulling the gear off the mare. On Thursday night, about dusk, I put her into the orchard - my brother was with me. I shut the orchard gate; it has a spring lock, which catches if the gate is pushed too. I went on Friday morning to look for the mare, and it was gone. I came to town last Monday evening (not before) and have seen the mare in possession of Ellis; it is my father's: she is rather fatter now than before; her tail has been cut since. I am sure it is my father's - it is black, with a white star on the forehead, and a spot on her back, where the saddle had hurt her - I had noticed that many times.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. A star on the forehead is not uncommon? A. No. I cannot make a mistake - I am certain of her. It was brought out of the stable to me in town by the hostler.</p>

            . I am hostler at Mr. Frances's livery stable, Phillimore-place, Kensington. On the 16th of February, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my master's stables, with a black mare; it had a saddle and bridle on, and appeared to have had a hard day's work; he said,</p>
               <p>"Hostler, will you take care of my mare for the night;" I took her into the stable - he followed me in, and said again,</p>
               <p>"Hostler, will you take care of my mare, for I have come a long way - I have come forty miles to day with her." She is about fourteen hands high, and is a strong mare - he told me to feed her well, to take care of her, and give her half a peck of oats,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070004"/>and a feed of beans; he gave me his spurs, and said he did not know that he should fetch the mare himself next day, as he did not know whether he should come that road, and if not he should send for her; he asked my name: I said, Stammers; he asked my Christian name; I said James. He said he should send a note next day by the person who was to take the mare away, and he should direct the note to James, the hostler; at Frances's livery stables, Kensington, near the Adam and Eve public-house. Next day the witness, Frewin, brought me a note; this is it (looking at it:) in consequence of this note I delivered the mare to Frewin, who paid me for her keep. I have seen the same mare this morning, in possession of Ellis, the officer, and at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen the prisoner before? A. Not to my knowledge.</p>

            . I am a green-grocer, and live in Carnaby-street. I have known the prisoner, by sight, for about five months before he last came to me. I am in the general line, and occasionally cook meat, and know him by his coming four or five times, to take meat - I knew him by the name of Thompson. The last time he came to me was on Friday night, the 18th of February - I have no doubt of his being the person; he had come to me on the Wednesday night, between eight and nine o'clock, and asked if I knew of a lodging - I said No; he said he had seen one as he came through Cross-street. He went away, returned, and said he had taken the lodging for a week. He asked for a slice of bread and cheese, which he had, and sent me for a pot of porter; we drank it together, and he asked me to call on him next morning, at his lodging, No. 8, Cross-street; I went there on Thursday morning, between ten and eleven o'clock, and he said he had got a horse from the country, and it was for sale, and if I would take it he would give me a sovereign for my trouble; he sent me to a livery stables in Oxford-street, to enquire when the sale days were at Dixon's repository, also at one in Goswell-street, and another in St. Martin's-lane - I returned, and told him Dixon's sale was on Friday, also that in Goswell-street; he asked me to call again in the afternoon: I went to him about three o'clock, and he wrote three notes; (looking at two notes.) I can only speak to this one, which is the note directed to the hostler - he sealed the other two up, but the hostler's note was open; he gave me all three notes, and told me I should see the name of Cozens on the right-hand side of High-street, Kensington - I was to leave one of the sealed notes there, and take the other to Dixon's. Before I left the room he told me to take the mare through the iron gates at Kensington, across the park, and make my way to Battle-bridge, as the mare had not been used to London the stones would hurt her. I went and delivered the note to Cozens, then went to the hostler, and delivered him the note; he gave me the mare; I paid him 4 s. 6 d. for her, and took her through the Park, out of Grosvenor-gate, to Dixon's repository, and delivered it to one of the men in the yard, with one of the notes he had given me - it was then dark. I went home; he came to me again that night, and asked me what they said - I said, when they looked at the note they said he had opened his mouth too wide - I suppose they meant he had asked too much for her; he then asked me to go next day, and see it sold, and told me to tell Dixon to sell it for what it would fetch. I went to Dixon's, and spoke to a man, who is here - I gave him the directions the prisoner had given me, and afterwards saw her sold for twenty guineas. I saw the prisoner that night, and told him she was sold for 18 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you say so? A. I thought it would surprise him when he took the money. He said nothing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you receive the money? A. No. I cannot identify the two sealed notes, as I did not see the contents.</p>

               <p>MR. BARRY to MRS. MEREDITH. Q. You are a distant relation of the prisoner's? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath have you not at any time lent him, or offered to lend him that mare? A. Never in my life; he never put the question to me. It was never lent to him by any person on my premises. I never said to any one that I had lent it to him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You said you saw him at his mother's on the Thursday - did you see him after that? A. No, my Lord.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, If I have pleaded not guilty to this indictment it is not that I wish by subtleties to evade or screen myself from the verdict, and sentence which may be awarded against me, if convicted; but that I might have an opportunity to say something to convince the public that whatever may have been the unhappy circumstances of the latter days of my life, I was not driven into my present crime from depravity of disposition, but from a species of fatal necessity, which had placed me far beyond the reach of all human assistance and charity. - The appeal I now make is not with a view to lessen my past error (as there is a God, on whom I alone rely for mercy,) but to beg the Jury to banish all former unfortunate circumstances from their minds. It cannot have escaped your notice that ever since my discharge from Hertford, the public animosity has been kept alive against me by the public press, which has reached every part of England; even the smallest village I went to spurned me as an outcast; the chief instrument which prevented my obtaining employ, or indeed to effect a reformation, was the public press. I could scarcely move from one place to another without seeing my route marked in the daily papers; every door was shut against me, and every hope of future support blasted. With this dreary prospect I felt my fortitude forsaking me. I appeal to your Lordship and the Jury, whether my situation was not most deplorable, and what would you have done under similar circumstances? If you should discern any feature in my case deserving of commisseration, I trust you will recommend me to the clemency of my gracious Sovereign, as no former conviction appears on the record against me. Since the calamitous event which occurred at Hertford I have been a lost man, and on the eve of self-destruction. My innocent wife was involved in my ruin, and has suffered every privation. I have endeavoured to leave the country, but could not for want of means.</p>

               <p>"How many times am I to tell you not to come here?" I said he had never seen me before; he looked at me and said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, it is not you," but he must take me under the disorderly act. He took me to the watch-house and said he thought I was the boy whom he had information against about a robbery.

            . I am landlord of the Roebuck public-house, Witchcross, near East Grinstead; it is four or five miles further from town than where Poile lives. On Saturday morning, the 26th of February, between nine and ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner at my house with another person - they remained there till Sunday evening. I knew the prisoner by the name of Thomas Baker; he said he wanted to get to town by Monday morning, but the weather being bad he stopped till the evening, intending to go by the mail cart if he could.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you live further from town than the prosecutor? A. Yes, his house is not in the direct road to town from my house. I heard of the horse being lost on the Monday morning.</p>

            . I was hostler at the King's Arms public-house, Weybridge, Surry. On Monday, the 28th of February, between one and two o'clock in the day, the prisoner came to master's house - I did not see him come, but about a quarter to two they sent for me - I found a little black mare and a bay gelding in the stable; the prisoner and another man were there - they came out of the stable and told me to fetch some corn for the bay gelding and black mare. The prisoner remained there till Tuesday, and went away on the little black mare, between three and four o'clock, leaving the other man and the gelding there. He returned next day on foot without the mare, and went away between two and three. May has shewn me a black mare in London, on Tuesday last - it had a white star in the forehead, and I think it is the same, but will not be positive.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it not common for a black mare to have a white spot? A. No, I speak to no other circumstance - it was the same size; my attention was not particularly called to it in the stable.</p>

            . I'am a grocer, and live on Hounslow Heath. I have known the prisoner a year and a half, or two years, by the name of William Sargeant; he lived within thirty yards of my house. On the 1st of March (Tuesday, I think) I was driving a hog to Hanworth and met the prisoner on a little black mare pony; it took fright at my hog, and started, and nearly threw him off, which made me notice it. I said</p>
               <p>"William, you have got a nice lively little thing there;" he said, yes, he had, and that it had never been rode before - he trotted away towards Hounslow Heath. I live next door to the George the Fourth, and was there one day when Poile was there - I think it was on a Thursday; I saw the same black pony there as I had met the prisoner on, and knew it again - Poile claimed it. On the 8th of March I saw the prisoner in custody at the Marquis of Granby, at Hounslow - he told me not to say any thing about the black pony I saw him with the other day - two constables had him, but he whispered to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you had any quarrel with him? A. I never had a word with him; I met him about a mile and a half from the George the Fourth, on the road between Weybridge and Hounslow.</p>

            . I am a labourer in Mr. Poile's employ. In consequence of directions I received I went to Hounslow; I was at the George the Fourth public-house, on Wednesday, the 2d of March, and saw the prisoner there. I have known him eleven years; I saw him come out of a small room, and when he saw me he went away without speaking. I then went to the stables of the George the Fourth, and in consequence of inquiries which I made I found master's pony there - I knew him by seeing him at Poile's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You knew him by sight? A. Yes, and knew his friends; I knew him by the name of T. Baker; I said nothing to him.</p>

            . I am landlord of the George the Fourth, public-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Stacey says he was with you when the pony came? A. He was with me but I did not see it come - I never said that a tall man came with it - I said a tall man ordered me to feed it. I did not see who brought it. A man came to the front of the house, and said he had put a horse into the stable, and I was to feed it. On Wednesday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070007"/>morning the prisoner was in my parlour with two more - I think one of them was this tall man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Pike, of Weybridge, knows that I rode from his place on a pony, three years old.</p>
               <p>WM. PIKE. I keep the Old King's Arms at Weybridge. The prisoner came to my house on the 28th of February, and rode away on the 29th, on a pony; I looked at its mouth at the same time as I looked at the bay horse which I bought of another man who was with him, and sold it it again. I was not at home when they came to my house, and cannot say whether they came together, but they drank together. I have seen the pony claimed by the prosecutor; I cannot say whether it is the same as the prisoner rode away on or not; I am no judge of the age of ponies.</p>

I took him to the office, and on the road he asked me to go to his lodging, as he wanted me to advise with him; I said I could not - it was for him to do as he pleased about saying any thing of the cloak. He repeatedly asked me to go to his lodging - I at last went; he asked if I should search his wife - I said certainly. When we got to the watch-house he again asked me to go; I said</p>
               <p>"Is the cloak or ticket there?" he said no, but he thought there was a clue that I could get it by. I then accompanied him to his lodging in Adam-street, West, where I found the witness Fennen in bed. The prisoner asked him what he had done with the cloak he gave him; he said</p>
               <p>"What cloak? I have had no cloak of yours." The prisoner said</p>
               <p>"Did you not tell me you had pawned it just by here - I gave it you in the bundle you were to take to my wife." Fennen acknowledged receiving the bundle, and said he took it to his wife, and then that he gave it to another person to take to her. I asked Fennen if he had any duplicates; he said no; I searched his room and found three in a portmanteau, one of which was for the cloak; he then said he had given it to another person to pawn, who brought him the ticket and money, but he gave the money to the prisoner, which he did not deny, but said he had taken the cloak as he was distressed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was his wife there? A. No, she is in service; he spoke of two children - I never heard that he had six.</p>

Last Tuesday three weeks, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner, William Darby, came to my house with his brother and Mr. Green; they said they had come to make up an old quarrel. We had a pot of beer and some gin; the prisoner Sarah, came in and took tea with my wife. She came to me and said</p>
               <p>"You *** if you owe my Bill any animosity come and take it out of me." She tucked up her sleeves and struck me. Green carried her down stairs; and in about two minutes William Darby offered to strike me but was prevented - Green and my wife held me. I went out in about ten minutes to go over to the Duke of York public-house, and met the prisoners, both very drunk. I asked if they did not think they had acted wrong in kicking up a disturbance in my place; the woman said</p>
               <p>"No, you ***." She ran at me, to claw my face, but did not do it - I knocked her down twice; William came up and struck me - I felt a great deal of pain in a certain place - I collared and threw him down - he ran at me five or six times, he leaned against the wall and seemed much fatigued - I went home and found I had been stabbed.</p>

            . I am the wife of Joshua Davidson - we live at No. 33, Rupert-street, in the parish of St. James, and rent the house; we have lived there about seven months. The prisoner took a first floor back room at our house, on the 15th of February, and was to sleep there that night, but did not. He brought a box that day, and then went away; I did not see him bring the box in. On Thursday, the 17th, he came again; I let him in, between four and five o'clock - before that two boxes had come to our house: I paid 1 s. 6 d. porterage for them. The box was corded, and the trunk was in a wrapper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe how they were addressed? A. No. I did not take them in myself; I was present when they came: one was left in the parlour, and the other taken into the prisoner's room, as the porter, when he brought them, asked if a young man named Douglas was moving in, and we did not know the prisoner's name - he had not said that he expected any boxes. When the prisoner came on the 17th, I said two boxes had come from the Green Man and Still, and was it right; he said Yes: I said I had paid 1 s. 6 d. porterage, was that right; he said Yes, and he would settle with me by and by. He went up stairs, came down again in about a quarter of an hour, and went out with the trunk; he returned in about twenty minutes, without the trunk - he went up to his room for about ten minutes, and then went out with two bundles; he came back in a few minutes, and went up stairs again, came down with another bundle, and brought me the key of his room, and said if Henry came in he should be in about eight or nine o'clock, to bed. Henry Ball had recommended him to us; they were to sleep in the same room. I saw no more of him till he was in custody; he did not come home, and Ball did not come till next day; he had lived about three months at our house. Next day, Friday, Mrs. Douglas came to our house; I shewed her the box which was left behind.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not ask if there was a letter left with the boxes, as I should like to know where they came from? A. He asked if there was a letter; I said No, and he said he said he supposed it was inside. He said nothing about liking to know where it came from.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on Wednesday, the 2d of March, at half-past eleven o'clock at night, and took him to St. Ann's watch-house, searched him, and found a pen-knife on him, which I have had ever since. When I first took him I asked if his name was Peter Carroll; he said No, it was George Day; I said I apprehended him for stealing a box and trunk from Rupert-street; he at first denied it, but afterwards said he took them to his mother's lodging, and sold them to a Jew, who he called out of the street, for 50 s., and that his right name was Peter Carroll. I found 20 s., on him, which he said was all he had left from the produce of the property; I found three silk handkerchiefs on him, two of which were in his hat; they do not belong to the prosecutrix.</p>

            . I was with Schofield when the prisoner said he had taken the things from Rupert-street, and sold them to a Jew, at his mother's place, in her absence; he said he sold the trunk, with its contents, altogether, to the Jew, for 50 s., and it was impossible to get any of them back, as he did not know the Jew, nor where he was likely to be found.</p>
               <p>MRS. DOUGLAS. I am quite sure this knife is mine; I have had it so many times in my hand: it was in the trunk or box when I packed them at Harrow. My goods were worth 20 l. to me. Banks is employed at the Green Man and Still; he referred me to No. 33, Rupert-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The box which was corded was not broken open; it appeared to have been forced with the weight of the clothes. If I had thought it was not for me I would not have sold them.</p>

I sent them to alarm Mr. Hewitt, who came. I had fastened the shop door the night before, but the space above was open, as the fan-light had not been put in. I let Mr. Hewitt and the watchmen in; we all went up stairs, looked round the front attic, and found the box of linen gone from there; it was there overnight: it was found at the bottom of the attic stairs, with three silver spoons on it, wrapped in a cloth; they were in the cupboard the night before, with a watch, which was found on the prisoner when he was taken: it belonged to Mrs. Winders, where Mr. Hewitt lodged; she had lent it to me. I am a widow. The linen still remained in the box.</p>

I went to collar him, and he made a blow at my head with a bottle; I stooped to avoid it, and he ran across the way; I called to Scott, who knocked his hat off with his stick: he fell: we seized him, and as he arose wine ran from his waistcoat.

On Wednesday morning, the 23d of February, between seven and eight o'clock, the witness Rushton, gave me information; I went to Blossoms Inn, and found 11 lbs. of paper; I waited there, but nobody came for it - I at last found out the prosecutors. I then went to Epps's shop on Holborn-bridge, and found more; I asked if they had any more, which they denied - we got a search warrant, and found a bundle more, and on going to several of Epps's shops I found more.</p>

            . Mayhew came into the yard, and asked whose teas they were which had gone out of the yard; I said it was Clark's cart; but the tea was Mr. Garratt's. I went out; there was a stoppage down the lane. Sering got off the cart till a truck was unloaded; they then moved on to Tower-street, and instead of turning to go to Old Swan, they turned to the left, to Barking churchyard, and staid there a short time; Smith was at the horses' heads - Sering got on the cart; he came down in five or ten minutes - they put a nose bag on the horse. Sering pulled off his hat, put on a leather cap, and got on the tilt; Smith tied the tilt down upon him. An Excise officer came by; I sent him for an officer, who came - Sering was then in the cart, and had broken the tea chest open. We found a nose bag, with 11 b. 2 ozs. of tea in it, with him in the cart - his hand was in the chest. Smith had gone away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you speak to Sering? A. Not till we got him off the cart; I thought him tipsy when he was in our yard - he was fresh, but not so drunk as he pretended. Smith did not appear so tipsy as him; they were both in our yard when the cart was loaded. I cannot say whether there was a cross bar in the cart - Sering was driver of the cart; Smith was his odd man.</p>

I received a parcel from Legg, for William Thomas, of Gloucester, on the 31st of March - it was put aside in the yard, to go by the waggon that night: it was not missed till it was found. - There was a stable on the premises, under the loft. The prisoner was our porter, and had access to it. I saw the parcel found in the loft; three pieces of the goods were gone when it was opened.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not see it in the stable? A. Yes. There are eight servants in the yard. I think that the prisoner can read.</p>

I stood against the tap-room door about a quarter of an hour; I then went out, and one of the young women (who was convicted last Session) followed me - she came up to me, and put her hand into my pocket - the prisoner came up to me in a few minutes, and stood quite close to me: I did not feel my watch go, but I missed it very soon. I pursued the prisoner, and overtook her; before I took her I had seen her extend her hand towards the other; I told her I thought she had taken my watch: I turned round to look for the other, but she had run away - I then gave charge of the prisoner, and as we were coming up Long-acre we met the other, and had her taken into custody - the prisoner was discharged after a second examination.</p>

I heard a knock at the street door about a quarter before eight; I went to open it; it was a man who came to deliver a message. One of the witnesses came down stairs, and told me there was a noise in the wash-house; I went towards the wash-house, and found the prisoner in the passage; there was no other person about. I went to the wash-house, and found the copper was gone from its usual place, and left in the yard. Nothing was found on him but a pen-knife and a few halfpence.</p>

On the Monday after Michaelmas day I told her to take care of them till Christmas, but I went for them about nine or ten days before Christmas - they were then gone - she said it must be the prisoner who had taken them - she was there and said she had pawned them - she went with me to the pawnbroker's, where we found them.</p>

            . I am twelve years of age. I know the nature of an oath; I have seen the prisoner several times on Clerkenwell-green. On the 29th of January, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I saw Mr. Pilgrin in 
               <persName id="t18250407-20-person204">York-place, City-road</persName>
            ; I did not see the prisoner at that time, but as I was sitting on a butcher's block in Sydney-street, about five minutes afterwards, I heard the cry of Stop Thief! and saw the prisoner run down Sydney-grove; he appeared to be the person the people were pursuing; I followed and saw him hide a yellow silk handkerchief under a post in a dust hole - Mr. Pilgrin was not then pursuing him; I saw him taken the same day - I told the officer I had seen the prisoner hide the handkerchief, and saw the officer take it from the dust-hole; I saw Mr. Pilgrin afterwards; the handkerchief was shewn to him and he claimed it as his property, in the presence of the prisoner, who said he had not seen it nor had it.</p>

I went down a short distance and at the corner of a court she pointed out two houses, each of them having a light in the passage - she asked if I would go to one of them, and said they were very respectable; I told her if that was her business I had nothing more to do with her; she still kept hold of my arm, and endeavoured to persuade me to go. I told her she need use no arguments, as I would have nothing to do with her. I turned round to go away, and she clasped her arms round my waist and begged I would excuse her - I then walked a few paces away, she still walking by my side - she then called some female by name, and I perceived her put her hand over my shoulder to that female - I put my hand to my breeches pocket and found my purse and money were gone; I have never got it again; I then took hold of the prisoner and said</p>
               <p>"You have picked my pocket;" she said</p>
               <p>"Oh, you naughty man, how can you say so? - I have not any thing about me." I said</p>
               <p>"If you have not, the person to whom you just now handed something, most likely has." She then stooped down, as if to look on the ground, and then ran away - I pursued her - she dodged me through several courts and got into Oxford-street, crossed over and fell down, but she got up and ran down Mary-le-bone-lane; I called Watch! several times - I could have taken her but did not know that I had a right.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You were afraid to touch her at all without an officer? A. Yes - I was going to Mary-le-bone-street to supper. It was the tone of distress that she assumed which took my attention - I had no suspicion of what she was - she put her two arms round my waist - she was before me, and her two hands were behind my back - it was immediately after that I missed my purse. It was in Woodstock-street that she asked me to go into the house; we had not spoken together in Oxford-street; the other person went from me in a great hurry, but I did not miss my purse till after the prisoner put her arms round me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not told this young woman again and again that you had not a farthing of money about you? A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you no suspicion of what she was? A. No, not in the least - I was perfectly sober.</p>

Mrs. Johnson said she had not ordered it - I shewed her the letter, and she said she knew nothing of it. I then came back to town and went to Mr. Pedley's shop, No. 268, Holborn, where the parcel was directed to be left, and after waiting there till between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came there, and said she had no idea the parcel was so large,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070014"/>had she would get a coach - she then went away, and I saw no more of her till she was apprehended - I gave directions to follow her.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Drew. On the 7th of February I received this letter:</p>
               <p>(The Letter was here read.)</p>
               <p>Woodford, Feb. 7.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Edward Johnson will thank Messrs. Manas to send her, to her late residence in Gerrard-street, the under-mentioned mourning for her three nieces, who are just returned from France. She will be glad if they will not said sending the parcel, carefully packed up, as she is sending by ten o'clock to-morrow, and the servant will call and bring it down to Woodford. Let the articles be good. I send this by the post-boy, with orders to post it immediately, consequently there will be plenty of time to send them."</p>
               <p>(Here followed a list of articles, see Indictment.)</p>
               <p>JESSE HALL. I know Mrs. Johnson - she is a customer of ours - her late husband lived in Gerrard-street; when I received the letter I packed up the goods, directed it for Mrs. Johnson, and delivered it in Gerrard-street, to Thomas Byford; I asked who I was to leave the parcel with, and they directed me to leave it with him. Mr. Johnson had been a comptroller of the Twopenny post-office there; I was not at home when the second letter arrived - I had not seen the prisoner in the transaction, or given her any credit at all - the second parcel was made up according to this letter, and taken the next morning, by Mr. Drew, with a bill of parcels. The second letter is as follows.</p>
               <p>(reads):</p>
               <p>"Feb. 11, 1825.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Johnson received the parcel quite safe, and likes the scarfs very much; she will be glad if Mr. Mann will send her down as much gros de Naples and lining as will make two more pelisses, as the quantity sent is only sufficient for one; also ten yards of Welch flannel, and twenty-five yards of calico, at about 1 s. 3 d.; and a piece of diaper, small pattern, Be so good as to send them to-morrow to Mr. Pedley's, No. 268, High Holborn, two doors from the George and Blue Boar, directed to me, A friend of mine is coming down to spend a few days with me, and sets off from the above Inn, therefore I have requested her to call at Pedley's, and bring the parcel in the coach with her - pack it secure."</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been in the habit ever since I lost my father at eleven years of age, of having my bill paid yearly at Mr. Mann's. After my marriage with Mr. Webster, I still continued to deal with them - we afterwards went to Ireland - when I returned I had some more goods of Mr. Mann, in consequence of the death of Mr. Johnson, as I wished to look as respectable as the rest of the family, by whom I had been forgotten. I had hoped that Mrs. Johnson would have enabled me pay the bill before it became due - I went to the house and ordered the print myself - I then went to Gerrard-street, and saw the porter; I enquired if the parcel was come, and he gave it me - I did not do it with intent to defraud Messrs. Mann.</p>

About five o'clock, the prisoner wanted to come down, and I told her to go to bed again, as I did not want to let her out while the man was asleep; she went up stairs again, but came down and said</p>

Birnie showed me the skeleton of the pin, the diamond had been removed from it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Had you a party there? A. Yes, There were some ladies, and one gentleman, none of them are here; it was a diamond pin, the prisoner was a stranger; it rained very fast, but it was very light - the rest of the party were in the theatre; I saw the handkerchief put towards me and felt the pin go; I do not know who found the pin, of my own knowledge; I did not see the prisoner searched.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was leaving the Theatre at the same time as the prosecutor; he was applying for a coach - I happened accidently to run against him: he then charged me with having taken his pin; I asked how he dared to charge me with such a thing: he stood struggling with me some time, and then gave charge of me.</p>

            . I have been in the employ of Messrs. Houlditch for two or three years, as a labourer, for a day or two in a week; Green was employed there, but I never saw Hewett there. On Saturday, the 25th of March, Green gave me twenty mahogany boards, and an elm board upon a truck, to take to Mr. Hewett, No. 5, Duck-lane, Berwick-street, Soho; I took them, and gave them to a man of the name of Davy; I went back again with the truck to Carburton-street, and got twenty more mahogany boards, and another elm board, which were loaded by me and some boys; Green and I took them to the same place, by Green's direction. I saw Mr. Davy again, and when I was unloading them I saw Mr. Hewett in the loft; when I had unloaded the truck Davy asked me if there was any thing to pay; I said Mr. Green told me Mr. Hewett was to pay me: he asked me what - I said 5 s., which he paid me. Mr. Hewett did not speak to me at all, but I am sure of his person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you then in the employ of Messrs. Houlditch? A. No. I did not know but that Messrs. Houlditch had employed Mr. Green to sell these boards - that I swear. Mr. Houlditch never sent me with any boards to sell. Green told me that Mr. Hewett was to pay me for my trouble; I did not ask what he was to pay me. I have been employed by Green, and always left it to him. I took them in Mr. Houlditch's truck - the distance might be half a mile. I was nearly six hours about it, and I earned the money; I asked if a crown was too much, and he said No; he went and got it. None of the boys are here who helped to load. I did not know the prosecutors' premises very well. I did not give Mr. Houlditch any notice of this. I went according to Green's direction. I was taken to the watch-house on Monday week - I never suspected there was any thing wrong. I was accused before the Magistrates, and then made the charge against Green. Avis took me; I asked what he took me for; he said concerning Green robbing Messrs. Houlditch. I did not say at the public-house that I did not know Green at all to my knowledge, but I will not swear whether I did or not. I heard an officer tell the Magistrate on Tuesday, that I had said I did not know Green - I said I had not said so to my recollection; I was a little in liquor, but not tipsy. I was sworn before the Magistrate, as to where I took the boards. I did not accuse Green to get off myself.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Whether a crown was too little or too much, is that what you received? A. Yes, I received two half-crowns. I lodge in Carburton-street, and come at a short notice to assist at Messrs. Houlditchs'. I was taken at the Nelson, public-house, in Charles-street; the officers told me they had been looking after me, about the robbery which Green had been taken up for, at Messrs. Houlditch', and I had taken the boards down - I said I had. I was taken about half-past eleven o'clock at night; I was a little in liquor, but not drunk.</p>

            . I was working at Mr. Hewett's in March last; I was employed there by a man of the name of Howe, a coach-maker. I was there when Neale came with a truck; Mr. Hewett was then in the loft: I took twenty boards from Neale the first time, and put them into the loft, by Hewett's direction. Neale came back again with twenty more. Hewett told me he expected some pannel boards to come, and wished me to assist the man in bringing them into the loft. - I heard no question asked who brought them, and did not see a name on the truck; I paid Neale two half-crown pieces, which I got from Hewett; he said it was too much, but he sent down the money; I did not hear where he came from, or any thing about him.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070018"/>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was your master there, Mr. Howe? A. Yes; it was about three or four o'clock - Howe was in the loft when the last pannels came, and he had been there before, but was not there when the first pannels came. The loft is Hewett's, but my master was working in it: there was no other person at work there. The boards were large - any person could see them in the street.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Mr. Howe and Mr. Hewett were both then in the loft? A. Yes; my master had leave to work there. I believe the stores there were Hewett's property; there is no conveying such things privately by day-light; it is not usual for trucks to stand in the night delivering such things; I should be afraid the watchman would take me into custody.</p>

            . I am a police officer. In consequence of some information I executed a search warrant on the premises of Hewett, in Duck-lane, on the 28th of March, about five o'clock in the afternoon - I found forty mahogany and two elm boards; there were no other articles there - I saw Davy there; I asked questions of him, but did not take him into custody; Green was taken the same night - I saw him next day. I took Neale myself at a public-house at the corner of Carburton-street, about twenty minutes before twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there a brother officer with you? A. No. I took him to the office myself; I told him I wanted to ask him no question, but that I took him for taking the boards down; I did not mention Green's name to him. Duke, who was with me, was not bound over; I did not hear Duke say that Neale had denied knowing Green. Neale had been drinking a little, but he could understand very well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q You searched Mr. Hewett's premises? A. Yes, I had some conversation with Davy. Hewett came and surrendered himself to me the same evening; he said he bought these boards of Green, and thought it was all right; he gave 6 1/2 d. per foot for them; he had paid 3 l. on account, and came voluntarily to answer any questions that might he put to him; this was before Green was taken - I did not hear him say he had been a fellow workman with Green.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Jas. Holditch. I went to see Green taken in custody by Johnson, one of the Bow-street officers - I believe he was not told what he was taken for; I had I some conversation with him before he was taken, at the corner of Long-acre and St. Martin's-lane - I met him there promiscuously; I went up to him and asked if his name was Green, and if he had heard of what had occurred - he then stated that he had robbed his master; he was very sorry for it, and that others were implicated in it - he said there was a man of the name of Wright, in Carburton-street, who had been concerned in it as well as himself; and he had sold the property for 20 l.; and had given Wright, or was to give him 10 l. to keep the secret, instead of which, he had heard he had informed his master of what had occurred, and he intended to be a hundred or a hundred and fifty miles from the spot by that time to-morrow - this was about nine o'clock in the evening, and he was in custody in about three quarters of an hour - I went and told Mr. James Holditch of it immediately; I went to the officer, and then went with him to take him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you still in Mr. Holditch's employ? A. Yes - I know Green only by sight; he told me all this of his own accord - he was tipsy - we were not intimate. A man named Wright was produced next day, but he was let go. Green was taken in a public-house near his own residence - I have been in Mr. Holditch's employ about three months.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. I took Green into custody at the Cart and Horses, public-house Little St. Martin's-lane, soon after nine o'clock; he was rather in liquor and asleep - he was not sensible till I shook him up; I told him what I took him for when we got to Bow-street; he said he had nothing to say - I saw Neale by his side in the public-house - I asked him he if knew Neale, and he said No; and Neale denied knowing him at the door of the public-house; I did not know then that Neale was wanted, and I let him go. I searched Hewett and found on him a book and a rule which belong to Neale.</p>
               <p>RICHARD GREEN'S Defence. I deny saying, that I did not know Neale.</p>
               <p>HEWETT'S Defence. I purchased these boards of Green, as I would of any other person; he had introduced me on a former occasion to some person over the water - I agreed to give 6 1/2 d per foot for them; I had a regular bill of parcels with them - I gave Green a written note, to deliver them on the premises, and told him to send them there in consequence of my being moving about that time. They were sent in, and 5 s. was asked for the cartage, which I did not consider an over-charge - it could not be supposed that I should buy them, if I had known they were not properly come by, having my character and family at stake - I had rather a large stock in hand considering the state in which it was; not being dry - very ill sawed, and shaken - I considered it a fair price; it cannot be supposed, that with all the yards in the metropolis open to me, I should be guilty of doing a mean action.</p>

            . I am foreman to Messrs. Houlditchs. I missed a number of boards from Carburton-street on the 28th of March; I could not tell how many - I found them in Duck-lane, in a loft, which Hewett admitted to be his; I had seen the boards at Christmas stock-taking, to the best of my knowledge. I asked Green on Monday morning where these boards were taken to, and he said to Long-acre.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070019"/>I applied at Bow-street to get a search-warrant, and found them; Hewett said he had bought them.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What are you in the service of Messrs. Holditch? A. I am foreman; we should be glad to buy the boards at 8 d. a-foot, but they cost us 8 1/2 d. or 6 d., which was the market price then. I am not aware of any place where we could have bought them at 5 1/2 d.</p>

            . I am a coach-maker in the New road. I have known Hewett fifteen years - he has been a very good character, and a very honest man.

               <p>JOHN BRANT. On the night of the 19th of last March, my poultry-house was robbed - I had some malt in that evening, and when I went with the light, to get the malt, into the granary, the poultry made a noise, I looked up and saw they were all safe - there was a cock and seven hens. Next morning, at seven o'clock, I found the brew-house window wrenched open, and all the fowls gone but one hen. I looked up the yard, and found a quantity of blood and feathers - I got a search warrant and found them on the prisoner's premises, about a quarter of a mile from my house; he was sitting by the fire, and the constable said</p>
               <p>"Mr. Brant has had some poultry stolen, and has strong suspicion of you." The prisoner said</p>
               <p>"I know nothing about it," but I saw some feathers on the ground, and said</p>
               <p>"I am confident the fowls are here." The officer then opened the door of a cupboard, and found two of them unpicked. We took him to the cage and then returned and looked into the privy, and found a fowl thrown down which had been picked and trussed ready for the pot. The prisoner said he had found them at ten o'clock the night before. I had given him two days work about three months before, and given him some food and some drink.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Are there no fowls like yours in this country.? A. Yes, but these were the spangled Poland breed, and one of them was a brown speckled pullet. I can positively swear to them.</p>

               <p>"If that is all you want I will go and fetch it;" he left me, and did not bring it. Next morning I got up early, and saw Castledine in the street - he said,</p>
               <p>"Master, did you want me last night;" I said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, I want that bridle, where is it?" he said it was at his house; I went with him - he brought it out of the house, and gave it to me - this was on the 25th. I told him he might go to work, and I should apprehend Richards, which I did, on Hendon-road, and in the afternoon I took Castledine.</p>

I went out at six o'clock, and on returning at ten, found the upper part of my house destroyed by fire; the first and second floors were destroyed - it was extinguished when I returned;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070021"/>the ceilings of the parlours were only damaged, and the kitchens unhurt - no part of it is yet habitable. I am a working silversmith, and had about 300 ozs. of silver there - some worked, and some not. On Monday I attended the firemen to search, and found from 113 to 120 ozs.; some of it had melted and run together, and some had not melted; there had been about 100 ozs. in bars, as it came from the refiners. I found that quantity considerably deficient; we continued to search on Tuesday and Wednesday, and found in all 170 or 180 ozs. The prisoner was one of the firemen, and in his presence I showed them all some stone and tile, and told them the silver, in the state it probably would be, would resemble that, except in weight, and told them not to throw any thing of the sort away without showing it to me - they left on Wednesday, and I afterwards found 13 ozs. more. On the 15th, Abut and Sons, refiners, sent me a piece, weighing 16 ozs. 5 dwts. - I went there, and took Heath into custody: we next took South, in the Borough, and then went to the Hope Insurance Office, and took the prisoner.</p>

            . I am principal clerk to Messrs. Abuts. On Tuesday morning, the 15th of February, Heath brought me a piece of silver to be assayed; he is a gold and silver chaser: as soon as I saw it I knew it to have been melted by me, by the shape of the ingot into which it was cast - the fire had not affected it. I sent to Mr. Starkey. I melted 2,200 ozs., and he had 200 ozs. of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Has the heat had no effect on it? A. It has only blackened it. An ignorant person might not know it to be silver.</p>

On Sunday, the 13th of February, the prisoner came to my house about six o'clock in the evening, and said he had got a piece of metal which he had found in the ruins of a fire - he did not know what it was, but it would serve me as solder; I gave him nothing for it: he was an acquaintance. I thought it heavier than the metal I generally use, and next morning took it to Heath, to be assayed. I could not tell what it was from the colour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He did not sell it to you? A. No. I just took it up and put it down; solder is heavier than pewter, but silver is still heavier.</p>

            . I am married to John Nelson, but we have been many years separated - the last time I heard of him was six years ago; I do not know whether he is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070022"/>alive - he was butler in a gentleman's family. I lodge in this home; here are several things here which are all mine; they are marked with my name, and I made them; here is a silk gown, ten towels, and other property, all of which are mine; I occupied the parlour, and slept there. I went out at two o'clock in the afternoon, returned about ten in the evening, and found this had happened; I locked the parlour door, and left the window down, but am not sure that it was quite down, for I have observed since that unless it is quite down it will not latch, and I recollect that I did not latch it - I could not have left it quite open, but it might not be quite down.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether you had left it open wide enough for the prisoner to get in? A. No, I certainly did not - it must have been lifted up for any one to get in, I am certain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How long is it since you and your husband parted? A. We have been quite separated for twelve years - I saw him six years ago last June. All the things were bought with my money.</p>
               <p>SARAH SANDERS. Here is a picture of mine among the property - it hung in the parlour.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK contended that if the window was not quite down a burglary had not been committed. The Court over-ruled the objection.</p>

            . I was on a visit to my sister, who is Solomon's wife. On the eight of March, about half-past six o'clock, I was up stairs, and heard a knocking in the shop - I went down, and found the prisoner Brough in the shop, with an apron on, and his right-hand under it; he asked if we sold china marbles; I said we did not sell any thing of the kind; he then went a little on one side; I opened the door, and let him out - I stood at the door a minute, and then shut it, and am sure that I latched it; I went up stairs again. I had seen the glass dish and jug in the shop before he came in, but did not look for them afterwards, not suspecting any thing. He was brought back by Watkins four or five minutes after I let him out.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Sowerby, of Chiswell-street. On the 8th of March, about twenty-five minutes past seven o'clock in the evening, I was shutting up the shop - day-light had quite gone; I saw the prisoner Medwinter looking in at the prosecutor's window: I did not know him before, but am sure of him. In about half a minute I saw him open the door and go in, and in about another half minute I saw him come out with something glass in his right hand, and when he passed me I saw that it was a glass jug; he ran down Finsbury-street - at the corner of which is our house - I pursued him, and at the bottom of Finsbury-street saw him give the jug to Brough, saying,</p>
               <p>"Here Jem, is another;" this was about 100 yards from Solomon's house - he was never out of my sight - a person in Finsbury-street could not see Solomon's shop; he walked on a little, and then ran. I collared Brough, took the jug from him, and began to unrol his apron - he then said,</p>
               <p>"Here is something he has just been making me a present of," which I found was the dish. I took him back to Solomon's; a constable was sent for, to whom I gave the jug and dish.</p>

            . I am a constable of Kingston. In consequence of information, on Monday the 28th of February, I went to Mrs. Shaw's house; I searched a bed in Mrs. Shaws presence, and found, sewed up in the bed, three different parcels; one bundle contained a feather, artificial flowers, and some frocks, and another all this plate which I produce.</p>
               <p>MRS. COLLINSON. Here is a silver gill, a cream ewer, two gravy and eight table spoons, and a variety of plate, which are my husband's; they were kept in a drawer in our bed room; I looked into that drawer and missed them when she was gone; we had used the spoons at dinner; I had seen most of the silver safe that day; I think I had seen all of it; the frocks and feathers, were in my daughter's room; the table spoons are worth 6 l.; I had seen the silver forks, cream over, and sugar tongs that day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence, written. I beg leave humbly to inform your Lordship, I never opened any drawer; and that I restored the plate as I took it; I had warning, and was to have left two days before this happened; I was not aware of the value of what I had taken; I did it with a desire to go home to Ireland, and hearing my brother was ill at Hull, I took the plate, having no means to get home without money.</p>
               <p>MR. COLLINSON. I have inquired about her at Hampstead since she left, and heard a good character of her; she had lived there two months, and I understand behaved well; we took her without a character, as she was recommended by my porter.</p>

I had a bundle and umbrella with me; I knew him before; we joined in conversation, and walked along the road together, and in the course of our walk, words ensued about an old grievance between me and him last summer - he challenged me to fight, and said he would fight me on any man in the parish I said, I should decline it for that time - I did not wish to fight. I walked on some hundred yards, and just as I got to the end of the last field, he struck me a blow with his fist - we fought and had two rounds, nobody was with us. I took the first opportunity to get from him, and run away leaving my bundle on the grass; I had put it down to fight. I went to the public-house where I lodge, the landlady opened the door; I then missed my bundle, and went back to look for it by myself; I went as fast as I could, till I arrived at the spot where I put it down - it was not there; by the time I arrived there King came up, he lodged at the same house with me - I searched round the field, but could not find the bundle. King went to the prisoner's father and mother's house just by; we could gain no entrance at the gate for some time; his mother said he was not at home. King got on a bank, and looking into an adjoining garden, called out,</p>
               <p>"Here he is." I told him to get over into the garden, he did so - the prisoner arose and ran away. I said,</p>
               <p>"Follow him King," I was at some little distance, the prisoner was running away, and as he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070024"/>ran, he threw away part of the bundle; I did not see him throw it away, but I picked some things up which were thrown over the hedge. I said to King,</p>
               <p>"This is not all, there is a silk handkerchief missing," in which a shirt and stockings had been tied. I made the best of my way over the bank, and said to the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"I want my handkerchief." King was then near to him; and I took hold of him, demanding the handkerchief; we were some time wrestling. I do not know that any blows passed; we both fell on the ground, and as soon as I arose again, I found myself stabbed on the left arm, and the left side of my back; there were two wounds. I said,</p>
               <p>"King, I must go home, I am stabbed in two places, I feel the blood running." King said,</p>
               <p>"Are you?" I said,</p>
               <p>"Yes." The prisoner came forward with his arm extended, and said to King,</p>
               <p>"D - n your eyes, I will serve you the same." King had my umbrella in his hand, and parried off the blow with it; we both got safe over the bank, the prisoner still remained in the garden; we went home as fast as possible. I had a doctor that night, and have been laid up ever since; nobody else was present.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by MR. LAW. Q. At what public house had you been drinking? A. The Three Tuns at Bow - I live at a public house nearly a mile off; we fought on the grass; it was dirty weather - I fell in the fight and believe he fell also - I believe he is a gardener - we got to the last field before the fighting commenced - Q. What had you been talking about in the mean time? A. Saying I did not wish to fight, as I did not owe him any animosity from the former quarrel; I had not applied for King to accompany me from the public house; the landlady sent him after me - I had not spoken to him - the garden is about ten yards from the prisoner's father's house; the prisoner was near enough to hear me desire King to get over after him; I was standing in a place called Sounding-alley, between the father's house and garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner retreat as you advanced? A. He did not; when I got over the hedge, he stood still - I demanded my handkerchief - he ran away from King, who pursued him; I was on the other side of the edge at that time - I came up to him, and asked for my property - he was standing still then; having been stopped by King; I and the prisoner took hold of each other, and down we came, and he stabbed me; I felt the blood running down my arm, and down my small clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not talking to a woman when you first met the prisoner? A. No, I had been in company with my relations that afternoon.</p>

            . I lodge at the same house as the prosecutor. On the 12th of February, about 12 o'clock, he came to the door; I heard him say he had lost his bundle in the field - he went back again; the landlady desired me to follow him; I did not overtake him till I came to the field where it happened - he was looking about for the bundle; I helped him, but could not find it, nor see any body; we went to the prisoner's house, knocked at the garden gate, his mother opened the window. I asked if her son was there, he was denied. I got on the bank opposite the house; there is an alley between the house and bank; I saw the prisoner laying under the bank, with this bundle. Lewis was in the alley; I said,</p>
               <p>"Here he is;" the prisoner immediately got up and run away with the bundle; I followed him, and got off the bank over into the garden, where he was. I followed him and saw him throw the bundle away; Lewis was on the other side, and picked it up; he said he had not got all, and told me not to let him run away; he made several attempts to run away; I said, if he did; I would knock him down. Lewis then came over and demanded a silk handkerchief of him; I believe he denied having it - a scuffle ensued between them; I did not see any blows given; I did not join in the scuffle - they were both down, and got up; Lewis said, he must go home, for he was stabbed in two places, and felt the blood run down his arm and back; I said,</p>
               <p>"Are you;" he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes;" the prisoner then said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, and d - n your eyes, I will serve you the same;" he was coming up to me, holding his arm up with a gardener's pruning knife in his hand; I parried the blow off with an umbrella: Lewis then made the best of his way to go home - I followed him; the prisoner followed us both with the knife in his hand; Lewis got over the bank into the alley - I was in the field then, and the prisoner was standing about two yards off with the knife in his hand; I got over the bank; Lewis and I went home. On getting home, when I saw what mischief was done, I went for the doctor; I went with the constable to the prisoner's house; we knocked at the gate, his mother opened the window the officer asked if her son was at home, and demanded admission, and after some time she said he was at home; she came down, opened the gate, and shewed us where he was in bed. The officer told him to get up, and put on the same clothes as he had on before; and when he had done so, he searched him, and among other things found a small knife with two blade; I said, that was not he, and he must have another knife somewhere; the officer pulled down the bed clothes, and between the bed and sacking found a large gardener's pruning knife, which I believe to be the same; there was some blood on it; it was a moonlight night; we lodge with Mrs. Hughes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know the prisoner before? A. I never saw him before; I was not long after Lewis - I did not see him till he came to the field, where he had lost his bundle; when I knocked at the gate, I asked if the son was at home - the mother said he was not, and she had not seen him that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prosecutor say what he would do if he could catch him? A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did neither of you say</p>
               <p>"D - n his eyes, if we catch him we will be the death of him?" A. No, I heard nothing of the kind: after he was gone back, the landlady told me he had been having a scuffle, and left his bundle behind - she desired me to go and look after it - he did not tell me he had been fighting, or say he would do any thing to the prisoner if he caught him - he has not since told me that he offered five sovereigns to fight him - I have heard him say he had two rounds with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. He endeavoured to get from you, instead of meeting you? A. He made several attempts to run away - the hedge prevented him.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you got over the hedge to go home, he was within two yards of you? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 28th of February, between two and three o'clock in the morning<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070025"/>I went with King to apprehend the prisoner - we found him in bed and apparently asleep - I awoke him; he said</p>
               <p>"What is the matter now?" I said he was charged with cutting and stabbing T. Lewis, and desired him to get up and put on his clothes - he did so, and I found a small two-bladed knife in his pocket; King said, that was not the knife - I said</p>
               <p>"August, you have another knife, have not you?" he said</p>
               <p>"No, if I have it is down stairs;" I then searched the bed and found this knife concealed between the bed and sacking, and, on taking it out of the case, King exclaimed</p>
               <p>"That is the knife;" it was bloody on both sides of the blade; I then secured him. I produce the prosecutor's clothes - his shirt is bloody, the arm of the coat is more than half cut - there is a stab in the back of the coat, and near the waistband of his breeches is a holo corresponding with it; he had a great coat and an under one on - both are cut through, and through the small-clothes behind.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you perceive some dirt on the knife? A. No, only blood - I did not examine the prisoner's clothes - it was not a very dirty night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the knife appear to have scraped dirt of his clothes? A. No, there was no dirt on it at all - it is such a knife as gardeners use.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose a person had such a knife in his hand, and falling with another person, he might inflict such wounds? A. I should think it impossible - it would rip a coat with great case.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. On the night of the 27th of February I was called in to attend Lewis, and found him in a faint state - he had a cut in the middle of the upper part of the arm - it was a very severe cut - and he had a stab in the back; I could see into that wound about an inch deep without probing it - it was about three inches long - he has been under my care ever since, and is not yet quite recovered - he was kept in bed for a week, and was in very great danger of his life for four or five days.</p>

               <p>"What have got here; fowls?" He said</p>
               <p>"No, they are ducks" - I took him across the road, and gave him in charge of a man at the toll-gate - they were ducks; Brown seeing that I had got Pembrooke, set off running - I pursued, calling Stop thief! and a man stopped him two hundred yards off; when I came up, he asked why I hallowed Stop thief! I said, I had reason to believe he had stolen property, and as I brought him back, I saw his hand in his pocket, and heard something fall on the ground - I turned round and found a chisel; I said</p>
               <p>"You have dropped this; how did you get it;" he said he had found it. I found five ducks in his basket; there were three or four ducks, two fowls, and two bells in Pembrooke's basket; the prosecutor claimed two hens from Pembrooke's basket.</p>

On the 23d of March, I fastened the door and went to dinner, returned in three quarters of an hour, and found the back door split as under, a basket of tools was on the stairs; I had left it in the cellar. I found a hat on the bench in the shop, with four boot hooks which I had left in the basket; I knew the hat to be the prisoner's; he had been in my employ nearly six weeks before Christmas; I found a bundle containing four rolls of wire, a candlestick, and some pick-lock keys, which I had left in the cellar. There were some keys, a screw wrench, and steelyards in a bag; I went up stairs and found the prisoner without his hat against the back room door, and gave him in charge; and saw two optic glasses, and a steel purse, found on him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The stays are made by my daughter; the room I worked in was used as a bed-room, and every thing was in confesion - a man there said he would prig all he could lay hold of - and one of the witnesses is a common prostitute. The prosecutrix often authorised women to pawn goods for her at that and other shops.</p>

It could not have fallen from the waggon - it was a dirty day and the flat was quite clean.</p>

I directed my son and daughter to watch on the night of the 23d of February - they sat up in the room adjoining the kitchen, till three o'clock in the morning.

               <p>"Is that you, James?" and Scrace said</p>
               <p>"It is;" I said</p>
               <p>"Give me a light?" He did so - I put it in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070028"/>my room and came down on the stairs without it. I then heard the bar door shut and locked, and the key taken out - I then heard the cellar door opened with a key, and heard one of the men go down into the cellar - I came down near the cellar door, and heard some liquor rattling into a can; Scrace then came out and went along the passage, stamping and calling out - I waited till Turner came up with a can full of gin - when he came to the top of the cellar stairs I took hold of his arm - I said</p>
               <p>"Samuel, is it you who is robbing us?" - he made no answer, but tried to get away - I cried Murder! he let the can drop, but got from me - he got over the pales in the yard and got away. I then went into the kitchen and saw Scrace standing there - I said</p>
               <p>"You and Samuel are robbing us;" he said he knew nothing at all about it - he seemed anxious to light the fire, and take up the ashes; we sent for a constable, and before he came another servant lighted the fire, and in the ashes we found this key, which will lock and unlock the bar door - we gave Scrace into custody. They had no right to draw any liquors - they get up about six o'clock generally - they usually slept together in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was not one of the prisoners to have some gin for cutting your husband's corns? A. Yes, he gave it to him the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not your husband give him some directions to go and get some bottle for a medicine for a dog? A. No, there was no bottle for dog medicine in the cellar - they must have known that - I had got a light of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. What time do your servants generally get up? A. Between five and six; the kitchen joins the bar, which was locked the night before by my son, who had the key - the cellar is on the other side of the passage - the cellar keys were locked up in the bar.</p>

I had seen my brother lock the cellar door, and put the key into the bar - he locked the bar door and put the key into his pocket - soon after five we were awoke by a cry of Thieves! I went down and saw Scrace standing by the kitchen fire - I asked if they had been robbing us; he said he had not; I said one could not do it without the other; he said he knew nothing about it; he seemed anxious to light the fire and take up the cinders - I said he should not do any thing till the constable came. When the cinders were sifted this key was found there - it was his usual business to fight the fire.</p>

I slept in the house that night, but I do not know whether Scrace did - his usual place was with Turner; I know he went to sleep in the soldiers' room while Turner was cutting my father's corns - he could let himself into the house when he came to work in the morning; I stood by my father part of the time while he was having his corns cut, and then staid up till three o'clock. I gave orders to Turner to get some castor oil for the dog, and said I would get him a bottle out of the cellar in the morning, but he was not to get it. I fastened the cellar door, and hung the key in the bar, and then locked the bar, and put the key into my pocket.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. James Towers, of Great Titchfield-street. On the 26th of February, about eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070029"/>came into the shop, and inquired for Mr. Towers; I said he was down stairs; she said,</p>
               <p>"It is of no consequence, you will do as well; I called to look at some glass dishes, which I looked at a few days ago" - I shewed her two, and she asked the price; I told her 33 s. each; she said,</p>
               <p>"I think Mr. Towers said 23 s.;" I went below to inquire of him - when I came up I found the prisoner in the shop - I told her 33 s. was the lowest price; she said,</p>
               <p>"Now, I recollect that is the price Mr. Towers told me." She selected two; she then asked to look at some glass salts, and I got three out of the window; she selected two of them, and said,</p>
               <p>"I will take this pair." She then wanted to look at some china articles, and after selecting some she ordered a bill to made of them; the whole amounted to 5 l. 4 s. 6 d. After Mr. Towers had made the bill she said,</p>
               <p>"I wish a receipt to be sent with me, and I will send back the money;" Mr. Towers asked in what name he should make out the receipt: she said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Turner, No. 25, Devonshire-place." She said, as I was putting the dishes into the basket.</p>
               <p>"I am afraid you will chip the dishes, and the salts, I will take them in my basket," which she did; I then followed her to the corner of Wimpole-street, when she said to me,</p>
               <p>"Go to the door of my house; I am going to Mr. Dixon's, the butcher's" - she went away. I went to the house, and found a Mr. Still lived there, and they knew nothing of Mr. Turner. I took the articles into the kitchen, and waited half an hour till the housekeeper came home, and no such articles were expected; I did not see the prisoner till the 23d of March. I have traced the dishes and the salts to two pawnbrokers.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 19th of March, I met the prisoner in the Strand, about half-past four o'clock, with a sack. I asked him what he had got there; he said, his master's top coat; I said,</p>
               <p>"It is a queer thing for you to bag it," and asked his master's name; he said it was of no consequence - he should not tell me. I said,</p>
               <p>"I shall take you to the watch-house." I opened the sack, and found the box-coat in it, which was claimed by Squires; after I took him to the watch-house, he said,</p>
               <p>"I may as well tell you where I got it, I shall only get seven penny-worth - I took it from Mr. Mason's yard, Duke-street, St. James's."</p>

            . I work for the Gas Company at Westminster. I was looking in at this shop window, and saw the prisoner come out of the shop and pass by me behind, and drop a piece of linen - it appeared to me to be about fourteen or fifteen yards - there was no one with her. I said,</p>
               <p>"My dear, you have dropped it:" she said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, I have;" she then picked it up and walked on; it was plain Irish linen. Gay came out to me and made some inquiries - I told him what I had seen; she was then in sight, but not in hearing. Gay returned to the shop, and another person came out and followed the prisoner, who had then turned the corner; I followed him to Warwick-street, and saw him questioning her; I did not then see any linen with her; there were several persons by, and the shopman had hold of her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. When the linen fell on the ground, was she behind you? A. Yes, I told Gay what I had seen - he followed her immediately, and brought her back.

I saw the blanket in the caravan after all the goods had been carried into the house; I heard it was stolen while I was in the house - I had seen it safe about five minutes before. I followed, and saw Price with the prisoners in London-field; they behaved very well, and said they would go back and wait for a constable, for they had found it.</p>

About eight o'clock in the evening of the 16th of March, I was watching a house in Great White Lion-street, Seven Dials, which I knew to be kept by a receiver of stolen goods. I saw the prisoner go in with a bundle under his arm - I asked him what he had got - he said a gown piece,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070031"/>which a man had given him to bring there to sell, and he was to ask 1 l. for it, and to have 1 s. for his trouble; he did not then say who the man was, but he said afterwards that he met the man in Short's-gardens, and did not know that he should know him again if he saw him; I took him and the parcel out of doors - a man was waiting outside of the shop, and I asked the prisoner if he could see the man there who had given him the property; he said No; I said</p>
               <p>"Is this the man?" he said No. I went next morning to several shops, and found Allen had lost it.</p>

I asked what had become of my clothes; the prisoner said somebody must have come in and taken them; the two young women said they knew nothing about them; I went out, and brought an officer from Queen-square; I saw the stays about seven o'clock that evening.</p>

               <p>Conelly's Defence. I went with my brother up to Stamford-hill, to take a pair of drawers home; when I was coming back, a gentleman met me, and told me to go into this house and ask if Mr. Johnson lived there - and if he did, to tell the cook, she was wanted very particularly; I did not see any knocker, or bell - and I did not like to go into the kitchen; the man opened the door and asked what I wanted.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I apprehended the prisoner on Thursday, the 17th of March, in Little Earl-street, Seven Dials - I told him he was charged with having two wives; he at first denied it, but afterwards at the office he said,</p>
               <p>"I want to speak to you," and said,</p>
               <p>"What had I better do, had I better confess it;" I said,</p>
               <p>"You know best whether it is in the books or not;" he said,</p>
               <p>"Then it is so in the books, and I shall confess it, it is true - we were married at St. Mary-le-bone six years ago, and have two children;" he afterwards said to Clarke, in my presence,</p>
               <p>"I shall throw myself on the mercy of the law, or the mercy of the Court."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not you say to this man,</p>
               <p>"You had better tell the truth?" A. No, I am quite positive I did not; his wife came to the office on the evening before, with the register in her hand; she was not examined at all upon her oath.</p>
               <p>MARY HAYDON. About the beginning of this year I lived about one mile from the Earl of Bradford's - the prisoner solicited me in marriage; he represented himself as single; I married him at Blynhill, in Staffordshire.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BLOUNT. I was present at the marriage of this young woman and the prisoner, on the 24th of February last, at Blynhill.</p>
               <p>MARY HAYDON re-examined. Q. How long did you live with the prisoner? A. About one month; he came to town, and staid about one month after he married me; he was living with me in London when he was taken up; he was very kind to me.</p>

On the 15th of March, about four o'clock, the two prisoners came to the shop - there were a great many other persons there - we attended to the prisoners in about five minutes; they asked for some half-mourning prints - I think Sadler asked for them - they bought three yards at 1 s. 2 d. I saw Sadler shuffling something under her, and Gannon put herself in front of her, as much as she could; they paid for what they bought, and left the shop - they had not been there altogether about ten minutes - when they were gone I missed a piece of cotton print off the counter - I had been shewing it to them - I told Scruton - he followed and brought them back with the print; I was then at the end of the shop, and did not hear any thing said.</p>
               <p>Prisoner GANNON. Q. Did I stand before the other prisoner in the shop? A. Yes, you certainly did.</p>

               <p>"Give it me, and you may go about your business." Sadler then took the print from under her clothes - Gannon fought to get away, and Sadler did get away - I pursued and took her again, and then came back and took Gannon.</p>

               <p>"Master, you have dropped something;" I ran to the place, and saw the top of one of these candlesticks, which I took out of the boy's hand; I pursued the prisoner, and found the candlesticks on him; I took him to Mr. Walter's, and the top exactly fitted one of the candlesticks which he had. I took him to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>"What shall we look at?" She replied,</p>
               <p>"Some gown pieces." I showed them some; they fixed on one, and told me to cut seven yards off it. Weldon paid me 1 s. deposit, and told me to put it by; she said she was going a little further, and should bring a person with her to look at it, and then speak about a shawl - they were in the shop about half an hour; they returned in about half an hour, and Weldon asked to look at a shawl; I brought them seven to look at; while I was showing them, a lady came in and stood near the shawls, and while I was serving that lady, I saw Weldon put her arm under one shawl which she had spread over the rest, and draw another towards her - Mitchell was sitting by her side; I saw Mitchell jog Weldon with her foot, she did not then take the shawl; the lady went out, and I went to finish serving them. I saw Weldon draw a shawl towards her; Mitchell took it, and concealed it under her clothes; they then asked the price of one; I asked them 20 s., they offered me 18 s., I said I would take 19 s.; I wrapped it up, and counted the shawls over before them; there were then only six; I said there was one missing. Mitchell then got up and said I should search her, and so did the other. I said I knew Mitchell had got it; that I saw Weldon take it, and I would send for an officer. I went round the counter, and beckoned an opposite neighbour to send for an officer - and when I returned, the shawl was laying behind the counter, tumbled, and in different folds to what we fold them; I said one of them had thrown it there; they said they had not; I said I had seen the whole, and would send for an officer; the shawl was lying further from the window than I was; an officer was coming by, and a neighbour called him in; I gave them in charge. Mitchell offered me five shillings not to let her go before a magistrate. I said, I would not compromise the matter. She then offered to pay for the shawl, and Weldon said she would pay for the dress.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is not one of these women married? A. I have heard so.</p>
               <p>Q. You observed a jog of the foot, while you were serving the lady? A. Yes, and saw her put the shawl under her clothes. These shawls were lying on the counter, and there is a space between where they laid, and the shelves; on my oath, the shawl was not behind the counter before I went round.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear it was not there before you served them? A. No, I unpacked seven to shew them; I do not know whether there is a bell in the shop; I have been there seven months.</p>

            . I am a headborough of St. Paul, Shadwell. I took the prisoners into custody on the 14th of March; I heard Mitchell say to the last witness, that she would give him five shillings not to send her before the magistrate; and she would have the shawl; Weldon said she would have the gown piece; I took them to the watch-house and searched them; I found on Mitchell, eight shillings and some copper - but nothing on Weldon - nor any goods on them; this is the shawl which was given me by the last witness; I understand that Mitchell, is a married woman with a family - her husband is a respectable man.</p>

               <p>WELDON'S Defence. I had nine shillings in my pocket when I went to Mrs. Mitchell's house, and asked her to take care of it till Saturday; I then asked her to go with me to buy a dark gown - we went to the shop - I chose the gown, and left one shilling till I came back; I said to Mrs. Mitchell</p>
               <p>"Would you have this gown?" and I asked her to lend me two shillings, which she did - the gentleman never searched us; nor offered to do so - he said there was no occasion to do so; Mrs. Mitchell offered the officer half a crown to go to her husband; he took the half crown, but did not go.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BIRD re-examined. Q. Did this woman send you to her husband? A. Yes, she did - and gave me half-crown for going; I took the money and gave it her back again - she gave me her proper direction; I walked, I suppose, twelve miles for her.</p>
               <p>MITCHELL'S Defence. I took no shawl. I took up my clothes and said, you may search me if you please - but he said,</p>
               <p>"I will not search you - but you b - ch, you shan't run away;" that was the word he said at the door - he sent for an officer, but the officer did not search me; I had 14 s. 9 d. in my pocket - I offered him five shillings not to let me go before a magistrate; and gave him my husband's direction.</p>

            . I am agent to Mr. Richard Bury, and have a warehouse in King-street, Cheapside, as a silk hat shag manufacturer. On the 12th of August the prisoner purchased a small quantity of goods, amounting to about seven guineas, which he paid for at the time; he called again on the 16th, and bought about 8 l. worth of goods, and paid partly in cash, and a small bill for six guineas; he represented himself as one of the firm of Bakewell and Co. On the 20th of August I received a letter, and wrote an answer to Bakewell and Co.; and in consequence of another letter, I went to Mr. Rawlings, and enquired of him respecting Bakewell and Co; after which I opened an account with them on the behalf of Mr. Bury. I saw the prisoner, and agreed to receive in payment, bills drawn by Bakewell and Co. upon respectable parties - they carried on business at No. 3, King's-arms-yard, Commercial-road. The prisoner said Mrs. Bakewell was a relation of his, and he was the other partner. I furnished him with goods at different times up to the 12th of November. On the 22d of November I received a bill for 25 l. 14 s.; in a letter, which I produce.</p>

               <p>"M. Bakewell and Co.," to be in the prisoner's hand writing; this letter is also his writing.</p>
               <p>This letter was here read - it stated, that the bill was enclosed, and contained an order for more goods. The bill was also read - drawn by M. Bakewell and Co., on Thomas Oakley, Brentford, and accepted; payable at Mr. H. Rawlings's, No. 18, St. Dunstan's-hill.</p>
               <p>MR. HAYNES. I saw the prisoner afterwards, and inquired who Oakley the acceptor was; this was after it became due - he stated, that he was a very respectable man, living at Brentford; that he had done a good deal of business with him, and he had no doubt the bill would ultimately be paid. It was returned to me on the 15th of January, the day after it became due; I called at Bakewell and Co.'s, but did not see the prisoner; I called at Rawlings's where it was made payable, but did not get payment; I addressed a letter to T. Oakley, of Brentford, the same day; it was afterwards returned from the post-office; the date on the envelope is 22d of January, with this written on it,</p>
               <p>"No such name at Brentford, J. Durhan:" I wrote to Bakewell and Co., the prisoner came to me some time after, and I received this letter.</p>
               <p>This letter was here read; it stated, that a ship having sailed, without paying a shipment account, had placed them to temporary inconvenience, but they would take an early opportunity to satisfy the prosecutor as to Oakley's bill - signed</p>
               <p>"for M. Bakewell, M. A. Thompson." This letter enclosed another, addressed to Bakewell and Co. - dated, Brentford, 17th of January, and signed T. Oakley; stating, that unexpected losses had caused him to dishonour his bill; but that in a few days, he should be able to return to his usual punctuality. - Post mark,</p>
               <p>"20th January, 12 noon."</p>
               <p>MR. HAYNES. I saw the prisoner a few days after this; it was then I asked him about Oakley's bill; he gave the account I have before stated - before it became due, I had had dealings with him to the amount of 150 l. or 160 l. - I have received bills for it, which have not been paid - I received another letter; after which I wrote to him, requesting a personal interview - he came to me - I said, I wanted to hear what he had to say, but I could do nothing without the advice of my solicitor. He then gave me a kind of statement, which I put down at the time; he proposed giving up property, as a security for the debt - he said, he had twelve dozen hats pawned for 30 l.; but which were worth 90 l. - that the stock in his house, after his paying rent and taxes, was worth about 35 l. - that he was going to sell the stock, to one George Owen, and to receive a bill from him, which he would give me as part security; I did not accept this security; I inquired who the parties were to the different bills he had paid me; mentioning Oakley among them - he said, he was an agent of the house, and not worth two-pence; and spoke of the parties to the other bills in the same way - he said, if I chose to take what there was, I might; if not, I might arrest him, and do what I liked; I went to Brentford about the latter end of February, and again about a week ago, and then made diligent inquiry, but could learn nothing of such a person as Oakley there - I went to almost every second or third house in the town; and I looked for the Swan; as he had stated that he lived opposite to the Swan - I could find no such sign; I found the Swan-stairs, and inquired about there, but could find no Oakley.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. A man might be there in November, and not in April? A. I inquired if any such person had lived there - they had never heard of him - my agreement with the prisoner was that he should furnish me with respectable acceptances - not Oakley's in particular. I have been to King's Arms-yard, and found a business carried on in the name of Bakewell and Co. - I did not inquire about Oakley till the bill was due.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner stated, that he had been unfortunate, and obliged to pawn some goods, but would give up all he had: at your first interview did you not tell him you considered what he had done was a forgery? A. I did not. I took him into custody at our last interview - he had come of his own accord, upon an understanding that he was not to be arrested for debt.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. When did you go to Brentford to make inquiry? A. The latter end of February, I inquired at both the post offices, but did not go round to the houses till a week ago.</p>

            . I am post-master of Brentford, and have been so nineteen years and a half; the returned letter produced has my notification on it. I was born at Brentford. Before I returned the letter I personally made every possible inquiry, and directed my two men to do the same, but could discover no such person, and I made as diligent inquiry as possible, after my examination at Guildhall, whether any such person had been there for the last year, but could find no such person.</p>

               <p>The prisoner being called upon for his defence requested the Jury to dispossess themselves of all prejudice which had been excited against him, and complained of the vindictive conduct of a person named Catchpole, who had used every means to injure him. He stated he should prove the existence of Oakley, and that the acceptance was his; that Oakley had been engaged to sell shoes for him on commission. He would call persons who had heard him talk of going home to Brentford at night, and fearing he should be too late for the stage - that Oakley and Wilson had an office in Union-court, for the purpose of showing samples, as King's Arms-yard was at too great a distance for persons to come - that before he went to Mr. Haynes he had received an anonymous letter, cautioning him to get out of the way. The prisoner further stated the nature of the case he had to prove, which will be seen by the following evidence:</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Levy, a Sheriff's officer. I arrested the prisoner before the last term, between the 28th of November and the 23d of January - he proposed one Rochester, of Ratcliffe-highway, as bail; we took him to Rochester, who was not at home - my master sent me with the prisoner to find bail, and at last went to a man named Oakley, in Union-court, Broad-street. I saw a person in an office on the left hand side of the passage; the prisoner called him Oakley, and he answered to that name, and said he would become one of his bail; the writ was at the suit of Catchpole, for 17 l. - I asked him for a reference, and took down that he kept a situation with one Wilson, at Brentford - he said something about an establishment there in the hat line - Thompson said to him</p>
               <p>"Oakley, I have paid your bill away;" - he said it was for 25 l. and upwards - he said</p>
               <p>"I hope you will take care of it when it becomes due, or it will spoil my credit;" I went to Rochester with the bail bond, which he signed - Oakley went with me, but master would not take his bail as he lived so far he could not go to make inquiry.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Do you often bail persons yourself. A. Never - I have not got the warrant or bail bond here - I am in possession of a house at Knightsbridge, and did not know I should be called here till this morning. Oakley said his situation was in Union-court, and he had an establishment at Brentford. I knew I was to come here to give evidence of what passed at the prisoner's arrest - A young woman brought me a subpoena - she called herself Mrs. Riley - she said I was to mention what happened when Thompson was arrested.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What sort of a man was Oakley? A. Rather taller than I, but not so stout.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you recollect whether there was any name on the door in Union-court? There was, but what I do not remember - it is the second door before you come to Wormwood-street.</p>

I know Thomas Oakley - I think it was in December last that he came with a message from the prisoner, to borrow 2 l., which I lent him, and took his receipt; he signed it Thomas Oakley; I believe the money was to pay for a bail bond, as Thompson had been arrested; I had executed a bail bond for him that day; Oakley came with the officer to me, with it. I have seen him with Thompson three or four times since, and have seen Wilson with them both; I was at Wilson's house, at Brentford, about two months ago; it is on the right-hand side, opposite to the Castle, public-house; I did not see Oakley there. When he came for the 2 l. he said he was in a hurry to go away, as he had to go to Brentford.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. When had you received information about this felony? A. About September last; I told him there was a talk about a horse, but whether the charge would be made against him I did not know; I had received information about it in September, but having been ill since, I did not know whether he had been examined or not.</p>

It is customary with me, when I get up in the morning, to go to my stable, and take my horse to water - and at the bottom of Millman-row, I met a man on this mare; I asked him to exchange it for a larger one - he said No; we went into a public house, and I bought it of him, for 5 l.</p>

            . I am a constable. Mr. Cox complained to me, and on Monday evening, the 28th of February, about five o'clock, I went to Cohen's with him, and found a drab coat hanging at the door for sale. Cohen was not at home; I left word for him to come to me; he came next morning, and said there were four more of the same lot, and brought them.</p>

               <p>MR. COX re-examined. I have endeavoured to find Turpin, but without effect. I lost about 100 l. worth of property; it was all safe at half-past eleven o'clock the night before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought them of Turpin, who lives at Westminster: I told the officer and Cox so, the morning they came to me; Turpin had sent his sister to me. I called on him, and said they did not suit me - he asked me to sell them for him, as he was in trouble. I showed them to Jarman, who offered 2 l. less than I was to ask. I said, they were not my own, but if the person would take the money, he should have them. I paid Turpin the money - Jarman paid me; he allowed me 1 l.</p>

            . I lodge in the prisoner's house. On the morning of the 10th of February, my child was taken ill; I heard the prisoner come home that evening a little before twelve o'clock, and lock the door. I went down stairs about ten minutes past twelve o'clock - he was in bed, I knocked at his door, and asked his wife for a few matches, as my child was sick. I was up and down all night - he could not go out without my knowledge. I unfastened the door myself at six o'clock in the morning; I know it was the 10th, for I have a duplicate of some things which I pawned that day to raise money, as my child was taken ill.</p>

I was passing by the prosecutor's house as near seven o'clock as possible, and observed the prisoner standing close to Mr. Grey's window - I saw him rush his right arm through the glass, and pull out a quantity of jewellery - I was within eight yards of him - he ran off directly - I pursued him down Hartshorn-alley, and saw him constantly dropping jewellery, watches, and chains, one at a time; I kept following him - he was stopped without my losing sight of him - I am sure he is the man - he was taken in Northumberland-alley - he might have run a hundred and fifty or a hundred and sixty yards, but I never lost sight of him; we look him to the public-house to the officer - I did not pick up any of the property; I saw him take it and drop it - he said at the public house, that he was in among the mob and was running after the thief, but I was close to him all the way.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not tell the Lord Mayor, there were three or four persons round the window besides me? A. No, there was no other person but him - several were on the other side of the way.</p>

I was at work in Northumberland-alley on this evening and heard a cry of Stop thief! and instantly ran out, and saw the prisoner running very fast; he was the first who was running - I had nearly overtaken him, when he threw something away, which made a great crash - he ran two or three yards further, then stood still and turned round - I went up and collared him; he said</p>
               <p>"It was not me; what do you want with me?" I said I did not know, but he was running very fast, and must stop and see what was wanted of him. I picked up a gold chain in Northumberland-alley, and gave it to Smithers, the officer.</p>

On Wednesday, the 2d of March, I had been employed on business all day, till half-past nine o'clock in the evening; and then went out to get a little fresh air - I went through New-street, Covent-garden, and saw the prisoner Mould on the same side of the way; I met him; I walked a little way, he turned and followed me perhaps twenty yards; and finding he pressed me, I turned round on my way home; he repeatedly pushed against me the whole of the way down St. Martin's-court; I went into my house, and pointed him out to Baxter my shopman; Mould was then standing looking in at a ham and beet shop, about fifteen yards off, on the opposite side of the way. In consequence of what Baxter said, I went out and followed him up the court, and lost sight of him half-way up St. Martin's-court; he crossed the court, and on looking back I found he was gone. On the 6th of March, a gentleman dined with me; and about a quarter before nine o'clock in the evening, I went out a little way with him, and parted with him at the corner of Air-street, Leicester-square - I went along Coventry-street and met Mould, whom I recognized as having met before, as I stated; he put his hand to his hat, and said,</p>
               <p>"How do you do, Sir?" I took no notice of him, but crossed the road; he crossed also, and then put his hand to his hat again, saying,</p>
               <p>"How do you do, Sir? I am the lad you met the other evening; you have taken indecent liberties with me, and if you do not give me some money, I will give you in charge."</p>
               <p>Q. I do not ask if you gave him any thing, but what did you do after that? Q. I proceeded in a direction for St. James's-square, along Charles-street, and saw several carriages driving about the square, and understood the Duke of Norfolk was coming out of a house there; I waited to see him, and while waiting, the prisoner Mould pushed up to me again - upon which I turned short round and went home; and on my way home, he accosted me at the corner of Charles-street, and said,</p>
               <p>"This won't do, you must give me something more, or I'll give you in charge." I was exceedingly agitated at such a charge, at which one must recoil with horror. I told him he might take me, or my life, or what he pleased; I then went home. On the 9th of March, I met him again in Holborn, about two o'clock in the afternoon opposite Little Queen-street, he touched his hat with his hand and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070044"/>said,</p>
               <p>"How do you do, Sir?" I made him on I reply - I had occasion to go into different shops, and while there, I observed him - I saw him looking in at the window of Mr. Collett, an ironmonger, in Middle-row, where I was - I afterwards went to Wilson and Co., druggists, Snow-hill, and saw him there; he followed me from there to Mr. Biggerstaff's, my brother-in-law's, in Smithfield; just as I got to his door, he came before me, put his hand to his hat, and said,</p>
               <p>"How do you do?" I gave him no answer; when I came out from Mr Biggerstaff's he was standing on the opposite side of the railing; I went from there to another brother-in-law's, Mr. Lever's, No. 15, Smithfield; he followed me to the door, and just as I got inside, I saw him walking up and down before the window; I left that house at the back entrance, in order to avoid him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you out on the 21st of March? A. I was going to Mr. Griffiths, No. 2, Pullen's-row, Islington, and met Mould about twenty yards on the City side of Templebar - he touched his hat and said, How do you do, Sir? - I said nothing to him; I afterwards went to Mr. Clark's in Fleet-street - intending to get him to assist me in taking him; having determined to do so, as he said in Fleet-street,</p>
               <p>"I am the lad that met you the other evening and you injured me very much - and if you do not give me something, I will give you in charge;" I then determined to get assistance and take him - but Mr. Clark was not at home; while I was at Mr. Clark's I observed him looking through the window; I waited about twenty minutes, Clark did not come, and in order to avoid him, I sent for a coach which I got into - and observed him running down by the side of it, down Fleet-market; and about Smithfield-bars he got up behind the coach - I desired the coachman to flog him off; I proceeded in the coach to Mr. Griffith's and there discharged the coach; George, Mr. Griffiths servant, came to the door - I merely said to him,</p>
               <p>"Let me out your back way, for there is a fellow lurking outside I wish to avoid" - I went out the back way.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 24th did your receive any communication from Mr. Griffiths? A. Yes, and went to Mr. Biggerstaff's, in order to meet Mould; Mr. Lever, my brother-in-law, had come for me with a message from Mr. Biggerstaff - I understood I was to meet the prisoners in an hour. I had an officer ready to take them, but they did not come to Mr. Biggerstaff's. On the morning of 25th a note was brought to me by Mr. Griffiths's servant, and in consequence of that note I went to the terrace on the Temple, with the note; I got there in about ten minutes, when the prisoner Denman, came up, and said,</p>
               <p>"Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Cozens?" I said,</p>
               <p>"That is my name - what is your business?" his reply was that he had written a note to me, which of course I had received; I said I had, and in consequence of that note I had come to meet him at the appointed time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you received any other note to lead you there but that? A. None; I observed the prisoner Mould standing under the clock; Denman stated that he had come to me respecting some very unpleasant affair between me and that youth, pointing to Mould; that I had taken indecent liberties with him - that he (Denman) was a respectable stationer, residing in Edgware-road; that he had brought up a large family respectably - that the youth (pointing to Mould) had returned a few evenings since, and communicated to the whole of his (Denman's) establishment, that a gentleman had taken indecent liberties with him a few evenings since, whom he since understood to be me - that he could not suffer such a slur to remain over the character of himself and his family, and as the youth was going to sea he wished the affair to be compromised, and demanded of me as a compromise 5 l.; he said,</p>
               <p>"We must have 5 l.:" he said he had once fitted the youth out for sea, and had been at a great expense with him: that he had unfortunately got into bad company, and frequented ale-houses, but that he had promised to reform, and he was about to re-fit him for sea. He again said,</p>
               <p>"If you will give us 5 l. this affair shall be entirely buried in oblivion, and you may rely on it you shall never hear any more of it;" he said</p>
               <p>"We must have 5 l." I merely stated that I was not a rich man - that I was a tradesman, and could not afford to give so much, upon which I took out two sovereigns, and about 10 s., in loose silver, from my pocket; Denman held out his hand for the two sovereigns - I said,</p>
               <p>"I shall not give it to you - I shall give it to the person who has accused me." Mould then held out his hand, and I gave him the two sovereigns, which had been previously marked; Denman then said,</p>
               <p>"You must make up the other as soon as you can, for we must have 5 l." - I immediately gave a signal, which had been agreed upon, and Wainwright, who was waiting, came up and took them into custody. There had been a plan to apprehend them; the sovereigns had been marked, and delivered to me for that purpose. I went afterwards to Denman's lodging, in Clement's-lane, with Mr. Harmer's clerk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You refused to give Denman the money, but said you would give it to the person who accused you? A. I did. I have lived in London at various periods, probably five or six years. I never saw Mould before the 2d of March; I went no further than New-street that night; he pushed against me in the street five or six times - I did not collar him; he did not speak to me that night. When I met him on the 6th he pushed against me, but not so much as before. I recognised him when he addressed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not day-light? A. No; it was about a quarter to nine o'clock on the 6th; I recognised him by the light of the lamps in Coventry-street; I did not give him in charge, nor ask why he pushed me: there were thirty or forty people in St. James's-square - he only pushed against me once in that crowd.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not take him in charge - he had not accused you of any thing then? A. Yes, he had. I had no cause to give him in charge on the 2d. He pushed me purposely five or six times. I never saw Denman till I went to Temple-terrace; he told me there that the other had said I had taken indecent liberties with him.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was Denman close by when you said you would give the money to the person who had accused you? A. Yes, and after I gave it to Mould, Denman said,</p>
               <p>"We must have the other to make up the 5 l." Before I came to town I lived with Mr. Pitt, a surgeon, at Brighton. My father was a banker, at Watlington, in Oxfordshire - I was brought up there, and apprenticed to Mr. Hopewell, of George-street, Portman-square.</p>

            . I am porter to Mr. Lever, No. 15, Smithfield bars. One day in March, about three o'clock, Mr. Cozens came to master's house, and after he had come in I observed Mould walking backward and forward, and looking in at the window; I went to the door, he came up and asked if the gentleman lived there who had just come in - nobody but Mr. Cozens had come in; I said he did not, and did not say where he did live. Mould walked into the shop again, about a week after, and asked if Mr. Thomas Cozens had been there? we said he had not. The shopman asked him if he had found out where Mr. Cozens lived; he said he thought either at No. 82, Smithfield or No. 2, High-street, Islington; that he got up behind a coach, but Mr. Cozens looked out and asked the coachman to whip him down - he went away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner MOULD. You told me he was not within; that you knew what circumstances I had come under, and that his brother had been taken up on the same ground. Witness - It is all false; I did not know Mr. Cozens had a brother.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Griffiths. On the 21st of March, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, Mr. Cozens came to master's house in a coach; he appeared very much frightened; he came into the passage and asked me to let him out our back way, which I did; Mould came to the door in about a quarter of an hour - nobody had called in the mean time; he asked for the gentleman who had come in the coach; I said he was not in the house; he said he was sure he was in the house, for he had been at the door ever since he came in, and that he could not get out the back way, because of the New River; he said he would fetch an officer and have the house searched; I said he might, for he was not there. On the 24th of March, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, both the prisoners came in the house; Denman asked the last witness if Mr. T. Cozens was there - I came up, and then he asked me (Mould was by); I said he was not; Denman said he had received a letter, stating that he was residing at this house, No. 2, Pullen's row; I said he did not, but he might find him at No. 82, Smithfield; I looked round at Mould, and said</p>
               <p>"You are the young man who was here the other evening?" He said</p>
               <p>"Yes, I am." I said</p>
               <p>"I knew your face again." They thanked me and went away; I followed them straight down St. John-street-road, and saw Denman go into the George and Dragon public-house; Mould went into a shop and got some paper and went over to him; I made the best of my way to No. 82, Smithfield, and informed master what had happened, and saw both the prisoners opposite to No. 82, Smithfield, three-quarters of an hour after I had left them in St. John-street.</p>

            . Wainwright's evidence is correct. I searched in Edgware-road, to find such a person as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070046"/>Denman, a stationer, and called at all the should which appeared to sell stationary; I searched and made diligent inquiry but could find nobody of the name.</p>
               <p>DENMAN'S Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, my not having pleaded guilty was with a conviction of my innocence of any felonious intention of extorting money from Mr. Cozens; having once swerved from the paths of rectitude two years ago - the press has held me up as a youth lost to all morality, and I was obliged to do as I could for a living; about six months ago I got a situation with a doctor, at Lambeth, but he was unable to support me; fearful of being arrested, I was obliged to go into obscure lodgings to avoid an arrest. If my fellow prisoner has mislead me I am sorry for it, but I trust that merely, which has always been held out by His Majesty, will be extended to me; I knew Mould, by having seen him in Covent-garden, with salesmen, where he lived, but being mislead he swerved from the paths of rectitude. - He came to me one night, and stated that he had known Mr. Cozens before Christmas, and that Mr. Cozens had actually given him a pound or two at a time - that he had seen him a night or two ago, and he had promised to serve him, and would I write to Mr. Cozens to assist him; wishing to serve him I wrote, and certainly did not wish to put my name to the letter. I am the son of a military officer, of some rank, who has fought the battles of his country. I was mislead by a set of fellows who kept a gaming-house, in the vicinity of St. James's, and was ruined; but it was not for money for myself that I acted in this business. If no commiseration can be shewn to me I must bow to my sentence, but I am innocent of any felunions intention. I had met with the patronage of His Majesty to a literary work of great magnitude, but His Majesty's official letter, having fallen into the hands of some gentlemen it was withheld from me.</p>

The prisoner was in our service on the 10th of March, and for six months before; we missed some nutmegs that morning from a glass in the window - while he was out we sent for a constable, and searched his box, which was opened by a smith; we found in it some tea, nutmegs, and ginger; he came in in about a quarter of an hour - I asked him where he had taken the nutmegs and other things - he appeared very indifferent, and said,</p>
               <p>"What nutmegs? I have taken none;" I asked him if he would allow us to look into his box; he said Yes, and went down for the key, which he said he could not find; the officer was present; I said we would save him the trouble of unlocking it - we brought it out, and opened it before him; I asked him when he got them - he said about nine weeks ago.</p>

On the 25th of February, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, I stopped the prisoner in Rosemary-lane, near Blue Anchor-yard, with a jacket and a pair of trowsers, a shirt and a pair of braces, under his arm. I asked him how he came by them? he said he had had a few words with his landlady, and was going from his lodging. I took him into custody: when we got before the Magistrate, he acknowledged he had stolen them; he stated he was a pensioner of the Navy, and had 16 l. a year.</p>

            . I am thirteen years of age; I live at No. 11, John's-row, Bath-street, City-road; I work for Mr. Skinner, whip-maker, in Finsbury. On the 28th of February I saw one man standing on the curb, and the two prisoners go to the back of this truck, and each take hold of one end of the box and take it out. I gave information, and pursued them toward Ropemaker's-street - I lost sight of them; I went back to the truck, and myself and the youngest man who was drawing it went and saw the two prisoners and the box in a coach, in custody. I saw them at the office the next day.</p>

On Monday, the 28th of February, I was with Herdsfield in London-wall - I saw the truck which two men were drawing - the prisoner Bailey, and two others, were following it; one of them had a white hat on - we followed them along the pavement, and saw Bailey cross the truck two or three times; when they got between Ropemaker's-street, and Chiswell-street, I saw a man coming back with the box on his head: Bailey was ten or fifteen yards behind him; and a third person was behind him; we crossed the way, and the man with the box turned down Ropemaker's-street; Herdsfield cried,</p>
               <p>"Stop thief!" and when we got into Ropemaker's-street, the box lay on the ground, and Horling was in the act of picking up this knot - I said,</p>
               <p>"What have you got here;" he made some answer, but I do not know what. I took him, and Herdsfield took Bailey. I did not notice the persons who were drawing the truck.</p>

            . I am a constable. I received the watch from Lesar - it was claimed by Higginbotham. I heard the cry of Stop thief! and ran out of the watch-house, and came up with the prisoner and Boison, who had got hold of him; some person in the crowd said,</p>
               <p>"That is he," and I took charge of him directly. As soon as Higginbotham came he charged him with having stolen his watch. While we were there some person said a woman had found the watch; I went to the corner of Holywell-lane, and got it. When I collared the prisoner he said,</p>
               <p>"I am innocent;" I said,</p>
               <p>"Why did you run?" he said,</p>

               <p>"You are the man who has stolen the watch," but I am quite innocent.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

On Thursday, the 24th of February, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I was in my own house, and did not see any thing of this - I take in washing, and had sent my child with a little boy to take some things to the mangle, about twelve doors from my house - when she went out she had the necklace on; she returned in about ten minutes crying, and said she had lost it. I saw it again on the Wednesday following, at Lambeth-street, and knew it. The prisoners were then in custody.</p>

            . I live in Philip-street, and am a servant. I saw the child between five and six o'clock, at the corner of the street where I live; I did not see the little boy with her. I saw the three prisoners going up the street; I am quite certain of Julian, who is lame; they were about fifteen or twenty yards from the child: I came down stairs, and saw them make a stop at the top of the street. - The child had no necklace on then, and was crying,</p>
               <p>"My beads, my beads." I took her home to her mother, and the mother and I went after the boys, but could not find them. I saw Julian at the office the next day.</p>

            . I am a constable. From information which I received I took Carwarden and Falgate into custody, on Saturday morning - Julian had been in custody before. I asked them what they had done with the beads - they said they knew nothing about them. I took them to a public-house, and searched them, but found nothing - Carwarden afterwards said to Julian's mother that he had given the beads to a girl in Rosemary-lane; she asked if he meant Betsy, and Falgate said Yes; I then went with Julian's mother, to Betsy, but she denied knowing any thing about them; I was bringing her to the office, and she said,</p>
               <p>"It's of no use having a piece of work about a row of beads, come back, and I'll give them to you:" I went back, and she gave them to me - I showed them to Mrs. Aves, who claimed them as her's.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going along with the pot, and the officer said</p>
               <p>"Where did you come from?" I said from Wiltshire - I told him I got the pot from Mr. Smith; I had been the night before at Mr. Smith's and asked Mrs. Smith, to lend me a pot to take home half a pint of beer - she said</p>
               <p>"Yes, but do not let Mr. Smith know it?" I was going to take it home and the officer stopped me.</p>

            . I am foreman to the prosecutor. On Friday, the 28th of January, I saw the waggon with five hogsheads of sugar, which were to go to Crowcher and Bishops, on account of Mr. Scott; I went with it, and got on to Limehouse turnpike; finding the waggon did not come, I went back to meet it; I found it stopping near a turning in the road, and saw a tarpauling put over the sugar; there was no appearance of rain; I went on and stopped at the turnpike till the waggon came up, and the two prisoners were walking by it; I was in the toll-house, and do not know that they saw me, they went on and I saw Barney for a little distance; I then lost sight of him - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070055"/>went up and asked Hartis where he had been so long; he said to get a little beer, I said he had no business to stop; I then asked about the tarpauling, and if he thought it was going to rain; he repeated my question, and said</p>
               <p>"Going to rain" - I then called to the horses to stop and told him to get up and take the tarpauling off, as people would have a suspicion there was something wrong; I then saw a man's hand which appeared to prevent it from coming off - and saw Barney between two hogsheads of sugar, scraping some loose sugar into a bag - I told Hartis to tell that fellow to get out; he said,</p>
               <p>"What fellow?" I said Barney - Barney then jumped out and got away; I came with the waggon to Church-lane and sent for Mr. Scott; I did not examine the sugar, but gave it to Mr. Scott; I looked at the tin cover of the drawing hole of one of the hogsheads, it appeared to have been raised and put down without being driven down - an instrument could have been introduced into the hogshead from that piece of tin being moved; it was weighed soon afterwards, and was six pounds deficient.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am in the habit of going in and out - I never opened the box: she came on the 15th of March, and ran up stairs; I went after her, and sat down on the bed. I saw the things she had brought with her, and said, I was glad to see she had got so many things; she then sent me down, and staid about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes - she then came down and went out, and came back with Mrs. Whiting, and said she was robbed; I said,</p>
               <p>"Dear me, how can that be, I have no one here to rob you." Mrs. Whiting said,</p>
               <p>"If you don't produce the tickets, or the things, I will fetch an officer." I said,</p>

On the 15th of March I was out late with my team, and went to the Plough, public-house, Beaufort-buildings, about ten o'clock, with my son, to have a pot of half-and-half - one of my fellow servants was there; after drinking that pot we agreed to have a pot each, which we drank; it was then half-past twelve o'clock: I looked at my watch, and said it was time to go home, for I would stop no longer; the prisoner sat opposite to me, he followed me out and caught hold of my arm. I could not get from him, he would go home with me. I am sure I put my watch back into my fob, and had it in my fob when he caught hold of me; I did not go into any public-house with him - he wanted me to go into several; as soon as he loosened my arm, I put my hand down and missed my watch; my pocket was cut in two places, nobody but him had been near enough to cut it; he was a stranger to me - my son was with me all the time; I have not received my watch. I went to the same public-house next morning, and saw him sitting there; he said,</p>
               <p>"How did you get on when you got home last night?" I said,</p>
               <p>"Very well." I immediately went to Bow-street and got an officer, but when we got back he was gone. I went again in the afternoon, and he was there; I had him secured.</p>

We all three came out together - the prisoner followed us out; when I came to the top of the buildings, I turned into the Strand; he took hold of my father's arm, and insisted on seeing him home; I said, I was going that way myself, but all at once, by Catherine-street, I missed them; nobody but the prisoner went near enough to cut his pocket; we sat in a small box; there was only room for four.</p>

On the 11th of March, I and Mrs. Brice spent the evening at Mrs. Johnson's, in Holywell-street, Westminster: she is Mrs. Brice's mother, and gave us a cake for our children, rolled up in a piece of paper; upon which Mrs. Johnson's address was written. On our return home, about half-past nine, I saw the cake put into the side board drawer - it still had the paper on it; we went to bed a little after ten o'clock; I was not the last person up; the cook fastened the house up - I was alarmed a little before three o'clock by Mrs. Brice - I got up, opened my bed room door, and distinctly heard some persons in the house - I returned, threw up the window and called the watchman; I found eight or nine watchmen had assembled round the house. I then directed them to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070058"/>the back of the house, as I had heard a noise there - I opened the hall door and let the watchmen in, on to the lead flats - I remained in the house and examined the ground floor; I found a square of glass taken out of the scullery window; the door leading from the scullery to the kitchen was bored through, and the bars undone, so that they could open the door; all the closets in the kitchen were broken open, also the wine cellar. The sideboard in the dining room was broken open, and several articles, which were in it, scattered about the dining room floor, and also in the kitchen; there was wine, rum, and jellies on the kitchen table - we had a drum of figs in the side-board; I found that nearly empty, and some scattered about the floor - the plumb cake and the paper were both gone; I saw all the prisoners in the watch-house that morning; I did not find any of them in the house; I saw marks of blood in the passage leading from the back yard to the stable, and where all the windows were broken, as if the parties had been endeavouring to escape there; the shutters of the stair-case window, and the glass was also broken; I had heard somebody escaping out that way, and have no doubt that is the way they did escape. The articles stated in the indictment were missing; there was a silver cruet stand, a coat, some cruet tops, and other things shewn to me when they were found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Have you any other Christian name? A. None; when I gave the alarm, the watchmen were collected; there must have been an alarm before I gave any - the virander prevented my seeing into the street - I cannot say whether there were other persons besides watchmen; there were two other persons at the watch-house, in the morning, after breakfast when I went there - they were spectators, and were taken at the watch-house, about half-past nine in the morning; I have heard nothing of them since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROBERTS. Q. It was a very dark night? A. Not very dark.</p>

            . I am a watchman, and was stationed near Euston-square - Mr. Brice lives at No. 17. On the morning of the 12th of March, I was attracted to his house by hearing a noise in the kitchen; I listened against the rails, and presently heard it again, and heard a noise as if a door creaked - I was convinced some persons were in the house - I ran up the steps - rang the bell - sprang my rattle, and other watchmen collected - there were no strangers about the house at that time; two men came up and asked me what o'clock it was - they went away. In consequence of what Mr. Brice said, I went to the back part of the premises with other watchmen; the other watchmen got on the leads of the stable of No. 22, with a ladder and torch; I staid at the end of the mews to prevent an escape, and I saw two of the prisoners come off the leads of No. 28, jump down into a garden; the leads were about twenty feet high - I think, they let themselves down by the boughs of a poplar tree; I was put over the wall into the garden, and found Dunn and Crawley there; they stood up concealed in one corner - I am positive they are the men who I had seen drop down by the poplar tree; no other men were in the garden - I secured and took them to the watch-house - returned to Mr. Brice's house, went on the leads and found a silver cruet stand, two cruet tops, a sugar spoon, and a dark lantern - I found a crow bar just under the staircase window; I found a chisel in the front kitchen, and a toast rack in the kitchen or pantry - it was bent; I saw some figs found in Crawley's pocket - I had heard a window break when I was listening in the street; I did not examine their hands.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How many watchmen were collected? A. Five or six; there might be fifty people collected in the course of the time - two persons came up while I was listening to the noise; they asked me what o'clock it was - there is a mews at the back of the houses, with coach-houses and stables, and a garden wall at the back of the house; it is very high, a person could not get over without assistance - I was heaved up: there is a space of about thirty-feet between the wall and the flats; there is not a garden to all the houses, only to No. 28.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a space between the house and stables? A. Yes, I saw the two persons on the stables - watchmen do not carry dark lantern's - I returned from taking them to the watch-house in about a quarter of an hour; it is very near.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROBERTS. Q. When Mr. Brice gave an alarm at the front window the watchman ran round behind? A. Yes, there was nobody assembled round the house but the watchmen - there were about fifty persons in the mews after the prisoners were taken; Mr. Brice called out to me that they were escaping at the back - there were no persons round then; I saw the prisoners on the flats - I was not ten yards from the wall.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Though there is a space between the flats and the wall, there is a tree by which they got down? A. Yes, the two men asked me the time, before I heard glass break in the house - the crowd assembled after the prisoners were taken.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The first thing you did on hearing the noise, was to ring the bell and spring your rattle, then the watchmen came, and Mr. Brice opened the window? A. Yes; the watchmen collected before I went to the back of the premises, but no other persons; when I got to the mews there were no persons collected that I saw, but I stopped at the end.</p>

            . I am a watchman. My attention was directed to Mr. Brice's house and the mews; I saw the heads of two persons going along the top of the stables, towards the end of the square; I saw one of them climb up the tree; a servant let me through into the garden of No. 28; I found Crawley and Dunn there; they are the men I had seen on the leads, I believe; there were no other men there; Hooper and I took them to the watch-house; they were searched in my presence by Cousins.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you come up on Hooper's springing his rattle? A. Yes, I only found Hooper there; another watchman or two came up before I went round to the back; Mr. Brice hallooed out of window that they were escaping backward; I went round - Hooper followed me, I believe; I found nobody in the mews that I recollect, but in a minute or two a watchman came along at the end of the street, with a prisoner, and said</p>
               <p>"We have got one, and there are two more behind," but they did not come along the mews.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went into the garden of No. 28, how<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070059"/>many persons had collected? A. There was a watchman of two coming up, and there might have been a person or two; I went to the front for the servant to let me into the garden - about ten minutes had elapsed before I took the men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROBERTS. Q. Were you in the square when Mr. Brice gave the alarm? A. Yes; I got to the door of No. 28, about ten minutes after that - it was not a quarter of an hour; I found the two prisoners in the garden; the other watchman came over to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say it was the prisoners whom you saw running over the leads? A. I believe it to be them, for I saw them go down into the garden, and there was nobody else there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you find a number of persons in the the mews? A. No, I saw nobody there - I had not been there two minutes before I saw the men running on the leads.</p>

            . I am footman to Mr. Roxborough, No. 28, Euston-square. On the morning of the 12th of March, at six o'clock, I went into master's garden, and found the stock of a center bit, a cake, a pot of jelly, some Turkey figs, and the top of a cruet frame. I was at home when the alarm was given, and let the watchman in; I had been in the garden at ten o'clock the night before; there was nothing of the sort there then; the prisoners had no business there; I saw the watchman find them in the garden, concealed in the area under the window; there is a poplar tree behind the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. At what time did you let the watchman in? A. About three o'clock - I heard windows break - I opened the window, hearing an alarm, and thought I heard a man jump down by the tree - I let Finch and another person in in front - there might be half a dozen persons standing in the street at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were in the garden altogether? A. I cannot say, but there were not more than three or four, besides the two I let in; I have not seen the person since, who came in with the watchman; the prisoners were found in three minutes. I then shut the garden up and went to bed without looking about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROBERTS. Q. Though you did not look about, if a piece of white paper had laid on the ground you probably would have seen it? Yes; I should think the garden wall is twelve feet high; I am not certain of the height.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You let Finch and another person in? A. Yes; they were both watchmen; I let nobody else in; another watchman was put over the wall; I let nobody else in and saw nobody else but the prisoners - they were taken through the house to the watch-house - I shut the door when I admitted the watchmen - nobody but them and the prisoners could be in the garden without my knowledge.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How many did you let out at the front door? A. Five - three watchmen and the two prisoners.</p>

            . I am a watch-house-keeper. On the 12th of March, Crawley and Dunn were brought to the watch-house; Crawley's hand was cut and bloody; it was quite a fresh cut; he washed it in the morning, and while he was washing it I said, he had made a bad job of it; he said</p>
               <p>"Yes, and I don't care if I get off for life." Dunn did not hear this conversation - I searched Crawley and found some figs in his pocket; I went to Mr. Brice's house with a crow bar and implements which were brought to me by the different watchmen; I applied the crow bar to a lock which had been broken open, and the wide end of it corresponded exactly with it; Goff was brought to the watch-house before the other two; I examined his hand - it was cut; he said he had knocked his hands by some means or other, a day or two before; but it was a fresh cut, and appeared to have been grazed with glass, or something sharp; there was blood all round his finger.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. What do you mean by being grazed? A. I suppose it was cut by glass or something; there was blood on it; I consider it a cut - it might be done by his running against any thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROBERTS. Q. If a man had got over a wall he might have grazed it? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was in Euston-square on the night in question, and in consequence of information I went on the flats of the stables, and found Goff laying down in a gutter on the top of the stable - he was awake and laying on his belly - I laid hold of him and took him through No. 21, to the watch-house, with Liers' assistance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How many watchmen were there in the street? A. I do not know; Liers and I were the only two who went on the flats. I saw Hooper in front of the house; Liers and I were the two first who got to the mews - we left Hooper at the end; we went round as Mr. Brice said they were escaping behind; I went round in three or four minutes: I got on the flats with a lamplighter's ladder; we called to him to bring his ladder. I saw nobody in the mews till the prisoners were secured; I might have seen half a dozen people in the mews when I went into the stables; I found Goff in the gutter on the stables of No. 21.</p>
               <p>Q. He was in the same position as a man would be who fell? A. I do not know that.</p>

On the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070060"/>night of the 11th of March I shut the house up - I fastened the scullery window, and the door leading from the scullery to the kitchen; the glass was entire: I fastened the house all up, and was the last person up. I heard glass breaking in the morning, and got up - I found the window leading to the leads broken; it was secure when I went to bed. I left no jelly pots on the table; I left a cloth and jug there. When I got up I found the drawers open, and the doors broken open, the store closets broken open, two bottles, two candles, and several pots of preserves were on the dresser - a square of glass was cut out of the scullery window; the back kitchen window was broken: a door leading to the safe had a square of glass broken: the cellar was also broken open.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Is there any shutter to the scullery window? A. No, it looks into the front area; the window does not open. The glass was secure the night before. (Looking at the property,) here is a toast-rack, which was left on the kitchen table - this cruet frame was quite perfect the night before - these spoons are master's, they were found on the leads; this cruet top is his. The chisel was not in the house the night before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How far is the house from the stables? A. It is no distance; there is only an area between them - it is not more than half the length of this place.</p>

               <p>MR. BRICE. Here is the direction on the paper containing the cake,</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Johnson, No. 43, Holywell-street, Westminster;" it is the paper which inclosed it when she gave it to me. All the property produced is mine - I value it at about 5 l. The cruet frame is silver, and cost me 16 l. When I gave the alarm I heard glass break; that window is on the first floor landing-place, and leads to the lead flat, which communicates with the stables.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Is there a communication from your stair-case window to the flats? A. Yes; my yard is not above six feet wide; the stable is not above nine or ten feet from the house, and a flat leads from the window to the roof of it. The girl is mistaken in there being a yard half the length of this Court.</p>
               <p>GOFF'S Defence. I had been to Highgate to take a pair of shoes home to a young woman - I supped there, and got rather intoxicated, and as I came through this square I heard an alarm - several people ran down the stable yard; they put a ladder up, and I, being intoxicated, ran up the ladder, fell down, and was immediately seized by two watchmen; several people saw me go up the ladder, but I was so drunk I had not power to speak for them to be here to prove it.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave Goff a good character, and three deposed the same for Crawley.</p>

I met her there by chance - we got into conversation; I had only been a few days in town - I said, I had no residence, and we slept together there; she got up while I was asleep, about six o'clock; but I awoke before she was gone, and saw her with my clothes in her hand; my money was in my pocket, and my watch on the table; she said she was looking for money to fetch some beer; I said, I wished she would, for I was thirsty - she went out and never returned. I found my pockets empty, and my watch gone. I found her in the evening at her lodgings - she acknowledged having pawned my watch; and said she had lost the duplicate, but had a certificate, and would return it to me at Mrs. Baker's, at one o'clock, but she never came. I found her in the evening, and she delivered me a certificate of the watch, pawned for 30 s.; I gave her in charge. I swear I did not give her the watch - the door was bolted inside. I had been at the house one night before.</p>

               <p>EDWARD COUCHMAN. I am a printer, and live in Throgmorton-street. The prisoner was my servant; Oliver gave me information - I pursued, and came up with the prisoner about one hundred and fifty yards off, with a ream of foolscap on his shoulder; I said,</p>
               <p>"I have caught you at last" - he made no reply; he was rather intoxicated, but talked quite sensible.</p>

On the 13th of March he called about half-past seven o'clock in the morning - I saw him go out, and when he had got six or seven houses further I saw a quantity of pork found upon him; Read searched him, and found three belly pieces and two legs of pork; he had them tied in an apron.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you any mark on it? A. I had marked it with a knife and fork.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Forbes. On the morning master turned the prisoner away, he came to me, and said if I liked he could put me in a way to get 10 s. a week; he took me to a public-house, and gave me a glass of gin; his brother came out: he told me to go away - he then told me to go in doors, and take two bellies, tie them on each side of me, and he would give me 5 s., and if I would do it again he would give me 6 d. a pound for it - I said I would think of it. I immediately went and told master; Read was desired to watch him. - On the 13th of March, between seven and eight o'clock, he came in; I saw him take the pork, and tie in his apron - he went out; I told master, who followed him.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was on the opposite side of the market, within view of the prosecutor's door. I saw the prisoner go in; he came out with a large bundle under his arm; I stopped him, and insisted on knowing what he had got; he said,</p>
               <p>"Go back, and it will be all right," and when he got near the door he dropped the bundle, containing two legs and three belly pieces of pork, which weighed 33 lbs.</p>

When I went there with the officer he denied knowing the boy, or having any property of mine, or any other persons in his possession. I found nothing but the kerseymere that I could swear to. It was under some things on the tester of a bed. I fetched Parton, who told Riley, in my presence, that he had sold him the kerseymere, for 1 s. 6 d., on the Saturday before; Riley denied it altogether, but gave no account of how he became possessed of it.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. I went with the prosecutor to Riley's, and found these articles under a parcel of rubbish on the top of a bed - Riley was not at home, but he came in, and I read my warrant; he denied having the property, or knowing the boy. Mr. Maire told me to stop five minutes, and fetched Parton, who said,</p>
               <p>"That is what I sold him for 1 s. 6 d. on Saturday last."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What did you say to him? A. I only read my warrant, and said I was come to search his house - I did not say any thing more till Mr. Maire fetched the boy; Riley then denied knowing him, or having any kerseymere in his house.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MAIRE. I know it by a pattern, which is marked on it, to cut out a pair of trowsers, but it would not do.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know any thing of Riley? A. No. I saw the property found on the top of the tester.</p>

I took him this, and he gave me 1 s. 6 d. for it.</p>
               <p>Six witnesses gave Riley an excellent character.</p>

I apprehended the prisoners on Monday, the 21st of February, about ten minutes before twelve o'clock at night, at Arlington corner, opposite a public-house, about six or seven miles from the Great Park; they were driving the asses before them; I asked whose they were, and Lamb said they belonged to his partner's father - I asked Slaughter if they belonged to his father - he said Yes; I asked what they were going to do with them; he said to take them to Smithfield market to sell; I said</p>
               <p>"What, on Friday, do you mean?" they said Yes; I said</p>
               <p>"What, keep them till Friday?" they said they had a man there who would receive them of them; Lamb said he was a bricklayer's labourer, and Slaughter said he was a farmer's man. I took them to my own station, about three hundred yards from the place; kept the asses till the next morning, when they were claimed by Phillips, as Lord Harcourt's property - I saw the marks on their hoofs, and have no doubt they were made with this branding iron.</p>

On Thursday, the 17th of February, about eight o'clock in the morning, I was in Hereford-place, New-road - I saw Morris, whom I had known before, and Canham a short distance behind him, with a porter's knot and something in a sack - I stopped Canham, and said,</p>
               <p>"What have you got here?" he said, it did not signify to me - I said, I am an officer and demand to see what it was; I then endeavoured to pull it down, but he turned himself round; Morris came up and caught hold of the sack with one hand, and with the other tried to push him away from me - I got the sack down, and found it contained the lead - this was about a quarter of mile from the Manor-house at Paddington - I put the lead on Canham's head again, and said, I should take charge of him - Morris said, he should go home - I said I should take charge of him likewise, and as we were going along, Morris said,</p>
               <p>"You are giving yourself unnecessary trouble - this is my property, and I can prove it;" we took the lead to my apartments, and in our way down to the office, Morris said,</p>
               <p>"I have been as much as four or five months collecting this lead, buying it by 1 lb., or 1 1/2 lb. at a time;" I weighed the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070068"/>the lead, and there is about 116 lbs., in a number of different pieces - I did not find where Morris lived.</p>

               <p>Prisoner CANHAM. Q. When you met me, you passed me, and then turned back - I told you it was Morris's property? A. I had not passed him - he did not tell me it was Morris's property, but Morris said so.</p>

On Tuesday, the 16th of February, the prisoners were employed on that house, taking the lead off - I saw them there about half-past six in the morning of the 16th, stripping the lead off - I saw a great many pieces of lead lying on the ground, and these two pieces on the roof on Wednesday morning - I have no doubt in the least that these are the same.</p>

            . I am a plumber; I have compared these two pieces of lead together, and have no doubt whatever, but that they formed one piece; the marks of the water course, and the weight of the lead, together with the cutting, leave no doubt on my mind that it is so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner MORRIS. Q. Suppose another building to be covered with lead, and a piece of that lead to be brought here, could you tell the difference? A. No.</p>
               <p>JOHN WILLMOT. I am a plumber. I have no doubt these two pieces of lead were once one piece; and as to the rest of the pieces here, I think there is no doubt that all belonged to one sheet originally.</p>

               <p>CANHAM'S Defence. I had been at work at the Manor-house, I went to my mate's house to breakfast, and he asked me if I would assist him in carrying this lead to sell, as he wanted to buy a pair of shoes and some other things; he said he would give me part of a pot of beer for carrying it; the watchman stated that I was at work on Tuesday morning; I was working in Black-lion-lane at that time for Mr. Stubbing, the surveyor; they sent a man to fetch us to work at the Manor-house. I have sent to Mr. Stubbings to beg him to come forward and prove that fact, but he said he dare not on account of the parish. I wish to ask Richardson, whether he saw me at work on Wednesday, and whether he remembers what I said to him on Thursday morning, when I came down from the top of the house, and whether I had any lead about me.</p>
               <p>RICHARDSON. Not that I saw, he had no bundle; but I did not rub him down; I had no suspicion of him. I had to watch the building from six o'clock in the morning till twelve.</p>

The prosecutor came to me on Easter Tuesday, and asked if I knew the prisoner - I said, I did; the next day I saw him walking up St. Martin's-lane; and watched him into a pawnbroker's shop - I then went and spoke to the pawnbroker to detain him, while I got an officer. I had him taken up with the coat on his back; he had 7 s. 9 d. in his pocket.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on Tuesday, the 22d of March, about seven o'clock in the evening, with a bundle under his coat; I asked how he came by it - he said he brought it from his sister's, who lived in Holywell-lane, who was lying in, and he was going to take it to his mother, who lived in Rosemary-lane, to iron - I took him into a shop; he ran away, but I got him again - he then said his mother lived in Spitalfields.</p>

I had seen them about five o'clock in the afternoon of Friday, the 4th of March; on the morning of Saturday, the 6th, I missed seventeen or twenty - I then went up to the prisoner's house, who is a tenant of mine, but had not been employed in the garden; I found a bundle near his house, which is about a quarter of a mile from where I live - I opened it, and found nearly twenty trees covered with a mat. I have no doubt but they were mine; they were worth 1 s. a tree; I intended to have them planted the next day in some other part of my garden. He was not at home when I found the trees; I saw him in about an hour, but had no conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What kind of trees were they? A. Different sorts of pippins and russetins, and others; they were cut in a particular way, and had been lately grafted; the prisoner is a gardener - it is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070070"/>usual for gardeners to put a mat over their trees to preserve them.</p>

            . I am a constable. Mr. Poynton came to me to apprehend the prisoner: I found him at Hammersmith about ten o'clock; he said the trees he had were his own property; the trees have not been found; I found nothing but some gooseberry and apple stocks, and plum stocks; his garden was open, and there were some other trees laid in by the heels; Mr. Poynton examined them, and said they were not his.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had, I suppose, a cart-load of trees of different descriptions laid in by the heels on that day. I have lived with this gentleman many years, and paid him about 180 l., and about three months ago he brought in a broker, and took my goods; this charge was brought out of spite against me - he came and took one dozen gooseberry trees, and said they were his property.</p>

About four o'clock in the afternoon of the 16th of March, I went to Best's house; I found a bag with these things in it - the prisoner had the razors and coat in his pocket - I took them to the office - he said, if there were any things belonging to his shipmate in his bag, it was unknown to him - but if they were his, to give them to him, and have no more bother about it - there were a couple of shirts in the bag, which he stated to be his own.</p>

            . On the afternoon of the 30th of March I was in Exeter-street, going to see the last witness - the three prisoners were standing with their backs to the English Opera-house; Mortlock, whom I knew, crossed over, and asked if I would do him the favour to go to a pawnbroker's to own a watch which Joseph had been to pawn for 15 s. - it was a silver watch, with a seal, two keys, and a black ribbon; I said I did not like to do it; I then went on to Bennison's, and told her what they had said; I went to pawn a gown at Mr. Turner's - as I went down the court the prisoners asked me if I would own it then, and said they would watch me to see if I did; when I got to Mr. Turner's door Joseph again asked if I would own the watch - I said I would see about it; when I went in I saw him looking through the window; I told what he had said, and soon after Pitt came by, and I said that was another of them.</p>

I had put this crape on the counter just as he came in - and as I reached the Irish, I saw him take the crape, and put it into his pocket, which was a large pocket, as long as his coat. I said,</p>
               <p>"You villain, you have taken that piece of crape." I collared and took him to the door, calling for assistance; he hit me on the side. I was obliged to let him go; he ran out, and I after him; a boy stopped him.

I looked at some handkerchiefs, which were too small. I asked to see some Irish. I took the crape up in my hand - she turned round, and said,</p>
               <p>"You thieving villain, how dare you be guilty of that." I said, I would put it down; she pulled me into the parlour, and sang out as loud as she could; I ran out of the shop - but I had stolen nothing.</p>

            . I am agent to Mr. Richard Bury, and carry on business, on his account, in King-street, Cheapside. I had several transactions with the prisoner, as one of the firm of Bakewell and Co.: it was agreed that he should give me the acceptances of respectable parties. On the 30th of November I received a bill for 40 l. inclosed in a note which I believe to be the prisoner's writing.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You were satisfied with Rawlings' acceptance, having had it before? A. I never had Rawlings' acceptance - it was Oakley's, payable at Rawlings'.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Had you more orders from him after you received the bill; but before it became due? A. Yes; perhaps to the amount of 100 l.; there was a running account; the bill was not given for any particular goods - Rawlings has acknowledged it to be his acceptance.</p>
               <p>A letter was here read from the prisoner, dated the 22d of November, containing an order for goods, and promising to forward a bill, drawn by the shipper, on Rawlings.</p>

            . I let the prisoner a house in the Commercial-road. A person named Wilson came to pay the rent about the 29th of October; he presented me with an account of some goods I had bought, which he deducted from the rent, and gave me a receipt, which I produce - I saw him write it on my table. I do not believe the endorsement on this bill to be the writing of that R. Wilson.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You never saw him write but once? A. No, I cannot say whether he wrote better at one time than another, but I should think the character of the writing would be the same.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Does the endorsement appear to be the same character of hand-writing? A. It does not; my account was only 1 l. 16 s.; he only wrote</p>
               <p>"Received cash, Robert Wilson."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How often has this bill been shewn to you to compare with the receipt? A. Only once; it struck me immediately that it was not his writing; but I compared it, as I had the receipt in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose you had not seen the receipt after he gave it to you, do you think you could have such a recollection of his writing as to say it was not his writing? A. I do know that I could; the bill is so different from the receipt that it struck me immediately that it was not his.</p>

            . I am landlord of a house at Brentford. A man named R. Wilson was a tenant of mine: I do not know whether he was connected with the prisoner; I once saw him write a receipt, about a month ago; I do not believe the handwriting of the drawer and endorser of this bill to be his.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You saw him once, after this bill was due, write a hand which you think not like that on the bill? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner entered into the same line of defence as on the former trial; and declared, that Wilson was the drawer and acceptor of the bill; and had paid it to him in the regular course of trade.</p>

            . In November last the prisoner gave me a bill for 40 l., to take to Wilson to sign and endorse. I believe the bill produced to be the same; I gave the bill to Thomas Oakley, on the 30th of November, at one o'clock, at the White Hart tavern, Tower-street, for that purpose. I called there in the evening, and he gave it to me, signed and endorsed</p>
               <p>"R. Wilson;" I took it home, and next morning, when I sent some bread to Bakewell and Co., I sent the bill by my son to give to Thompson. I knew Wilson about two years ago; he then lived in Rood-land, as a boot and shoe-maker; I have frequently seen him in Thompson's company, at the White Hart, since this bill was drawn, talking upon business.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Do you know whether Wilson lived at Brentford? A. He was represented to me as having an establishment there in the boot and shoe line.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When were you at Brentford? A. Not lately; I have been in the habit of seeing him in town; the last time I saw him, was on the 4th or 5th of February; I have continued to go to places where I used to see him, but have not seen him since. He has made me out bills for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070077"/>work done, (looking at the bill). I believe this endorsement and signature to be his writing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How often have you seen him write? A. It might be seven or eight times - I am a baker, and live in North-street, Bethnall-green. I do not know where Wilson is now; he wrote very much like a school-boy.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe this to be his writing, (handing a paper)? A. I cannot be positive - it resembles it - I should think it was his.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, will you venture to swear, that you believe the endorsement on the bill to be his writing? A. I do believe it is - I believe both to be written by the same person; I saw him write last about January, at Union-court, Broad-street: I had no connexion with the firm.</p>

On Thursday, the 10th of March, about a quarter to two o'clock, I went up stairs to dinner; I left nobody in the counting-house; the street-door is usually barred inside. I went out afterwards on business; we enter by the private door. Mr. King, another clerk, was at dinner with me - I returned to the counting-house in about half an hour, found my desk broken open, and missed a tin cash-box which was locked. I found the box in the cellar about eight o'clock that evening; the lid of it was broken, but the lock, which was a very good one, was not broken; bills amounting to about 200 l., and about 1 l. 1 s. 6 d. in money, were left in it. I missed 18 l. 9 s. 8 d. in gold, silver, and copper; I believe there was seventeen sovereigns, sixteen shillings, four half-crowns, six sixpences, and 8 d. in copper. - It was Mr. Young's money. I went to the Mansion House; and went again on the 11th, and went with Martin to the prisoner's lodging, about three o'clock in the afternoon; he had not been to the counting-house after the robbery was discovered; he lodged in George-yard, at the end of Fenchurch-street. I went to the door with Martin, who asked at the door for Mr. Williams; I heard the prisoner's voice answering.</p>
               <p>"I don't know him." I stepped forward, and said,</p>
               <p>"That is the man." I observed a pistol in his right hand; he held it down by his side: I cried out,</p>
               <p>"He has got a pistol;" the officer then seized him. He did not attempt to fire - I cannot say whether it was loaded - he had a dark great-coat on, which was not usual.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went with Mr. Lowe to this house, and inquired of the prisoner for Henry Williams; I did not know him, as he was dressed different to what he had been described. He said he did not know him: Mr. Lowe then called out,</p>
               <p>"Oh, my God, he has got a pistol." I then seized him, pinioned his arms, and he dropped the pistol on the bed which was in the room; I examined it - it was loaded with three small balls, but a very small quantity of powder, not sufficient to discharge it. I have the cash-box, which was found in the cellar; the lock being very good, it could not be forced; the lid has been wrenched up, and the cash shook out; but the inner box could not be got out, so that the bills, which were under it, did not come out. While he was on the bed, he begged for mercy; I neither threatened or promised him: he said he had robbed his master, that he was very sorry for it, and, if I would suffer him to get up, I might do as I pleased with him; he appeared very penitent at that time. I let him get up, and was in the act of searching him, when he stooped down, and, while he was stooping, I heard him cock a second pistol; I again seized him, threw him on the bed, and wrenched it from his hand; that was loaded with powder and wadding, but no ball, I searched him, and found three sovereigns, seven shillings, eight sixpences, and 7 d. in copper on him.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 27th of February; at twenty minutes past seven o'clock, I was in Smithfield, and found the hoard door open - I went in, went up stairs, and found the foreman's room-door broken open, and the workmen's tools shifted from one basket to the other. I came away, put something against the door, went there again before one o'clock, and saw the prisoner, Davis, on the stairs, with a basket of tools; he appeared to be receiving it from a person above; he dropped it on seeing me, and turned as if going away - I secured him; my shopmate who was with me, said somebody else was up stairs. I afterwards stopped Crookshanks in the George-yard, under the gate-way; he seemed greatly agitated, very pale, and sick. Goddard said, in his presence, that he saw him lift the sash up, and drop down - the height is fourteen or fifteen feet.</p>

               <p>Q. You went to the play together? A. Yes, I paid for him, as he had no money - we supped when we came home - I cannot say what we drank; he always took a bottle of wine after dinner and after supper - I did not lend him the handkerchief and glass - I did not go to the play in my widow's dress.</p>

            . I keep the Pitt's-head, public-house, Old-street. On Sunday morning, the 20th of March, about six o'clock, the prisoner came to my house and requested I would make him a pint of ale purl; he said it was very unfortunate for him, during the time he had been in London, he had not been able to get purl early in the morning - but at home, his servant always brought him up a pint in bed; he drank it, and ordered another half-pint; he shuffled about in his pockets, and said,</p>
               <p>"God bless me, it is very unfortunate, I have come out without money," and at the same time dropping this handkerchief over the bar, said,</p>
               <p>"Have the goodness to take care of this, while I go to St. Bartholomew-close, where I live, and fetch the money;" he did not return.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to ANN HOWELL. Q. He was apprehended at your house - did he not come voluntarily to visit you? A. He came in to dress himself; I had two officers ready to take him - I went with him to several houses, to get 5 l. which he owed me; I had not then found the handkerchief.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 23d of March I took the prisoner at Howell's house, and found a duplicate of the eye-glass on him, pawned at M'Dowell's, in Surry-road; I told him to be here, but he is not - he was not bound over.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many different houses did they call at? A. She said he owed her 5 l., and called at three houses for him to borrow it, at his own request - if he had got it, there it would have been an end of it for what I know.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did she mention a glass and handkerchief? A. She said she had missed them.</p>
               <p>(Handkerchief produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>ANN HOWELL. It was never under the bed - I kept it on the side-board in the parlour. I lost the handkerchief before we went to the Theatre.</p>

On the 7th of March, about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner in company with two others in Goswell-street, lurking about Miss Doudney's door. I watched them for half an hour, at last the prisoner went in and took out a black waistcoat; he ran towards me, and I caught him in my arms: he threw the waistcoat away, and it was lost while we were scuffling.</p>

I desired her to go up stairs, and open her box; she took the key, opened it, and I found the articles stated in the indictment in it, and a purse containing 1 l. 2 s. 6 d. As I came to each article she said she had purchased them out of the shop, and put the money into the till. It is customary, when shopwomen want things, to have them put down to them - she had a bottle put down against her wages: when I came to the gold ring, she said a friend of her mother's gave it to her.</p>

            . I am a looking-glass manufacturer, and deal in paintings and stained glass, and live in Chapel-court, Long-acre; the prisoner brought me some stained glass, called pot-metal, about three weeks or a month before Christmas; he asked if I wanted to buy any, as he knew a person who was taken ill, in the looking glass way, who had some to dispose of, as he was obliged to go into the country, and his wife wished to sell it to go down to him. I bought 15 or 16 lbs.; he came to me again several times with a woman, saying she was the man's wife. I dealt with him five or six times for the same sort of metal; I bought about 150 lbs. within about two months - some of it is here now. Mr. Hedgland and Mr. Bailey afterwards made inquiry about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know the prisoner's brother? A. Yes; but he never brought me any glass, except on his master's account, a Mr. Headley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know his brother was employed by Mrs. Muss? A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a particular sort of glass? A. No, it is made by every manufacturer.</p>

            . I am an officer of Clerkenwell. I was in Great Queen-street, with Colton, on the 22d of March. We saw the prisoner and two others following the cart; I saw the box behind the cart, but could not tell whether it was tied then or not; I saw the prisoner cross against the back of the cart and draw something across it - I could not distinguish what; one of them then crossed the cart, and lifted up the box to see if it was loose, but did not take it away; the cart turned down Mercer-street, and then my partner and I were close behind it, and saw that the rope had been cut - it was hanging down; the cart went on to Castle-street, where the carman stopped at an ironmonger's shop; the three persons gave a whistle and all came to the left side of the cart farthest from the shop. We passed the prisoner and his companions; we went round St. Andrew's-street and then returned; we met the prisoner and another carrying the box, the third person was walking on the other side; we followed them a little distance in hopes of getting some assistance: when we got to the Seven Dials we went over and asked what they had got; I laid hold of the prisoner, and Colton took the other, who was carrying the box; the third one crossed over in my direction, and struck me a violent blow in the mouth: I still kept hold of the prisoner, and he struck me on the right eye, the third person still continuing to strike me: I knocked the prisoner down and fell on him - the third person then got away: I kept hold of the prisoner and would not let him go: another person came up and we got him into a baker's shop: the box was brought over by Colton and the other person: the prisoner was taken to the watch-house; the box was taken to Hatton-garden and opened by the chief officer - it was claimed by the carrier and by the young lady.</p>

I was going to my beat in the Seven Dials, and saw a great mob - I went up and saw Colton, the officer, with his face and his handkerchief covered with blood - the prisoner was then in custody: I took him to the watch-house - he went quietly with me: I saw the trunk in Mr. Gray's (a baker) shop - I saw some blood upon Reynolds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I was going to the Sans Pareil Theatre, and in Great St. Andrew's-street, I saw two men put a box down as if to rest, and in a moment heard a cry of Stop thief! two men ran across and secured one of them; the other stumbled; the officer then turned round and secured me, saying that I was one of them: he struck me on the head, and stunned me. (The prisoner concluded by solemnly appealing to the Almighty declaring his innocence).</p>

On the following day I inquired after him at his usual residence, at a court in Wells-street, but I did not see him again till Friday evening, when he was taken up. I went with Schofield to a sort of clothes shop, No. 38, Wells-street, and saw Aspinall and Riddell; Schofield asked if they had bought any shirts of Gardiner; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070084"/>mentioned the price, 5 s. 3 1/2 d., naming the day on which they were taken by Gardiner: they denied positively having seen either the boy or the articles; they first said they were man and wife and then they denied it: they appeared to be in the shop as persons conducting the business: the officer then commenced his search; they mentioned something about his going into some back premises: the officer first looked round the counter and there he found one of the shirts, and another among the bed clothes: a third shirt was found concealed among some other things - I do not exactly know what they were: the fourth was found partly cut up in a corner of the room - the parts that were found made up the entire shirt when put together - my name was not on them, but I knew them to be mine - I stated so in the prisoners' presence. The man addressed himself to the woman, and insisted upon her giving them up if she had purchased them, which he said he knew nothing about: she denied knowing any thing about them: after the search the two prisoners were taken into custody: there was a third person in the shop, who was not taken - the duplicate of the hat was found in the possession of a waiter at the Jew's Harp tavern.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there not some harness hanging on the outside of the door of the shop? A. Yes, there was.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. Walker applied to me. I apprehended Gardiner, and went with Mr. Walker to the shop, about two o'clock in the afternoon - I found the two prisoners in the shop, and another man - I had found Gardiner at the Jew's Harp, on the Thursday night; I told him he was charged with stealing a hat and five shirts; he denied all knowledge of it: I took him to the watch-house, and as we were going to the office next morning I told him I had found the hat - he then said he had taken it, and asked me if I had found the shirts; I said I had not, but I had traced different places where he had offered them for 12 s. - he then said he had sold them to a man and woman, who kept a shop at No. 38, Wells-street; he described the people, and said he had got but 5 s. 3 1/2 d., which was paid him by the woman, and that they then put him out at the back door of the house. I went to the house with Mr. Walker and his employer - the man was behind the counter, and the woman rather towards the end; there was a young man there, who appeared as if he had called on business - they were all in conversation; I told Aspinall I had got a search-warrant for five shirts, and asked if they had not bought them of a dirty looking boy, on Wednesday, for 5 s. 31 d. - they both positively denied any knowledge of them; there was a little harness inside the shop, and a little out; I understand the man works at that business; I then said I must proceed to search for the property; they said I was very welcome - they said they had some back premises, and wished me to go and search them - I began to search the shop first, and the woman assisted in moving the things. Under the counter I found a calico shirt - they did not at that time give any account of how they came by it, but the man told the woman to give the shirts up - she declared positively that she had got no more. I then let a bedstead down, and under the bed and bedclothes we found two linen shirts; the man still continued wishing her to give up the property, but neither of them gave any account of how they came by it; I searched in a recess in the wall, and among a parcel of rubbish I found another linen shirt; it was in strips, but appeared to be an entire shirt when the pieces were put together - Mr. Walker claimed them; the woman then said she had brought them of the prisoner Gardiner; I do not think she mentioned whether the man was present - I asked if he was present; he said he could not tell as there were so many things brought in; the woman then took it all on herself, and said the man had nothing to do with it; I took them both into custody. There is a back door to the house which leads to Booth-court.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go up stairs at all? A. No, I did not; I do not know whether the woman is a widow or not; at first they said they were man and wife, but afterwards they said they were not, and therefore I took them both, or I should only have taken the man.</p>

            . Mr. Walker is my assistant. Gardiner lived with me - he gave me no notice of his being about to leave. I went with Schofield to No. 38, Wells-street, and found the two prisoners and a man in the shop; the officer asked who owned the shop - the man stepped forward, and said he did. I saw some harness at the door, and some inside, and some phials and old rags - I did not see any wearing apparel. The officer then said he had a warrant to search for five shirts, which had been sold by a boy for 5 s. 3 1/2 d.; they both denied knowing any thing about it: a proposal was made by one of them, but I cannot tell which, to search the back premises, which was declined. The officer searched under the counter, in which Riddell assisted - among some rags he found a shirt, which was claimed by Walker: no objection was made to that, or any account given of how they became possessed of it; the man then told her to give up the other shirts if she had any; she denied knowing of any: the officer continued to search, and among the clothes of an old bed he found two other shirts; some conversation then took place, and they said they were not married. The officer proceeded to search, and near the place where the man appeared to have been at work, among some old bits of leather and other things was found a fourth shirt, which was partly unripped - I saw the parts put together, and they appeared to form a shirt - they were all claimed by Walker; the woman then said she had given 5 s. and a pint of beer for them, and had bought them of the boy.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden; in consequence of directions from the Mint, I employed John Elledge to discover sellers of counterfeit coin. On the 14th of March, I had given him some money to make a purchase; I do not remember what; but I had searched him before he went out, and he had nothing more about him than what I gave him. He brought me, to my own house in the afternoon, forty bad shillings; they were packed in separate papers; I bade him mark them, which he did in my presence, and I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he tell you where he was going? A. No. not particularly; but I had information that there were some at Westminster; I have known him twenty-five years. He had never been in any scrape, or difficulty, to my knowledge - I left him entirely to himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a relation of yours? A. Yes, he is; I gave him all the information I could to direct him in his search, but I had not named any particular person. I had given him money on several occasions - I cannot tell the amount of what I gave him that day.</p>
               <p>JOHN ELLEDGE. I am a shoemaker, and live in Elder-walk. On the 14th of March I went to the sign of the Ship, public-house, in Duck-lane, Westminster; I saw a person there with whom I had made an appointment, but I could not then get any thing from him - the prisoner was present - we were all in one box together; that person and the prisoner conversed together; the prisoner afterwards asked what I wanted; I told him two-score of bobs, (I meant shillings). The prisoner went out, and returned in a very short time; he then came and sat down by my side: he said,</p>
               <p>"Here are the things;" he gave me two paper parcels, and I paid him 15 s. - I paid him one crown, one half-crown, seven shillings, and a sixpence. I received this money in change for a sovereign which I had received from Limbrick. I delivered the papers to Mr. Limbrick, and made a mark upon each of the pieces of money - I had not opened the papers before I delivered them to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How often before have you been out upon such expeditions? A. Several times, but I never was examined before to day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Limbrick ask if you had any other money? A. Yes, and I said No. He did not search me - he has upon other occasions.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mark the money he gave you? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you learn that pretty phrase, two-score of bobs? A. I have learnt it some time, perhaps, some years.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you change the sovereign? A. At the Three Elms, public-house, St. Ann's-street, Orchard-street, Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been before a Magistrate before? A. Yes, in a case of felony, for stealing some cheese. I have been before a Justice on other occasions, but I do not know how many - it may be two or three years ago since I first went; the first time was the case of an assault. On one occasion, a night-constable took up a felon, and I attended as a witness; but I never attended a case in which Limbrick was concerned.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Was the prisoner a stranger to you? Yes, but the man who was with him was not. I had seen him on the Saturday before; I went there by appointment - I had been employed on a similar business on the Saturday preceding; I have seen the landlord of the public-house here to day.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I apprehended the prisoner from the information of the last witness, at the Ship, in Duck-lane, on Saturday, the 26th of March, about a quarter past eleven o'clock at night. I was in company with Pace; the prisoner took us to a house in a court, which we searched, but found nothing; the next morning we searched a stable, of which he gave us the key, but found nothing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where was this court to which he took you? A. I do not know the name of it; his wife was there washing; no one opposed our going in. I had been in search of him before for a day or two; I did not know where he lived before that night.</p>

            . I am a constable, and live in New-street, Lambeth. I know Elizabeth Mary Ann Williams, and Myers the officer; I gave directions to Williams to discover persons making counterfeit coin; on the 22d of December I employed her in that way, and on the 23d she came to me again with Myers, at the Bell, public-house, in Falcon-court; I then gave her twelve shillings - they were good. I searched her pocket, and her bonnet to see if she had any more money about her - she had not. On the day before I had gone with her as far as the end of Petticoat-lane, but did not go farther then, as the officers are pretty well known there. On the 23d I saw her and Myers again, between five and six o'clock in the evening, at my house at Lambeth; she gave me two sovereigns, which I marked before her face, and gave to Myers; he wrapped them up in paper, and wrote something upon it; I put my initials upon it, and the date. I think the sovereigns were in the same paper, but folded so as to prevent their rubbing against each other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. What parish are you constable of? A. Lambeth; I have been an officer eight or nine years. I never was an officer of Union-street; I have been employed as an extra officer there - I was prevented from being a constable for ten or eleven weeks, because I was arrested upon a trespass, and was forced to take the benefit of the act. I never knew Mrs. Williams by the name of Daly - I never heard of that name - I asked her to do this job for me; there was a woman present when I gave her the money, who goes by the name of Smith, and Myers the officer. I spoke to Mrs. Smith while she was there, about the transaction. I think she is between thirty and forty years of age. I believe we had some beer to drink; I called Mrs. Smith, Smith or Mary - and Williams, I called Betsey. I have heard Smith called Dowling, or Downing; I knew her best by the name of Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a man there of the name of Daly, or Delay? A. I do not know him by name - Myers walked with Williams and me part of the way to Petticoat-lane, but with no other man. I do not know such a man as Delay; I heard there was a man of that name at the King of Prussia, public-house, in Petticoat-lane, but I never saw him.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Why do you call the witness Mrs. Williams? A. I have seen her marriage register; her name before she was married was Richards. I was the person who made Smith and Williams acquainted together.</p>

I had seen Goff and Myers at the Bell, in Falcon-court, between three and four o'clock - Goff gave me 12 s. - before he gave me the money, he searched my bonnet and my pockets. I had no other money about me but what he gave; which was twelve separate shillings. I then went to Wentworth-street, met the prisoner, and went with him to his house in Marlborough-court, which leads from Petticoat-lane to Wentworth-street. Liepman Liepman came there - I had seen them both the day before; the prisoner then asked, what I wanted; I said,</p>
               <p>"Two sovereigns;" and he told Liepman Liepman to go and get them, which he did; I paid 12 s. for them; the prisoner delivered them to me; I took them to Mr. Goff's house and gave them to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What was your maiden name? A. Elizabeth Mary Ann Smith Richards.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you bring a charge of bigamy against your husband? A. Yes; but the Magistrate dismissed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you well acquainted with Goff? A. Yes; I know him very well. I had emptied my pocket; I do not think he searched my gloves.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you to have for this? A. I do not know; I have got nothing yet; I expect my expences like another witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not expect and hope to be paid by the gentlemen of the Mint for doing this job? A. I do not know who is to pay me; I have not been promised any thing - I expect they will pay me for my loss of time, either the gentlemen of the Mint or the Court.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you set about all this trouble, did Goff say to you, or you to him, anything about what you was to get? A. No; he said, I should be paid for my time as a witness, that was all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Goff the only person who told you you was to be paid by the Court as a witness? A. Myers told me I should be paid as a witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Myers mention no sum? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think will be a proper payment for what you have done? A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never made up your mind as to what you are to get for it? A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever at the office of the Solicitor of the Mint? A. Yes, I have been there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get any money from Myers on the footing of this transaction? A. Not on this transaction nor on any other. No; I have borrowed a sovereign of Mrs. Myers, which I intend to pay her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that since you were employed in this transaction, or before? A. It is since that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Myers know of it? A. I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to the Bell on the 23d, who were there? A. Mr. Goff and Mr. Myers.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the Bell was it? A. I do not know what they call it; it was a room that many people go into.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you there? A. Perhaps half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any refreshment? A. I had little porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Goff and Mr. Myers take any thing? A. I did not watch them; they did take porter out of the same pot with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went with you on the 23d to Petticoat-lane? A. A woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070087"/>Q. Did Myers and Goff go with you on that day? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go with you on the day before the 22d? A. Yes, and a woman, the name she went by was Smith; I never saw her before that day, and they were the only persons, man or woman, who went with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen her since? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever heard her go by the name of Downing or Dowling? A. No; I have seen Delany; I saw him in Wentworth-street, he was speaking to Mrs. Smith; Goff and Myers were not with me then; I lived at that time at No. 6, Portugal-street, Lambeth; I get my living by my needle, or winding cotton.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. You have known Goff for twelve years; he employed you in this transaction, and he told you you should be paid for your loss of time? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever had any promise from any of the gentlemen of the Mint for what you have done? A. No.</p>
               <p>

            . I am a constable. I saw the last witness on the 22d and 23d of December; Goff gave her 12 s.; I was at Goff's house in the evening when she returned; she put down a paper with two counterfeit sovereigns - I marked them, put them into another piece of paper which I also marked, and gave them to Goff, who put his initials on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who introduced you to Williams? A. I have known her five years. I saw Morris Delany and Williams standing outside the door in Fenchurch-street; there was, I believe, one woman with them; I was at some distance and cannot tell whether they were in conversation: I had no conversation with Williams as to what she was to get for this business. I told her Government would pay her, I had no doubt of it: I never gave her any money myself; my wife told me on one occasion, she had given her some, but I do not know what - that is since this business; she gets her living by needle-work: I never heard Goff say any thing to her about what she was to get for it. I never knew of her going to the Solicitor of the Mint but once, when we all went together; she has been employed in other jobs besides this - I think about four - two of them were the same day - about the 21st of February - that was the last time; the job for which we are now trying the prisoner was the first - I have not received any money myself for this business.</p>

I was counting them and he said I need not count them, they were all right: I then put them into my pocket and Williams took a paper of them likewise.

            . I live at No. 3, Elder-walk, Islington. I know the prisoner. I met him by appointment on the 4th of March. I had seen Limbrick and Lloyd the preceding evening, after I had made the appointment with the prisoner: I received 15 s. from Limbrick, and had no other money about me: the next morning I saw the prisoner at the Pied Horse public-house, in Chiswell-street; he asked me what I wanted; I said two score - meaning what are called bobs - that is counterfeit shillings; he said if I would give him 12 s. he would go and get them: I gave him two half-crowns, four shillings and six sixpences; he told me to wait till he returned: he returned in about twenty minutes, and I asked if he had got them; he said Yes; and we came out of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070088"/>house together, and walked along Chiswell-street; as we went along he said to me</p>
               <p>"Have you got a shilling?" I said</p>
               <p>"All I have got is 3 1/2 d.;" he said he wanted to buy stuff to colour them, as they were too bright to pass; I gave him the 5 1/2 d., and walked with him to the corner of Carthusian-street: he then pulled out one of the counterfeit shillings, and said</p>
               <p>"When you see these again you will see them in a different state:" he then told me to call at the Cross Keys in Belton-street, between one and two o'clock and they should be ready for me; I went to the house about two o'clock, and saw him with some beer before him; I asked him if he had got them; he said Yes, and pulled them from a hat which he had between his legs; he produced two paper parcels which he said contained two score; he said I must give him 2 s. more for colouring them; I gave 1 s. 6 d. and was going to give him the half-penny - he said</p>
               <p>"Never mind the halfpenny;" I then went to see for Limbrick at Hatton-garden office, but I heard he was out of town and I did not see him till Monday, when I gave him the parcel.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner Barton between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, of the 12th of March - the other prisoner was not then with him; I had been introduced to Barton, and had been talking about bad money, and asked if he could get me any - he said his partner was out, and he did not know. He sat some time, and then went out and returned, and said, he could not find his partner, but he was always to be found at the Ship, public-house, in Duck-lane - I went to the Ship, and met him there between nine and ten o'clock - Barton and I went into the Ship, Barton said the money would soon be forthcoming; we drank at the bar and I changed a sovereign - before I got the change, Barton called me out to the door, and said in Ward's presence, that they had been only able to make up ten bobs-worth - he said there is twenty-five bobs and five spuds - I took the coin and gave Ward the money; I then left them, they both ran after me and said, I had given them a tinker, meaning a bad sixpence - I changed it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BARTON.

He then told me he would meet me on the Saturday following, which was the 11th of March - he shewed me a duplicate of four candlesticks, pawned for 3 l., and said he had got the rest of the plate concealed - and said, if I could sell it, he would rather sell it than pledge it; he then said,</p>
               <p>"Have you got any bad money for me yet;" he pulled out two or three shillings, and said,</p>
               <p>"Like these" - I said I should be at the Ship, in the evening; he said he would call again - from that time I never saw him till I was taken into custody - he had another man with him, who cannot be found. Witness. This is not true. I had another man with me, named Smith - he introduced me to Barton, and Barton introduced me to Ward.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I never came in the shop but once; then I knocked with my foot and no one came; I then put my hand on the cloth.</p>
               <p>Witness. Yes, he knocked with his hand, not his foot, but that was the first time, before he had taken the cloth: I did not answer because I suspected that he came to steal.</p>

I employed the officer to watch our premises, and after Pearce was in custody, he sent for me to Giltspur-street, and made a voluntary statement to me; I said I was informed a quantity of iron had been taken away on the 16th; he said he delivered it to the same person as on the 18th, and that an arrangement had been made, by which he (Pearce) was to have half the money; he said he was an honest man till seduced by that person, who had induced him at different times to supply him with our metal, for which he was exceedingly sorry; and that latterly he had not been paid any money for it.</p>

One of my clerks, who was with us at the time, has absented himself, and I have reason to believe has taken our money.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met a man named Bolton in the Curtain-road, rolling this vat - he said he was going to Whitechapel-road, where he had sold it for 25 s.; I said I thought I could get more for it nearer than that; he said what I could get more I should have. I went to Mead, who said he would come and look at it, but Bolton asked me to take it down, as he was not strong enough - I thought it belonged to him, as he said he bought it at Watkins's sale, in Kingsland-road; if I had been guilty I should not have called for the money, as Mead said he should go to Watkins.</p>

I went afterwards with two officers to his house, in Cornwall-road, Surry - I saw a female lodger there; we searched the house, and found on a landing-place over a back kitchen, a window shutter, which I knew to be mine. On the roof of another house we found two or three more shutters; they were all mine, I am quite sure - they were laying on the roof of the house, and some wood covered over them. We found the leaden pipe in the cellar, which was first covered over with some stones, then a flap, and under the flap some ashes; it appeared to me to have been done to conceal the property; there were some lead weights and other things there, which were not mine. The sign board was found in an empty house in Waterloo-road, which I was given to understand belonged to Frost; the officer got the key from Mrs. Frost.

Yes, I met him with four saddles on his shoulder - I showed them to Mr. M'Donald, who owned them as his: Merritt made some resistance, but Turley did not - they both said they had been employed by another man to carry them.</p>

As I was going down Whitecross-street I met the officer - I told him what I was to do with them, and said I was going to my father who worked at Mr. Dixon's.</p>

            . I belong to the Thames Police. On the night of the 29th of March I saw the prisoner in Rosemary-lane with this pair of boots - he had another man with him. I asked where he got them, he said he had made them that afternoon at home - I asked where that was - he said it was of no use telling me, for if I went I should not be satisfied.</p>

The prisoner lived at Mr. Ashdown's; he called at our house on the 11th of January, and brought a bill of 1 l., 7 s., which I took to my mistress in the parlour; she gave me the money which I paid him; I do not know whether I gave him two sovereigns or not, but I am quite sure I gave him one; I took him the pen and ink, and he signed the bill while I stood by; Mr. Ashdown called afterwards, I told him I had paid his servant.</p>

I did not send him to Mr. King's, nor did he bring me any money that day, or since, from Mr. King; I did not see him again till the 25th, when I charged an officer with him.

I know the prisoner, and had frequently paid him money - it was not usual for him to produce an order. On the 4th of March there was a balance of 19 l. 18 s. 5 d. due to Mr. Holden for pigs delivered between five and six o'clock that morning - it was customary to settle the same day, and the prisoner came about half-past ten o'clock that morning, which was rather earlier than usual - he said he called for Mr. Holden's bill for articles sent by Fielden and Sadler. I thought it was all right, and I paid him nineteen sovereigns, seven half-crowns, and one shilling, and he gave me 1 d. In about a hour and a half Mr. Holden came for the bill; I told him I had paid his man; he said he had not told him to come, but perhaps he had taken it home - I saw the prisoner about a fortnight afterwards at Guildhall.</p>

When I read the order I told the prisoner it was not Mr. Barnes's writing; he said Mr. Barnes was out, and Mrs. Barnes wrote it - I believed that, and gave him the goods he applied for. Mr. Barnes came to our house on the 2d of April, and I asked him how he approved of the articles; I then found I had been imposed upon. About half-past five o'clock the same evening the prisoner brought another order for two more of the same kind, as from Mr. Barnes; we sent for an officer, and gave charge of him. I knew he had formerly worked for Mr. Barnes, and supposed all was right.</p>

On the 25th of March, I went to bed about eleven o'clock at night, and next morning I found three of the squares in the area window had been broken; a man could have put his arm in and unbolted the window; the prisoner had been in my employ for three years as an errand boy - but I had discharged him on the Saturday before.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PUGH. I am servant to Mr. Price; it is the warehouse window which was broken; it was safe after dusk; I was up stairs and heard the window broken; I came down and called the watch; I took two watchmen inside, and left one outside; we found the prisoner in the area, in a state of concealment; he must have lifted up a heavy grating to have got down; there were three squares broken quite out, and some more cracked; he could then have undone the fastenings.</p>

            . I was the constable of the night. The prisoner was brought to me; I found a piece of liver, and a phosphorous box on him; and in the area, we found a small iron crow, which they call a jemmy, and a knife.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence; stating that he had met two men, who made him intoxicated, and then gave him a crow-bar, and lifted up the area grating and persuaded him to go down, which he refused, but they forced him down, and in the scuffle the glass was broken.</p>
