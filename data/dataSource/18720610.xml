I am an overseer of letter-carriers at the Holloway sorting-office—the prisoner has been employed in that office as a letter-carrier since the middle of February—his district of delivery was a portion of Barnsbury and the neighbourhood round there—each of the letter-car<lb/>riers have a cupboard in the kitchen if they require one—the prisoner had one which he kept locked—I have a duplicate key—on the 8th May, I went to his cupboard and found upwards of 300 letters and packets—they were all addressed to persons residing in the prisoner's walk, and bore post marks from 10th March till 4th May—it was the prisoner's duty to deliver those letters at their owners on the dates with which they were stamped—the first six in this packet are dated 19th March, 4th April, 12th April, 23rd March, and 16th April—it was his duty to deliver them to the persons to whom they were addressed on those days—he must have known that was his duty—he has a copy of the rules, and there it is stated—the postmaster, Mr. Wilson, and Mr. Gardner, spoke to the prisoner in my presence on 8th May—he was asked how he came to detain those letters—he said he had kept them in his bag several days, and was then afraid to return them to the office—these are some of the letters—I delivered some to the persons to whom they were addressed—there was no difficulty in finding them out—I have got some few of the covers back—none of the letters had been opened—there was no appearance of their being letters of value.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 5a, Pye Street, Westminster—it is a lodging-house—on 4th June, a short time before 5 o'clock, I was sitting at a table in the kitchen, taking my tea, at the end towards the door, and the two prisoners came in together—there were several persons in the kitchen—they both came up to where I was sitting, one alongside me and the other opposite—Brown asked me for some tea—I said "I have got no tea to give you; I shall be obliged to you if you will keep your distance; you have no command of me, nor I of you"—a man sitting above me reached Jones a saucer of tea, which she drank, and flung the saucer at me—it broke on the back of my neck—they then called me names which I could not express; they called me out of character, all the bad names they could think of—I stood up, and put my hand like this, and said to Brown "Go away," and then Jones called me names, and Brown picked a knife up from the table, which I had been using, and stabbed me in the back of the <hi rend="italic">poll,</hi> and then followed me up, and stubbed me a little below the ball of the left eye, near my nose—my other eye has been totally dark for a year—while Brown stabbed me, Jones caught hold of my hair, and pulled me—I said "I am stabbed; I must go to the hospital"—the blood was running out of my eye, in a stream, on my clothes and on the floor, and all the way from there to the hospital, where the surgeon bandaged my head and strapped up my eye—the blood continued after that till I went to Rochester Row before the Police Magistrate—I saw the prisoners together the same evening in Tothill Street, and gave them in custody, but the constable could only take one—Jones got away, but she came to the Court afterwards, and was detained.</p>

I lodge in this house—on 4th June I was in the kitchen, a little before 5 o'clock, and saw the prisoners come in—one stood on one side of Cogan and the other at the other side of the table—they asked him for tea—he said "I have no tea, only what will do for myself; you have nothing to do with me; go away, and leave me alone; I am an old man"—a blind man who was sitting next him, said "I will give you a saucer of tea if you will go away and sit yourself down"—he gave a saucer of tea to Jones, who drank of it, and said "Here, sister, you have the remainder"—after that they called the old gentleman names not fit to be mentioned in Court—he put his hand out, and said "Now, go away from me"—Jones picked the saucer up after she had put it down, and sent it at him, and it was broken, but where it hit him I could not say—Brown then picked something up, and Jones was holding him by the hair and blood was flowing from the back of his neck—I pulled Jones away, and saw Brown stab him with a knife in the corner of the eye—I made a grab at her, and took the knife out of her hand—he said "Oh, dear! I am blind; I must go to the hospital," and blood flowed down his face on to the floor—I could not tell what sort of a face he had, for blood—this is the knife—he said "<hi rend="italic">Entertain</hi> them; I must go to the hospital." and another one from the house went with him—Brown said "There, sister, see what execution I have done"—I allowed them to go, and as soon as they got to the door, away they ran, as if they were shot; they did not stop to walk—I afterwards went with Cogan to the Broadway, and gave them in charge, but the police-man could only take one—the other one came to the Police Court, and was given into custody—they were both sober; they could run as well as I could.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Southampton—on 10th August, 1861, I was present at the Registrar's Office, when the prisoner, Mr. Cavendish, was married to Alethea Thomas, who I saw in Paris on 16th May last—I am certain she is the same woman who was married to the prisoner—I signed the register.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was living in the neighbourhood, and was fetched out of my house into the Registrar's Office—I saw the man and woman for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—we were waiting for a few minutes—this was eleven years ago—I held no conversation with the lady or gentleman—I do not think the lady I saw in Paris on 16th May, 1872, was pitted with small pox, I cannot pledge my oath that she was not—I did not see her more than five minutes—Mr. Carrick, the solicitor, took me over there—I had no interview with Sergeant Ham before I went to Paris; I did not see him—I did not bring the lady away—there was a change in her, certainly, but I had seen her five years ago—if I had met her in the street, I might very likely have passed her as a stranger, but I quite recognised her as the same person—I had a gentleman with me.</p>

I am the wife of Mr. Bell, of Southampton—I was present at the marriage of Henry Cavendish with Alethea Thomas at the Registry Office—I have compared this document with the original register at Southampton—it is correct—the prisoner is the man who was married that day in the name of Henry Cavendish—I saw the lady at Southampton about five years ago, and on 16th May at Paris—she was the same person who was married in 1861.

               <p>manner and gestures were that of an angry and passionate person—I have not been present when she has addressed the prisoner in an angry and passionate manner—it always appeared as if they were angry words, French people always do speak so in talking—the pre<lb/>vious cook left because she did not understand French cooking—she did not complain of Madame's temper—the prisoner has complained of it to me, and I have complained to the prisoner that Madame was of very bad temper—I did not complain without supposing that I had a cause—Madame was sometimes ill-tempered to me, very seldom—it was without a cause—men occasionally came to work at the house—I think Madame was once out of temper with a workman; I think that was on the Thursday previous to this occurrence, or about that time; she seemed very angry on that occasion—I only knew the man by sight, he was a painter, working for a Mr. Bernard—I do not know where Bernard's place of business is—I have seen the man since, he came to work on the Monday morning that Madame was found dead, he was going to paint the front of the house; I have seen him since this, I think he has called once since—I do not know where he is to be found, or anything about him—I don't understand French at all, whatever words passed between Madame and the prisoner I did not know what they were—the prisoner speaks very little English, only a few words—we com<lb/>municated more by motions, by signs—I can't say whether on more than one occasion Madame and the prisoner had high words, I could not tell what was said—it appeared to me that Madame and the prisoner on more than one occasion had high words together; Madame was rather of a sus<lb/>picious disposition; she suspected things that never occurred, and blamed persons unjustly in consequence, myself amongst others—when she was excited she was in the habit of gesticulating a good deal, she would throw her head up, and throw out her hands—I have observed that that was a habit of hers—she was rather short—I never noticed that when so excited, and throwing her head back, the muscles of the throat were very plainly discernible, and the working of them—on the Sunday morning I had been with the prisoner for some time in the kitchen, before I went up to Madame—I should think I had been with her twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour before Madame rang her bell; we breakfasted together—there was very little conversation between us—I did not notice anything remarkable in her manner or demeanour—Madame was not in the habit of going out very fre<lb/>quently in the morning—she would go out sometimes—I did not know that she was going out that morning, before she said she was going to the Green Park, and so far as I knew, the prisoner could not know it—I often fetched the beer on the week days as well as on the Sunday, not always at the same time, sometimes earlier and sometimes later, according to the exigencies of the house—the lady visitor came about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—about 6.30 in the evening I was in the dining-room with the prisoner—the lady was in the house at that time, she was sitting in Madame's bedroom, up stairs—I did not see the prisoner writing a letter in the course of that afternoon or evening, nor during any part of that day; I never saw her writing—the post-office is just at the corner, not very far off—the prisoner was out until nearly 12 o'clock on the Saturday night—there used to be a cord in the kitchen, over the hot-plate—I very seldom went into the prisoner's bedroom—I never saw any cord in her room—I don't remember whether she was out on the Friday night at all, she might have gone out, she could not have been out for half an hour without my knowing it—I</p>

Kiel's, who was with her—in conse<lb/>quence of what was said to me I went into a room at the end of the passage leading from the front door, and saw the dead body of a woman, dressed—her face was on the floor, her knees on the ground, and her legs sticking upwards so that you could see the soles of her boots—her head was against an iron safe fixed to the wall in one corner of the room, in the right-hand corner as you went in—I did not measure the room, but it was about 12 ft. by 6 ft., I believe—the feet were towards the door, as you went in—I removed the body about 18 in., as near as I can say, from the safe out towards the middle of the room—a rope was once round the neck, with a slip noose under the left cheek, the end round the neck was not loose, but there was about 6 ft. to spare, and the other part was hanging loose over the body, and the other end was twisted twice round the handle of the door of the safe, which was I suppose about a foot from the floor—the rope was tight round the neck, and was just put slack round the handle of the door, it would slip round—it was loose round the handle—I was there when Dr. Wadham came—I was sent to the station for the Inspector, and Sergeant Butcher came—we then, by Dr. Wadham's direction, removed the body into the back parlour—I had lifted the face off the ground before that to recog<lb/>nise who it was, and found it was the lady of the house.</p>

               <p>third finger of the left hand were a wedding ring, and a ring with a stone," that is evidently a mistake—my evidence was read over to me before I signed it, and I explained that there was only one ring—there was only a gold ring with one stone, no wedding ring—I do not think I signed that statement; if I did, it was an oversight at the time, an error, but I don't think I said it—I have a distinct recollection of explaining that there was only one ring—I have not got the diamond ring, it was left there—it is not cus<lb/>tomary to take possession of anything found on a body, unless it shows marks of violence—I left it on the finger—Dr. Wadham was in the room, and Peek, and Inspector Hambling, and Madlle. Riel—I did not see the body again till the day of the inquest—I do not know whether the ring was on then; she was then in the coffin, I have never seen the ring since—I saw the jewel box, I did not take an inventory of its contents—the minute it was discovered I went away to make enquiries out of the house, and left Hambling and another sergeant in charge of the case—I do not think it is the practice of the police in such cases to take a note of what is found, but only of property which is missing, things which are right in the house we should leave there—no inventory was taken of the jewel-case, to my knowledge—I can form no idea of the value of the jewellery—there was no sign of a struggle in the pantry—every thing was in perfect order, as far as I could judge.</p>

On Monday morning, 8th April, about 9 o'clock, I went to 13, Park Lane—the body of Madame Riel had then been removed into the back parlour—I proceeded to make a search, and on a shelf in the pantry, near the safe, found some false hair and a bonnet—I examined the hair and found in it some cinders and small chips of wood, and a small fish bone—there was a fire-place in the pantry, but the fire had not been lighted—some small pieces of charred paper were in the grate, paper which had been burnt and thrown into the fire-place—I found a hair-pin on the mat in the coal cellar, and another on the stairs leading to the kitchen—when I got into the kitchen, I saw the kitchen door which leads to the coal-cellar, it was locked, and there was no key there; it locks from the inside, you cannot lock it from the outside—I unscrewed the lock, removed it, and opened the door; it leads into the area or the cellar—when I got into the cellar, I found a hair-pin on the mat—I was present when a lady's comb was picked up by Inspector Pay—the mat is just at the entrance of the coal-cellar—there is a dust<lb/>hole there and cinders and chips—it is the ordinary dust-hole of the house—the chips were small pieces of wood, such as arise from wood, they were not burnt—I afterwards on that day received from the witness Watts, this 1 pair of gloves (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and I found in the kitchen this dress hang<lb/>ing up—I examined it at the time; it was not torn, it was in good repair, but I found on the left-hand sleeve a spot which I believe to be blood—it was just inside the cuff, other spots have been cut out by Dr. Letheby but I observed them—I examined the safe, and saw a railway bond found</p>

               <p>there—I searched to see if I could find any keys, but found none at that time—I was examined as a witness at the Police Court—after the first day's examination, Inspector Druscovitch made a communication to me in consequence of which I went to the pantry where the body was found, and behind a beer-barrel, on a shelf, I found eight keys on one ring and two on another—I find that one of them fits the iron safe, and two are latch-keys of the street door—I also on that occasion tried four keys in the presence of Inspector Pay, which were produced by the French police, and found that one was the key of the pantry, in which the body was found, and the other, the key of the kitchen leading from the coal<lb/>cellar, the door from which I removed the lock; another was the key of a sort of press up stairs, where Madlle. Riel kept her dresses, and which I found locked, and the fourth key fits the padlock on the prisoner's box—on the Monday morning I went to the prisoner's box, in her room on the third floor; it is an ordinary servant's box—I forced it open, and found several pieces of her dresses and boots and paper, and a book with her name in it—there was no rope in her box, or in her room—I saw no appearance of any struggle in the kitchen or pantry—the prisoner's box was not packed at all, her things were lying in different parts of the room, such as under linen, and dresses were hanging on the door.</p>

I first saw the green dress on the morning of 12th April, it was then in the hands of Madame Bouillion, who was going to give it to me; the prisoner was not there then—I had been to Madame Bouillion's twenty or thirty times before I arrested her—I knew that she had a green dress in her possession before she showed it to me—I did not know it from her, she had not told me—I had had a tele<lb/>graphic description of the prisoner, and also of the dress she wore, and it</p>

               <p>was impossible to mistake it—I had seen Madame Bouillion twenty times before she handed me the dress; every time I saw her it was on this affair; when she handed me the dress, it had in the pocket the porte-monnaie and the pawn ticket, and also a pocket-handkerchief not belonging to Marguerite Dixblanc—it was Madame Bouillion's, she told me so herself, and it was given to her as her property—the ring was in the first compartment of the porte-monnaie in the first fold (<hi rend="italic">replacing it there</hi>)—I discovered that the notes were not 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes at the Judge of Instruction's, Monsieur Massey, that was I think on the Saturday, the day after—I had marked the notes imme<lb/>diately after taking them, but did not discover it then—I last saw Madame Bouillion on the Monday following 11th April—that is since she was discharged, it was when there was a question about Monsieur Bouillion coming to London—that was last Saturday—when you asked me the question before, I said that I had seen her some early day in April—I thought you meant while in durance vile, not when she had her liberty—when I saw her last Saturday she was at Passage Maurice, at her own house, or it may be her sister's—I do not know whether it was on the first or second floor—I am in the habit of seeing houses of six or seven stories high, and I do not count—she was sitting up, and dressed as women usually are—I saw nothing about her which looked as if she could not go out for a walk—her husband was present, I cannot say whether he lives there—that was not the house where I had gone to see her before—I brought the prisoner over to England; we talked about different subjects on the voyage, and occasionally the con<lb/>versation turned upon Madame Riel, and she told me how the matter happened, and complained of Madame Kiel's conduct towards her—(<hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>

I live at 18, Rue de Porte St. Denis—I am a coal dealer—I only know the prisoner since 13th April—I had seen her once last year, about June or July—I had not seen her again until I saw her on 13th April—I then saw her at our own door—she had arrived there whilst I was serving customers with coal—it was about 10.30 in the morn<lb/>ing—I did not recognise her at first—after I had served two customers in the shop, I called to her and said "And you, Madame, what is your pleasure?—she answered me in patois, "So you don't recognise me; so you don't know me"—I recognised her then by her talk and the voice—I asked her how she was and what she came for to St. Denis—she said "Pretty well, and you?"—I said our house matters did not go very well as my wife was ill—she asked whether it was a long time since I had seen her father—she told me afterwards she had been looking for him, but she said first "Have you seen my father?—I told her I had seen her father between Christmas and New Year, that I knew he was looking after her and would like to see her—I asked her afterwards about Victoire Bouillion, but before that she told me she had been looking all over Paris for her father and could not find him—I asked her whether it was a long time since she saw Victoire—she said that she had seen her on the Monday and had taken some money to her that she owed her—by Victoire I meant Madame Bouillion—she said she had seen Victoire Bouillion on Monday, the 8th—the conversation about Victoire took place after dinner on the Saturday—she asked me whether I did not know of a servant's place in St. Denis—I asked her where she came from—she said she came from the Faubourg St. Honore without mentioning any address—I told her that at St. Denis there were no aristocratic people, and that she had much better have remained at the Rue St. Honore, as there the aristocracy lived, and I asked her the reason why she left—she told me she had had a quarrel with her mistress—I told her that that was no reason to leave a neighbourhood, simply on account of a quarrel with her mistress—some more conversation ensued—during this time I had to serve some more</p>

I want to take with me"—I went into the coal-shop with her and asked for the parcel, and I received one from Madame Gerard—I opened it and it contained a mass-book, a silk handker<lb/>chief, and a waterproof—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the book—I then took her to Paris in a carriage; on the way a conversation took place about her father and Madame Riel; it was not a consecutive conversation on one subject only, she talked about her father, and I interrupted at times, talking about the other affair—I asked her whether she had been in London—she said "Yes," and commenced crying—I said "Why are you crying, there is no cause for it?—she said "I know what you came to fetch me for"—I said "It is to take you to your father's that I come to fetch you"—she said "Do you promise me that you are going to take me to him I"—I said "Yes," and then it was that she told me the story about Madame Riel, upon questions which I put to her—she said that she had stayed in London and had quar<lb/>relled with her mistress—I said "What I you have killed her I you have assassinated her! you have murdered her!"—she replied "They say more about the matter than really is the fact; if you knew how it had happened you could not condemn me"—I then said "Tell me how it happened"—she said "I had a quarrel with my mistress in London, who was a very bad person, and it very often happened that we quarrelled; she always called me abusive words, and particularly so on that day"—I think she said that on Sunday Madame Riel came down stairs in the kitchen about 11 o'clock, asking her why the soup was not on the fire, to which she replied as the dinner was only to be ready by 7 o'clock there was plenty of time—then Madame Riel got angry, and was going to put the soup on the fire herself, and then she, the mistress, called her a dirty bitch, and that she, the pri<lb/>soner,</p>

                  </hi>. I am Fellow of a College, and Physician to St. Georges' Hospital—I live at 12, Park Lane—on 8th April, about 8 a.m., I was called to No. 13, Park Lane—I did not know Madame Riel at all—when I got there, I went into the pantry and found her body on the floor; her face and knees were on the ground and her legs so turned up, that you saw the heels and soles of her boots; her hands were placed under her body, a rope was placed round her neck, the knot of it was under her left jaw—the rest of the rope was twisted twice round the knob of the door of an iron safe, and the remainder was thrown over the deceased's body—it was just strained from the door to the neck, but not tight, no force; not enough to have resisted any effort to disentangle it, besides which the free end of the rope was loose—the room was perfectly undisturbed; there was no carpet in it, and not the slightest appearance of a struggle, as far as I could see—I waited, leaving things exactly as I found them till Butcher arrived, after which the body was removed by him into the next room, a parlour that is there—I first examined the body before it was removed, and took the rope off—I made no detailed examination, but merely to look for marks of injury on the body—when it was moved into the parlour, I examined it again; no change whatever could have happened between the first examination and the second—I made a few notes, it is scarcely necessary to look at them—I found the dress open in front, it buttoned in front, but no buttons were torn off; I looked to see—I found a reddish brown mark nearly all round the throat, with a reddish brown depression where the knot had been under the left jaw—there was a bruise over the right eye, and an abrasion under each eye—the eyes and mouth were firmly closed; I tried them—the right-hand was firmly closed, and the nail of the ring finger, the third finger, was broken back; there was no ring on that finger—a slight scratch under the right knee was the only other injury I observed—the third finger nail being bent back resulted, I suppose, from some struggle which she had made—I did not draw any conclusion from that—the dress was not torn, only open</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187206100037"/>
               <p>in front—I saw no other signs of tearing—the pocket was examined in my presence, and nothing found in it—a little blood was coming from the mouth, very slight—the body was quite stiff and cold—it is very difficult to say how long a body has been dead, but there was nothing incompatible with the notion that she had been dead twenty hours—the safe was examined in my presence, and something was found in it, but no money—this exami<lb/>nation was on Monday, and I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination on the Wednesday, and found a bruise on the left-cheek bone, which I had not observed on the Monday; I ought to say on the angle of the lower jaw on the left side—two front teeth of the upper jaw were rather loose—I also found some slight scratches on the nose, which I had not observed before, and in the neighbourhood of the mark of the cord there were some reddish scratches, which I had not observed—the mark on the lower jaw was higher than the place where the rope was on the Monday; the rope was below the jaw—the membranes of the brain were healthy, but gorged with blood—the brain was healthy, except that it was greatly congested—the lungs were gorged with blood, but perfectly healthy, except a little <hi rend="italic">empyema</hi> at the tips—that is a little rupture of the air cells, nearly everybody has it—the valves of the heart were perfect, and the structure of the heart was perfectly healthy, but it was nearly empty of blood because the blood was so unusually fluid that it ran out when the heart was removed from the body—the liver and kidneys were both gorged with blood, but healthy—the lungs, liver, and all the important parts of the body were gorged with blood—I naturally examined the throat and wind pipe, and found two fractures of the <hi rend="italic">hyoid</hi> bone, also a fracture of the <hi rend="italic">hyoid</hi> cartilage, and one of the <hi rend="italic">cracoid</hi> cartilage, just at the left of the medium line—I should also say that there was blood poured out under the mucous membrane of the right vocal cord—that is what we use in articulation—these different bones and cartilages which I have described, are parts of the structure of the throat through which the voice passes, and the blood—they showed that some very great violence must have been applied to the throat—it comes to this, that the architecture, the frame of the throat was broken; the fracture of the frame-work of the throat, and the blood which I saw gorging the different organs, made me consider that she had been killed either by strangulation or throttling, the effect of which would be to gorge all those organs—strangulation would cause that flow of blood to the internal organs—the destruction of the throat which I have described would be the result of throttling, and throttling would also produce the gorging of the various organs which I have described—the mark by the neck, and the injuries to the neck, might have been made during life or after death, but the blood poured out under the mucous membrane of the vocal chord, showed that some injury must have been done during life—it might not have been aggravated afterwards, it must have been before death—in the healthy patient, when strangulation takes place, it would so interfere with the system that congestion would ensue—I do not think congestion would increase after life had ceased—I think the pouring out of the blood under the vocal chord must have been done during life; I should think it was probably done by the violence which caused the breaking of the part—in my opinion a single blow on the jaw would not produce the injuries—it requires very great force and strength to produce the breaking of the frame<lb/>work of the neck which I saw—I have made experiments two or three times to see whether it could be done, and it requires very great force indeed—a</p>

               <p>rope might possibly have caused the two fractures of the <hi rend="italic">hyoid</hi> bone, but not the others, for the mark of the rope was above those injuries—there was only one mark; such a mark could be made by a rope after death, but this was so very regular that I should hardly think it could be made by a rope dragging a body—still there was only one mark—looking at all the circum<lb/>stances, my opinion is that she either died from being strangled or from being throttled; strangling with a rope or throttling with your hand—whether one or the other the gorging of the vessels would equally have taken place.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POWELL</hi>. It is consistent with my examination that the deceased might have been killed by grasping the throat, by throttling—cases have occurred where the throat has been grasped so suddenly and strongly that the windpipe was closed, and death followed almost imme<lb/>diately—I discovered on the Wednesday a fracture of the <hi rend="italic">hyoid</hi> bone, and an injury to the cartilage of the throat—the fracture of the bone was not caused by the rope after death—my opinion is that the injury to the car<lb/>tilage was caused during life, it might have been caused by a powerful grasp of the hand—I give it as my opinion that a blow could not have caused the injury to the cartilage—I have met with no case on record, and I think it would be an accident happening in prize fights, if possible, but it is matter of opinion—in the experiments I have made since I have fractured the bone—that was after the death of the subject—I succeeded in producing similar injuries to the cartilage, twelve or fourteen hours after death—I can give no opinion whether injuries to the bone and cartilage might be more easily produced during life than after death—I am not aware that injuries to the structure of the bone may be produced much more easily on the living than on the dead subject—I am aware that the German surgeons have experi<lb/>mented largely in that way, and Mr. Casper says that he has failed to break this thing—he was a very high authority—he is not living—his works are a very high authority—he says that he never could produce those injuries after death—it is very improbable that the injuries I discovered on this body might have been produced by a blow given under what for medical purposes might be called favourable circumstances—I have not made the experiment, and therefore I cannot say that it is impossible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> In the living subject there is power of resistance, but in the dead subject none whatever—in the experiments I made I chose my opportunity and carefully searched for the right place to put my fingers—I hardly think the hand could grasp all the parts at once, so that the various injuries could be the result of a single sudden act—in my opinion it is impossible for a blow to have produced all those injuries.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Bevington Arms, Paddington Road, Notting Hill—I have known the deceased Sidney Smith, two years, as a customer—on Saturday, 27th April, he came in about 5.30—I left the house, leaving him there—my wife was attending to the bar—I returned between 7 o'clock and half-past, and found him in the private bar—the prisoner was in the parlour with Caroline Jenner, and her sister, Mrs. Judge, and three or four young men—Smith appeared the worse for drink, but I should not call him drunk—he could stand well—he was in that state when he came in—he only had one glass of beer in the house—I advised him to go out, because I was told something which he had done—the prisoner and his friends were about to leave the house; as they went out Smith followed—the sister of Caroline Jenner was standing at the door as he went out, and he pushed rudely against her—I Raw a little scuffle—I could not see exactly who it was between, because there are folding doors with embossed glass—the doors swung open as they went out—I went outside immediately and saw a scuffle, and saw the deceased fall on the flags—his head was towards the doorway as I went out—I could not Bay what caused him to fall—I picked him up—he appeared to he stunned; he could not speak to me—I dragged him into the parlour and bathed his face with water, and he came round a bit, and sat on a seat and said that would do, and took the cloth out of my hand—he laid his face on the parlour table—he sat there about half an hour while I was attending to my business—he then removed himself to the far end and laid down on the seat—he slid off on to the floor and I picked him up—he was then awake—the seat was about two feet high—I don't think he hurt himself—it was not a direct fall, he slid off—I carried him into the tap-room with another witness, to let him sleep off the effect of the drink, as I thought, as he was then snoring and appeared to be fast asleep—I carried him chair and all into the taproom, and shortly afterwards I heard him fall a second time out of one of the Windsor chairs—he was taken away by a man named Plum, about 12.30—I did not notice whether he had a black eye—I bathed his face after 11 o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of Notting Hill—on Sunday morning, 28th April, about 12.40, I was fetched to Plum's house, and there found the deceased lying on the floor, totally insensible; I tried to rouse him—I went with him in a cab to his own house, and stopped with him till between 3 and 4 o'clock; I then left—I have since made a <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> examination in conjunction with Dr. Finlay, the result of which was that he died from compression of the brain—the skull was fractured; there was a considerable bruise on the left temple, and echymosis under the right eye, a small bruise on the left upper lip, a bruise on the right shoulder, and a small one on the right arm, and echymosis on the left side of the scrotum; that was the result of external violence—three bones of the skull were fractured; the parietal, the temporal, and spheroid bones; it was one continuous fracture—on opening the skull, I found a considerable clot of blood pressing on the left hemisphere of the brain, caused by the rupture of a vessel; that was the cause of death, and would be the result of the fracture; the fracture might not be fatal—being knocked down would be sufficient to cause the injury.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> If he fell heavily on some hard substance, such as the iron leg of a table, that would be sufficient—the injury was at the side of the head—I should think if he fell and struck the back of his head it would produce injury of the frontal bone—the injury would not be so probable by a fall on the back of the head as by something from the other side—all the organs</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187206100045"/>
               <p>were healthy—there was nothing in the brain to show excessive drinking—from the bruise on the upper lip there had probably been a blow on the mouth—I could not see from the face that there had been any other.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think it would be impossible for a fall on the back of the head to produce those injuries—I have known cases in the hospital where a fall on the back of the head has produced black eyes—it might have been done from the man falling from his chair against the iron supports of a table, if he fell heavily—drunken men very often snore heavily, it is often difficult to distinguish the symptoms between drunkenness and injury to the brain—healthy people often snore, it is very often a symptom of sound sleep—the only indication of blows was a out on the upper lip—if there had been a heavy blow on the eye I should expect to find it bloodshot, and the echymosis to have come on much more rapidly—he must have been struck behind the right ear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Some hard body must have struck him behind the right ear—falling on the kerb-stone or pavement might do it—some skulls are more brittle than others—I know one case where a person slipping off a chair caused such a fracture—portions of three bones were fractured—it was not a fracture which in itself Would cause death—whether a man falling on the pavement would be likely to produce such an injury would depend upon what part of his head he struck.</p>

On 2nd June I received some infor<lb/>mation from Mr. Bird and Mr. Davis, and I went to Berkeley Street, Hyde Park, that is about a quarter of a mile from Mr. Bird's house—I met the prisoner there about 11 o'clock, in the street—I told him I was a policeman, and that I should take him into custody for breaking and entering into his late master's house, Mr. Bird, at Norfolk Square, on Friday night, 31st May, about 11o'clock, and stealing about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money—he said "Very well"—I then took him to the station and searched him—I found seven sovereigns, 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze, a silver watch, and a plated chain—I asked him how he came possessed of so much money—he said it was his last quarter's wages—I then went to 2, Southwark Place, Lady McCann's—I searched his box and clothes, and found this receipt, which was paid on the Saturday, relating to clothing amounting to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and this box of matches—these two matches were handed to me by Mr. Bird, he has got no matches in his house corresponding with them—they are common wax matches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been examined before—I have said before to-day that the prisoner told me that the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the result of the last quarter's wages—I heard him say afterwards that he had received it from his mother, from Hemel Hempstead—when I asked how he accounted for the money, he said it was his last quarter's wages—these are ordinary matches in the ordinary box.</p>

I found those two matches on the floor in the library, when I came back and found the gas alight—they are different from any we have in the house; two or three sizes larger—they appear to be the same size as those in the box—we have wax matches in the house, but not that size.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a glove cleaner, and live at 16, London Street, immediately opposite Mr. Bird's house—on Friday, 31st May, about 11.20 or 11.30, I was smoking my pipe and looking out of the first floor window—I could see Mr. Bird's house, and the whole of the square—I saw the prisoner at the corner of the square—he walked up to the first lamp-post, and then went back to the corner, and in about five or ten minutes, that would be about half-past 11 o'clock, I saw him run up the steps and get over the front area railings—I went and told my wife what I had seen, and then I went to the second floor front room and watched to see whether he came out—I saw him come out of the front door of Mr. Bird's house—he was in the house from twelve to fifteen minutes—I am quite sure he is the man—I had known him since 8th December last.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I went from the first to the second floor, because I went to tell my wife, who had gone to bed—she was sleeping on the second floor—I did not suspect there was anything wrong, because I have seen him do the same thing before—I did not know that he had left the service—I thought the thing very suspicious—I thought probably he was going to see some of the female servants in the house—on the Sunday, when I heard Mr. Bird had</p>

Muggeridge, in Thames Street, with three other constables—I posted them round the granaries, one in Thames Street, one in St. Andrew's Hill, and the other I was in the act of posting in the rear of the premises in Queen Victoria Street, when I saw the prisoner jump down from the roof of the counting house on to a piece of waste ground at the rear, which lies between Queen Victoria Street and the rear of Messrs. Muggeridge's granaries—he was within nine or ten yards of me—I got a distinct view of him—he ran up Queen Victoria Street, and I pursued him—he jumped over the railings on to the piece of waste ground, and across that into Upper Thames Street, over some railings again—he ran down Thames Street in the direction of Paul's Wharf—I followed him, crying "Stop thief!"—I saw him stopped by an officer named Snellgrove—I took him to the station, and charged him with break<lb/>ing and entering the granaries—I afterwards went back and examined the warehouse; I found an entry had been effected by climbing up an old disused crane, and breaking a window on the second floor, and opening it—he could then come down and open the doors that were used for loading the grain out—I examined the counting-house where I saw the prisoner come out, and found two high office chairs placed one on top of the other, so as to be used as a ladder; immediately over those chairs was a large pane of glass broken, and the wire guard of the glass bent upwards—it was the sky light of the counting-house which was broken—I received some crow bars from Sergeant Heath—I am sure the prisoner is the man—I followed him all the way.</p>

               <p>Station, Twickenham, on the morning of the 9th—I saw a four-wheeled cab driven up to the Albany—three men got out of it, and one was standing outside—I saw a woman, but I did not see her get out—I know the pro<lb/>secutor—he came up shortly afterwards from the Railway, Hotel—he had some conversation with the men, but I could not hear what it was—the three men went away and the prisoner remained—I am quite sure of that, because I spoke to him afterwards—he and the prosecutor were together—I asked him if it was not true they were going home—the prisoner spoke to me first—he said they were going home together—they then went away along the Avenue Road—there was no one else with them—there was another policeman in the station-yard at the time—about twenty minutes afterwards I heard them talking together under a wall in the Avenue Road—I went across to them—the prisoner was with the prosecutor, and I asked them if they were not going home?—the prisoner said he was going home along with the old gentleman—he then turned away and followed the prosecutor—I lost sight of them for two or three minutes—then I heard someone halloa "Murder," and "Police"—I immediately ran back—I saw a man leave the prosecutor—he was running away—the prosecutor was lying on the ground bleeding from wounds on the side of his head—I will not swear who the man was, because I was not near enough to see him—I am quite sure when I first saw the prosecutor his head was right—he was sensible—I picked him up and took him to the station—I do not know the prisoner—the first time I had ever seen him was that night, to notice him—next night I had some communication with Sergeant Payne—he took me into a room at the Railway Tavern—there were six or seven persons there—I picked the prisoner out from them directly—I had given a description of the dress the man wore—when I had identified the prisoner I took him into custody—I went to the house—I found this hat and scarf (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are similar to those I saw him wearing the night before—he had a dark coat on, a pilot or over-coat—I also gave a description of his trousers—about 12 o'clock on the night previously I had seen the prosecutor in the station-yard, and he was then the worse for drink—from the time I saw them go away from the station-yard till the time I found the prosecutor on the ground, I saw no other person about there at all.</p>

I am a solicitor, and have offices at 5, Gray's Inn Square—I practice there under the firm of Stuart &amp; Massey—the chambers are on the first floor, and no one resides there—after business hours the chambers were locked up and the key left in charge of the bead porter—that is not so now, it was at that time—I was at my chambers on Saturday, 17th February—I left a few minutes before 2 o'clock—I closed the outer door ass I went out, and left the place all safe—I had there a little iron box, 11 in. by 6 in., which contained securities to the value of over 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. United States Bonds, Great Western Railway Bonds, Metropolitan and other Railway Stock, and also my pass-book, cheque-book, and some loose papers—I did not go to the office on Sunday—on Monday, 19th, I came to business about the usual time, and missed my box—I considered that one of my clerks had put it in the safe—I afterwards wanted the box, looked for it, and could not find it—I then issued handbills offering a reward of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is one of them—it is dated 20th February, that was the Tuesday, and says "Apply to Messrs.</p>

Do not think to get us in a trap, as all move<lb/>ments <hi rend="italic">is</hi> watched in a way that you little think"—upon that I advertised: "Messrs. S. &amp; M. desire to say that Messrs. Scott, Stratton, &amp; Co; have instructions to pay over 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the contents of the box being handed to them"—I received after that a letter, which is missing—the series of letters is not perfect—after I recovered my papers I burnt some of the letters—the letter was in the same handwriting, in which he said he was not satisfied to put himself in Scott &amp; Co.'s power, and that he would not take the letters there; that I must send the money first, and he would send my papers, and that he meant to keep good faith—on 23rd February I wrote this letter—it was sent to the post by James Lambert, who is in <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "As H. W. objects to go to Messrs. Scott, Stratton &amp; Co., Mr. Massey makes this proposition: that if H. W. will deliver here by parcel or otherwise half of each document in the box, cutting them evenly from corner to cross corner, so as not to deface them, Mr. Massey will send a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note or four 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes by post to H. W. to any address he may give, and he binds himself to do it at once, and before he gets the second halves of the papers, if H. W. will give him his promise to keep good faith and send the second halves of the documents to-morrow. Their numbers are all known, and they are all stopped")—The good faith was that I was to send the money if he sent me the papers, what intention I had rested in my own breast—I them received this letter: "As I do not like to spoil the papers by cutting them in two, I send you one half of the contents of the box, and as soon as I receive the four 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bank notes you shall have the remainder,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187206100061"/>
               <p>without fail, within two hours after receiving. Please address to the same place in Gray's Inn Road; I send you a list of remaining papers I still keep. H. W."—The list is an accurate schedule, containing about half the securities, bonds, and so on—it is a very accurate schedule, drawn by a man who was not familiar with the wording of such documents—I received half of the securities with that letter—on 26th February I wrote this letter, which was sent by Lambert in the ordinary way to the same address in Gray's Inn Road: "Mr. Massey acknowledges the receipt of the parcel sent by H. W., and encloses four 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes in the confidence that H. W. will keep faith and send him at once the whole of the rest of the contents of the blue box—Mr. Massey will really feel obliged if he might have the box also, even if it be broken"—I enclosed four 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes in that letter—the numbers were 09026, 7, 8 and 9—I did not receive the remaining portion of the deeds in two hours—my clerk waited till 10 o'clock at night—I stopped the payment of the notes, as H. W. had broken faith—on 29th I wrote another letter, but I advertised before that, offering an extra 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the remaining half—I then wrote this letter to the same address as before and sent it by Lambert: "Mr. Massey wrote to H. W., enclosing bank notes for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at 11 o'clock on Saturday, and did not stop those notes until noon on Monday—the interval was sufficient to allow H. W. to fulfil his promise and return the box with the contents, and had he done so he might have had the money. The stop shall be removed from the notes on Mr. Massey receiving the box and the papers which H. W. retains."—Neither of us trusted the other then—the securities then came in this envelope—the post mark is "London, W.C.," and it was delivered at 4.30 p.m.—in the mean-time I had taken off the stop, but I asked the bank to let me know who presented each note—on 5th March I received the remaining securities, addressed in an envelope to "Mr. Massey, 5, Gray's Inn Square," in the same handwriting—on 15th March I advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi> in say that there was a letter waiting for H. W. at the poet-office, Gray's Inn Lane—on 18th March I received an answer in the same handwriting: "In answer to your letter of 13th instant I write to say that I am deeply grateful to you for the interest that you take in me, and rest assured that your advice will not be lost upon me; dear Sir, I can assure you it was the first time of my being tempted to steal, and it will be the last, by the help of God, as I have not had a moment's peace since. The box you shall have without fail; I give you my word that you shall have it back before I leave this country, which I am trying to do to go to Australia; I have some friends out there, and if I succeed in going I will endeavour to forget and lead a new life, with God's help. P.S. If you wish to write to me again, address to the same place. H. W."—That was in answer to a letter I wrote giving him some good advice—I have not received the box—this is a letter which I received earlier in the proceedings—it is in the same handwriting: "Messrs. Stuart and Massey, your advertisement in to-day's <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi> is not very plain, as you wish to have the papers without giving the reward, and I consider I should be a fool to send them; therefore, I have one more suggestion to make; if Stuart and Massey wish to get the papers back, and if they send four 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, to be left at the Post-Office, Gray's Inn Lane, as soon as you receive this, and upon receiving the same the whole of the papers that is in the box you will receive at Gray's Inn, even to the small key. I send the two cartes-de-visite to let you know that it is no hoax; this is the last time, and if Messrs. Stuart and Massey send the notes they will</p>

               <p>receive the things that was in the box if no one is sent to watch. H. W."—That letter convinced me that I was dealing with the thief—the carte-de<lb/>visite was my wife's, which was in the box—it was sent to me to show that he had the things.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Stuart &amp; Massey—from time to time, I took letters addressed to "H. W." to the post-office in Gray's Inn Lane, which I left to be called for—I know the prisoner, David Edwards—I have noticed him since the robbery, as a constable in the Inn—I can't say that I noticed him before—he wore the ordinary Metropolitan police uniform—on the morning of 24th February, I took a letter addressed to "H. W.," to Gray's Inn Road, containing bank notes—on that same day, half the securities had been received by Mr. Massey—the first time I saw the prisoner was when I was taking the notes—I saw him in Verulam Buildings—he asked me if we still communicated with the thief at the post-office—I can't tell you the exact words, but they were to that effect—I told him "Yes," I said "I am going to take a letter there now;" but I did not tell him that it contained the notes—he asked me if we had the post-office watched, and I said "No, Mr. Massey does not have it watched"—he then said that he wished he could find the thief; that he would give 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of his own pocket to discover the thief, and that if he caught him he would break his neck—he said we had had Mr. Lansdowne to find out the robbery, and he should have thought that Mr. Lansdowne would have been able to find it out, for he was a very sharp detective—I think that was all that took place; there might have been a few remarks more—he spoke about the woman having brought Mr. Massey's documents to the head porter's lodge that morning—he said he had followed her, and stated the reason he had lost her was because he was afraid to keep too close to her, being in uniform—he said it would be very different if it was anyone in plain clothes; but being in uniform, he was afraid to keep too close to her and so he lost her—on the same afternoon as "H. W." had promised to return the documents within two hours, I was to wait to see if they came to the head porter's, and when I was going over between 2 and 3 o'clock to gee if they had come back, so as to take them to Mr. Massey's bank before it closed, I saw the prisoner by the lodge, and then he said something about his being there to watch in case the remainder of the documents were brought back, and he asked me if Mr. Massey got all his documents back, whether he intended to prosecute the thief if he found him out—I told him I did not know—on the morning of the 24th, he said that he thought Mr. Massey had gone the wrong way to work to find out the robberies, they should have been kept a good deal darker than they had been, and if it had been his robbery, he should have called in a policeman from the Inn.</p>

               <p>—the key of Mr. Massey's chambers used to be left at the lodge—on Monday, 19th February, I heard of this robbery, and on Saturday, 24th February, the prisoner Hopkins came to the lodge—she said "I have a parcel for Stuart &amp; Massey"—I replied "They are over there "meaning at the office, which is at the other corner of the square—she said "I was to leave it here"—I said "Oh, very well," and took the parcel—she imme<lb/>diately turned away, and went out into the Gray's Inn Road—the packet was addressed to "Messrs. Stuart &amp; Massey, 5, Gray's Inn Square"—my lodge is under the archway, close to the chapel—she went out by the arch<lb/>way, and came in that way—I told the warder, Comely, to follow her—I pointed her out to him—he followed her, and returned into the square—I saw Edwards on duty—he was in his constable's uniform—I said "Edwards, I believe there is a portion of Stuart &amp; Massey's property been brought by a woman; Comely is following her down the Gray's Inn Road; you go and have a look at her, so as we shall all know her again"—he then went out of Verulam Buildings into the Gray's Inn Road, and I pointed Hopkins out to him—she turned down Liquorpond Street—I, and him, and Comely went to the corner of Liquorpond Street—Comely had got his uniform coat and hat on—I told him to take them off and give them to me, and told him and Edwards to follow the woman to see where she went to; I returned to the lodge—they went down Liquorpond Street—in a short time they came back and said they had lost the woman—I was surprised to see them back so soon—I did not see Hopkins again till 9th May, when she was in custody at Hunter Street police-station—I saw her with four or five other women, and I pointed her out as being the person who brought the parcel to the lodge—I have not the least doubt about her—I took the parcel afterwards to Stuart &amp; Massey's—the windows at the back of the chambers look on to the gardens of Gray's Inn—there are a number of ladders in the Inn—the constable has the key in order to get the ladders in case of necessity.</p>

W.," and in my judgment the writing corresponds—I have no doubt that they are written by the same person—on 9th May I went in the evening to his lodgings again—I found him there with his wife—I said "Good evening, Edwards." and he said "I suppose you have come to arrest me"—I said "Yes, I have, and your wife also"—he had been kept at the police-station more or less, but not in custody—he was not allowed to go on duty—Edwards said to his wife "Never mind, my dear, it will all be right" and he protested his innocence—the husband of Hopkins was also in the room—there was a little dog there, and the wife said "Take the little dog home and tell mother where we are gone"—I took them to the station and</p>

I was an engraver, and for many years I have made handwriting a study—I am the author of the book about "Junius's Letters," and I have very often been examined in Courts before—I have had placed in my hands thirteen pieces of paper, numbered 1 to 13, and have also had a number of letters signed H. W.—in my judgment they are in the same handwriting—I have no doubt of it whatever—the letters are not written in a disguised hand, but the writing is a little more upright, which is very common, but is really no disguise at all when you come to examine the habits of writing, which are rather peculiar in this case—the capital letter "I" is very peculiarly formed in No. 2 of the letters of H.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Wyman, of 19, Queen Street, Kenington—on Friday night, 10th May, I was sitting in my back parlour—about 10 o'clock I heard a noise which appeared to be in the front parlour—I listened and heard another noise, and while I was passing up the passage I heard it again, and saw my window open, and the table cover gone—I missed my writing-case, and a pot of musk was thrown down—my shutters were closed and the window fastened at 6 o'clock—it has the ordinary fastening—the table on which the things were, stood close under the window, and was the same height as the window—the upper sash was pulled down—I went outside the house and found my scissors, and two or three other things I had left on the table, outside—I saw a policeman and went with him—he ran down Milverton Street—I saw Beck with a hamper with something that looked like checkweed or groundsel—I found my table-cover inside his hamper, he dropped the basket, broke my hold, and ran away—I am sure he was the boy—I saw the constable take Higgs—these are my things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

               <p>a policeman coming up the court and ran away—the policeman ran after them, and Mrs. Wyman followed—she thought I had something to do with it—I said "That is one of them," and pointed to Beck—she put her hand in his basket and pulledout the table-cover—he ran away and I ran after him and caught him—he said "Leave go of me, you b—, for I have just come home from the country"—I took him back to Mrs. Wyman, and we gave him in charge—I saw the policeman take Higgs—he was one of the five I saw—I can't recognise Winter as one of them.</p>
