I am a general dealer, of 17, Sardinia Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields—we have a shop, and a dwelling-house above it—on 25th August, about 4. 30 a. m., a constable called me—I went down and found some of the goods had been moved, and some were gone—I missed 1 1/4 lb. of tobacco, four packets of cocoa, 3 lb. of German sausage, 4lb. of brawn, 12 jam tarts, a box of cigarette papers, 14 lb. of sugar, and about 1s. in bronze—the entry had been effected by pushing out a panel of the front door—there was the mark of an instrument at the bottom of the panel of the parlour-door leading to the shop—the value of the things lost is 30s.—I left the house safe when I went to bed—I identified the cigars, tobacco, and chocolate at the station.</p>

I am a hamster, and am now living at Brighton—in June, 1886, I had chambers at 1, Garden Court, Temple, which I closed at the end of June or the beginning of July, in consequence of ill<lb/>health—the prisoner Illingworth was my clerk, and had the key—the chambers were closed for about eighteen months, till February, 1888—Illingworth continued in my employ down to Christmas, 1886, and I paid him his wages during that time, and it was his</p>

"—I wrote to him to come and see me, and said, "What do you mean by making a claim of 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I don't owe you anything"—not only Deane, but the other two were always begging—Deane knew my address at the club—I went to live in Cambridge two years ago, and then went to Wimbledon—I did not state in the Bankruptcy Court that I was entirely dependent upon my wife, but it was so—the Middle Temple put in an execution for £80—Park, Nelson, and Co. sued me in my absence—I paid that in full—Mr. Cumber is my brother-in-law—it is quite untrue that I told him to buy in my furniture, and claim it if anyone made a claim on it—here is a judgment debt to Allen—this, "James, manager of the Rock Land," was not a judgment—this statement as to the sale of a business in Catherine Street, Strand, was, I suppose, filled up by my solicitor—I cannot account for discrepancies, it was eighteen months' rent at the Middle Temple—Crowder and Lizzard, the solicitors, did not oppose my scheme—my creditors were all paid under the scheme; they desired that those should be the terms—the Registrar said that I was entitled to my order of discharge.</p>

I do not think I was in a state of impecuniosity from 1856 to 1886—I was not able to pay my debts—Simon's father was not a client in my office; he was a wine merchant, and has left a great deal of money—I did not write to a relation about two years ago to say that Simon owed me money, nor did that gentleman resent my writing; on the contrary, he approved of what I did—I have paid Mr. Smith for the wig and gown which I wore in 1866 when I was called to the bar, and they have cleaned my wig several times since—I have never authorised Simon's pawning anything for me; I never authorised him to pawn my wife's opera-glasses, nor did I ask him to redeem them, or to pawn her rings—I may have pawned things since I have been called to the bar; I do not call to mind ever pawning anything in my life, but I may have done so—it is not correct that in 1886 I was being pressed by judgments and writs, and had to leave the Temple, and shut up the place, and that I had to leave my position in <hi rend="italic">Agriculture</hi>—Simon was not in my place there—he never pawned things for me in his life—I never went to my chambers from June, 1886, to February, 1888—I was not abroad; I did not go there, because I was ill nearly all the time in the country and in Brighton—I went to the office of <hi rend="italic">Agriculture</hi> occasionally—Simon met me once or twice in 1886 at Charing Cross Station—I do not know The Shades, Charing Cross, or the Nell Gwynne, in the Strand—I do not remember meeting Simon at any public-house in my life—I do not know No. 8, next door to the Vaudeville Theatre, and do not remember meeting him there, or at Finch's, opposite Somerset House; nor have I met him promiscuously—a portion of the furniture at the Temple was mine, and a portion Mr. Cumber's—in 1888 there was a judgment against me at the suit of the Society of the Middle Temple—I do not know that Mr. Cumber swore</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188910210018"/>
               <p>that all the furniture in my chambers was his; I think he claimed all the things that were seized in 1888—a barrister has to pay dues to the Inn, and has to give security to the Inn—I have always paid ray dues—I think if my security, Mr. John H. Gough, had been sued to pay my dues, he would have told me, and I never heard of it—there were two steel engravings, one was "The Stag at Bay," by Landseer—I did not ask him to pawn that for me—I did not say that he was simply raising some money on it for me—I told the grand jury that the charge was dismissed by Alderman Lusk, and also that I Lad called Deane as a witness—I did not know that the other two were prepared to swear that I had given Simon authority to pawn; on the contrary, I never heard Illingworth tell the inspector that I had given him authority to pawn—Deane said that about a week before the clock was taken away he heard me use the word" pledge" in chambers, and I immediately said that I had not been in chambers—I think I wrote this letter: "My dear Simon,—I am obliged to go home early without seeing you at No. 8, as you mention"—as far as I remember, No. 8 had no reference to any public-house, but I do not remember the letter—I was formerly proprietor of <hi rend="italic">Agriculture</hi>, and it was sold to a company—I was not the vendor—I became a director—I sold my interest to my brother-in-law and his wife—I held 20 shares of £5 each—they were given to me—Illingworth was not my clerk then—the company got £500 from a man named Gordon; he did not afterwards say that it was fraudulently got up, nor did Illingworth say the same—the Board of Trade granted an inquiry—it was not then found that there was a fraudulent prospectus—I do not know that Simon aided Mr. Gordon to get the inquiry.</p>

I am editor of <hi rend="italic">Agriculture</hi>, and am the prosecutor's brother—he was inquiring about a clock in 1888, and saying that his chambers were damp, and Simon said that he and Illingworth had removed the clock and some pictures from the large room to the small room—that was at the end of September or the beginning of October—Simon was then in his employ at the office of <hi rend="italic">Agriculture</hi>—later on in the same year I visited the chambers with Illingworth; I went for a parcel; we could not find it, and so I returned; he remarked to me that he and Simon had put the clock and pictures into the small room—I said, "Perhaps the parcel is in the small room"—he said no, he was quite certain nothing was in there except the things he had mentioned—I tried to go in, but it was locked, and he had not the key; I think he said it was at his place, and he had lost it; that was about the end of November, 1886—a few days afterwards the parcel was brought to Catherine Street, and put into my office—I do not know who brought it—Illingworth came into the employ of the newspaper in June or July of the following year—I went to the chambers again with Illingworth a year afterwards, in December, 1887, to look for a box; I could not find it, and the room was still locked; we did not go again—he said that the room contained no box, only the timepiece and pictures, and another thing or two—I afterwards got the box; it was at the porter's lodge—I went with ray brother to Bridewell Station</p>

I am coachman to Mr. Woolf, at Upper Montagu Mews—I have known Amos between five and six years—he has sold me fifty or sixty mackintoshes and capes—15s. was the ordinary price I paid for capes—Vernon brought these last three Wigan driving capes to my mews—I had seen him several times before with Amos, when mackintoshes and capos were sold to me—I had given Amos an order for five capes, I believe; there were two more to come—I had agreed to no price—Vernon brought these three in August—he said, "I have brought you those three capes, Mr. Tate, that Mr. Amos has brought up "—I asked him what size they were—he said two forty-eights and a forty-six—those sizes are not usually known among coachmen—I looked at them, and asked him to ask Mr. Amos to let me have the other two—he said, "All right; I will tell Mr. Amos; I know he has got some spare material, and I daresay Mrs. Amos will be able to make them up "—I paid him 36s. for the three—before I saw Amos I frequently bought secondhand capes—these were new; we considered them not very cheap at 15s.—I am not aware that they were valued at 25s. wholesale—I considered them cheap at 12s.—I had no receipts—Amos gave me his name and address—I only knew Vernon by coming by; Amos told me he was his man, in Vernon's hearing; Vernon said nothing to it; it was very seldom he said anything when they came together—I paid the money to Vernon.</p>

I live at 3, Denmark Street, Hyde Street, Bloomsbury, and am a piler at Hayes' Wharf—I pile up chests of tea—I have been employed there seven or eight years—I was out on strike with other men—on September 4th a notice was sent out by Messrs. Hayes, offering to take the men back on certain terms—I accepted the offer, with about twenty others—on Thursday, the 6th, I worked up to six p. m., got my wages, and went towards home—I was just entering Tooley Street when I saw a mob of from thirty to fifty, and the pri<lb/>soner at the head of them—he stepped out and said, "I want your name and address, also the amount of money you have received"—I said, "What for?"—he said, "Never mind what for, you give it to me"—I said, "I decline to tell you "—he said, "You don't go," and turned round to the mob and said, "Lads, don't let him go; this is the b——y blackleg "—he put his left hand on my right shoulder, and the crowd drew close—at that moment a police inspector came up—the crowd looked very savage; one man put up his hand, and I thought he was going to push me backwards—the inspector pushed the prisoner on one side, and said, "How dare you molest this man!" and instructed a constable to see me safe on to London Bridge,</p>

I am a barrister, and have chambers at 2, Harcourt Buildings, with Mr. Lancaster, another barrister—Mrs. Jones, the wife of the prisoner Jones, was my laundress, and is so still—I have the most implicit belief in her honesty—Jones used to come there to assist his wife—there was a pedestal writing-desk on one side of the window, in the drawers of which I kept some silver plate and some diamond earrings, which belonged to my mother, a diamond ring value twenty guineas, and some very small diamond shirt studs—on 12th August I came back from the Middlesex Sessions and went up to my chambers, and noticed that the water-closet window on the landing had been displaced—if that was taken out it would admit Jones—there is an outer door and an inner door, which you open with a key—I was alarmed, not knowing whether there was anybody inside, and I brought Mr. Lancaster, and found the chambers disturbed—drawers which had been locked had been opened with a key—the plate and jewellery were gone, but the cases were left—one stud was lying on the floor, some cigars were gone—I afterwards</p>

               <p>missed some clothing—I went to the station, and Sergeant Bryan went back with me and examined the premises—he and I then went to 7, Dean Street, Fetter Lane, where Mrs. Jones lives—we saw her son leaving the house, and going into Fetter Lane again I saw a cab standing, and the prisoner Jones in it with another man—that was about 5. 30—the cab drove off, and we could not overtake it—that was Monday—the cabman called on me on Wednesday, and have Bryan a contract note and a receipt for a pawnticket, and I went to Mr. Blackburn, a pawnbroker, of 271, Caledonian Road—the pawnbroker showed me this diamond ring, which is part of the property stolen from my chambers—some time after<lb/>wards the prisoners were arrested at Chatham, and brought here—there was one remand at the Mansion House—I saw both prisoners on the first occasion; they were not admitted to bail—on the second hearing my attention was directed to the coat, waistcoat, and trousers he was wearing; they were mine—a pawn<lb/>broker from Chatham showed me the upper parts of two earrings, two balls and pendants—they could be unlocked, and made into one, two, or three, separated into two pairs—I recognised them—the value of the property taken away was about £50—on the day week after the prisoners were committed for trial, the postman brought me a parcel with all my silver plate in it—two shirt studs are missing, and the remaining portion of the earrings—I have never seen Marsam to my knowledge.</p>

I am cabdriver, 9820, and live at 6, Britannia Street, Gray's Inn Road—on 12th August I saw the prisoners at Waterloo Station about 5. 30 p. m.—Marsam engaged my cab to go to Victoria Station for Brighton—immediately after they got in they asked me to pull up at the first public-house, and asked me to come in and have a drink—I did so—they then said, "Drive to Fetter Lane"—I did so, and Jones got out there, leaving Marsam in the cab—Jones went into a public-house, and came out in a few minutes, and told me to drive to Finch's, in Holborn; I did so—they then told me to drive to Dean Street, Holborn, where Marsam got out, and then they told me to drive to Victoria, but they asked me to pull up on the road—I then drove to Fetter Lane, and then to 5, Staple Inn Buildings, where Marsam got out, and stopped some time away—I asked Jones where Marsam lived; he told me, and I went and knocked at Marsam's door—he told me he would be down in a few minutes—he came down, and there was a dispute about the fare—I left a man in charge of my cab, and took them to the station, where Marsam gave his name "Charles Bartholomew Marsam," 5, Staple Inn Buildings—Jones gave no address—they were allowed to go—I then went back to my cab, and found in it an envelope containing a contract ticket of a diamond ring, pawned for £8 at Mr. Blackman's, Caledonian Road—I took it to Snow Hill Police-station the same evening, and gave it to the police—I have no doubt the prisoners are the men.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manageress of the Army Floral Association, 8, Eccleston Street; Mrs. Mary Scribner is the proprietress—on Tuesday, 17th September, Simcox came into the shop—he asked what the price of a cross would be—I said it depended on the size and the kind of flowers he wanted—he was about five minutes in the shop discussing the matter—I took him down to the back to show him some specimens—I had sent my assistant out—he said he would let me know, and went away—he had hardly left the door when Walker came in and asked the price of two large plants—we had a conversation—he gave no order—he said he would let me know, and left—he was only there a very short time—it is shop and office in one—next day I was alone in the office, when I heard the bell ring, and looking up I saw Simcox sitting in a trap outside at the door—I did not see who rang the bell—I went as far as the door, and asked what he wanted—he bent forward, and asked if the cross was ready—I said, "No, you have not given me the order"—he asked how long I should be making one—I said it would be ready about half-past five—he said that would be too late, because of last post going out—I said I would let him have it about five—he said that would do; the lady would go as far as £1 or £1 5s.—I asked how long he would be letting me know—he said he would be gone about ten minutes—he pointed out across to another shop, and asked if that was another (florist's he meant)—I said no, a greengrocer's—then he drove off—he was alone in the trap—he went on talking to me outside; I could not hear inside, the traffic was so great—I ran inside to the inner office and got my hat, and came out again on the pavement—when he asked me about the time, I went in and got my watch, and came out and told him what time I could let him have the cross—as he drove off I turned to go into the office; I saw someone passing the office window, and walking in a suspicious way—I believe that was Walker—I looked in and found the cash-box gone, and I ran out again directly—the box was on a chair near the wall in the inner office, and was closed, but not locked—it was safe when I heard the bell ring; it contained £7 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I believe, keys, and memoranda—I went out and spoke to a policeman immediately—I did not see Simcox again till I went to identify him; he did not come back to tell me about the cross, nor did Walker come to tell me about the plants—I believe I was asked to identify them at the police-station on the Saturday—they were with several men—I identified Simcox immediately—I asked whether Walker might turn his back; I was morally certain I knew him by his back, and I recognised him in the second police-station by his face—I am morally certain they are both the same men—I identified them at two separate times, not both together—I have not seen the cash-box nor its contents since.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective L</hi>). I received information with regard to this robbery after the prisoner was in custody, and on 27th September, in company with Sergeant Gray, I arrested Walker about 2. 30 p. m., in St. George's Circus, Southwark—I told him I should take him into custody on suspicion of being concerned in stealing cash-boxes in various parts of the metropolis—he said, "Where is one?"—I said, "You answer the description of a man circulated about three weeks ago by the City police "—he said, "All right, give me a cab "—he was conveyed in a cab to Kennington Road Station—on the following day Mary Innes came to the station—the prisoners were put with six others; we had arrested eight men altogether on suspicion, and did not know which were the men—directly Mary Innes came into the room she seemed attracted to Simcox—she walked up to and identified him—she was turning away, and the inspector said, "You have not looked at the other men"—she looked at the others, and on coming to Walker she stopped in front of him, and asked him to turn round—he did so, and she said, "That is the other man "—he said nothing in my hearing then—he was conveyed to Gerald Road Police-station, where the inspector on duty told him the charge—Walker said to Mary Innes, "Attend to me, madam: When you were at Kennington Road Station did you identify me by my face or my back?"—she said, "By both; I also identify you now by your face"—before 27th September I had seen Simcox and Walker together on two or three occasions within a fortnight.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> All the men among whom the prisoners were placed were taken on suspicion of cash-box robberies, and persons who had lost cash-boxes were brought down from all parts of London to see who were there—when I apprehended Walker I had no personal knowledge of this robbery—I had seen the information—a description of the persons</p>

On 27th September I saw Gray apprehend Walker—about six hours afterwards I stopped Simcox coming out of a public-house in St. George's Circus—I said, "I am a police<lb/>officer; I shall take you into custody on suspicion of stealing cash<lb/>boxes"—he said, "All right"—he made a sudden spring and ran off for about a mile—I ran, and eventually caught him in a house called The Pollards, Waterloo Road, concealed behind the back door—I did not see him go into the house, but I heard the door clash—as I went in he held the door up, concealing himself behind it—I heard him breathing, and pulled him out—he said, "I should not have run away, but I did not care to pass the night in a police-station "—I took him to Gerald Road Station, where he was charged with this offence—he said, "I know nothing at all about it"—I found £1 10s. gold, 7s. 6d. silver, and 5d. bronze on him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Seven men besides Simcox were apprehended that evening near that public-house, and charged with being concerned in cash<lb/>box robberies—I had not heard of this robbery in Eccleston Street when I apprehended Simcox—four of the eight have been discharged, one is in prison for picking pockets, and another is wanted for cash-box robberies—we have found out since that some of the men we discharged are wanted—five plain clothes officers were engaged in the case.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wine-blender, and live at 13, Liddiard Road, next door to the prisoner—the house on the other side of the prisoner, No. 9, is inhabited—my kitchen faces the prisoner's kitchen—on Thursday night, 12th September, about half-past nine, I was in my kitchen, and I noticed a light over the fanlight of the prisoner's back door—seeing that I went out to the front door; there was not a soul to be seen; I knocked at the prisoner's door, and I could hear wood crackling and things falling about—I then knocked at No. 9, and told the people there that the house next to them was on fire—I then tried to force the door of No. 11, but could not—I then tried the parlour window, and found it to be unfastened—with difficulty, owing to the smoke, I got through and into the passage, where I found the cellar under the stairs to be a complete furnace—I then opened the door; someone handed me water, which I threw on the fire—some neighbours came, and I left them throwing water on the fire—I then went to the Holborn Infirmary, and Mr. Lanham came there—the coal-cellar is marked on this plan; that is where the fire was raging; it is under the staircase leading up to the first floor—between the ground floor and first floor there is an ante-room or office—the fire was not out when I returned with Lanham to the house; although it was greatly got under, it was still burning—Lanham extinguished the fire—at the time I got through the window there was a rather strong smell of paraffin—on Sunday afternoon, the 15th, at twenty minutes to three, I was at my parlour window, and saw the prisoner and two others just going in at the door; I heard the prisoner or someone go to the back of the house, and shut down the back window, and then he and the two persons came out at seven minutes to four, and they went away together; I don't know who the two others were—I next saw the prisoner at half-past four come out of the house alone; he had an overcoat on his arm, and he went away in the same direction as before—a few minutes after I went into my kitchen, and found a strong smell of paraffin, coming from a broken window of the prisoner's kitchen—I saw that window broken on the Sunday night, by the engineer from the infirmary—the kitchen leads to the passage and the coal-cellar and the larder: there is a door in front of the larder—the smell was strong; it smelt like raw paraffin—in consequence of that I stopped at home the whole of the evening and night—I was at home on the 19th—about half-past ten that night someone knocked at my door, and told me the house was on fire—I went to the front door, and tried to break it, but was unable to do so—the door was locked, and the window also through which I had obtained access before—just as I was trying to open the window somebody broke the door open, and I then entered the house with others—I saw the back parlour carpet on fire all over, with the legs of the furniture; I saw smoke and flame—there was a very strong smell of paraffin, and I also saw the front parlour carpet on fire—there were two distinct fires—I saw some things in that room on fire, a distinct fire from the back room—my attention was not directed to the staircase that night; I only went into the two rooms—the neighbours and myself extinguished the fire with water—it took about fifteen minutes—Lanham was there; the two fires seemed to be quite independent of each other.</p>

I am a driver in the service of the North Metropolitan Tramway Company, and am now living at 16, Liddiard Road—up to the 19th September I was a lodger with the prisoner at No, 11—I occupied the back bedroom on the first floor—I was the only lodger—up to 9th September the prisoner, his wife, and children lived there—they went to Margate; my duties took me to my work about eight in the morning, end I did not get back till somewhere after twelve at night; I did not go home to my meals—when I left on Thursday morning, the 12th, everything was all right in the house, as far as I could see—I did not see the prisoner before I left that morning—I returned from my work at a quarter to one in the middle of the night—I found that a fire had occurred in the coal-cellar under the staircase—it was all over when I got back—I let myself in with a key at the front door—the prisoner was in the house at the time—he said, "This is a very sad affair"—I said, "Yes"—he said he had a suspicion of certain persons having done this, in spite to him—I went into my bedroom; it was in a disorderly state, a chest of drawers had been broken open, and the contents strewn about the carpet—some of the drawers were on the floor, and the contents of other drawers were thrown on the floor—I missed two overcoats—I told the prisoner so—he did not say anything—I went into the prisoner's room, the front room; that was in almost a similar condition—the drawers had been broken open—I don't think anything was strewn on the floor—the drawers were drawn out a little—I think the things were still in them—I went into the office—there was a table in one comer of the room, and a shelf in another comer—I think the prisoner kept his books and papers there belonging to the insurance company—he told me he had lost between £25 and £30 in money, a suit of clothes, and a mackintosh—he said the money had been taken from the drawers of the desk in his office, and the clothes from his bedroom—I think he made that statement half an hour after our return—I think the policeman left the house before that—I think he made the statement about the money while the policeman was there; I think he did not as to the clothes—Mr. Thorne was there part of the time—he was there when I got home—he stayed, I think, fully an hour and a quarter after that—the prisoner asked me if I would take a day off the following day—I said I would go and ask, and Thorne said, "I will stay with Rickards till you come back"—I went to the yard and got permission, and I got back about half-past one, and found the prisoner and Thorne still there, and I told them I had got my day off; that was with the object that we should go and communicate with the police in the morning as to my loss and his—Thorne left immediately after my return from the yard; that was about half-past one or thereabouts—I slept in the house that night; nothing was done in the way of setting the rooms straight that night, except I think that I put my two drawers that were on the floor in their place—nothing was done in the prisoner's room that I am aware of—I went to the station and gave information—I left the house with the prisoner between nine and ten in the morning, and went to the station and gave information as to the loss and the fire—the police came back to the house either with us or immediately afterwards, Superintendent Allum and Sergeant Nutkins—I remained in the house up to the Sunday—I saw the prisoner that day; I had an appointment to meet him at half-past two at the terminus of our company's line, at the Archway Tavern—he told me he was going to Margate that afternoon; he had told me on the day</p>

               <p>previous that he was going on the Sunday—I think ho said he was going some time in the evening—he said on the Sunday that he was anxious to communicate the bad news to his wife; he left me at half-past two, and I saw no more of him that day—I got home that night at a little past eleven—I let myself in with my key—there was the old smell in the house from the fire, a smell of burning and of paraffin; that smell had existed from the previous Thursday; there was a smell of smoke; as I came to the staircase I noticed rolls of paper laid in a train form up the stairs, going up towards the office and up to the first floor, where the bedrooms were; the paper was rolled loosely, touching each other, and one was put through the banisters on the first landing, close to the office door, about two yards from it; that was evidently laid purposely—I did not smell the paper; I left it as it was—I slept in the house that night—I saw the prisoner next morning between eleven and twelve; it was before dinner; he came to where I was—I said to him, "How did you leave the house yesterday morning?"—he said, ''Just as you left it"—I said then, "There is something very queer about it; there has evidently been another plot for a fire "—he appeared surprised, and said he would go and look—I described to him what I had seen the night before—he said his wife had received the news, and was very much hurt, and was almost beside herself on hearing the news—that was between eleven and twelve on the Monday morning; he then left me, and I saw him again in the afternoon between two and three—he said ho had been to his office to see the manager, and they told him that the police had been watching him for six months—I said, ''You ought to go to the police office, and tell them of this plot to burn your place again"—he said he would do so—he told me he had been to see the house—I went to my work the rest of the day, and got home at my usual hour, at twelve on the Monday night—the newspapers had then been removed, and the place was swept and cleared up—I spoke to the prisoner about it, and he said he had had his coat off, and cleaned the place up himself—I slept in the house on the Tuesday and Wednesday—on the Thursday ho said he might as well be down at Margate, because he was only walking about spending money and doing no good, as he was suspended by his company; he could not follow his business, and he would go to Margate that evening; I don't think he mentioned the time—he then left mo to go home, and I saw no more of him—I got home between twelve and one that night—on going into the office I at once saw there had been another fire—I had heard the news before I got there—it Lad been extinguished before I arrived—the prisoner did not say anything to me as to his having been at the place before the second fire—I did not ask him a question about it—he would know that I should sleep in the house both on the 15th and 19th—I did not see the prisoner again till he was in custody—I think I made a mistake in my evidence before, when I said I saw him on the Saturday, but on thinking it over I did not see him again till he was in custody.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector Y</hi>). On the night of 12th September, about five minutes to ten, I went to 11, Liddiard Road—on entering the house I saw that the staircase was on fire—people were engaged in putting the fire out—it was put out in a quarter of an hour from the time I got there—the prisoner was not there—after the fire was put out I went upstairs and into the bedrooms—in the front room there were two chairs placed on the floor; the remaining drawers wore in the chest, and their contents partly disarranged—in the back room the drawers were dis<lb/>arranged—in the office the table was strewn with a quantity of papers belonging to the Prudential Insurance Company—in the front room there was a smell of paraffin oil on the table—there was a hanging-socket, and the lamp was on the table—I did not see the prisoner at all that night—on the Friday morning I was at the station, when the prisoner came there accompanied by Jackson—he stated that the house had been entered during his absence and a quantity of clothing stolen, enumerating the articles, also a sum of money, a £5 note, and from £20 to £25 in gold and silver, and the thieves had afterwards set fire to the premises—he said he left the house about seven o'clock—I took the particulars of the alleged loss and have the exact items: a diagonal coat and vest; a pair of grey trousers, two overcoats, one waterproof, and the money; he valued the total at £30—I was the first police officer that arrived at the house; others came—nobody made a note that I know of—on the morn<lb/>ing of the 13th I visited the house about half-past ten—I could find no trace of thieves having been in the place; I examined the place fully; there were no marks visible on the outside—I examined the different rooms—between the 13th and 19th the prisoner made no report of any further attempt to fire the place—I met him on one or two occasions, once on Monday, the 16th, about half-past four, and the following day about three; nothing was said about this—on the 19th, about half-past ten, I was called to the same house—I found the premises in charge of some of the neighbours; some communication was made to me—I examined the place—there was a quantity of newspapers loosely rolled into each other from the bottom of the stairs to the prisoner's bedroom, some were twined into the stair rails, and others leading from the stairs into the office; the whole of them were saturated with paraffin or similar oil; this train led into the office behind the door, to an old aquarium under a shelf, on which were a quantity of books relating to the business of the Prudential—there was a quantity of paraffin oil on the carpet at the termination of the train; by the train, I mean the rolls of paper—on the front-room table there were three bottles, each of which contained, paraffin oil—I produce them—there were no broken bottles on that occasion—on the first occasion there were three or four broken beer bottles—I found this small can on the dresser in the kitchen on the night of the 19th, and this other one was lying on its side in the passage on the night of the 12th, close to the fire—I produce some of the paper I found—this roll of paper is the one spoken of as being on the stairs; they had paraffin oil on them; it is there now; these others are the papers leading from the stairs to the shelf behind the door, and these are the papers under the shelf in the aquarium—this is a piece of the carpet that</p>

               <p>was saturated with paraffin, also some books and a table-cloth with paraffin on it—I saw a cabinet on the morning of the 13th at one of the neighbour's houses; it had been removed at the outbreak of the fire; the prisoner directed my attention to it; he took me to the neighbour's house—the doors of that cabinet appeared to have been forced by a small screwdriver—when I examined the place on the night of the 12th I saw nothing the matter with it; it appeared perfectly safe and intact—when I saw it on the morning of the 13th I noticed marks on the wood<lb/>work on each side of the lock, apparently done by a pair of scissors; the bolt of the lock was shot outside, the catch of the drawers, not strained or forced in any way; the socket into which the bolt of the lock shot was quite intact, not injured in any way—I saw a pair of scissors in the office such as would have made the marks on the drawer—I saw a screwdriver in the house on the night of the 12th which corresponded with the marks on the cabinet.</p>

               <p>—I am a money lender—I know the prisoner as a borrower—on 20th June last I lent him £30 on a bill of sale of his furniture at 11, Liddiard Road—I have the bill of sale; it contained a proviso for insurance—I insured the furniture for £100; I took out the policy in his name—on the Saturday after the first fire he came to my office and said a fire had occurred on his premises; burglars had entered and broken open a drawer and stolen £25 and £5 of his own money, and had soaked some clothes with paraffin and set light to the place—I said, "Then you had better make out an inventory of the remains''—he said, '' There is no policy "—I said, '' Yes, there is "—I don't believe he knew there was a policy in existence—I said, "You had better go to the Prudential"—he said, "I have been there, and they don't believe the money is stolen, but that I have had the money "—I said, "You had better let my man come and see what damage is done "—he said he would let me know by Monday—he said he must resign on the Monday if he did not produce the £30—he said that an agent under him had been discharged through being a defaulter, and he suspected that was the party who had set light to the place—I said, "You had better acquaint the police of that fact"—he said, "I have done so"—I did not see him again till he was in custody—I had a telegram from him on the Tuesday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am head clerk in the audit department of the Prudential Insurance Company, at 142, Holborn Bars—the prisoner has been employed in that company as assistant to the superintendent for the Highgate division since April, 1886—it was his duty to superintend the collectors and agents for the Highgate district—his salary was £2 6s. per week, and he had something by way of commission in addition—if the agents had any balance in their hands they would hand it to the prisoner; it would be quite in order for him to receive it—he would also receive premiums from assured persons—many of those premiums would fall due on the first of each month—about 20th August I sent to the prisoner a list of premiums, which would become due on 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi> September; he would have authority to collect those premiums; it would be his duty to hand them over to the society—on 7th and 13th September I wrote to him to come and see me—he did not come until the 14th; he then told me that a burglary had taken place at his house and a fire, and that about £30 of the company's money had been stolen, and about £10 of his own money—I said I did not believe his statement as to the burglary, and that he would not be allowed to act further for us until he had found the money—I said it pointed to two things, either gross carelessness or something worse (we have facilities for our agents to pay into the banks, and they could have paid them)—he replied, "Very well"—I said I did not believe he had £10 of his own money, and I asked him how he had made it up—he said he had put it back by small sums week by week for a specific purpose which he did not specify—I had written to him to come at ten, he came at half-past eleven—he apologised for being late by saying he had been to see the police that morning with reference to the burglary—he then left about twelve—I next saw him on Monday, the 16th, about twelve o'clock—I asked him how this money of ours was made up, and he then made out this list in my presence—the pencil figures are his, the red ink are mine—I was not able to cast the pencil figures, they were not sufficiently clear, and I asked him to call out the items to me, and I put them</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188910210051"/>
               <p>down in red ink—those represent the sums he had received on our behalf under different policies, the numbers of which are put here; the total amount in red ink is £20 2s.—he agreed that that was right—he said he had also in this drawer, which was broken open, £15, which had been handed to him by an agent named Shepherd; he did not say when—Shepherd was a new agent, and would have gone to the prisoner for instructions and handed the cash over to him—I understood that had been done—it was the prisoner's duty to have remitted that £15 to the office—he said that a further sum of £4 in gold was handed to him by an agent named Harrod, on the Thursday night, 12th September, on which the fire had occurred—no mention was made of any books—we supply our agents with books and stationery, including proposal forms, and all forms required by an agent—the prisoner would supply the agents with collecting books, which he would receive from the office—he was to come on Saturday morning to bring the books—they were not brought; the money was a more important matter—the books he was to bring were with reference to an agent named Partman—he did not bring those books; he brought no books at all, either on the 14th or 16th, he said they had been in this fire, and my inference from what he said was that the books had been destroyed; I have not a very distinct recollection of his actual words, that he had had a fire at his house and he was unable to bring the books; that was on the 14th—the books were not referred to further on the 16th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The ordinary collectors and agents were inferior to the prisoner—a collector would pay his collection direct to us as a rule; he would have a book—that collector has left, not of his own free will—the directors would have authority to dismiss; we have a surety—we had a surety with Partman; we go by the report of the superintendent or the assistant—we sometimes reinstate; the man would have the privilege of appeal to us, and we should have the matter gone into—if an ordinary collector has not duly entered in his book the amounts received it would justify his dismissal—the assistant superintendent keeps in his possession the books of the agent who on his recommendation has been discharged, and if the agent appeals those books would be produced in evidence for his reinstatement—Partman was dismissed, and reinstated after the fire in another district—it was on the prisoner's report that Partman was dismissed—he said the books had been destroyed in consequence of the fire; that would include Partman's books—it was after the fire that Partman appealed—the police communicated with us—I did not promise to rein<lb/>state the prisoner in another district if he paid the money—Partman is here; he is a superintendent of agents—the prisoner was not an agent; he was assistant to a superintendent—Mr. Hargreaves would not have authority himself to represent to the prisoner that if the police took no action he should be sent to another district—Harrod is a collecting agent—the prisoner said that Harrod had on the night of the fire paid him £4 in gold—Harrod is here.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It was the prisoner who reported Partman in the first instance, and on his report Partman was dismissed—if there was a balance in Partman's hands, he should have handed it to the prisoner, and that should have appeared in the books—no complete investigation was made as to this matter, because so much suspicion was attached to the prisoner that we gave Partman the banefit of the doubt—I believe Partman's</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the Highgate district—the prisoner was my assistant; I paid him his salary from week to week—before 10th September he had occasionally anticipated his salary and commission—we have had an investigation in order to discover the prisoner's deficiency to the society, which shows a deficiency of £39 2s.—I am not aware that Partman's dismissal was brought about by the prisoner's report to the directors—since this accusation against the prisoner, Partman has been reinstated—Partman's books have been found at the prisoner's house, I believe—it was after they were found that Part<lb/>man was reinstated—I don't know what the result of the prisoner's report was; I know that Partman was dismissed.</p>

               <p>he did not see the reason why he should stop about here spending his money and doing nothing, and he thought about going away and enjoying himself; he was suspended from the office, and rather than stop about the neighbourhood he would go to Margate and see his wife; that was what I understood—he told me in the morning that he would go at one o'clock, but I saw him afterwards between four and five, and I said, "How is it that you have not gone off?"—he said, "I promised to meet a friend of mine here, and he has not shown up, and I am going off now"—I saw him again between six and half-past, and he then said he was just going off to catch the train at London Bridge at a few minutes past seven, and if they wanted him they would have to fetch him—it was not then, but just before or just after the first fire, he said, "If anybody calls, tell them you have not seen me.

I live at White Hart Street, Drury Lane, a coffee<lb/>shop kept by Clarke, and the other three prisoners lived there—on Sunday, September 15th, I went for a walk with the four prisoners—when we got to Chancery Lane Clarke and Jackson parted—they went towards Holborn, and Bassett, Whatton, and I went another way towards Holborn—we turned to the right out of Chancery Lane, down the street where the <hi rend="italic">Railway Press</hi> buildings are—Whatton and Bassett stood still there, and said, "That is all right, is it not? ''—I said to Whatton, "What did you mean by saying that is all right?''—he said, "Brown is going to break into the <hi rend="italic">Railway Press</hi> to-morrow night"—Jackson goes by the name of Brown—we were out about two hours—we three went back to White Hart Street together, and Clarke and Jackson were there—Bassett or Whatton said, '' We have been down to that place"—one of them, I can<lb/>not say which, had a file, which they said was to be put in the fire and hammered out down to a point—I communicated with Mr. Nicholson next morning—Clarke put the file in the fire, and Jackson hammered it out on a flat-iron—on Monday night, the 12th, the prisoners went out, but first of all they told me there were two people on the watch—Jackson came in very late next morning—Jackson said when Clarke and Bassett were there, that there were two <hi rend="italic">coppers</hi> on the watch—on the night they were out, the first Monday night, Bassett said to Jackson, '' You gave me the file in the street "—in the week before the burglary Clarke broke off one of the prongs of this fork and put the other into the fire—I said, "I know what that is for, "and told him it was for undoing the locks of drawers or desks—he said, '' That is quite right''—on Monday evening, the 23rd, Whatton, Jackson, and Miles, who is not in custody, went out from about 3 p. m.—Miles came back about two o'clock in the night, and then Bassett and he went out together; they came back about 5 a. m., Whatton and Jackson about seven—when they were all five together I said, "Where have you been?''—Whatton and Jackson said at first that they had been with two girls, but after breakfast there was a conversation between them all, and one of them said they had been to Southampton Buildings, and went upstairs and broke the desk and took out the papers, that they opened the area window and Jackson got in first and Whatton after him, and went upstairs to the top floor and took their boots off when they got into the passage—they said they had three enamelled clocks, and put them in a bag behind the front door, but did not bring them out, and they committed a nuisance behind the stairs—they had a cheque, and one of them said, "That is a wrong one; it has two lines across it," and it was torn up and burnt—I could not under<lb/>stand it, but I heard it said it had been forged—they were showing one another this gauge, and said they had taken it to two or three shops, but could not sell it or pawn it—after Clarke put the fork into the fire he tried it on one of the locks—on the Thursday I went to Mr. Nicholson again, and then to the station, where my statement was taken down.</p>

               <p>been in the neighbourhood of Deptford for a great many years, and has held official appointments for thirty-five years—in 1886 I had to recover some debts for J. G. Cooper, who was engaged in the building trade—he was then living at 2, Josephine Avenue, Brixton Rise—after his bankruptcy he went from No. 2 to No. 19, where I think his sister lived—he introduced me to the prisoner, with whom I first had business relations at the end of 1886, I think—I have seen him living with Cooper, both at No. 2 and No. 19—I always believed the prisoner to be a man of means—he told me very early in our acquaintance that he had guaranteed Cooper's banking account at the Central Bank, Newgate Street, because Cooper was in difficulties—the prisoner purchased some freehold land at Kingston-on-Thames, built houses on it, and sold them—I acted for him as his solicitor; Cooper was the builder—Cooper was made bankrupt in May, 1888, I believe—the prisoner applied verbally to me to raise £100, at New Cross, I think—a few days or a week before 5th April he asked me if I could arrange or negotiate another loan of £80 or £100 as I had already negotiated two other loans for him—I said I would see what I could do, and while I was doing that he sent me this telegram on 6th April, "Please try Steadman"—acting on that authority, I wrote this letter to Mr. Steadman on 6th April, "Dear Sir,—<hi rend="italic">Re</hi> Cooper. Dr. Hakim wishes us to inquire whether you are open to make an advance on the same terms as before. Please let us know to-morrow "—Mr. Steadman came to see me, either that day or the next—I communicated with Hakim—I said Mr. Steadman was willing to make another loan, on condition that Hakim would endorse the note himself, as he would not lend to Cooper alone, because he had found out that Cooper was in difficulties—I told Hakim that, and then he asked me to negotiate for £80 or £100, what<lb/>ever Steadman would consent to lend; he preferred £100—I wrote to Steadman in consequence—there was no doubt another letter addressed to him after I had seen Hakim—something was said about collateral security—a lease of one of the Kingston houses, granted by Hakim to Cooper would be deposited—he offered that voluntarily, on the same terms as before—I communicated to Steadman—I had seen him before, after seeing Hakim, and telling him that he would have his name and collateral security, as before—Steadman consented to make an advance—this is the letter that Hakim sent me, dated 12th April, 1888; I altered it at the time in pencil to the 13th, because I thought it was a mistake (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Dear Sir,—Herewith I enclose a promissory note, as required. Try and arrange it. I will see you in the City at twelve o'clock.—<hi rend="smallCaps">P. M.

               <p>soon as he had my reply, and I gave him the money—I believe next month Cooper became bankrupt—Steadman had the deed as collateral security; it was a ground-rent of £3 a year—at the time of Cooper's bankruptcy the house was about two-thirds finished; it was roofed, but not finished; it was never finished by Cooper or Hakim—there was no value in the lease, because it had been disclaimed by Cooper's trustee in bankruptcy—that was the state of things when the money was paid over to the prisoner—the note was presented for payment in due course; it was payable at our office—it was dishonoured on the 17th July; I marked it myself, "Not provided for"—subsequently, in September I acted for Steadman in suing on the promissory note—before doing so I saw the prisoner on the subject—I told him it had been presented, and not paid, and he asked me to see if Steadman would agree to renew—I did not see Steadman—the prisoner did not come for some little time—I do not think I told him anything—I did not consider it likely that Steadman would renew, and, in fact, he had said he would not—he was not my client—he was so disappointed in the matter, I knew he would not—I then issued a writ dated 18th August, 1888—I acted from that time for Steadman; this is the statement of defence and the reply—the action went for trial—this is the judgment for the plaintiff for £105 and costs, dated 3rd May, 1889—the costs were about £70; they have never been paid—the prisoner was insolvent in July, not in May—I got no money from him, Steadman got nothing—the affidavits were before Master Kaye—the summons I took out was heard before him on 3rd, 4th and 5th September, 1888, and afterwards on appeal before Mr. Justice Denman—on the occasion of going before him, Steadman had prepared this affidavit—it was not used—the Judge said there was conflict, and we must have a trial—subsequently there was a trial by Jury before Mr. Justice Hawkins—Steadman's affidavit was never used or filed—I had previously given the other side a copy of it—this is the judgment on Master Kaye's order—it is that the plaintiff recovers against the defendant £100 principal and interest—judgment was drawn up on 3rd September—the prisoner appealed to the Judge, who decided that the Master's order be rescinded, and the defendants have leave to appear—the original affidavits came before Mr. Justice Denman, and he overruled Master Kaye, who had given unconditional judgment—the result of that was that the £70 costs were incurred—if Master Kaye's judgment had stood, the costs would have been £5—my client has got nothing for it—these two affidavits, sworn before Mr. Phillips and Mr. King, are in the prisoner's writing.</p>

M. Cooper through the prisoner's default; I swear that is the only one—these are my two acceptances for £300 and £200—they are not paid; nothing is due on them—there has never been any demand for them, they are absolutely valueless—in my action against the prisoner the statement of defence and counter-claim were delivered—these are the pleadings—these are the two bills; I produced them at the Police-court—payment of the "bills was claimed in the counter-claim, but that was not for months after they were due—the pleadings were closed; I have not set the action down for trial; the defendant could do it at any time if he wished it tried—as three actions were pending, I thought we could wait for the fourth—I meant claim for payment on the bills had not been made; Counsel made a claim in the pleadings, the defendant did not—that was the first claim, and it was six months after the bills were nominally due—I daresay my father will be here—many of the bills were accepted in the name of Saw and Son—I don't think my father knew much about these matters, I attended to them entirely—my father knew very little about my transactions with the prisoner and Cooper till about 23rd August, 1888—he was in the office very frequently, but he knew nothing of the details—I don't think he knew I had accepted a number of bills in the</p>

               <p>name of the firm—I don't suppose there is any authority in the deed of partnership between me and my father for me to accept bills in the name of the firm—I did this entirely on my own authority—I don't think there is any clause in the deed prohibiting a partner from accepting in the name of the firm; I am speaking without any recollection in the matter—I had no power to bind my father in any way, and he is not bound—one solicitor cannot bind another unless with express authority—I considered myself alone bound by the bills—I signed one, "Saw and Son," at the prisoner's request—the acceptance, Saw and Son, was intended to go forth as the endorsement of the firm, but I was primarily liable—I was sued by the Central Bank—an order for judgment was made against me, but the bank agreed never to draw judgment up because the prisoner paid the debt and cleared it up; it was partly accommodation—the prisoner was present when the Master made the order—the solicitor to the bank could have signed judgment at any moment—they wrote several times asking for the matter to be settled; they never threatened bankruptcy proceedings unless I did pay; I swear that—I was never to my knowledge threatened directly or indirectly with bankruptcy proceedings by the bank—I never heard from the prisoner or from anyone that he had been told they would take bankruptcy proceedings against me unless I took up the bills; I had not the slightest fear of any trouble—it was suggested to me in cross<lb/>examination at Southwark County-court, when the prisoner defended an action; he produced a letter to someone else, which said something about bankruptcy; I swear it—I did not go to the bank and plead for time; I saw the solicitor many times—I have seen Mr. Pitt, the manager of the Central Bank, Newgate Street, in the prisoner's presence—I think I went once to the bank with the prisoner, and saw him with Mr. Pitt—I said I was unable to take up the acceptances; I asked for time to pay them—I said Mr. Clinton was going to purchase the ground-rents—he did purchase them from the prisoner—I said money was going to be raised in that way—I swear I said they were accommodation bills—it was absolutely an accommodation transaction—I said at the Police-court, "The Central Bank, as a matter of fact, obtained judgment against me for £750 in respect of these bills. I had no defence. Hakim brought bills P and Q (these are the two bills in question) to me, and so relieved me of the judgment which had been obtained against me; there was only an order for judgment, no judgment was ever drawn up"—I only knew Mr. Strapp for about two months before he came to the Police-court—I do not know how the £250 bill, for which there was order for judgment, was discharged—that and the £500 bill were brought back to me on the 18th May—I don't remember ever making an advance to Cooper in cash; it was by cheque to Hakim or order in every case, except, perhaps, twice—the bills were for Hakim's accommodation—I never made advances direct to Cooper, except in one or two instances—I think on two occasions I gave Cooper a cheque because the prisoner could not come, and he requested me to do so—the £250 and £500 bills were drawn by the prisoner on me purely for his accommodation; I explained that to Mr. Pitt—I, as drawer, was liable first—they could have sued the prisoner; I don't know of any case in which they sued him—a portion of the £92 paid by Steadman was not paid to Strapp, nor was a portion paid to Gibbons—I handed it to the prisoner—I have found out that the bank notes were paid to Mr. Strapp's</p>

M. Cooper took over all the securities—I proved in the prisoner's bankruptcy for about £1,400—Cooper's trustee has made no claim against me—in the prisoner's will of October, 1887, he left his property in England to me as trustee, and I was to pay his debts, and hand over his residue to the next<lb/>of-kin—I should take what was owing to me among the rest—the bills for £250 and £500, due on 24th and 27th March, 1888, were made on 24th October; they were endorsed, and were in the hands of the bank—I had not a farthing out of them—the £750 was used by the prisoner for the purpose of his business transactions—the other three bills the prisoner obtained for discounting, but the bank manager, I suppose on account of Cooper's instability, refused to discount, and they are absolutely waste paper—I should think they never were discounted—they fell due on 18th May, 4th July, and 10th June, 1888—from 4th July to 27th November, 1888, when this amended claim and counter-claim were put in, no one applied to me for payment on account of those bills, and I never heard about them—the prisoner has never endorsed them—this is an indemnity signed by the prisoner to indemnify me against all bills. (<hi rend="italic">This was signed</hi> 13<hi rend="italic">th April</hi>, 1888.)—I had no consideration for these five bills; they were brought to me after the indemnity—I never knew when the prisoner applied for the second loan of £80 or £100 what he wanted the money for—I never heard till November that he was not liable—he never suggested it—he said nothing at all as to what he was going to do with the £92 when he took it—I applied to him for these bills, but as they were not going to be used, he told me on his word of honour that all signatures on the bills were cancelled, and that they were harmless; that they were in the pocket of an overcoat at Nutfield, where Cooper had moved to on his bankruptcy—that was in June or July, 1888—when he exhibited them to his affidavit I found the signatures were not cancelled—the claim in my action was for £450, which I lent him for seven days on his personal undertaking to repay it; it was never repaid—he wrote out the whole cheque, and endorsed it, and Cooper signed it—that is part of the £1,400 I have proved against the estate—he brought a cheque signed by Cooper, and filled it up and got the money from me on it for seven days—he wrote, asking me not to pay it in—Miss Adams</p>

I live at 16, Douglas Street, Deptford—I make loans on security—on 16th December, 1887, Mr. Saw, jun., applied to me to lend money for the prisoner—the first transaction was a promissory note for £80 at three months—when that was due on 19th March it was renewed, and at the same time they wanted another loan of £80 payable at four months—on 14th April I was applied to for £100—I got this promissory note, endorsed by the prisoner—I gave Mr. Saw £45 in gold, and a £50 Bank of England note, and as collateral security I got a three guinea lease of a house not finished at the time, 3, Florence Avenue—just before the promissory was due on 14th July, I wrote to Hakim to remind him that it was coming due on the 17th, and asked him to meet it—this is a copy of the letter; I sent it by post, and never had it back—on the 17th I sent another letter to him, and one to Cooper, stating the note had been presented, and was dishonoured by non-payment—I had sent many letters both to the prisoner and Cooper to that address, Josephine Avenue, and they never came back—I did not get a farthing on the judgment for £100 9s. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I obtained in May this year—I brought another action in reference to the other loan where Cooper's name alone was used—on the subsequent loan I declined to lend on Cooper's name, and got the prisoner's and the collateral security—I have been paid no money at all, only the interest when the notes were given.</p>

Cooper, of 2, Josephine Avenue—I have often seen the prisoner with him—I had a bill for £50, which I had accepted, falling due on 24th April, 1888, at the London and South-Western Bank head office—I was drawn into a brick business by a limited com<lb/>pany—Cooper had a number of bricks of me, for which he gave trade bills; other bills of even amounts were accommodation bills—I got Cooper's acceptance, not the prisoner's, for the debt for the bricks—those I suppose I should take to my bankers—all the bills for even money might be for Cooper's accommodation; there might be exceptions—when Cooper went bankrupt he owed me somewhere about £2,000, I daresay for bricks, I don't know the exact figures—to some extent I think that was covered by the bills, but they were useless as they had not been met—the prisoner guaranteed Cooper's debts—when the prisoner went bankrupt he owed me nearly the same amount—the £50 bill was for timber—it fell due on 24th April, and was lying at the London and South-Western Bank head office—I was responsible to Cooper for it, as I had accepted it; the prisoner had nothing to do with it—I don't know whose hand conveyed the money to the head office to meet it; it was not paid to me—I took the bill up afterwards—I was charged with it, and £50 went into the bank; for it I was credited with £50 on my general account, I should say—but for the £50 payment I should have been a creditor of Cooper for £2,050 instead of £2,000.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I gave the prisoner an acceptance about 25th April, 1888; as far as I recollect he asked me about that date to give him this acceptance for £250, and I did so on condition that he would pay the £50 to my account and give me the leases of certain property at Kingston for security, within three weeks—I gave him the acceptance, and it has been met and paid by me—I never had the leases—he would expect the £50 to be a credit to the £250, helping to meet it—£50 was paid in to my credit, I understand, by the prisoner—the acceptance was paid through the main office of the South-Western Bank, I think—I believe I gave it up with all my papers at the bankruptcy proceedings—I should think it was very probably a five months' acceptance—I believe</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188910210082"/>
               <p>after that the prisoner obtained another acceptance from me for £500 about May 17th; that was accepted and paid by me; that bill went into the bankruptcy, I believe, when I proved against one or other of the estates—I handed my solicitors, Messrs. Barnard and Co., of Lincoln's Inn Fields, all the acceptances I could find—I have no doubt the payments would appear in my pass-book—I saw nothing of Mr. Saw in this matter; I have no interest in the matter one way or the other, except that I am a loser in the interminable law proceedings—Mr. Gibbons, of Ludgate Hill, is an agent of mine, and he was so in April, 1888.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If it was an accommodation bill I should make it payable at my bank—besides the bills they met they still owed £2,000 on the balance—I don't remember these other bills: 24th January, £107; 24th August, £150; 6th May, £150—I cannot say how many bills were floating at the same time for Cooper's accommodation—Mr. Saw's name was never mentioned; he might have said what he wanted it for, I don't remember—I did not see Mr. Saw till a week or two before the trial in May, 1889—I think I was subpœnaed to prove the £50 which the prisoner handed to me—the £50 and the promise of the lease induced me to give the bill; I should not have given the bill on condition of the £50 only—the prisoner never brought the lease, I got no security at all—I have lost £200, the difference between £250 and £50.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Messrs. Morton, Cutler, and Co., solicitors to the Central Bank, Newgate Street—I have been subpœnaed both for the defence and the prosecution—I had conduct of the legal proceedings in reference to the two acceptances for £500 and £250 marked P and Q—they had been discounted by the Central Bank through the account of J. G. Cooper. (<hi rend="italic">The</hi> £500 <hi rend="italic">bill was dated</hi> 21<hi rend="italic">st of November</hi>, 1887, <hi rend="italic">and drawn at four months by Hakim, and accepted by Saw and Son. The</hi> £250 <hi rend="italic">bill was dated 24th October</hi>, 1887, <hi rend="italic">and was drawn at five months by Hakim, and accepted by Saw and Son.</hi>)—I issued a writ, dated 29th March, 1888, against Saw and Son, and Saw, jun., the acceptors of the two bills—after the writ had been served I saw both the prisoner and Mr. Saw, jun., on more than one occasion—the prisoner said neither Mr. Saw, jun., nor Saw and Son had ever had a penny piece of the money for the bills—I have heard reference to ground-rents—I under<lb/>stood the bills were given by Saw and Son for the accommodation of the prisoner until money was obtained by Mr. Saw or his firm upon mortgage of some property or other; what it was I don't remember—there was application for judgment under Order 14, and I obtained an order for judgment on the 8th April, 1888; whether it was by consent or not I cannot remember—there was a formal affidavit by Mr. Pitt on which</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188910210083"/>
               <p>judgment was obtained—the acceptor of a bill is primarily liable, and the practice is to sue him first—on my suing Saw, jun., the prisoner saw me several times with reference to the matter—my recollection is he was present when the order for judgment against Mr. Saw was made by the Master on 8th of April—subsequently the prisoner took up the £250 bill on 24th April, 1888, and then I was instructed not to proceed—judgment was not signed; I did not go on with the action after what the prisoner told me, because Cooper's account would come right, and we should not have to press Mr. Saw—he did not sign judgment with regard to the other acceptance—Mr. Saw was not asked by the bank, after we got this judgment, to pay—we sued on 6th April, on the £300 acceptance, by Mr. Saw, dated December, 1887, drawn by the prisoner, and endorsed Saw and Son and J. G. Cooper—that is a third bill; it has never been paid at the bank, as there was a reserve balance, and the prisoner said the bills were good, and if we allowed payment of this bill to stand over, the reserve balance would be sufficient to pay it, and that was so, with the exception of £20, or something like that—Mr. Saw paid £25 14s. 7d. with regard to the £300 bill; that was all we required to balance J. G. Cooper's account; there is nothing due to the bank on his account, so I am instructed—I knew when the action was proceeding of the guarantees by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have a note that Strapp's acceptance was taken up by the prisoner, and I have no doubt I was present then; I have a recollection of being present; how it was taken up I cannot say—Saw's £250 acceptance was taken up by replacing it with Strapp's—Saw's was given back to him and produced to-day—when we first started the action, and until the prisoner took up the acceptance, I threatened to go on with the order for judgment; whether I threatened bankruptcy proceedings in so many words I cannot say; I did my best to get the money—I put on pressure.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Bankruptcy proceedings were impossible till I had signed judgment—there could have been only a week during which I could threaten bankruptcy proceedings—I have no recollection of mentioning anything of the kind—I have no letter in my letter-book about it—I have no recollection of ever being employed in reference to three other bills in a great-coat pocket in the country—I never heard anything about them.</p>

On 8th August I saw the prisoner at Avenue Villa, Nutfield, Sussex—I said, "I am a police officer, and I have a warrant for your arrest"—I read the warrant; it was for wilful and corrupt perjury—he said, "What do you wish me do?"—I said, "Go with me "—he said, "Where?"—I said, "To the City "—he said, "What then?"—I said, "You must go to the police-station, where you will be detained for the night"—he said, "What about to-morrow?"—I said, "I shall have to take you to the Mansion House to-morrow "—he said, "Cannot you leave me here till to-morrow? you may take my word I will come"—I said, "No; I cannot"—he pressed me several times—I said, "I dare not do it, I should not be allowed to do it"—the house I found him in was J. G. Cooper's—I knocked and rang several times before I could get in—I was there eight or ten minutes perhaps from the time of my first knocking.</p>

I am the manager of the Central Bank, Newgate Street—I opened the branch about twelve years ago—I was manager at the time Mr. Cooper opened an account at the bank—I think we have had the account between two and three years—I think it was opened in 1886—with regard to the guarantees that were given by Hakim, he (Hakim) was simply a guarantor against the bills I discounted for Cooper—I understood the acceptances were trade bills—I made inquiries before discounting them—after the order for judgment of 18th Aprils I saw Mr. Saw and the prisoner with reference to taking up the bills—Mr. Saw strongly asked me not to press the matter—I said I should certainly instruct my solicitors to sign judgment and institute bankruptcy proceedings unless the money was paid, as I could not allow the matter to go on any longer—about 27th April the prisoner brought me a bill of Strapp's—before that he came and asked me if I would take £100, and give Saw, the man I was suing, credit for that amount—I did not think it was enough, as we had a lot of bills—I assumed he had the £100 somewhere about him—he said, "I have £100"—I refused to take it—I said unless the matter was settled I should instruct our solicitors to go on with the bankruptcy proceedings, as I should not allow the matter to go on any longer—Mr. Saw was not present; the order for judgment for £250 was relieved by this bill of Strapp's of 25th of April—I think the prisoner brought it to me and I discounted it for Cooper—I gave Mr. Saw credit for £250—I gave the bill for £250, on which we had got order for judgment, to the prisoner by Cooper's instructions, taking in substitution Strapp's bill—I discounted it on Strapp's bill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Strapp paid his bill on 28th September, 1888—I had a great many bills of Strapp's, all for even amounts, I think—I did not know they were accommodation bills—I should not have taken them if I had known they were; if every bill of an even amount was looked on as an accommodation bill we should do no business at all—I thought they were genuine business transactions—Cooper's account put right the yielding up of the £250 bill to Saw—the balance we held against Cooper's account when all the bills under discount were paid off paid the balance on Mr. Saw's bills—Mr. Saw paid the difference due to the bank—I don't know about the date—the bills had run off earlier than December—I should not receive anything paid in after his bankruptcy—the 27th April is the date of the last discount on behalf of Cooper's account—he became bankrupt in May—the account was not closed, and on the 27th April we had the bills in suspense—we charged £6 6s. 7d. for discounting Strapp's bill—as far as the current account was concerned the last transaction was on 27th April, but I kept the bills in suspense, that was a different account—I have not got another account of Cooper's—I had nothing to prove against his estate, because I had the £25 from Mr. Saw—I never had a copy of the prisoner's account—these twenty-seven cheques by Saw, jun., in favour of the prisoner, went through our bank credited to Cooper's account—when we got the order for judgment Mr. Saw told us the bills of £500, £250 and £300 were simply accommodation bills, for which he never had 6d.—I am not certain if the prisoner was present then—Mr. Bradley may have told me about it—I approved of Mr. Bradley's conduct as our</p>

B. Cooper was Cooper's account only—I have asked the prisoner to give a general guarantee of Cooper's account, and he has refused—all these guarantees produced are in respect of Cooper's customer's acceptances—everyone of Mr. Strapp's acceptances are now discharged and honoured, and they include his £250 acceptance, which replaced the dishonoured acceptance of Mr. Saw for the same amount.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a barge-owner, of 19, Ludgate Hill—about 20th or 25th April I had business transactions with Mr. Strapp; I was his agent in connection with my own business—I had become acquainted with the prisoner; and there had been transactions with Cooper which had been met and guaranteed through the prisoner's instrumentality—the prisoner called on me, and asked me if I would get him an acceptance for £250 from Mr. Strapp, as he had some liabilities at the bank which he must remove as speedily as possible to prevent Cooper and others being made bankrupt, Cooper then being very heavily indebted to Mr. Strapp—I said to Mr. Strapp, in trying to get the acceptance, that it possibly would save Cooper from bankruptcy—Strapp said he would do it on condition that he obtained from Cooper or the prisoner some leases which had been previously mentioned by the prisoner to Strapp, but I told the prisoner before I could do that I must ask him to pay me something on account of Cooper's indebtedness to me—that was about 22nd or 23rd April I think—I was then holding a dishonoured cheque of Cooper's, which I asked the prisoner to take up, and I also held a £20 cheque of Cooper's, which had not been presented at his request—the prisoner paid me £12 on one day and £20, I believe, on another; it was all within three or four days that he paid me those two sums, and then on 24th, I think, he received Mr. Strapp's acceptance—he also paid me £7 or £8, the difference, in all about £40—that was a payment by the prisoner to me in respect of matters of my own that I held as regards Cooper—he gave me, as Strapp's agent, £50 in bank notes on Strapp's behalf—I afterwards gave those notes to my office boy to pay into Mr. Strapp's account—after that Mr. Strapp sent me his acceptance of £250 by post, and I gave it to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This is the acceptance; I wrote it out—I had given an accommodation bill of £100 to Cooper to assist him in meeting bills which he had given to Strapp—in October, 1886, I gave accommodation bills to Cooper—I gave Cooper several acceptances to enable him to take up his own acceptances, which he had given me on account of goods sup<lb/>plied—I did not give the prisoner any acceptances; he was guaranteeing the bank, not me—I don't think I gave Cooper any so late as April, 1888—about April I considered Cooper a solvent man—I did not know that nothing had been paid in to his credit after 31<hi rend="italic">st</hi> March, 1888, till Strapp's bill—Strapp is £2,000 to the bad for goods supplied to Cooper through me or to my knowledge—I knew Cooper was building houses at Clapham Common, because I visited him—the goods that partially represented Cooper's loss were sent there to put into the houses—I don't</p>

               <p>remember sending any to Sutton or by rail—the promise made by the prisoner about bringing the leases was made to me, and I think to Strapp as well, before the bill was obtained—he did not fulfil the promise—I understood from the prisoner there was some difficulty in getting them from Mr. Saw; they were never delivered over—I have ceased to be Strapp's agent; I am not sure whether the prisoner or Cooper have paid Strapp anything since—I don't know how the account went on—the prisoner pressed for the £250 bill, because of saving Cooper and others from bankruptcy, and if Cooper went into bankruptcy there would be no chance of Strapp getting his money; in fact, he told me he was going straight to the bank to deposit it—I knew nothing of Cooper's account—the prisoner did not tell me that before paying Mr. Saw's acceptance for £250 there was £360 to his credit, and that after paying it there was still left a balance in Cooper's favour—I thought by keeping Cooper on foot a little longer his debt might be diminished—I only took the £50 in notes from the prisoner and paid it into the bank—I took £50 for Strapp and £40 for myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lieutenant and quartermaster in the Army Service Corps, Hounslow—Johnson has been in the army for a number of years, and in September last he was warrant officer, and was called "Conductor Johnson"—Scott has also been in the army some years, and is a sergeant in the same corps—part of Johnson's duty was to assist</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188910210087"/>
               <p>me, and Scott assisted both—coals would be delivered for the regiment at the barracks in the ordinary way by the contractors, the requisition being sent to me by the officer, initialed by Johnson, which he would hand to Scott, who would issue the coal to the representative of the regiment—the requisition would be receipted at the back and retained by Scott, and handed in to me as part of his account—the coal is issued in boxes containing 80 lb., and is accounted for by Scott, who hands me the money—neither he nor Johnson had any right to deal with the coal—on 27th September Scott came to the office, and said there would not be sufficient coal for that day's issue, and that about five tons would be sufficient—I said I would arrange it; but we were expecting to have a delivery by the proper contractor during that morning—I sent this order to Mr. Funge, a coal merchant of Hounslow, for five tons—in the course of the day I received a communication from him, in consequence of which I saw his two carmen at his office, and communicated the result to the colonel, by whose order I went to the Horse Guards the same day—before that I totalled up Scott's receipts and issue of coal, and asked him how much, surplus coal he had, his book showing about ten tons—I told him I thought there should have been a little more surplus, but that as I was in a hurry he had better go over my figures again—when I was in the yard afterwards I said, "Scott, where were the five tons of coal put?"—I saw a heap there, and said, "What is this heap?"—he said, "The first lot of coals that came in; the two tons"—I said, "Where were the other three placed?"—he said, "Down by the side of it"—on my return from the Horse Guards I met the prisoners near my house—Scott was in uniform, and Johnson in plain clothes—I said to Johnson, "What is the matter? do you want me?"—he replied, "You know what it is; it is a bad business about the coal"—I said, "I don't understand you; what do you mean?"—he said, "Yes, you do, you know you saw the Colonel this morning, and have been to London "—I said, "How do you know that?" and he replied, "From your manner in the morning I knew that you knew it; I wish you had spoken to me about it then, and I would have asked you to let me see Mr. Funge"—I said, "I am very sorry "—he said, "I shall never get over this disgrace; what are my wife and family to do? I hope it has not gone too far "—I said, "I am going to take the Colonel's instructions, and you will hear later on"—I then called Scott up, who was standing near, and said, "I am not going to ask you any questions, and I don't wish you to tell me anything, but I shall place you under arrest for stealing three tons of coal"—he said, "Let me see Mr. Funge, as I may be able to square it; but I cannot do so if I am in arrest"—I asked him how he thought he could do that; he said, "I might get him to take the person's receipts "—I said, "I cannot allow that," and I ordered Conductor Johnson to take him to barracks—the following day Johnson was placed under arrest, and on the 29th Scott handed in his books and accounts—I said to him, "You know your crime; is there anything you want?"—he said, "I did not steal the coal," and I said that did not agree with what he told me the day previously—Johnson would sign the receipt on delivery of the coal at the barracks—by order of the Colonel I signed the charge-sheet, charging Smith with receiving the coal.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GEOGHEGAN</hi>. Five tons of coal were ordered, and sent in three deliveries—two tons by the first delivery, safely received,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188910210088"/>
               <p>and two separate deliveries of a ton and a half each, I believe—Johnson's duties are more clerical than military—the coal-yard opens on the main road—Johnson is in my office, which is at the back of the stabling—between my office and the coal-yard there is a drying-ground and the married soldiers' quarters and infant school—the coal-yard is 100 to 150 yards from the office—Johnson is entitled to wear plain clothes, and would come to the office about 9 a. m.—it is Johnson's and Scott's duty to be present in the barrack-yard when the coal is shot—when I went to London I saw Colonel Clark—I reported the matter to Colonel Tucker, the commandant of the troops in the barracks—Johnson has been in the Army twenty-seven years—he wears a medal with two clasps, showing he has been under fire twice, also a star and long service medal—I had been in the barracks six weeks when this occurred, having just relieved Major Parkin—this was the first delivery of coals made by Funge at the barracks, to my knowledge—Johnson is entitled to a pension of 4s. or 4s. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day—the military authorities determined to deal with Johnson and Scott—Johnson's dinner-hour is between one and two.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. Scott spoke to me about the coal some time on the morning of the 25th, and the next day he came to me, and said the contractors had not sent the coal—the strike was all over then—I gave the contractor till eleven, and wrote telling him I would wait till eleven; I waited till 11. 30—there are about 1,000 soldiers in the barracks—the Lancers drew 7 1/2 tons on the 27th—Scott kept the books—after the other coal came in there would be about 5 tons in stock after the Lancers had their 7 1/2 tons on Thursday, instead of which there was under 3 tons—Scott must be present at the delivery of coal, and accept it as through Johnson—I was to go and report the matter in London, and go back to Colonel Tucker—I took Scott into custody on my own authority before going to the Colonel, and after coming back from London—that was the 28th September—Johnson and Scott were taken by military escort to Brentford on 9th October—they were under subpœna to give evidence—as soon as they were taken into civil custody the papers, I believe, were withdrawn from the Horse Guards, and no further steps taken—when Scott had the opportunity he said he had not stolen the coal—he has been nine years in the service, and is a long service man, and of excellent character.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was among seven or eight or nine men at the station—they were not like working men—not one of them was like the prisoner in face—some had beards; some had no hair on their faces—I examined them all rather closely to make sure—none had a moustache like this man, I think—before I came to him my impression was that he was not there—I had never seen him before—he seemed to spring out, and almost immediately afterwards he snatched at my watch and ran away—the whole thing did not take quite a minute; he stood before me half a second—I only saw him for about a minute—he was dressed in shabby dark clothes at the time—I think he was dressed in</p>

                  </hi>. I am unmarried, and live at 86, Lordship Park—on the afternoon of 25th September I was coming through the passage by Stoke Newington Church—as I came to the Church Street end of the passage I saw four men sitting just outside the gate in Church Street, two on each side—the prisoner was one of the men on the right hand—there is no gate—there is an arch with an upright bar in the middle, from the ground to the top—all the men made a move as though they were going to stop me, and they hesitated, and sat down again—then a fair man said to the prisoner, "Now," and gave him a nudge with the elbow—the prisoner looked me up and down quickly and said, "There is no go there "I went to a shop in Church Street, and did my business there—when I came back I went towards the passage to come back the same way—the men had all gone except the prisoner and the fair man—I saw Miss Crowe coming along on the same side as the prisoner and the fair man—as I was crossing over the road towards the gateway, the prisoner got up from where he was sitting, pulled his hat well over his forehead, put his hands into his pockets, walked leisurely towards the end of the kerbstone, looked hastily up and down Church Street (I was going through the gate then), and walked back again to the fair man, who said, "Go on quick"—I stood to see what they were going to do—while I was hesitating, afraid to go through, the prisoner crossed by the gateway and went up to Miss Crowe—as his back was towards me I did not see what he did—he was only apparently speaking to her—he came back, but before he could get through the gate Miss Crowe had called "Stop thief!"—I was standing just inside the churchyard—the prisoner ran by me, I ran after him through the churchyard; the fair man came after me with his fists up in this way, and got me up in a corner in a threatening attitude—the prisoner got through into the mews at the other end—on the Saturday I went to the Police-court, where I picked out the prisoner from a number of other men; he is the man—he was not dressed exactly as he is now—my watch-chain was not showing, it was in my jacket.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The fair man did not hold me; he came to me in a threatening attitude, and at that moment six gentlemenly men came at the other end and surrounded me, and all laughed—they did not hurt me; it was no use my calling out—I had never seen the prisoner before the 25th; I identified him on the following Saturday, the 28th—Miss Crowe was not in the room at the same time—I went in first; there looked nine or ten men; some looked like poor and some were gentlemenly men—I did not take particular notice of their clothes; I looked at their faces—on the following Monday I saw the prisoner at the Police-court—he was dressed on the 25th precisely as he is now; he had a longish overcoat on, with pockets—I noticed the other men in the station; I did not notice if they had overcoats on—I went by their faces; I cannot remember if any of the men had similar faces—no other man was clean shaved with a moustache, like the prisoner—he is the man—I looked at all the men—they were men of every description—I did not say at once he was the man—I looked round the room before I identified the pri<lb/>soner</p>

I am a partner in the firm of Lewin, Vavacour and Co., cabinetmakers, Tottenham Court Road—on 6th January I was at Mr. Jacobson's in Torrington Square—the prisoner was there—he was a perfect stranger to me—I went there by chance—Mr. Jacobson introduced him to him as a young man of good position, who he had known many years; that he had taken a public-house, and had paid £680 into the hands of Mr. Fowler, of Chancery Lane; that he was going into the house on the following Tuesday; that he had also purchased a house last week, and it had made him rather short, and he wanted to borrow some money for little necessaries on going into it, as he did not want to apply to his friends; and he said, "You have got a little money, I think?"—I said, "I don't care much about this sort of thing "—I made an appointment with the prisoner for next morning, when he came with Mr. Jacobson—I questioned him about his position—he told me he was about to be married—it was mentioned that he wanted about £100—he proposed that

               <p>he should have £80, and give me bills for £100—he repeated what he had said the night before—I had known Mr. Jacobson many years; the prisoner said, "I am going to be married, and it is not likely I should go back in the next six months"—I gave him a cheque for £80, and he gave me three bills of exchange for £33 6s. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., payable at one, two, and three months—the first was payable that day month, the 18th June; this is it—I had no security—when it became due it was dishonoured—the cheque was cashed—he said he was shifting his account to the Notting Hill Bank for convenience, as he was going to take a house in Portobello Road.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Jacobson has only introduced me to one person before to lend money—I am a furniture broker; I do a little money lending occasionally—Mr. Jacobson did not come to me and say he had a young man who wanted to borrow money; it was accidental—he said that he had known the young man many years, and his family, and he was a most respectable young man—I said at the Police-court that Mr. Jacobson said everything, and the prisoner was standing by—he joined in general conversation—I also said I believed what Mr. Jacobson told me—I did not go into the percentage—he was to purchase furniture afterwards on the hire system—my firm got the money, but the purchase was never completed—I did not tell the Magistrate that I saw the prisoner give Mr. Jacobson £10 when I advanced the money; I did not know it then, but it oozed out—I did not say that Mr. Jacobson gave him a cheque for £69 and a sovereign.</p>

On 11th September, about 10. 30 a. m., I was at the principal entrance of the London Docks; a number of people were collected, and Mead pointed out Newman in the crowd, and made a complaint against him, and gave me Best's name as a witness—I found out Best later in the day, who also pointed out Newman, and told me what he had seen—I afterwards took Newman, and told him it was for violently assaulting Mead on the previous Saturday night—he said, "Me, sir! I know nothing about it, ask the man?" pointing to Mead—he was taken to Leman Street Station, and the charge read over to him—he said he knew nothing about it, and asked me to get some witnesses for him, giving me their names and addresses, which I took down and gave to Collins to make inquiries about them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 85, Barking Road—about four on Sunday, 22nd September, I was called to Tomlinson's house; he was in bed, bleeding from the nose—he had a cut at the top of his head, and about three inches below it was a large blood tumour, caused either by a fall or a violent blow with a blunt instrument—there were some bruises on his face—he lingered on till the 24th, and then died—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> by direction of the coroner—I found bruises on both eyes, the left cheek, and upper lip; the brain showed both rupture and concussion; there was no fracture of the skull—the injuries were such as would be caused by merely falling on asphalte—a violent fall alone would be likely to cause concussion—assuming a blow in the mouth, which knocked him backwards, I should expect such results as I found.</p>

I live at the Horn of Plenty—I have known Mrs. Cruse for years—in consequence of a communication from Mrs. Cruse, I went to the White Hart, Woodford, on Tuesday, 3rd September—I made out this bill for the prisoner—at eight o'clock the same evening, before the bill was given to him, he told me he was in the firm of Gourley and Watson, shipowners, and that he had a share of £16,000 in the new ship <hi rend="italic">Florence;</hi> that his father allowed him an income, and that he had an estate in Surrey—Mrs. Cruse handed the bill to him, and then I came in; he told me he was awkwarkly placed, that he had no money, and that he could not settle the bill, but he would go and get change for a cheque—he left the house about nine o'clock and returned about ten minutes past eleven—he stood on the threshold; Mrs. Cruse was at the door—I asked him if he intended paying his bill—he said, "Who are you? I am a gentleman, and have the money," patting his coat pocket," and you cannot take it from me"—I said, "I am not a highwayman, and shall not try"—Mrs. Cruse said if he was a honest man and told her exactly his position she should not be hard with him, but allow him to stay there that night, not turn him out like a dog—he said, "You don't know me; I am a gentleman, and I shan't pay"—he went away.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "I was called across the road by <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> Simpson; he said there was some one drunk there; I was with Alfred Lane; we had some more drink; I left Lane on the other side."</p>

I am a hairdresser, of 18, Newington Crescent, Newington Butts—at twenty-five minutes past twelve, on the night of the 9th and morning of the 10th September, I was walking along Newington Butts with Annie Kent, when the prisoner, who was walking in the same direction, came in front of us, then allowed us to pass him, and then he walked by again, and as he did so he snatched my silk handkerchief, worth about 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and ran down Horse and Groom Passage with it—I ran after him, and Kent followed me—we got into Horse and Groom Passage, which is a blind alley, before he turned; then he ran back—Kent stood with outstretched arms—he pushed her in the chest, and knocked her over—I continued to chase him, and as I was near the top of the alley another man bumped into me—I had a coat on like Butler's, who was a witness at the Police-court, and was about his height—I did not notice his features—I still followed—the prisoner ran through a urinal—as he went to go through the constable made a grab at him, but the prisoner went through the urinal and came out on the other side of the road, almost by Lower Kennington Lane, where there is a little joiner's shop—the prisoner fell down there on his stomach, and the policeman took him—when he stood up my handkerchief was at his feet on the ground—this is my handkerchief; it is red—I did not see the prisoner's handkerchief before I got to the station—when they picked him off the ground at Lower Kennington Lane, I said I would charge him with stealing my handkerchief—he then pulled his tie off and broke it, and said, "Why, I charge him with stealing my gold pin"—I saw the pin in his tie when he did that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had been to the Canterbury Music Hall with Miss Kent and three others—this was twenty-five minutes past twelve—we went to the Old Dover Castle opposite after leaving the music hall—I had two glasses of stout—I can't say what time the hall closes—I have been there lots of times, and I always stay to the end; it closes at eleven as a rule; I have no reason to suppose it was later on this night—from the public-house we all five walked down to the Elephant—I was not in the public-house half an hour, I don't know how long it was—I daresay it would take twenty-five minutes to walk from the Dover Castle to the Elephant—all I did after leaving the music hall was to go to the public-house and then walk to this place—I never saw a young woman with the prisoner—Lizzie Abbey was a witness at the Police-court, and came to the station the night the prisoner was charged—the first time I saw her that night was when she came to the station—Butler did not come to the station but to the Police-court; that was the first time I saw him, to the best of my belief—I saw Mr. Cheverton at the station, not before, I swear—when my attention was first attracted to the prisoner he was the only one I saw at the time to the best of my belief, I never saw anyone with him—I was taking notice of Kent, and not of anyone else—it is not the fact that I was walking along with my young woman, the prisoner with his, and Butler with his, and that we were all together having a wrangle, and that I and the prisoner commenced wrestling—that is not true; there was no wrangling—I did not take off my handkerchief and pull him down with it—I never had the prisoner in my grasp—Horse and Groom Passage is longer than this Court—I followed the prisoner—Kent followed me to the best of my belief—when the prisoner got to the bottom he turned and came back and I tried to stop him, but he eluded my grasp, dived under my arm—I was running up the court after him when he knocked Kent down—when the constable had him and I came up, my young woman charged him with assault—I did not charge him with assault, because he did not touch me; very likely I charged him with assaulting her—I first charged him with stealing my handkerchief—I don't think I charged him at all with assaulting her, I told her to charge him—she did so—I solemnly say I did not charge him with the assault on her—I said I would charge him with stealing the handkerchief—the constable did not say I should summon him—if anyone says they heard him say so, that is untrue—I saw my handkerchief on the ground when I came up to the constable and prisoner—I said, "That is my handkerchief"—the constable said, "Will you give him in charge for stealing it?"—before the constable asked me, I said I would charge him with stealing it—I was excited and out of breath—the constable was not excited to my knowledge—it is impossible that my excitement may interfere with my correct recollection of what took place—when the constable asked me if I would charge him with stealing it, I said I would—the prisoner said, "I never stole his handkerchief," but not directly, we picked him off the ground and then he said it—Butler never said, "You know he did not steal the handkerchief"—the prisoner was crossing the road when I got to the top of the court—after he went through the urinal, I saw him fall flat on his stomach with his arms outstretched—I am twenty-three or twenty-two years old—I am in business as a hairdresser at 4, Newland Terrace, Kensington—I have not been there very long—before that I was in the Post Office as an auxiliary</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 184, Ladbroke Grove Road, Kensington—on this night I was walking with Bridger in Newington Butts—he was perfectly sober—we had come from the Canterbury, and had been in one public-house after leaving it—he had had two glasses of stout, and I had had one; that was all we had had—the prisoner passed us, then we passed him—he snatched the handkerchief off the back of Bridger's neck and ran down the Horse and Groom passage—Bridger ran after him and I after Bridger down this court—the prisoner turned to come back, as the court has no thoroughfare—I tried to stop him by holding out my arms, and he knocked me with his fist on my chest and knocked me down—I don't think he hurt me—when I got up I fancied I saw another young fellow at the top of the court—he had a light coat on—the next thing I saw of the prisoner was that he was in custody in Kennington Lane—he said Mr. Bridger wanted to steal his gold pin—I charged him with assaulting me—I saw him searched at the Policestation, and a brown handkerchief taken from his pocket—I did not see Butler that night, but I saw him at the Police-court next day—he resembles the man I thought I saw in the court—I think he is the same man; I am not sure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I met this other man after I picked myself up, and was coming up the court—Bridger then came down the court from the street end to fetch me—he saw me knocked down, because he was after the prisoner—when I was knocked down Bridger was between me and the blind end of the court—he ran past me, and came back to help me—I was already up when he came—he helped me across the road; I think I took his arm; I daresay I was able to cross the road by myself—we walked across the road, and found the prisoner in custody—he was up then—I think several people were there—Bridger first said he would charge him with stealing his handkerchief—I think he said that before he said he would charge him with assaulting me—if someone said he first charged him with assaulting me, I should not swear that was untrue, but I think it was the other way—the constable asked if he would charge him with stealing—Bridger said that was his scarf; he recognised it—when he recognised it the constable said, "Will you charge him with stealing it?" and then he said, "Yes, I will"—there was nobody about before I was knocked down—there was no wrangling whatever—I saw nobody else but Bridger, the prisoner, and myself—I could have seen them if there had been—I will swear no one else was round as far</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188910210135"/>
               <p>as my recollection goes—I am speaking of the Horse and Groom passage—there was no dispute between Bridger and the prisoner—the first time I saw Butler was when he was at the entrance to the court after I picked myself up—I did not notice him among the people when I and Bridger came up to the constable and the prisoner—I don't remember Butler or anyone saying to Bridger, "You know he did not steal your handkerchief"—there were not many people about—I cannot tell you if the few there seemed excited—I went to the policestation; Butler did not come there—I saw Cheverton there, and heard him dissent from the constable's evidence—I heard the inspector speaking to Cheverton.</p>

At 12. 30 on the night of 9th September I was standing in the shadow of the urinal at the corner of Newington Butts, almost opposite, but to the left of the entrance to Horse and Groom Court—I heard a cry of "Stop him"—I saw the prisoner running towards me from the direction of Horse and Groom Court, and Bridger two or three yards behind him—I seized him by the arm and caught his coat, but he snatched it away from me and ran through the urinal without stopping—I spoke to Bridger—the prisoner came out on the Kennington Lane side of the urinal and ran across the road, and fell exactly opposite the Horse and Groom public-house—I saw him take this red handkerchief (which Bridger has identified) out of his left hand coat pocket and leave it on the ground—he then turned round and snatched his tie off and accused Bridger of stealing his pin—he said, "I will charge that man with attempting to steal my pin "—when he took his tie off a pin was in it—his tie was in his hand at the time—Bridger charged him with stealing his handkerchief, and a young lady also charged him with assaulting her by knocking her down—I searched the prisoner at the station, and took from his pocket this brown handkerchief—the necktie he snatched off he was wearing at the Police-station and afterwards.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw nothing of this brown scarf till the prisoner was searched at the station—I was at the opening of the urinal nearest Horse and Groom Court when I first saw the prisoner—he slipped and fell on the kerb upon his face with his hands outstretched—immediately he did so he brought one hand back—it was raining very fast at that moment—soon after Bridger and Kent came up—they did not come up together—Bridger came first; he did not say then that he would charge the prisoner with assaulting his young woman—he said he would give him in charge for stealing—he said he would charge him with assaulting the young woman when he came back from fetching her—he went back to fetch her; she was across the road—it is not true that they came up together—he first said he would charge him with taking this—I did not say, "You had better summon him, "or anything about summoning him—I did not see a handkerchief like this red one lying on the prisoner's shoulder—I will say there was not such a thing—Bridger saw it on the ground and said, "That is mine"—I then said, "Will you charge him with stealing it?" and he said "Yes, I will"—the prisoner said, "I did not steal his handkerchief, he stole or tried to steal my scarf-pin," something like that—I saw Cheverton at the station very soon after I got there—I don't know if he accompanied the prisoner when I took him into custody—I saw Miss Abbey also—Cheverton heard me give my evidence to the inspector—he said that was not a true account of what</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 5, Vassal Road, Brixton, and manage the Cleveland Farmers' Dairy Company, Limited, Brixton branch—on 9th September I had been to France's auction-room, and was walking home on the left-hand side of Newington Butts, going towards Brixton—when approaching the Horse and Groom public-house I saw Bridger and the prisoner quarrelling—I thought they were quarrelling about the young woman; I could not hear—I saw Abbey there—I did not look at them above two minutes when I saw Bridger take a handkerchief or a comforter from him and throw it round the prisoner's neck like a noose—it was dark at half-past twelve, and I cannot swear to the handkerchief; I thought at the Police-court it was this brown one; I believe it was one of these—the prisoner then threw Bridger to the ground—Bridger caught hold of the prisoner's coat, and pulled him down on his knees—the prisoner released his grasp, and got away—when he got up he looked round; some people were coming towards them, and the prisoner ran across the road towards Kennington Lane—I saw the two men from the moment the quarrelling first attracted my attention till the prisoner ran across the road—the prisoner ran down no passage or lane; he only ran across the open road; I swear that—he was caught very soon after he got to the other side by a constable, Snow, I believe, but I could not swear to him, I took no notice of him—I think Bridger and I got up to the prisoner and constable about the same time—Bridger said he would give the prisoner into custody for assaulting his young woman; that he had knocked his young woman down; that was the first charge he made—I did not see his young woman knocked about—when he said that, the young woman came up by the side of him—the constable said, "You had better take his name and address and summons him "—the prosecutor said, "He has got my handkerchief," pointing to a handkerchief hanging on the prisoner's shoulders, and partly, I should think, in the breast pocket—I should think it had not hung there above three minutes—I think the one on his shoulder was the one I saw Bridger throw there, but I could not swear to it—the constable said, "Will you give him in charge for stealing it?" the prosecutor said, "Yes, I will—the prisoner said, "I never stole his handkerchief; he is after my gold scarf pin; look," and he showed his gold pin to the constable—I could not say where his scarf was—I did not know the people—I only felt for the man to be charged with the theft when he had not done it—I never saw either of the men before that night—the prisoner was taken to the station and I went too—the handkerchief got to the station, the constable said he found it in the prisoner's pocket—I said how did he know it was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188910210138"/>
               <p>there before the prisoner was searched; and he said I was drunk or mad or something—I was not excited—the inspector at the station said I could say what I had to say next morning—I did not go to the Police-court next day because my wife was called to a sick relation, and forgot to shut the door, and left the gas burning, and when I got home at half-past twelve I found a constable watching the place—afterwards the prisoner's friends begged of me to come and say what I could, and I came although at great inconvenience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I swore at the Police-court that Bridger took off his scarf and put it round the prisoner's neck, and pulled it tight; it looked to me like it—I said the scarf he took off was the colour of the curtains behind the Magistrate—I believe these are the two scarves I saw at the Police-court—I think I said I thought he was wearing the brown scarf—that was found in the prisoner's pocket; I suppose being dark I made a mistake—the prisoner ran away—I will swear he did not run down Horse and Groom Court while I was looking at him; not within a quarter of an hour, I did not see him—I did not lose sight of him from the time I saw him wrestling till the constable had hold of him—he did not go in the urinal at the time of this occurrence—I was asked at the Police-court to pick out the constable who took the prisoner into custody, and I could not identify him—I picked out another constable, who was in bed in another part of London at the time—I was not positive—it was eleven days afterwards—I said I was not sure—I believe I cannot pick out the constable or the handkerchief, but I can tell you about the occurrence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I said, "I think he is the constable"—if I did not say so I should have done, because I could not be certain.</p>
