               <p> I am a pawnbroker, in Portpool-lane: On Monday last, between twelve and one O'clock, the prisoner at the bar came to my shop, with a clock, and asked me to lend him five guineas upon it; it was an eight-day table clock; he then laid down the duplicate of a coat, which I had in pledge for 8s. 6d. and desired to redeem that; I interrogated him whose clock it was; he said, it was his own; that that was his name on the dial plate, Mr. Johnson; I knew Mr. Johnson's house very well, and knew that he was a very respectable man; I asked him where he lived; he said, No. 22, Great Warner-street; I asked him if he kept a house; he said, no, he was in lodgings; I asked him if he was a single man; he said, he was a married man, but had no family; I told him I knew Mr. Johnson very well, and supposed he could have no objection to my sending for Mr. Johnson, and asking him if he had sold the clock at any time. The coat was pledged in the name of Johnson, he said it was his own; I asked him what he gave for it, he made me rather an evasive answer, and said, The clock was worth 201. I called my lad on one side, and desired him to go to the Police-office in Hatton-garden, and bring an officer. I asked him some more questions; he said, he had the clock to clean of Mr. Macklin, No. 22, Berkley-street; he said, he had sold it to Mr. Macklin, and bought it again of him second-hand, this was during the boys absence; however, I judged that the prisoner conjectured where I had sent the lad, and he immediately went out of my shop; I had the clock; I then opened a private door, pursued him and took him; I brought him back to the shop where he remained, till the officer came, who conveyed him to the office; when he was at the Magistrates, he confessed that he had it from Mr. Downing's servant, and endeavoured to prejudice Mr. Downing's servant, by saying, he had been drinking with him, and that he had given him orders to come for it.(The clerk produced in Court).</p>

               <p>This clock is my property; I did not miss it till I saw it at the public-office; I saw it on the Monday morning when I came down stairs to breakfast.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you given any one directions to take it away, for the purpose of cleaning? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you ever see him before? - A. I think he was a person that had been at work in my house, but I am not certain; I asked him the question, and he denied it.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the value of the clock? - A. I gave nine guineas for it; I thought I had seen him before; I sent to the principal workman that I had, and they told me it was not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you ever give the prisoner any directions to take it down to clean it? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. What particular species of clock is it? - A. An eight-day table-clock.</p>
               <p>(To Edwards). Look at that clock. - A. It has never been out of my possession since he brought it to my house.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Smith). Is that the clock you delivered to the prisoner? - A. That is the clock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was taking a pint of porter in Hatton-garden, there was a servant-man there; I told him I was not capital at new work, I used in the country to clean old work; I thought it was Mr. Downing's servant; and he told me of a place where a clock was to be cleaned; I went to the house, and I did not see the man; I thought Mr. Downing had two servants, and I asked for the clock to clean, the young man gave it to me immediately; I meant to have brought the clock back, but I was distressed at the time.(The Prosecutor recommended him to his Majesty's mercy).</p>

A young man, of the name of Lumley, pursued him, and took him, he was brought back directly; he was the least among them. I did not see his face till he was brought back; I watched him more particular than the rest, because he had a black coat on; I saw him before I went into the house for a stick; he stood right facing a doctor's shop, that I could very well perceive him, where there were three lights in the shop-window.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your sixing on her, she was taken into custody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at the prisoner? - A. That is her; she said it was a pity a red bugger should ever wear a watch, the sailors ought to have them.</p>

               <p>I am a constable, I took the prisoner; the watch was not found upon her. The prosecutor came to me, on Tuesday morning, the 16th of December, to Bow-street, to go and take a woman who had robbed him; he took me to No.7, Parker's-lane, and the woman had left the lodging and gone away; I asked him where he was to be found if I found the girl? and he gave me a direction. On Sunday week last I found her, and sent for him; I first took him to a house in King-street, Drury-lane, she was not there; I then went with him to a house in Cross-lane, she lived in the first-floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you aware this was the woman before you carried him there? - A. Yes; the second house we went into we found her; there were three of them sitting at breakfast; the soldier went in and pointed her out as the person; I searched her, there was no duplicate, or any thing, found upon her; she said, how do you think I could rob you? I might as well have taken your guinea and half as the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. She said he had a guinea and half in his pocket? - A. Yes; she said, it was some other girl that robbed him, it was not her; she said he was drunk.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Birch.) What money had you in your pocket when you were with this woman? - A. A guinea and a half, and five shillings in silver, and five pennyworth of halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the know you had the money? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in liquor, or sober? - A. I was sober enough; I had only had two pots of beer with them.</p>
               <p>Q. You had some gin? - A. Yes; the sixpenny-worth she went for.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Why did not you lay hold of the woman when she robbed you? - A. I got hold of the watch, she got off; I went back to the table for the candle, not knowing the room, and fell down stairs.</p>
               <p> - MUMFORD sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable: I was with Treadway when he took the prisoner; she said, she might as well have taken the guinea and a half as the watch; that he had no business with a watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. As I was going down Drury-lane, with another young woman, this man stood at the White Horse; he asked us to go in and drink; we had several pots of beer, and rum and gin; I told the young woman, I must go; she said, she could get him a lodging, and I went away, I was afterwards coming back, and saw the prisoner lying in the street, and a crowd about him; he said, he had lost his watch; there was a soldier with him; they took a guinea and a half out of his pocket, and took him to the watch-house; I know nothing of his watch; he he came to me several times, and said, he would give me a guinea and a half if I would find his watch.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutor.) Were you lying in the street? - A. Yes; it was with falling down stairs; I did not lay above a minute; the watchman took me to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Why were you carried to the watch-house? - A. To take care of me; the watchman said, I might as well go there, and pay a shilling for my bed, as lay any where else; I went and lay there, and paid a shilling for a bed.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Const. Q. Were you, on the 23d of December, at Wills's coffee-house? - A. I was; I come every day, at twelve o'clock, generally, and stay till Change is over; I go on the Change, but don't leave there till past four; I was there on that day, about half past two o'clock, and heard several gentlemen talking, especially Mr. Young, a sail-maker; I observed, round the corner, four or five people standing, when I was speaking to Mr. Young.</p>
               <p>Don't tell us what you said to Mr. Young - A. I went out of the coffee-house, with that gentleman, directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any thing of these persons? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoners there? - A. Yes;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170011"/>the prisoner Wakeman particularly; I cannot say particularly as to the other; I am almost sure of Wakeman; I used to come to Bow-street, constantly, and sit with the Magistrate, when I had nothing to do, and have seen him there, and in the street, frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. As to Wakeman you know him? - A. I saw his face that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure as to his person? - A. Yes, I am; as to the other I cannot be positive, because they stood with their backs turned, at the corner, and I could not be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any belief on the subject? - A. I do believe he was one, but I will not be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. As to Wakeman, you have seen him at Bow-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where have you seen the other? - A. In the street; I have seen him frequently in the street, but cannot say particularly as to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know any thing till you returned, and then you heard it from other persons? - A. I know nothing else about it.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw them after they were taken up? - A. Yes; the next day, I believe, I am not positive; I saw them at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. And there you gave the same account you have given here? - A. Yes; I observed them at Wills's coffee-house, for a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. As to Dew, you never saw his face upon that occasion, only his back? - A. No; and I am not positive it was his back.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the only thing you can form a belief upon? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The room was very full at Bow-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And a lane was made for you to come and see them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So that they were the only two objects you had to look at? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that, were you not told by some of the officers, that these were the people who were charged with the robbery? - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw them under the report that they were the persons who had done this? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You take upon yourself now to be positive to Wakeman? - A. I had seen his face; I am positive to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, what is your name? - A. Augustus David Whiskey.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always gone by that name? - A. Yes, always; I have been sixteen years in this country, and was never known by any other name.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been in prison in Poland? - A. I have been prisoner in Russia.</p>
               <p>Q. I mean a prisoner in Poland? - A. No; no such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q.That you are sure of? - A. Yes; I was with the confederates; and I can bring proofs from the King of Prussia, and Duke of Brunswick, that I was a gentleman bred and born.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you never in prison, under a charge of a conspiracy to assassinate the King of Poland? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. That is certainly very improper; we always pity counsel when they have such instructions.</p>
               <p>Jury. It is certainly very foreign to the subject.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you go by the name of Count Whiskey? - A. I believe I am entitled, as well as any one; but I always go by the name of Mr. Whiskey; I never go by any such title, though I may have that title by people that know me.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this; was it short of five days before you saw these people? - A. I do not know indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know whether you went to Bow-street the next day after this matter happened? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. It was five days after they were taken up before you saw them? - A. I do not know whether it was or not.</p>

Yes; I saw several people looking on; but I did not suspect any body; I put it in my left coat pocket; when I came out of the coffee-house, I crossed the street over from the Royal Exchange, to the opposite side of Cornhill, over the way, till I came to between Tom's and the Rainbow coffee-houses; there I was hustled by a number of people, four or five, or more; it was a little before three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say there were at least five? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe, as well as you can, the manner in which you were hustled? - A. I went along in a regular way, as all other people walk in the street, till I had passed the door of Tom's coffee-house, then I was hustled at once, in the midst of a great crowd of people.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any crowd before to interrupt your passage? - A. No, not all the way; then one of them gave me a very hard push, at the right hand side, and said, let us pass by, make a little room, if you can, to pass by; I looked round, to see what the matter could be; I thought it might be a horse or a cart; and I supposed it must be a pick pocket business, as several such things I had read in the news-papers; I clapped my hand upon my pocket, and immediately missed my book.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the people were about you, had you an opportunity of seeing the countenances of the people about you? - A. Yes; I turned myself round immediately, to see who they were, and this man that gave me a push was, I suppose, a couple of yards from me out of sight; the other people ran in order to stop him; but he was instantly out of sight; whether he went into a shop, or down Birchin-lane, I cannot tell; I turned round to see if I could lay hold of any, and they were all gone.</p>
               <p>Q. During all that time had you seen the faces of the people, so as to enable you to speak to them again, as to make you believe you should be able to speak to them? - A. He that struck me on the arm, I could almost draw his picture, I was so certain of him; I went instantly and crossed over, facing the Exchange, to a correspondent, to whom I related the story; and soon after, I met with another, while I was talking to one Mr. Stevens, a brother to the banker, and told him I had been robbed, because I saw him at Wills's coffee-house, likewise a quarter of an hour before, who gave me a bill in the very same pocket-book, with his name in the acceptance.</p>
               <p>Q. You communicated your misfortune to Mr. Stevens? - A. Yes; while I was doing so, a Jew boy came up and asked if I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the boy's communication, you thought proper to take him to Bow-Street? - A. Yes, which I did; and I stopped the notes at the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever heard of any of the notes since? - A. No; only one note that has been in circulation; one 30l. note.</p>
               <p>Q. This boy gave information to the Magistrates? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Some officers were dispatched to particular places? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it, in consequence of any search, that the prisoners were apprehended? - A. I cannot tell how soon they were apprehended; but they were apprehended the very same evening, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body at Bow-street that evening, in consequence of their being apprehended? - A. No; it was a couple of days afterwards; as soon as the Magistrate sat, the Monday following, to the best of my recollection, I was robbed on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Look carefully at the prisoners, and tell the Jury upon your oath, whether you are warranted that they are the men? - A. I firmly believe, that both of them were the men, not that I can say that they took my pocket-book, but that they were two of the people that surrounded me when I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are you sure these were two of the men that surrounded you, at the time you lost your pocket-book? - A. Yes; I knew them immediately after I saw them at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you any doubt about it? - A. No; I don't think I can have the least doubt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Where is this Jew boy? - A. He has been taken away for the purpose of not appearing as an evidence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You say, at the time you were going by, there was a crowd of people, and some two persons brushed by you, and hit you on the arm? - A. Four or five; it was only one person gave me a push on the arm.</p>
               <p>Q. As any porter going along might do? - A. No; they seemed to be all in a crowd, and pushed close to me, so as to have an opportunity to take my pocket-book, and he spoke to me to take my attention.</p>
               <p>Q. You were pushed as you would be in a crowd? - A. Yes, and asked to make room.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no hurt at all done to you? - A. No; only that I could feel it.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the only effect it had upon you to draw off your attention? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The person who said to you, "make way," got out of your sight entirely? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was the Monday following you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170013"/>saw these two persons at Bow-street, that is four or five days after? - A. Four days.</p>
               <p>Q.You had never seen the persons you suppose to have robbed you, from the time the robbery was committed, till the time you saw these two people in Bow-street? - A. No; not from the hour of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, before you went up stairs, you were told by the officers, that the persons were coming who had committed the robbery? - A. They told me that two such persons had been taken of the names and descriptions I had given of them.</p>
               <p>Q. The room was very full of people when they were brought up? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And they were desired to make a line, that you might see the two people that stood at the bar? - A. Yes; the Justice desired them to do so.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you saw these two persons not mixed with any others for you to pick them out? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, or did you say, at Bow-Street, any thing further than that you believed them to be the men? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never seen the pocket-book, or recovered any thing lost upon that occasion? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When you were before the Magistrate, had you any doubt about the persons of the men? - A. No; I had not.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Const. On Wednesday the 23d of December, information was given at Bow-street, by a Jew boy, who, I understand, has since absconded; in consequence of that, I and some more other officers went that evening in search of the parties; we took up, I believe, that night, several suspected persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the person, who gave you that information, describe any particular persons? - A. Yes; he gave me the names of all the five whom I knew of course, and we apprehended the prisoners among the rest; they were searched, but nothing found upon them; we apprehended them at a public-house in Clare-street, Clare-market, kept by a man of the name of Liffet, and found them together; I had been in the house before, but they were not there then, and I thought it right to go again, which I did, a little before eight o'clock, I believe it was, and apprehended them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see them come in? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were they in company together, or how? - A. They were not sitting close together, they were near one another.</p>
               <p>Q. In the same box? - A. No; I believe one sat at the fire-place, and the other in the box; I believe the house was clear, and only these two people in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. From the information you received, you were in pursuit of others whom you did not find? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This robbery was committed about three o'clock in the afternoon; the place you went to, in order to apprehend these persons, was at a Mr. Lisset's in Clare-market? - A. I went to a number of bad houses.</p>
               <p>Q. But you went to Lisset's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You apprehended the prisoners at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You searched them and found nothing upon them? - A. Nothing relative to the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, at the time you apprehended them, they went very quietly with you? - A. Certainly; there is no question about that.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Macmanus with you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this boy come of his own accord? - A. He came with the prisoner, I believe.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was he bound over? - A. Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Beckman). Q. Did this boy go with you to the Magistrate? - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Of his own accord? - A. Yes; he did not go immediately; because he had some fruit, and would not leave his basket, he has been bound over to prosecute, but is no where to be found.</p>
               <p>Court. I shall certainly estreat the boy's recognizance; and I do it that there may be some further enquiry; the blame must lie somewhere.</p>

The night before; I went between eleven and twelve to look at the fastenings before I went to bed, the windows were then fast; the next morning I looked in at the windows, and perceived that the brick-work of the copper was disturbed; I went back again in at the back door, and came through the kitchen into the wash-house, and I examined the place and found the articles in the indictment to be missing.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen them there before? - A. The day before, Saturday the 16th; I missed a large copper out of the brick-work, a large copper pot and stew-pan, two copper saucepans, a brassskillet, and a brass ladle, nine live fowls, eight hens, and a cock.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in the wash-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see them again? - A. I have seen part of them at the Justices in Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. It had been light sometime before you got up? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>I am a constable of the Public-office, Worship-street: On Tuesday, the 19th of January, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, my neighbour, Mr. Gooch, came to my house, to tell me, that there had been three men at his house offering some copper to sell that he suspected was stole; I enquired which way they went; and I went directly towards Shoreditch church; and in Mr. Mason's house, who keeps an iron shop, I saw some copper in the scale; Mr. Mason would know where they got it, before he paid for it; the man, then, was running out of doors; I was coming in at the very instant, and caught him in my arms; that was the prisoner North, the middle man; I did not stand to talk with him, but gave him in custody to the man that keeps the Ship, who is an officer, and I went round the corner of Kingsland-road, and saw the stout man, Mills, skulking round the corner; I laid hold of him, and said to him, I have got your partner, I believe, you must go with me; I took him directly to the iron shop, where North was, and sent for the man who gave me the information, to know whether that was one of the parties concerned, before I confined him; he said, he was; then I handcussed them together; and went out, to look for the other man, just by Shoreditch church gates; I saw the other man, Fry, with a black bag upon his shoulder; I asked him, what he had there; he said, why my own property; says I, I don't know that; but, says he, I can prove it to be my property, and I can prove where I bought it; then, says I, you must go with me, and prove that before the Magistrate; and I took him, and put him in the watch-house; they were all put in the watch-house, and locked up, till the Magistrate sat; I have had the things in my possession; in the bag was part of a copper, and a copper pot without a handle.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the copper that was at Mr. Mason's shop? - A. I had that in another bag; he and I put it into the bag, in his own shop, out of the scale; that was a part of a copper, and a stewpan.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it been in your custody ever since? - A. Yes. (producing them).</p>
               <p>Simpson. This is my pot, here is a piece rivetted on the side; the stew-pan is knocked to pieces in such a manner, that there is no mark I can speak to; but I believe it to be my property.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Simpson. This is my pot; I cannot say any thing to the stew pan, it is knocked to pieces so, and there is no mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Mrs. Simpson). What is the mark upon that pot? - A. A part of the side rivetted on.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a pot that has been mended? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no mark of your's upon it? - A. No; it is a pot I have had in use a great many years, that makes me know it.</p>
               <p>Q.Any person that has a pot that has seen many years service, would have it mended? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is it a pot of the same size with that you lost? - A. It is; I have no doubt but it is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this pot loose in the brick work? - A. No; it was a fixture.</p>

They made use of Abbot's name to me; I have known him twenty or thirty years; and I should not have taken the cart in, but their having made use of his name; we take a number of carriages into our yard, many that come to Mr. Brewer's meeting of a Sunday; our gates are generally open from morning to night.</p>

             (the Accomplice), sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 11th, or 12th, of last December, Ashley and I went to Low-Layton; and we broke into an out-house belonging to a person, near the Red-lion; and we stole a parcel of fowls from there, and a coachman's box-coat, and a green baize covering of a chaise, or a chariot; we could not bring them home conveniently; we had a horse, harnessed, with us; we had looked at the cart in the day-time, and took a collar with us to put upon the horse, to put him into the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. So you went with that intent, did you? - A. Yes; we took the cart from a carpenter's yard at Low-Layton, near the three Black-birds, below where we committed the robbery; we brought the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170017"/>cart and property to town; and we out the cart into one Zorble Phillips's yard, in Petticoat-lane; he turned the cart out of his yard, and put it into Tripe's yard; he would not let it stand in his place; he said it was a stolen cart; it staid there about two days. Then Mr. Abbot, the publican, asked me if I had a mind to sell it, he would give me sixteen shillings for it; I told him I did not want it; I used to use his house; he keeps the Duke of Argyle, in Petticoat-lane.</p>
               <p>Q.Who did he ask, you or Ashley? - A. Ashley and me were together; and he asked me in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he offer the sixteen shillings to? - A. He told us to take it to one Prior, and give his compliments to him, at Stepney, and leave it there till he went for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he offer it to? - A. To both of us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Ashley say he had a share in the cart? - A. Yes; Abbot knew that Ashley and I had stolen the cart, and brought it there; he knew it was a stolen cart; we had taken the number-board off, and we told him it was a stolen cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known Abbot long before? - A. I had used his house for some months; we put it in Mr. Abbot's yard till he called for it; we both rode in it there; when we came back Abbot paid for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This is the first time you have made your appearance in a Court of this sort, I take it for granted? - A. I don't understand you.</p>
               <p>Q. This is the first time you have been examined as a witness, or been at the bar of any Court? - A. No; it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been at the bar of this Court, perhaps? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be at the bar of this Court? A. I did not come of my own accord, I assure you.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you brought here for? - A. For what I was cleared of.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it for? - A. A felony; I was cleared of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it for stealing any thing? - A. I was charged by a gentleman at Hammersmith, for break ing his house, not stealing any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the only time you have been here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What else were you here for? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been here often, perhaps? - A. The more is my misfortune.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you been convicted for? - A. I have not been convicted of any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Never? - A. I was confined six months for buying some pigeons.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you may have been on the other side of the water; you were never tried in Surry, were you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you tried in Surry for? - A. A thing I was not guilty of.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the charge against you? - A. For burglary, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. How may times have you been charged in Surry? - A. Only that once.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any other things you can remember; how many times have you been in custody in your life? - A. Not above half a-dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you had the good fortune to escape? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you been convicted? - A. Only once.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ally. Q. Is not there a woman, of the name of Smith, lives with you? - A. No woman in particular lives with me now.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since there has? - A. Within these three or four weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. She was not your wife, I take it for granted. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was unfortunate enough to take lodgings at your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This good lady does not live with you now? - A. She could not live with me in prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Now and then this woman had an opportunity of going about the house, and the lodgers of coming into the place where she was? - A. I cannot answer for that; nobody had any business in my place.</p>
               <p>Q. They had no opportunity of coming there? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. You would not be jealous of any man coming to visit this lady? - A. If I had catched them there I should have paid them for their trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not you be angry, and jealous, if another man came to visit this lady? -</p>
               <p>Court. That is certainly not a regular mode of examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether or not this man, Ashley, visited this lady? - A. Not to my knowledge, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, have you not threatened him for visiting this lady? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said, if you got him into your claws you would be up with him? - A. No; he has loaded a brace of pistols to shoot me; I have heard or it, I did not know it.</p>
               <p>For Ashley.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170018"/>Q. In what manner have you known Smith behave towards the prisoner at the bar? - A. I don't know any ill conduct, but when Smith and I have had any words; he has said, damn me, (pardon me, my Lord, for repeating the oath), he would do for him if he got him in his power. The prisoner Ashley has often saved my life, by taking my part against Smith.</p>
               <p>Court. You have lived with Smith as your husband? - A. He drawed me away before I was sixteen; when Ashley first lodged with us, I believe he worked in Falcon-square; he has cut his hand, and been unable to work for these six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any intimacy between Ashley and Smith? - A. Ashley never was in the house from morning to night.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they out together of a night? - A. He was never out of a night, in general; I never knew him out but two nights, and then I knew where he was.</p>
               <p>Q. You never knew them out together? - A. Never; unless I was out with them, taking a walk.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you keep a house there? - A. Yes: On the 27th of January, we discovered that the house was broke into through the cellar-window, by wrenching out an iron bar; there was a lattice before the window; I was not in the cellar the night before, but I saw the lattice safe the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. They could not undo the iron bar without taking away the lattice? - A. No, it could not; I am certain the lattice was safe over night; my servant maid found the house broke open, about seven in the morning, and came and called me, and I got up directly I missed the things mentioned in the indictment, and many more.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen them before this? - A. I saw the candlestick after ten o'clock on the night of the 26th; the tumbler, I believe, I had at dinner, I don't know that I had it at supper; the candlestick and goblet were shewn to me by an officer belonging to the office in Lambeth-street, Whitechapel, in the office.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was that? - A. The Friday after, the 26th was on the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the candlestick and goblet to be your's? - A. I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. You don't fasten your own windows? - A. That window never was fastened more than it was that night.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the house broke open on the 27th? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the house fastened over night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in business? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any partner? - A. Yes, one; but he does not live in the house with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he any share in the property of your house? - A. Certainly not.</p>

               <p>I am an officer belonging to Lambeth-street: On Wednesday, the 27th of January, I had an information against Ashley; I was informed he was at a public-house in Petticoat-lane; I went, in company with Foredum, in search of him; going up Petticoat-lane, I met Ashley; we took him into custody, and brought him down to the office; there I searched him; in his pocket I found this silver candlestick, and this silver half pint tumbler in his coat pocket; upon a little further enquiry, we found the gentleman that had lost them, Mr. Penn; he came forward, and proved them to be his property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. I believe the things were wrapped up in a handkerchief? - A. Yes; the same handkerchief is about them now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find a snuff-box upon him, Yes; he said the snuff-box was his.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what he was going to do with it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>(To Mr. Penn). Look at those things. - A. These are both my property; the snuff-box is not mine; they have my marks upon them; there is my crest upon the candlestick; and the initials of my name at the bottom of the tumbler.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Grissith). What time did you take him? - A. At half past twelve o'clock in the day of the 27th.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen, I understand you have already determined that the accomplice is unworthy of credit.</p>
               <p>Jury. We have.</p>
               <p>Court. I shall not call him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I lodged at Smith's: On Wednesday morning, he asked me if I would stop to breakfast, which I did; he said he wanted a box made the same as I had got; he said, my father has left me some silver; it was in a handkerchief; he wanted me to sell it for him, I refused to take it; I said, he might take it himself; he forced the handkerchief into my pocket; I did not know what it was; I was going with the box; I have a witness to prove I had it of him.</p>

               <p>Q. You know the prisoner at the bar, and that Smith, who has been already in court? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know that man has accused the prisoner of this offence? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect seeing any thing, and when given to the prisoner at the bar? - A. To the best of my recollection it was this day three weeks; it was on the Wednesday in the morning, between the hours of nine and ten, Smith asked Ashley if he would go to London with him; we lived at Bethnalgreen; Ashley answered him, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you live with Smith? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed that night? - A. About ten o'clock; I never saw Smith from three o'clock on Tuesday afternoon till the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What occurred in the morning? - A. He asked Ashley if he would go to London with him; he said yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Ashley at home that night? - A. He came home about eleven o'clock on Tuesday night as he was taken into custody on the Wednesday; Smith asked me to give him a clean pocket handkerchief; if this is it, it has had three letters picked out of the corner, (looks at it); this is the handkerchief, here are the letters partly picked out.</p>
               <p>Jury. What were the letters? - A. I cannot recollect what the letters were, though I had the picking of them out; I think one of them was a D.</p>
               <p>Jury. (Look at the handkerchief.)There are no letters picked out of it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Penn). Do you know the handkerchief? - A. I think I do.</p>
               <p>Dixon. That is the corner; I do think that is the handkerchief; I should not chuse to swear it.</p>
               <p>Jury. There does not appear to have been any letters picked out; she has a fine eye if she can discover it.</p>
               <p>Dixon. It was the pattern of that handkerchief, there were three letters picked out of the corner; Mr. Smith gave me the handkerchief about a fortnight before he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. The handkerchief came originally from Smith? - A. Yes; Smith gave me a handkerchief, and desired me to pick the letters out.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what it was you saw given by Smith to the prisoner? - A. When I gave him the handkerchief, he put a little quantity of something into it; I cannot say it was this, it was about this bulk; he asked Ashley to put it in his pocket, he said no,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170020"/>he would carry it in his hand, and Smith turned him round, and I saw him put it into his pocket; what it was I don't know, for I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Court. What are you? - A. I have lived with this man, Smith; turned of seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. He is a notorious thief? - A. I am sorry to say he gets his bread in an unaccountable manner; I never knew what he did; I said he should never bring things into the house not come honestly by.</p>
               <p>Q. Ashley and he agreed very well? - A. Ashley lodged in the house five months.</p>
               <p>Q. You continue in that line of life now? - A. The way I maintain myself since he has been in prison, is by parting with things to keep him and me; I never mean to enter a home with him any more; if I do, I believe I shall come to an untimely death.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I believe this is my handkerchief; I have some of the same pattern.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the door fast? - A. Yes; it was opened by a pick-lock or false key; I heard them come in and shut the door after them; I was sitting in my shop, and one of the officers with me; they might be some space of time in the passage; and then one of them says to the other, where are the matches and tinder.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear them say that? - A. Yes; and then they began to strike a light; I heard the flint strike against the steel; Mr. Hudson, the officer, that I had to guard me, gave me a shove, and I shoved the bolt, so that no man could come out of the house, and none could come in; it was a bolt I had fixed on purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that secure the door at which they had come in? - A. Yes; as soon as I had done it, Hudson knocked one of them down, or both, before the other officer came out of the other room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go into the passage? - A. Yes; and I went with him.</p>
               <p>Q.Who was the other officer? - A. One Austin.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had got into the passage, who did these two men turn out to be? - A. Those two gentlemen, (pointing to the prisoners); the other officer was concealed in a back room; and he came out with a lighted candle in one hand, and a pistol in the other, which was not discharged; and they were secured and handcuffed in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it dark? - A. The quarters had gone half past six some time before they came into the house; it was not seven, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. How light was it? - A. It was very dark out of doors.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it too dark to see their faces out of doors? - A. Yes; unless they stood against a lamp or a candle.</p>
               <p>Q. But you could not distinguish them by the light of the heavens? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What shop do you keep? - A. A chandler's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear you could not see a man's face, if you were as near him as I am? - A. Not to know any man.</p>
               <p>Q. But could you see any man's face? - A. I could not, to see what face he had, or any thing about him.</p>
               <p>Q. You had two officers in your house, you know; you knew, perhaps, that upon the conviction of these persons, there would be two forty pounds reward? - A. I knew nothing at all of that; if you please, I will tell you why I had the officers.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not want to know that; did you not know that there was a 40l. reward for the conviction of persons who break into houses? - A. I did not know any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear it? - A. I never had such a thing happen to me before; I have heard that there have been such things; but I don't know any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you know there is a reward given by the parish of Islington, for the convictions of those men? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How much is that? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it 30l.? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard of a parliamentary reward of 40l. each, and the parish reward of 30l.; and you, you know, will be entitled to a share of it; now, upon your oath, will you take upon yourself to swear, that it was so dark you could not distinguish the person of a man? - A. It was so dark that I could not distinguish the feature; it was very cloudy.</p>
               <p>Q. You told my Lord just now, that you had fastened the door? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before this had you fastened the door? - A. All the evening I kept it fast.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it fastened? - A. With a lock.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons live in your house? - A. Only my wife and myself; my wife was gone out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170022"/>to chapel; she did not come home till after this happened.</p>
               <p>Q.After you had fastened the door, did you go out to chapel? - A. I let her out, and fastened the door after her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did nobody else go out after that? - A. No; nor come in.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you fasten it? - A. With a lock.</p>
               <p>Q. After that did nobody else go out? - A. Not till after these gentlemen came in.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there any woman, or any body else lived in your house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did nobody go to chapel with your wife? - A. Yes; there was a man went with her, he drank tea with us, and went out at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the only security to the door all the night; do you fasten it any other way than pushing it to; was it bolted? - A. No; it was upon the lock.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not fasten it more than at any other time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Then how do you know that it caught at that particular time, more than at any other time? - A. I am sure it was fast.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you never found, upon the shutting the door, that it has missed the catch? - A. Never; I always try it.</p>
               <p>Q. This door was never opened at all after you had so fastened it? - A. No; not till they broke in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never open this door any time at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Not for above ten minutes now? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath it never was? - A. No; it never was.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you said so before,at the Justice's, that after you had fastened it, it was open for above ten minutes before the prisoners were in your house? - A. Never; because it was never open from the time I fastened it after my wife, till the time the prisoners broke it open.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You heard them put the key into the door, did not you? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>I am a constable: I was at Mr. Are's on the 7th of February; as soon as ever Mrs. Are went out to chapel, the door was fastened; I tried it myself, and it was fast; she had got but a very little way from the house before somebody came and knocked at the door, very hard, and kicked with their feet, several times; then I heard somebody say, at the door, damn them, I suppose they don't serve of a Sunday; then a woman came by, I could hear her walk in pattens; the door is quite close to the edge of the pavement; in the course of a few minutes, somebody came and put pick-lock keys into the lock of the door; the door opened, and somebody came in; then they shut it; I heard one of the people that came in, ask the other for some tinder; I heard some paper rustle, and then they began to strike with the flint against the steel; the sparks began to fly very near my face; I was close to the door, close to the prisoners; there is no passage to the house, it is only a slight partition, put up of a Sunday, to separate the passage into the house from the shop; I made a motion to Mr. Are to shove a bolt that he, had contrived to keep the door from opening above five or six inches; he did not shove it the first time, and then I moved him again, he shoved it; and then I immediately began laying on with this staff upon the prisoners; one of them, in the scuffle, struck me with something, I believe a crow, that was found upon the ground afterwards; and then I struck against something very hard, like iron; and here is a dent in the truncheon that was not in it before. Austin, the other officer, was in the parlour, he came out with the light, and then we secured the prisoners; I secured Tait; I handcuffed him; and in searching him, I found this knife, it is a very dangerous knife, (produces it).</p>
               <p>Court. There is no particularity in the knife, excepting that it has a very strong spring.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What time in the evening was it? - A. Between half past six and seven.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been here before? - A. Not as an officer; I have been here, but not as an officer till now.</p>
               <p>Q. You know, of course, there is a 40l. reward? - A. I don't know any thing of it; this is the first year I have been an officer; I have heard it, but I don't know that this has any thing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Q. But you have heard of it? - A. Yes; I have heard that there is a 40l. reward for people breaking open houses.</p>
               <p>Q.But they did not break into this house, did they? - A. Yes, they did; but we did not find any property upon them.</p>
               <p>Q.Perhaps you may have heard there is a reward given by the parish, as well as 40l. upon each of these men's heads? - A. I have heard of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is it? - A. Twenty or thirty pounds, I don't know which.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was this? - A. A wetnight; it had been raining all the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Day-light of course was gone? - A. It was very dark.</p>
               <p>Q. As dark as at twelve o'clock at night? - A. It could not be much darker; it was a very wet night, and a very dull night.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure it was quite dark? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>I was at Mr. Are's; on the 7th of February, between six and seven o'clock, somebody came and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170023"/>knocked at the door ready to split the door almost, it seemed to be with their feet; and then somebody came and put a pick-lock key in the door; I heard it twice; I was in a back room in the house; directly afterwards I heard somebody in the passage striking a light; then a scuffle ensued with somebody; I judged it to be Mr. Hudson; and then I came out, and saw the two prisoners on the ground; I brought out a light with me.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Are you a constable? - A. Yes; I immediately secured Tabor, put the handcuffs on him, and searched him; I found in his pocket a dark lanthorn, and some tinder in a paper, and some tinder upon the ground; some matches, and a flint; and an iron crow lay between the two prisoners; these pick-lock keys, and a knife, I found in Tabor's pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this? - A. Before they began to pick the lock, the half after six was gone; but they knocked at the door rather before that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark? - A. It had been dark an hour; the candles were lighted at half past five; the watch was hanging just by me.</p>
               <p>Tabor's defence. We were taking a walk round Islington fields, and went into a public-house to smoke a pipe together, and we went into this shop for some tobacco; we had no sooner touched the door than it opened; and then we were knocked down and secured; they found nothing upon me but my pocket knife, till they came to the watch-house, and there they found upon me these pick-lock keys, which I have no doubt they put into my pocket; for they make their brags, in public-houses about that neighbourhood, that they should get two forty and two thirty pounds reward, if we were convicted.</p>
               <p>Tait's defence; We went to take a walk in Islington fields, and we went into this chandler's-shop to buy some tobacco, the door came open immediately, and there was a man knocked us both down, and said we came with intent to rob the house; he found nothing upon me but two bad shillings.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Austin.) Where did you take these things from him? - A. I took the lanthorn from him in the passage; I rubbed him down the things; and when I came to the watch-house, I saw the pocket was made to hang quite behind, where the picklock keys were.</p>

               <p>I am an officer belonging to the Public office, Worship-street: On Saturday, the 6th of February, I went with a warrant to the house of Mostyn; the prisoner, Mostyn, was sitting down at a table, I was in the kitchin part; I told him I had a warrant to search his house; I went up stairs, and on the landing-place, up one pair of stairs, I found some papers containing some counterfeit halfpence, some with the impression, and some without,(producing them) I came down immediately with them, and searched the drawers, where Mostyn and Wingrove were; in the drawers I found these two other papers, containing some blank halfpence; and another paper with some farthings that have got the impression on; the prisoners, Mostyn and Wingrove, were then secured; we then went from that house to a house where Kelly and his son were found, at No. 1, Bellalley; I had been round, and looked at the back of the house, and returned, and knocked with my feet hard; Kelly came and opened the door, he was without a hat, and a handkerchief tied round him as if he had been unwell; the lad was without a hat and coat. I told Kelly I had a warrant to search the house, and would he come and see what we did? he said, give me your names, and do what you like; I wrote the names of the five officers that were present, on a piece of paper; I told him Mostyn was in custody; and asked him had Mostyn any thing to do with that house, or came there; he said, no; there was a closet in that room where Kelly, his son, and family, were just going to dinner; it was a lower room; there was the appearance of a trapdoor in the room, in the bottom of the closet, that was pulled up, and Ray was let down into the cellar; after he had been in the cellar a few minutes, with a lighted candle, he holloaed out, "secure the people; here is the press, with a halfpenny in it." I went down afterwards, and saw a stamping-press standing, with a pair of plain dies fixed in it; not with the impression of Britannia on them, they only produce blanks; there was a box that contained some saw-dust, which is used to blacken the money: there is a person that stands by the press to feed, two pulls, and one feeds; there were four candles hanging up on a nail against the wall; there were three arched vanlts together, such as might be used for beer, or any thing else; there was a door to it with a lock and key in it, and a bolt, that any body, being inside, might bolt it; the upper part of that cellar, which was under another house, of one Bailey, a broker, was a boarded floor.</p>
               <p>Q. The door that led to the premisses of Bailey was blocked up? - A. That door was fixed to the part of the cellar where the arch was.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a cellar, not an arched vault, which entered into the third? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And within the door of that there was a bolt, by which any body might keep themselves in? - A. Any body might be in the cellar and not perceive them.</p>
               <p>Q.Where was the press and those other things found, in the cellar or the vault? - A. In the vault there was a bench which I saw, where they might paper them up; it is in Ray's possession; there was some brown paper by it; after we had found these, I looked at the front cellar, and went up a pair of stairs and found the stair-case that leads into Mr. Bailey's shop, a broker, who is here; but against that door there were a couple of wooden spars fixed against the wall, that nobody, at Bailey's, could open that door, as it appeared to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that door appear to you to be opened lately? - A. Not at all; quite to the contrary; the two spars were fixed against the wall; and the cobwebs and dust all about it; on the examination of the prisoners, when they were committed, the money was looked at; and the halfpence I found in Mostyn's house, appear to have a ridge on one side; and comparing them with the dies found in that press, there is a flaw in that die; they correspond exactly; I have them here.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170026"/>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You talked about the blank halfpence; they were nothing but blank pieces of copper, were not they? - A. Yes; such as I have seen in circulation, and do every day; but there were some struck with the dies.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw Mostyn? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had been reading till you went in? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed? - A. As workmen in general are.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing particular about him? - A. No; nor the woman neither.</p>
               <p>Q.When you went into Kelly's house, you asked Kelly, whether Mostyn used to come to that house; and he denied it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Where is Mostyn's house? - A. No. 1, Ar thur-street; and the other, No. 1, Bell-Alley; they are the next ally to one another; there is no communication between the two houses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ally. Q. You tell us, that when you went to Kelly's house, that they opened the door, and told you, that if you would give your names, you should be admitted to see what you pleased? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray what kind of cellar is this; what may be the depth from the floor of the room to the ground of the cellar, into which you afterwards went? - A. I dare say, between eight and nine foot; I take it more nine than short of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then a person being in that cellar could not, without assistance, get up into Kelly's room? - A. I got up with a chair.</p>
               <p>Q. There were three doors; the trap-door, through which you got into the cellar, another from the street, and another from Bailey's? - A. No; whatever communication from the street, must come through Bailey's shop, by taking up some part of the window in his shop.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no other communication than that you saw, through Kelly's, and through the shop? - A. I searched attentively and could find none.</p>
               <p>Q.These vaults run under other houses? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What size was this machine with which the dies were struck? - A. It is here.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the width of the trap-door? - A. Two foot.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get the machine up, could it have been introduced in at the trap-door? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not bring it through that way? - A. No; because we had a coach brought to the door, and came through the broker's shop; the house was up an alley.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were there any stairs from this trapdoor to the cellar? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. But there were stairs to the broker's shop? - A. After I had got possession of the tools, with my candle, I went to the further end of the cellar, and found it boarded, not arched; I then went round through the street into Bailey's shop, and asked, who had the key of that door, (the door that was sparred); and they said, one Myers; I came to the further end of the cellar, with a sledge hammer, and he came and removed his goods.</p>
               <p>Q.It must have been some trouble to open the door going into that shop? - A. Yes; with a hammer.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no trouble the other way, and you chose that troublesome way? - A. The stock of the press is a very heavy piece of iron, and we chose that for the most convenient way.</p>
               <p>Q.Those bits of copper, that you found in Kelly's, were not stamped? - A. Ray has them here.</p>
               <p>Q. They were not stamped? - A. There were some stamped.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you to say, that only those found in Mostyn's house were stamped? - A. I said, there were some found but I did not compare them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any boarding over this trap-door, which went into the cellar? - A. Yes; three boards nailed up.</p>
               <p>Q. It was so covered that you did not discover it at first? - A. We knew it was.</p>

               <p>I am an officer: I went, on the 6th of February, to Mostyn's house, with my brother officers; Mostyn was sitting at the table; he had been reading; I secured the prisoner, and searched his pockets, and found these two papers; I stood over him all the time they were searching that house, and part of the time they were searching the other, (produces them).</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else? - A. No; then I went to Kelly's house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. Were you in the closet in Kelly's house? - A. I saw the place where Ray and the other officers went down; but I did not go down myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this closet very dark? - A. No; not when the door was open.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the door of the closet obvious to people's view? - A. Yes; young Kelly's hands were pretty dirty, as if he had been at work; the other officers were there before me.</p>

               <p>I went to Kelly's house, with Armstrong, Harper and Blackiter; I went to the back part of the house and heard a knocking; I said to Armstrong, they were knocking something to pieces, the curtain was not drawn quite close; I heard the knocking cease, and saw Kelly, the father, come out of a place on the outside of the house that looked like a closet; that closet was level with the back window; we could not get in at the back door, we knocked there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Kelly any thing in his hand? - A. Not that I observed; I went round to the front door, and there we got in; we went to the closet in the lower room, out of which I saw Kelly come; I went to this closet with Armstrong, we looked, and there was a hole about two foot square; the boards were cut, and a door pulled up; at one corner of it there was a new nail stuck in it, drove within a quarter of an inch of the head; I pulled it up and let myself drop into the cellar; Armstrong gave me a candle; the moment I dropped through this hole, there was a door open, and there were three large arches covered with brick; I looked in the first and saw nothing; I went into the middle one, and at the further end of it I saw a press fixed; I returned to the hole where I got down, and informed Armstrong that every thing was right, there was a press and every thing for coining in the cellar; Blackiter and Armstrong came down to me; these are the dies that were fixed in the press, there is a very particular mark in one of the dies.</p>
               <p>Court. Let the Jury look at it, and compare it with the mark in the halfpence.</p>
               <p>Ray. This halfpenny I found between the dies; all the things that I found in the cellar are here; I found a great many halfpence there, (producing them); I found a pair of trowsers, a jacket, and a bed-gown, and some bags with saw-dust, and sieves, they are all here; a paper of brimstone; I went the same evening again, and examined the situation of the premisses; the cellar is a very long one, it formerly belonged to a public-house, there is a flap in the street where the beer was let down, and another door that goes down a dozen stairs, but that is so barracaded with wood, that it is impossible for any body that lives in the front house to go down; Mr. Bailey, a broker, lives in the front house; then you go down fifteen or sixteen yards, and then a door opens that lets you into these three vaults; they are about twelve or fourteen yards in length, each of them; in one them there was a deep hole dug, where there was a great deal of water; there is no communication at all that I could see, but through this cellar, no way in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the prisoner Kelly's hands? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. All that you have been relating is with respect to Kelly's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Mostyn was not by? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ally. Q. I understand you that this trapdoor was nailed down? - A. A new nail stuck in it, but not drove quite down.</p>
               <p>Q. And a cellar communicates? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long Kelly had lived in this house? - A. No.</p>

               <p>I went with the other officer to the prisoner Kelly's house, young Kelly was standing with his coat off; I looked at his hands, they were all black and greasy; I did not observe the elder Kelly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. He told you, I believe, that he had been cleaning shoes? - A. Yes; but I am sure it was not that; I did not see any shoes.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Armstrong.) Look at all these implements produced by the other witnesses, and see what is the use of them; I believe you have had a great deal of experience in the coining business? - A. This is an edging engine, this is to round the edges; I have been at the apprehending of many coiners; I have always seen such as these.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. That was found in Mostyn's house; that would not coin of itself without something else? - A. No; this is a stamping-press; here is a sieve; that when the halfpence, or money is coined, they fist it to get the saw-dust from it, and this is handier than a wire one; the saw-dust is mixed with oil to make them greasy, for they are boiled in brimstone; it puts a greasy black upon them, to make them better for circulation, it takes off the newness; this cross bar is a fly, a couple of weights are fixed at each end for farthings, it is lighter than the other; this is the fly, one seeds it, sitting in a chair, and two pull it round, and it receives the impression, either plain or whatever the dye is engraved<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170028"/>with; this is fixed in a large piece of wood in a cellar, and then nothing can be heard but a jarring found, the earth keeps any person from hearing it; it flies downward, and here the dye is placed.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say, from your experience, that these implements, found in Kelly's house, were complete for coining halfpence? - A. They will make plain halfpence, or with a stamp.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the halfpence, those found at Mostyn's, and those found at Kelly's? - A. They are all counterfeit.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. All those things found in Kelly's house, are compleat for coining? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What you found in Mostyn's house, could not be? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ally. Q. Button-cutters make use of the same kind of presses? - A. I have seen them worked by the hand by women, it is too heavy a press for making buttons; besides, they generally work for buttons in garrets, not cellars.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What quantity of halfpence were found at Mostyn's? - A. Six papers; some stamped and some unstamped; some that are stamped appear of the date 1775; there are six papers, each containing 1l. 10s.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do any of those found at Mostyn's appear to have the flaw of the die found at Kelly's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many? - A. A great quantity; but I cannot ascertain, without it was counted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. There were some that had not that flaw? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They were all tied up in separate papers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Can you say, by looking at a piece of copper, whether it has been passed under the edging tool or not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Look at those found at Mostyn's. - A. Yes; they have all passed under the edging tool.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Look at some of those found at Kelly's, and see whether they have been under the edging tool? - A. Here are four of them that appear not to have been under the edging tool; the greater part of them have.</p>
               <p>Q. They are always passed under the edging tool before they are fit to circulate? - A. Generally, because they don't go so well; they are not reckoned finished, some call it rounding, and some edging; here are some that were found down with the press, and these have never been edged.</p>
               <p>Mostyn's defence. When the officers came into our house, I was reading over a book, and they asked me my name; I told them; they asked what I was; I said, a hatter; they went up stairs, and on the landing-place, I believe, they found these things; and then they went down stairs, and said, there was nothing there, only that block and that machine; and they took them away, and took me into custody; there is no communication between my house and Mr. Kelly's; that is all I know; the things were there, and they were left there by somebody.</p>
               <p>Kelly, the elder's, defence. Our premisses are seventy or eighty feet long; the front comes into Goswell-street, and the cellar runs under four houses; the next evidence, though he is against me, will prove, one of his children had like to have broke his neck down there; there are a great many communications; I am told it was a bad house before I came to it; these gentlemen, you know very well, swear for gain; they must get something by it; and when it is so; if they can swear a man's life away, and foul to, it is done; the man that is to come in next has been much urged against us; the Justice exposed him to us, or we did not know it; my son is apprenticed to me; I am a cabinet-maker; he is as innocent as the child unborn; I am a freeman of the city of London; he is only fifteen years old.</p>
               <p>Kelly, the younger's, defence. I know nothing about it; I know the hole was there before we came there.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Mostyn). Q. Whether you mean to give any account of these things found in your house? - A. The engine has been left there by a person that desired me to take care of it; and the block to these halfpence was behind the door; they were left there; I did not know they were there.(The prisoner Kelly called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.)(The prisoner Mostyn called three witnesses, who gave him a good character).</p>

               <p>On the 29th of January, I saw the prisoners cut or break the glass of Mr. Ward's window, with some instrument or other; I went into the shop to see what they were doing, and I saw the glass that was broke, and some halfpence and farthings lying under it; they had not got the piece out then.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the house was it that this glass was so broke? - A. The shop is in the front of the street; after I had been in and seen what they were doing, I came out, and passed them; I walked up the street about twenty yards; I crossed the street, and came down the other side; just as I got against them, I saw them take the piece of glass out; and one put his hand into the hole; but I could not see which; I saw his fingers in; but I did not see him take any thing out; I saw it afterwards; and put my hand into it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing within reach of the persons, if they tried? - A. There was about five or six shillings-worth of halfpence lay just under the hole, that any body might reach it with their hand.</p>
               <p>Q.How came they to leave off the attempt? - A. I believe I took them before they had the opportunity; they began to cut the place larger; I thought myself not capable of taking them, and I went to Mr.Hill's, the next door but one, to get a man to assist me; he stood about ten yards from me, while I took them both by the collar, and then he came and laid hold of one them; one of their hands was part of the way in at the window, at the time I laid hold of them; but they stood so close together, I could not tell which of them it was; the other witness can tell; we took them to the watch-house that night, and the next morning they were taken before the Magistrate in Lambeth-street.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe, when you were at the Justices, the two men were offered to go as soldiers? - A. I believe there was something mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. The Justices thought they were proper objects to serve his Majesty? - A. I did not hear the Magistrates offer it; I believe it was one of the clerks.</p>
               <p>Q. This was between nine and ten at night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from this house? - A. I live next door to it.</p>
               <p>Q. There were some halfpence near? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So near that they might have laid hold of those halfpence, if they had thought fit? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That they did not do? - A. I cannot say whether they did or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when they were searched? - A. Yes; five pennyworth of halfpence were found upon one, and a knife; and, I think, to the best of my recollection, 3s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Q. There were no implements of house-breaking found upon them? - A. No; only a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. But no crow, or any thing of that sort? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a knife yourself; I dare say every body has? - A. Yes; I have one now.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How was it broke? - A. It was broke, by some instrument drove in between the putty and the glass.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. There was no diamond found upon them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You know that there is a reward in this case? - A. I don't do such things for reward.</p>
               <p>Q.You have heard of such a thing as a reward for each of them? - A. I have; but I did not do it for that.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe the hole of the glass, where it was broke? - A. About half of the glass was broke.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it big enough for a man's hand to go in? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You don't know, whether the pane broke was large enough to admit a man's hand? - A. No.</p>
               <p>- AINSLEY sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 29th of January, I was in the watch-house; I am the keeper of the watch-house; the two prisoners were brought to me, and given charge of; I asked what the charge was; they told me, they had been cutting windows at Mr. Ward's.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you that? - A. Taylor and Harrop; with that, I searched the prisoners immediately, and found five pennyworth of halfpence upon one and a knife; and I searched the other, Molloy, and found 3s. 6d. in his pocket, and a knife; so that there were two knives between the two; Molloy said immediately, I will pay for the window, if you won't detain me.</p>
               <p>Q.This was about nine o'clock? - A. It was a little before ten when they were brought to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any curiosity to go and see the win<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170030"/>dow? - A. Not directly; I went that way home, and saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it broke? - A. There was a piece out big enough to put one's hand in.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Was the putty removed from the window? - A. Yes; and there was the mark of it on the knife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You saw the window afterwards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear as if it had been broke before and mended with putty, or was it a whole pane? - A. No; it had been broke before, and puttied across, but it was cut nearer the frame.</p>
               <p>Q. You had an intention to discharge them? - A. No; I said, it could not be.</p>
               <p>Q. This window had been broke and puttied? - A. It had been broke across, but the piece did not appear to have been out, but the putty was put to keep it whole.</p>
               <p>Barnett's defence. I was going along, and a man bid another man lay hold of me, and said he would bring another; he says he took the money out of both of our pockets; it was all taken out of mine; the prosecutor said, before the Justice, that the window was broke before.</p>
               <p>Molloy's defence. I was coming by the place, a man laid hold of me, and took me into the shop, and asked if the man had lost any thing; he said no; but the window was broke.(The prisoner, Molloy, called four witnesses, who gave him a good character).(The prisoner, Barnett, called three witnesses, who gave him a good character).</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see it after that? - A. I believe it was safe till we came to London-bridge; at least, I think I saw it there; when I came to Winchester-street, the first thing I heard was, that one of the portmanteaus was cut off; I think I saw it on London-bridge; I apprehend it was cut off between the bridge and <placeName id="t17960217-18-crimeloc105">Gracechurch-street</placeName>

I sent up immediately to Bow-street, to get an advertisement in the paper immediately, and to give a reward of ten guineas; I had information that a portmanteau was to be seen at the Justice's office, Guildhall; on the Monday I went to Guildhall, and saw the portmanteau.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that your portmanteau? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.Where were you on the 29th of January? - A. On a Friday evening, the day of the month I do not know, it was after six o'clock; I went from our warehouse, Old Swan-stairs, with a gentleman and lady, and three parcels, to Gracechurch-street, to get them a coach; I put the three parcels into the coach, and the lady and gentleman, and they gave the direction to go to Balsover-street, Oxford-road; I turned back towards London-bridge; I believe it was just by the Nag's-head, Hare-court, I saw a post-chaise coming up full trot; and I saw a man run to the door of the post-chaise, which I thought was open, till I saw him pull the portmanteau from before the chaise; he came on the pavement where I was, within three or four yards at furthest; when he came on the pavement, he dropped it down in the inside of his coat, and made a little running of it; I run after him, and another man came and gave me a blow on the back of my head against the shutters, I was not down; the per<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170031"/>son that gave me the blow, ran to the man with the portmanteau, I suppose he was not six yards from me, and he catched hold of the portmanteau, and took it away; I was in a confusion, and ran after them both; I came as far as the corner of Great Eastcheap, to turn up towards Cannon-street, it struck in my head somebody else would give me a blow, and I looked round to see if any body was coming after me, and cried out "stop thief." three or four times, very loud; and, afterwards, the men went out of my fight; I was so slurried, I followed one of the men, he went down St. Michael's-lane, I went after him; when I came there, there was a crowd, and the patroles got hold of him, and that was the person that took the portmanteau from the chaise, but it had been taken away from him by the other, in Gracechurch-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw a man go up to the door of the chaise, and draw the portmanteau from under the chaise? - A. Yes; and pull it out; it was before between the wheels.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any man under the perch? - A. No; I don't know there was any body else till I received the blow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The person that was apprehended by the patroles, had not the portmanteau with him? - A. I was not there when he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the persons, whoever they were, that went from the chaise, you followed them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not, while you followed them, an opportunity of seeing their faces? - A. I saw his body, it was very light; he had lank hair behind.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see his face? - A. Yes; I saw his face when he came from the chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you lost fight of the persons before the prisoner was taken? - A. I had not lost fight of them till I called out.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there not a great many personsin Grace-church-street? - A. Upon my word I never counted how many there were; I was in a slurry myself; I was looking after this piece of business.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. How do you know that was the man that was taken? - A. I know by his cloaths he had on then; I went with him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How do you know the man that was stopped was the same man you saw at the chaise? - A. By seeing him before; I saw the gleam of his face.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You very candidly say, you cannot swear to the man? - A. The prisoner at the bar is very like the man that passed by me, and took the watch, and that I pursued; I lost sight of him in Salisbury-court, till he was taken in Shoe-lane.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How came he to be taken? - A. I followed him to the corner of Salisbury-court, where I was exceedingly same, and could not pursue him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cry stop thief? - A. I did not, after I fell down; at first I halloa'd out stop thief, and he ran towards Shoe-lane.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170033"/>Q. When he was taken, did you come up to him? - A. I did, in a few minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came up to him, what coat had he on? - A. A brown coat; and appeared to be the man I pursued.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge him, at that time, with having robbed you? - A. I did; some people said they would take care of him; I said, there should be a constable sent for to take him to the watch-house; they took him, as I thought, to St. Bride's watch-house; as I went by I found it shut; and somebody said, he was taken to the Compter; I went to the Compter, and found him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between you there? - A. Nothing; only I said, you are a clever person, I give you credit for your abilities.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. It was half past seven in the evening? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A great number of people were passing? - A. There were.</p>
               <p>Q. You got into a crowd, and endeavoured to extricate yourself from it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not by when the prisoner was taken? - A. No.</p>
               <p>MORE PRICE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Rowen, at the Globe tavern, Fleet-street: This day fortnight I had been out on business for my master; and I returned between seven and eight in the afternoon; I went through our coffee-room into the kitchen; I turned into the yard, and heard some people mustering in the street; I ran out at a back door, and heard the cry of "stop thief;" I saw Mr. Watkins, just at the end of Salisbury-court, try to catch at the prisoner with a small stick; upon which, he cried, "stop thief;" the prisoner passed me, from Mr. Watkins, up into Shoe-lane; he ran up Shoe-lane, and I ran after him; just at the bottom of Shoe-lane I clapped my hand upon his shoulder, and told him he must stop; there came up two men and said, they would take care of him, and rushed between him and me; I said, I would not lose him; one gave me a blow on the back part of my head; I turned round, and looked at the prisoner; he took the watch out of his pocket, and chucked it under his left arm.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see what sort of a watch it was? - A. No; it was a watch and chain; Mr. Watkins came up, and said, hold him, he has robbed me; they made another attempt to take him from me; I would not let them; and the constable, Bird, came up to assist me; the constable went with me down Fleet-street; and he dropped a bag, with something in it, which was picked up; we took him to the Compter; that is all I know; he had a brown great coat up, with straps backwards and forwards; he had a close coat under it; but I did not take particular notice of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. You heard the cry of stop thief? - A. Yes; and I saw Mr. Watkins trying to catch him; when he cried stop thief, he passed me; he was running.</p>
               <p>Q. And other persons were running also? - A. only a few boys.</p>
               <p>Q. After some time you stopped the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Two men came up and interfered? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That took up some time? - A. A very little time; I never lost my hold of him; they tried to get between me and him.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might the prisoner have gone, or what might be the distance between where Mr. Watkins first pursued him, and where you took him? - A. It might be one hundred yards; it was not two hundred yards before he came to the first turning, I think Harp-alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did these two men go with you afterwards? - A. I did not perceive them afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a good deal of opportunity for this man, if he had the watch in his possession, to have thrown it away; he did not pretend to drop it in the pursuit? - A. Not till he was taken; I saw him pull it out of his right hand pocket, and chuck it out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not there at the time Mr. Watkins lost his watch? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it was some time after he lost his watch that the prisoner was apprehended? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear positively he threw the watch from him? - A. I am positive.</p>
               <p>Jury. Are you sure it was a watch? - A. Yes; because I saw the chain.</p>
               <p>Jury. And you did not take it up? - A. No; there was a crowd.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr Watkins came up? - A. Yes; and desired me to hold him.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you desire Mr. Watkins to look after the watch? - A. I told somebody to pick it up, but the mob came in so upon me, that I could not; Mr. Watkins cried out that he was hurt.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not lose sight of him more than two minutes? - A. It is as much as it possibly could be; the last time I saw him was at Smith and Hartley's door, opposite Serjeant's-inn.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see him near the Globe tavern, Fleet-street? - A. No; that was the time I lost sight of him; I was running down Fleet-street, very near the time the robbery must have been committed.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When you saw the prisoner with the other three men, was he running? - A. Yes; I had been watching them some time up and down Fleet-street.</p>

               <p>Mr. Watkins. This is my watch, my Lord; there was another seal to it, but that is gone; and the case is gone; I cannot swear either to the maker's name, or the number; with respect to the seal, there is my own initial upon it; it is a remarkable small watch; I have not any doubt about its being mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ally. Q. I understand the outside case is not to that watch? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There was an outside case to that watch when you lost it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not seen it since? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know the maker's name, nor number of the watch? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. As to the seal there is the letter W upon it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There are a great many persons, the initial of whose name begins with W? - A. It is very true, certainly; I have no doubt about it; the seal I will swear to.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Have you had this watch lately? - A. No; it is a watch that belonged to a person in Clare-market; it was not cleared at a sale, and I have wore it ever since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have been about four weeks and eight days in London, since I came from Porssmouth; I was second-mate on board a ship there, and I lest her in consequence of some words with the officer; I came up to London to go on board an Indiaman; I expected a parcel to come for me, at the White-horse, Fetter-lane, and I took this bag to get the parcel; hearing a cry of stop thief, in Fleet-street, I saw a few people cross the way, from one side of the way to the other, I joined the pursuit, with an intent to apprehend the people that were running and going up Fetter-lane, or whatever the lane is; I am not positive to the turning, but I believe it is Shoe-lane; I went up there, and in consequence of running up there, a person took hold of me, and said, he supposed me to be the person that had robbed the gentleman that was behind; I told him, I dare say he was mistaken, but if he thought I was the person, I would stay till the gentleman came up, and when he came up, he said, he supposed me to be the person, and six or seven people came up and took me to the Compter; I never saw the watch; the gentleman in the blue coat said, I had it and threw it from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170035"/>under my arm, but I never had the watch; I told him I was willing to stop till the gentleman came up; when the gentleman, in blue, came before the Lord-Mayor, he said first of all he saw me put my hand in his right hand pocket, and take out something, and let it drop down, and another man picked it up; if this man would swear that, I suppose he would swear that a ship's mast was a long-beat, and a thousand men in it it he saw them at night; I know no more of it than the blessed baby unborn; I have plenty of friends-at Portsmouth and Plymouth, but I have none in London; I have served his Majesty seventeen years duly and truly, and never had a blemish upon my character in my life; I have been under four different admirals.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mrs. Yeoman; I was called up by the last witness; I went into the parlour, I lighted a candle; I went towards the street door, and there was a gentleman, who is the prisoner at the bar; I said, my mistress is not at home; if you will please to walk in, she will be at home in a minute; he went into the parlour, and stood in the parlour near the door; I lighted the others candle, and desired him to sit down; I went and stirred the fire; there was a new sheet behind the parlour curtain.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the sheet made up? - A. It was begun, but not finished; my mistress had been to work in the afternoon about it; I gave it a twist and slung it into the back parlour; the prisoner was in the front parlour, sitting on the sofa; I shut the parlour-door, and went into the kitchen again; there was a double knock at the door, I came up stairs and opened it to a gentleman that belonged to the gentlewoman up stairs; and I saw the prisoner sitting sideways, with his face towards the parlourdoor, on the chair; I let the gentleman in, and he went up stairs; I then turned my face towards the prisoner; he said, I am frightened, I am frightened; I am all of a tremble; frightened, said I,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170036"/>what are you frightened at? it is a gentleman belongs up stairs; upon that, he got up, and said he must go; no, says I, stop a few minutes, my mistress will be home in a minute; upon that, he said no, he would go, and call again; then, says he, I will stop; he sat himself down in the same posture as he was before, sideways in the chair; I happened to cast my eyes down between his knees, and through the chair I saw the new linen, it was deposited between the end of the sofa and the side of the chair; upon that, I was much flurried, seeing my mistresses property, that I knew was deposited in another room.</p>
               <p>Q. The same linen you had put in the back-parlour? - A: Yes; he rose, and said he must go; I said no, sir, you shall not; he went to the passage, and I pushed him back; he said he would go; says I, you are a thief, and a villain; and you have robbed my mistress of her property; he got round the corner to the door; he had a great coat on; we had a good deal of tustle, and he got the door open with one of his hands; I pushed it to keep it close; his coat gave way owing to my clasping of him, as he got out; I cried out, "stop thief, for God's sake, stop thief," he has robbed my mistress; I stept pretty close to him, as well as I could; and I never left him till he was taken and brought back.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was brought back, did you see him? - A. Yes; he was the same man that had been in the parlour; I saw the property again in the parlour after he was taken and brought back; I did not see the table-cloths till he was brought back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. How long have you lived with your mitress? - A. Twenty months; I was nurse to her.</p>
               <p>Q. You can tell whether she is a married lady or not? - A. A single lady; she has lost the use of her limbs almost a year and an half; I was nurse to her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had this man been in the house from the time he first came in? - A. It is impossible for me to tell; for I was much alarmed with the sound of a foot walking in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from the parlour when he first came in? - A. I was making one sheet belonging to the new cloth below stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. You were below stairs then all the time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And the prisoner had been about half an hour by himself; a pretty good time, if he had meant to have committed a robbery, to have gone away in you absence? - A. I don't know; I paid very good attention.</p>

               <p>On the 3d of February, near eight o'clock, I heard the cry of "stop thief;" I live in Charlotte-street, Mary-le-bonne; I was taking my window bar in, which I always do at eight o'clock; I ran immediately, and caught the prisoner at the bar; he swung me about three yards, as near as I can guess, and a man of the name of Gibson came up to my assistance, and we took him to Mrs. Yeoman's house; No. 82, Queen Ann-street East; when we got him into the house, he sat down in a chair near a sofa, and laid his elbow on the sofa; at this time he had his right hand in his pocket; he said he was very saint, and I saw something drop from him, which turned out to be two tablecloths, or napkins, or breakfast cloths; Gibson took them up; I should know them again if I was to see them; when I caught hold of him, he begged I would let him go; I told him I would when I brought him to the place where he came from.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took charge of the table-cloths? - A. The constable of the night, at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. But who took charge of him before that? - A. One Captain Devereux; he belongs to the military; I saw them afterwards at the watch-house, and am sure they were the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. Whether you mean to say, that the property dropped from him or the chair? - A. When he sat down there was nothing in the chair.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of observing that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>EDWARD GIBSON sworn.</p>
               <p>On the third of February, I pursued the prisoner, with the last witness; I did not come up with him till Gardener had him by the collar.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the prisoner at the bar? - A. It was; I took hold of him on the right side with my left hand, and as we were bringing him through High-street, Mary-le-bone, the people said, he was dropping things out of his pocket; I said he should drop no more, and I seized his hand, and kept hold of it till he came back to the house; he sat down in a chair near a sofa; he drew his hand out of his right hand pocket, and there were two small tablecloths in his hand; he dropped them; that is all I know about it; I took them up, and they were immediately given into the hands of a gentleman, who was in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know these table-cloths again if you were to see them? - A. I believe I should.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put any mark upon them? - A. Not that night, but the next day, at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those you put your mark upon the same that dropped from the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Gibson. These are the table-cloths that dropped from the prisoner, and that I saw at the Justice's; there is my mark upon them.</p>
               <p>(The table-cloths, being produced, were deposed to by Chapman and Green.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, I was coming by and met with the woman at the door; I was very much in liquor; and I asked her if it was to her I spoke a few minutes before; that she said no; I used to come to the house to see ladies: Mrs. Yeoman lodges ladies of the town; and coming to see a lady there, I asked if the lady in the parlour was at home, who had usually lodged there; she insisted upon my walking in, and she would serch her mistress; I said no, I would come again; do, sir, pray walk in; I told her, no; now do, sir, pray walk in; she called to her fellow-servant for a pair of would candles for a gentleman; pray do walk in, sir; I am much obliged to you, I had rather not; I will call some other opportunity; by these persuadings both the women got me into the parlour, and I sat down upon the sofa; as to meddling with any of their property, I know nothing at all about it; that gentleman asked at the Justice's how he was to come by the 10l.(The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.)</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Your Lordship knows there is a reward for highway robbery, and none for privately stealing.(The former indictment read).</p>

               <p>Q. Then you went on very familiarly together; he talking to you, and you to him; how was that? - A. We did not talk much.</p>

               <p>Q. Therefore you were not at all surprised at his staying for you? - A. I thought it was as free for him as me; I did not think of seeing him.</p>

               <p>I live with Elwin and Flower, wholesale silk merchants, in St. Paul's Church-yard: On Tuesday, the 9th of February, a little after seven, I was going to Gower's-walk; turning out of Church-lane into Gower's-walk, the prisoner passed by me, walking; the prosecutrix desired me to stop that man, for he had robbed her; the prisoner ran about an hundred yards; he was not out of my sight; I pursued him to the Prince of Wales, the corner of Union-street; and he was taken round the corner, by a person, before I came up to him; his name, I believe, is Robertson; I never saw the prisoner before; I did not see him talking to her, not she to him; when I first saw him, he was walking, and she was walking after the prisoner; and she said, first of all, "stop that man, stop him, for he has robbed me."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you go with this woman to Clerkenwell, upon the former occasion, as well as the last? - A. Yes; I was twice to find the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how the second indictment came to be for robbery? - A. As far as I can find, the officer belonging to the office came out, and said, the indictment was wrong found, because the prosecutrix had not given her husband's two Christian names.</p>

My Lord, on Tuesday afternoon, I left the India warehouses, in Billiter-lane; I went upon duty in Seething-lane; I am a warder, I left my duty about seven o'clock; I stepped down to Butcher-row, to buy a steak, to carry home to my wife and three children; this woman came by and touched me, I said, my dear, I would have made room for you, if you had spoke; she said, there is room for me, we sell into discourse; she said, she was going into the cheesemonger's shop; I said, I would stop for her; when she got her cheese, she came out, and we walked along, and she said hold of my arm; we went as far as Church-lane, Whitechapel; I told her I was going up Brick-lane; she asked me which was the best way for her to go, up that lane, or up Union-street; I told her Church-lane was the best, because it was paved; she told me she lived in Gower's-walk, and I would, if she liked, walk with her; I was just going to leave her, and she took hold of my arm again; she said, she would not like to see her husband, her husband was a jealous man; she gave me liberties not proper to speak before women, and I took liberties with her; I kissed her afterwards; I found she was a woman with child; I kissed her, and shook hands with her; she said, there was her husband at the corner, and I went away in a hurry, and she called out, stop thief; this young fellow was at the corner all the while, he did not come after me till I got over the way; the man, at the public-house, said, oh, we want you; I pulled out my money, I had 1s. 4d1/4 I had had a pint of beer at a house in Seething-lane; the woman said it was not her shilling; he took my knife from me, and I was locked up; after it was put down what the good woman said, there were two Jews said, "damn him, we will do for him;" they went out, and in about ten minutes the two Jews and this man came back, and pretended they had picked up this box in the middle of the road; I have watched thirteen years in Crosby-square, besides doing business; my character is well known, I have done duty at the India-house.</p>

               <p>I am one of the officers belonging to Bow-street, I know the prisoner at the bar; I apprehended him on Monday the 18th of January, at the Rumpuncheon, a public-house, in Cross-lane, St. Giles's; he was standing in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went away from this place to go to serve his Majesty, as I thought, as a soldier; I was pardoned to serve his Majesty, and was very willing to embrace the opportunity of what was granted me; after receiving sentence of transportation, we embarked at Southampton, and went out, there was a hurricane of wind, and we came back to Spithead, we were forty-nine hours without any think to eat or drink, and every body thinking they were going to the bottom; and when I saw every body making theif escape, I thought I had as much right as any body else.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What regiment were you in? - A. The 65th regiment of foot.</p>

            ; about dusk, on Tuesday the 26th of January, I was leaning over the hatch, I saw the prisoner take a pair of half-boots off the nail at the shop-door, and put them under his coat; I immediately went after him, and he dropped them in the middle of the street, in St. Giles's; I immediately caught him.</p>
               <p>Q. You never lost sight of him? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Jenkins. These are my boots, they have my mark upon them, I always number them, and enter them in a book.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was on the opposite side of the way when the prosecutor was running after somebody; he came and laid hold of me; I never saw the boots; he came up to me in Holborn, and asked if I had a pair of half-boots; several people were running along at the same time; I told him I had none; a man asked how he could charge me with having the boots, when they were lying on the other side of the way.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Summering). Q. Did he drop the boots before you caught him? - A. Yes; he dropped them as soon as I got hold of him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow.</p>
               <p>(The indictment was stated by Mr. Lawes).</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Adair. Gentlemen of the Jury, it becomes my duty to address you, and to call your particular attention to a case of the importance of that which is now brought before you. The crime that is imputed to the unfortunate gentleman at the bar, by this indictment, you well know, is one of the greatest magnitude that can be committed upon society, that of wilfully and maliciously depriving a fellow-creature of his life; and, I flatter myself, you are sufficiently acquainted with the principles and the administration of criminal justice, to be perfectly satisfied in your own minds, without its being suggested by me or any other person, that in proportion to the magnitude of the crime charged, the guide to your judgment ought to be the clearness and precision of the evidence, whereby that charge is supported.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, you are called upon to perform, I am afraid, a painful duty; but it is an honourable duty also to those who faithfully perform it; and you will find yourselves called upon, to pay a diligent attention to the facts that will be laid before you in evidence; and the directions that you will receive from the Bench, with respect to the law that is applicable to those facts; because it is by these alone that the judgments that you are to form ought to be directed. You are to pay no regard to any facts or rumours that may have reached your ears; except those that shall be substantiated upon oath, by evidence in open Court; and, in forming your judgments upon the legal operation of those facts, for or against the prisoner, I am sure you will be inclined to be guided by the direction of the learned Judge who presides, from whom you will receive the most satisfactory information. Gentlemen, whatever it will be my duty to state to you in these observations, is merely pointed to direct your attention to the material circumstances of the case; but whatever you may hear from me respecting either the one or the other, either the fact or the law of this case, you will wholly suspend your minds, as to any impression which they may make one way or the other, in the recollection that my statement of facts ought to have no weight, except so far as they are supported by evidence; nor any idea that I may suggest upon the law of the case, except so far as it is confirmed by the learned Judges upon the Bench.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, to you is entrusted a very important duty; on the one hand, is committed to you, the protection of the life of the prisoner at the bar, against light suspicions, or unfounded accusations; on the other, the administration of justice, and the support of those laws of your country which are calculated for the protection of the innocent, as well as the punishment of the guilty, is entrusted in your hands; you are to administer justice in mercy; when I say justice in mercy, although mercy is a principle which ought never to be lost sight of in the administration of criminal affairs, yet that mercy is always mistaken which is not directed by the principles of wisdom and of justice; for though it is your duty, in the consideration of every fact laid before you, where any matter of doubt shall occur to your minds, to avail yourselves of that presumption in favour of innocence, which is the principle of the law of England; till it is encountered with satisfactory proof; yet, on the other hand, you well know that it is not your duty to shut your eyes against clear and satisfactory evidence; or to decline, upon any principles of false tenderness, the discharge of a painful duty, if that painful duty should fall to your lot: but you will pronounce a conscientious verdict upon the evidence that will be laid before you; and if the effect of that evidence should be such, as when applied to the known laws of the kingdom, shall satisfy you that the prisoner has been guilty of a breach of those laws, in the point alledged by this indictment, however painful the talk may be, it will be your duty to perform that talk, and to find the prisoner guilty. God forbid you should be led to that verdict by any thing but the clearest and most satisfactory evidence; at the same time that I discharge my duty in laying before you these circumstances, which, on the part of the profecution, we are led to believe will, to-day, be established by evidence; after having discharged that duty, no man will feel more satisfaction than myself, if, upon the result of the whole of the evidence, you shall find yourselves fairly justified before God and your Country in delivering the prisoner from the heavy charge with which he stands accused.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, it will be necessary for me now to state to you, the nature of that fact upon which the charge against the prisoner is founded; it is not that sort of dark insiduous murder committed in secret; difficult of proof, dependent upon circumstantial evidence, which is frequently the subject of your enquiry in a court of justice, that will be the subject of your enquiry to-day, it is a killing, in the face of day, publickly and openly, in the face of many witnesses; so that the fact of the death of the unfortunate gentleman who has for many years been no more, the fact that that death was occasioned by the prisoner at the bar, will, I am afraid, not be a matter of much doubt, or much enquiry. Gentlemen, the only question that can exit in this case will be, whether, under the circumstances, that that death was unfortunately occasioned by, the guilt of murder is or not, properly imputable to the prisoner; and, if I am right in the law upon that subject, I am afraid, that upon the application of that law to the facts in evidence, there will be as little doubt upon that question; for whatever may be the no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170043"/>tion of honour, that has been prevalent in this and other countries; whatever impression those notions may have made on the private minds and feelings of mankind, I am afraid they neither can nor ought to find entrance into the Courts of justice; and that the law of this country is, what I believe the law of God also to be-that whoever shall wilfully and deliberately, by pre-concerted appointment, armed with instruments of death, meet another, for the purpose of deciding their differences by the fall of the one or the other; which ever party shall fall, or by whomsoever the original provocation was given, the survivor is guilty of murder, by the laws of God and men. That the degrees of malignity and guilt, annexed to that unfortunate circumstance, may widely differ, is a circumstance that no man feels more than myself; but, whatever may be the degree of malignity and guilt, if once the fact, which constitutes the crime of murder, is clearly and unquestionably established. I conceive of these circumstances are more proper for the consideration of those who are entrusted with the prerogative of mercy, than those who are in the first instance entrusted with the administration of the law. The province of a jury is to investigate the facts, and according to the directions they shall receive from the learned Judge, of the application of those facts to the law, they are, according to their oaths and consciences, to decide whether the party is guilty of that offence which is imputed to him, by the indictment; whether the circumstances of that guilt are such as loudly call for the punishment of the law, or solicit the tender interpositions of mercy, under favourable circumstances afterwards, is not the object of consideration.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I have thought it my duty, in the outset, to state what occurs to me upon that subject, for it is extremely right, that all the circumstances of this unhappy transaction should be laid before you; that public justice may be satisfied, by a full disclosure of every circumstance that may make for or against the unhappy gentleman who now stands upon trial for his life; and if it shall turn out that sort of favourable case, according to the notions and feelings which are implanted in the breast of every man, whatever may be the strict law upon the subject; having, I hope, fairly, and, I am sure, as far as my own opinion goes, faithfully stated to you, what I conceive to be the law, and your duty, acting upon oath, under such circumstances, I shall feel no inclination to press that matter upon your attention. It will, therefore, be my duty, according to the instructions I have received, which I have every reason at present to believe are according to the best information of those from whom I have received them; but which information is liable to mistake, it will be my duty, however, according to that best information, to give you a short and distinct statement of the circumstances attending this transaction, as far as they are material either to the malignity or the degree of guilt imputed to the prisoner; and then it will be your duty upon the whole result of the evidence, to pronounce your verdict, whether the prisoner has, by pre-concerted, deliberate intention, been the death of the unfortunate gentleman who is the subject of this indictment.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, it will be necessary, therefore, to understand the circumstances of this case; that you should not only be acquainted with the fact of the duel itself, but he circumstances immediately connected with it; for I should not think myself at liberty to go into the allegations made on the one side or on the other, that are not immediately connected, or not directly leading to the unfortunate catastrophe that happened. I shall think it my duty neither to attempt to prove or state, as it will be unquestionably your duty to retain your minds perfectly unprejudiced and unbiassed, till you hear the evidence, free from any impressions made by the supposed character of the parties, or by rumours, or loose conversations which have but too much prevailed, upon the subject of this indictment; and feeling that unbiassed mind, and giving that steady attention, which it is your duty to do, to the evidence, you will be guided by that, and that alone, in the opinion that you shall form.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the quarrel which gave rise to this unfortunate duel, originated in a debt of honour, due from Mr. Rowlls to the prisoner at the bar, which will be proved beyond all doubt, I believe, under the circumstances of this case. It will be necessary, therefore, for me, so far, and so far only, as directly leads to this unfortunate transaction, to state to you what has publicly passed on that occation, and what has passed under a degree of examination, that will not be so liable to misrepresentation.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rowlls, at the time of his decease, was a very young gentleman, a gentleman of fortune, and, as I am informed, of character unimpeached, except by those levities of youth which gave rise to the unfortunate transaction; he was a little too found of attending races, plays, and those fashionable amusements, to which young men of fortune are too apt to devote their time, and from that levity of youth arose the circumstance which terminated in his death. I think it was in the year 1780, that he met the prisoner at the bar, who was then a stranger to him, at Ascot races; it appears, from subsequent transactions, that Mr. Rowlls had lost a considerable sum of money to the prisoner at the bar; that circumstance, therefore, gave rise to considerable altereation upon the subject, and security was at length given for a sum of money, not to the prisoner at the bar, but to another. gentleman of the name of Etherington, which afterwards became the subject of dispute; what the nature of that security really was, I shall not presume to state, because that was the subject matter of a dispute, which, to this hour, has never been decided, and therefore on which side the truth lies, I am not entitled to state, not is it material for you to enquire; that security, however, in fact, became the subject of dispute - it being alledged by Mr. Rowlls, that Mr. Etherington was merely a stakeholder, and trustee for Mr. England, for whom this debt was contracted; it being alledged on the other hand, that it was a security for a sum of money, bond-side, advanced and lent Mr. Rowlls, by Mr. Etherington; the security being given by a warrant of attorney to confess the judgment, it became the subject of enquiry in the court in which that judgment was entered; affidavits were made on one side and on the other, each maintaining the truth of their respective allegations, and the court entertained so much doubt upon that subject, as to direct an issue to be tried to determine for what conside<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170044"/>ration the bond, which was the subject of that judgment, could have been given; it being alledged on the one hand, that this was given to Mr. Etherington, as trustee to Mr. England, to cover a gaming debt, which, by law, he could not recover; and on the other hand, that it was money actually lent and advanced. When that cause came on to be tried, it was thought adviseable by the counsel on each side, to compromise the matter, and it was agreed that Mr. Rowlls should pay one half of the sum demanded, with interest; one would have hoped, that, with that compromise, all memory of the transaction had been buried; but a deep resentment lay buried in the mind of the prisoner at the bar, and I believe it will be in proof to you (and if it is not clearly and satisfactorily proved, I beg of you to forget that I have so stated it;) that upon departing from Westminster-half, subsequent to the compromise that I have stated, Mr. England was heard to declare, that the matter should not rest there, but that he would have satisfaction from Mr. Rowlls elsewhere; in what degree that declaration ought to weigh, will be a subject for your consideration, under the direction of the court. Gentlemen, this was, I believe, on the 20th of February, 1784; unfortunately within a few months after this transaction, the parties met together at the same place, where this unfortunate circumstance originated at Ascot races, and there that altercation arose, which was the immediate cause of the duel that followed.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I am happy to be assured that you will have such an account of that altercation, as will probably leave no room for doubt upon that subject; for I see in Court a noble Lord, of high rank and character, who happened, unpleasantly to himself, and, I am sorry that it has given him the trouble of a painful attendance here, happened to be present at that altercation; and, if his Lordship's memory should serve him, distinctly to relate what the conduct of each of the parties was upon that occasion, you will probably think it unnecessary to trouble you with any further evidence upon that subject. I shall state to you, very generally, what I am instructed, passed upon that occasion; and I am happy to state it in the hearing of witnesses present, who will immediately correct me if I am wrong. I understand, that Mr. Rowlls proposing some betts in the booth upon the race-ground, Mr. England interposed with a considerable degree of animosity; and, on the race-ground, before all the gentlemen of the country there assembled, declared, loudly, that the gentlemen ought not to accept of betts from a person who did not pay his debts of honour. I forbear to state the particular words and expressions, because you will hear them so much more satisfactorily from the witness; but that the substance of them was with reference to the transaction, which I have already stated to you, for the purpose of shewing what gave rise to this unfortunate quarrel, namely, the declaraion of Mr. England, that he, not being, a man of honour, had not discharged those debts which he considered he ought to have discharged; that you will conceive necessarily, to a gentleman in Mr. Rowlls's situation, was a charge that must provoke immediate resentment, wounding his honour, upon a very public occasion, in a sensible point. Mr. Rowlls had seen the transaction in a very different light; he was perfectly persuaded that the conduct on his part, had been honourable; and that, therefore, this was manifestly intended to provoke a resentment that should give rise to the unfortunate circumstances that followed. Mr. Rowlls immediately, with that warmth of passion that might be expected from a young man upon such an occasion, came up to him in a threatening posture; Mr. England, in a threatening manner also, desired him to refrain from personal violence, informing him, that if he had any thing to say to him, he knew where to find him; the meaning of that language is to every man perfectly understood; a meeting took place between Mr. England and a gentleman in the army, who interfered, and the unfortunate business was at that time settled between them, in what manner we can only know from that gentleman; and, therefore, as he will appear here as a witness, I will not state it to you; but an appointment was made on the morning following, to meet, with pistols, at Cranford-bridge, to determine the animosity that subsisted between the parties. In consequence of this, they met at the appointed time and place, with every circumstance of deliberation on both sides, each bringing his second, and pistols; with every preparation for the contest that was to ensure, and one or more surgeons were directed to attend, in case of consequences that were likely to take place. I am afraid, therefore, that if these facts (which were too public to admit of much doubt) are satisfactorily proved, you can admit of no doubt, in your minds, that, whatever were the true merits of the quarrel, their meeting was deliberate and pre-concerted; that, in consequence of a deliberate purpose entertained the day before, and after sleeping a night upon it, with all those circumstances of deliberation and forethought, which exclude that indulgence, I am afraid, which the law gives to the sudden passion of a man. These parties met, with instruments of death, for the purpose of deciding the differences and animosity subsisting between them at that meeting, having been so deliberately planned, the circumstances that passed will be capable of proof, by witnesses of undoubted credit; with respect to that, it is only necessary for me to state, that that unfortunate duel was carried on with an unusual degree of animosity and perseverance. The parties (for I will speak of them at present jointly) did not appear to be satisfied with that sort of vindication of their honour, which has prevailed in this unfortunate, fashionable mode of deciding differences; they did not satisfy themselves with exchanging each a shot, shewing that they met like men of honour, and had kept their appointment; but shot after shot was fired to the amount of four or five discharges on each side, before the deceased fell, that is a circumstance unquestionably material, to which party that obstinacy is imputable, the evidence will best enable you to judge. I am of course instructed, on the part of the prosecution, to state, that it was imputable to the prisoner at the bar; that he refused to be satisfied with those usual modes of satisfaction, which the laws of honour, essentially differing from the laws of the country, have introduced; and that, by the declarations made by him, at that time, you will find, that the object of the duel, I am afraid, was not so much the satisfaction of his honour, as either the fulfilling of his revenge for the injury he had sustained, in not being paid the full amount of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170045"/>debt he had demanded, or enforcing that payment by a means, which I will venture to say, if that is the case, neither the laws of honour, nor of the country, can justify; for the subject of duelling, when it it is applied not to the restoration of injured honour, but to enforce the payment of debts, is equally repugnant to the principles of honour as of law. It will, therefore, with respect to the degree of guilt, in this case, be undoubtedly material, that these circumstances should be laid before you; and if it should turn out to he as it is stated to me, I am afraid they will afford a very strong suspicion of the conduct of the unfortunate gentleman at the bar. It will appear, that, in the interval-between the different sirings, certain conversations took place between these gentlemen and their seconds, and propositions were made, which must necessarily relate to the transactions I before referred to, and could relate to nothing else; for that sums of money were offered, by the second of Mr. Rowlls, to Mr. England, and rejected by him; which sums of money put, as I am instructed, the principles of honour entirely out of the question.</p>
               <p>Having stated this, which it is my duty to state, from the instructions I have received, which, if they are not proved, I cannot too often repeat to you, that it will be your duty to forget, and lay out of the question. Gentlemen, a circumstance is stated to me, that after several shots had been fired, Mr. Rowlls's pistol went off; and, either by design or accident, was fired into the ground, at so small a distance from himself, that it appeared not to have been directed to the prisoner; and, at the same time, I am instructed, that the prisoner fired his pistol into the air; that circumstance will have, undoubtedly, all the weight that it ought to have in your consideration, and happy would it have been if that had terminated the dispute; whose fault it was that it did not, you will best hear from the witnesses; unhappily it did not; negotiations took place, the parties still remained unsatisfied, and, with a degree of perseverance, I had almost said serocity, unusual upon those occasions, the pistols were again loaded; Mr. England received the fire of Mr. Rowlls, who, I believe, fired first, upon that occasion also: and then, reserving his fire, with some deliberation, he discharged that pistol at the deceased, which killed him on the spot; it wounded him in the groin to such a degree, that he immediately fell, and was carried dead fromthe field, that therefore his death was occasioned, in fact, by the prisoner, in consequence of a premeditated plan for meeting to decide their differences with the weapons and instruments of death; I am afraid there will not be a possibility of doubt; I am afraid that will impose upon you a duty, which undoubtedly will be more or less painful to you, according as the other circumstances of the case shall turn out for or against the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, I have thus stated to you (not with very minute particularity which I have avoided for the reasons I have told you) the general substance of the evidence that is to be laid before you, upon the part of the prosecution, It remains, however, to account for a circumstance that cannot but have struck your minds in the attention you have paid to the opening of this case, and that is the dates which you must have noticed, and the distance of time that has elapsed between the death of this gentleman and the prosecution for that death; and it becomes necessary that this matter may stand fairly, and to vindicate the conduct of the prosecution itself, it becomes indispensibly necessary to state to you, that that has been wholly occasioned by the prisoner; I do not wish to draw any stronger inferences of guilt from that circumstance, than your own unbiassed opinions and consciences may lead you to think it warrants; but in point of fact, immediately upon the decease of this unfortunate gentleman, Mr. England sted from the spot, and sted from his country, and remained abroad for a number of years; the prosecution was instituted, proceedings were had against Mr. England, he having sted; the only proceedings which can be had against an absent man were entered, and Mr. England was, by the prosecutrix, outlawed; under that outlawry he remained till lately, when he returned again to England, but, it was not till after, I think, four of the witnesses, who were examined before the coronor, who held an inquisition on the body of the unfortunate gentleman deceased, were dead. Whether by that circumstance public justice will be deprived of the evidence of those witnesses, will depend upon the opinion of the Court, whether they are or not admissible in evidence, if they have been properly authenticated in the manner which the law directs, I conceive them to be admissible in evidence; when Mr. England returned to this country, and appeared at large, he was apprehended upon the outlawry; that outlawry has been reversed, and he now stands upon his trial upon the original indictment. You may, perhaps, think, that after the lapse of so many years, there is a degree of animosity in persisting in coming forward with the prosecution against this unfortunate gentleman for his life; upon that subject, I can only say, that it would be a principle dangerous to the administration of justice, if persons, who withdraw themselves from the reach of the laws of their country, were afterwards to avail themselves of that circumstance, either as a circumstance in their own favour, or as the smallest degree of imputation upon those, who are called upon by a duty, perhaps little less painful than your own, to bring that prosecution into a court of justice. But the feelings and duty of a mother (for it is a mother who is the prosecutrix in this instance) the mother of the unfortunate gentleman, who fell by the hands of the prisoner, the feeling, and the duty of a mother would not permit her to suffer that person whom she conceived to be the murderer of her son, to walk at large in this country, after the commission of such an act, till there had been a full investigation of his conduct, by a court and jury of his country; that investigation I will do her the justice to believe and to assure you, on her behalf, that whatever may be her feelings as a mother, she wishes they may be directed by the principles of public justice only. And, gentlemen, if you should find yourselves warranted by the evidence under the direction in point of law, of the learned Judge to release the prisoner at the bar, I trust the animosities will be buried in the grave of her son, and that she will be perfectly satisfied with your verdict; but I have no doubt that you will pay that attention which the importance of this case deserves, that you will deliberate, with every indulgence that the case of the prisoner requires, consistent with law and justice; and if you find yourselves upon the evidence warranted to doubt that the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170046"/>death was occasioned by the prisoner, in consequence of a pre-concerted purpose, you will judge whether the case more or less interests your feelings to render the discharge of your duty more or less painful; it will be your duty to deliver him into the hands of public justice, accompanied with mercy, under the direction of those by whom the laws are now to be administered.</p>
               <p>The Right Hon. the Earl of DERBY sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Mingay. Q. Does your Lordship recollect any thing which took place at Ascot races, in June, 1784? - A. I cannot particularly swear to the year; I have been there several years; but, I believe, I can save the Court a great deal of trouble by saying, that I was present at a dispute which took place between the prisoner at the bar and Mr. Rowlls.</p>
               <p>Q. Will your Lordship have the goodness to relate how it commenced, and how it proceeded? - A. I must preface what I have to say on this subject, by stating, that at such a distance of time, it is very difficult for any body to state, with that sort of accuracy that a man would wish upon oath, particular words in a case of this sort; but as accurately as I can, I will endeavour to relate the circumstances that took place; I must also add another circumstance, that I was perhaps at as great a distance from the transaction, as the nature of the place we were in would admit, the transaction taking place at one end of the booth, I being at the other end; but the first thing that struck my attention was, an appeal from the prisoner at the bar to the company, by way of caution, and the purport of it was, not to bet with Mr. Rowlls, as he was a person who neither paid the money he betted, nor the money which he lost; to the words I do not prosess to be accurate, but that was the purport of them; Mr. England was then sitting upon a bench or stand, which might be as wide as this (pointing to the table), and his face turned to the people in the stand; Mr. Rowlls came up to him in a very boisterous and violent manner, and appeared to me to offer to strike him, adding words to this effect, "what do you mean by that you rascal, you scoundrel," or some such words; Mr. England behaved with as much coolness and temper as ever I witnessed upon any occasion in my life; the prisoner said, "stand off, for if you strike me, I shall be obliged to knock you down, (he had a stick in his hand); our altercation has already disturbed the company a great deal too much; if you have any thing further to say to me, you or your friend," or words to that purpose,"know where I am to be found;" some further altercation took place between the parties at that time, as I have reason to believe, both from the circumstance of their remaining in that sort of situation for some time, (though from the distance at which I stood, and the noise in the stand, I could not distinctly hear) and also from having heard so from credible witnesses since; sometime after this the parties withdrew, and from that time to this I believe I have never seen one or the other.</p>

             called in.</p>
               <p>My Lord, as there has been a report gone abroad, that I was second to one of the gentlemen, I should wish to put myself under your Lordship's protection; if your Lordship can give any better advice, I shall be happy to take it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. If Mr. Donnisthorpe objects to be examined, we are all of opinion that it ought not to be pressed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adair. I certainly shall not press it.</p>
               <p>Capt. Donnisthorpe. I have no objection to throw any light upon the subject, as a gentleman, and a man of honour, provided I do not criminate myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. The very form of the oath renders it unnecessary for us to object, because he must relate the whole.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adair. Will your Lordship permit, that he having been reported to be in the situation of an accessary to this fact, be examined as an accessary.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. I cannot make up my mind upon that subject. Can you suggest to the Court, in what way we can admit him; giving him an assurance that he shall never be indicted as an accessary.(The witness ordered to withdraw).</p>
               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adair. My Lord, in the first place, it appears highly probable, that the evidence of Capt. Donnisthorpe will be material to the ends of public justice on the one side or the other; because if Capt. Donnisthorpe was present, and accompanied the party in the field, circumstances must be within his knowledge, very materially affecting the merits of this question, which every way his evidence might turn out, whether favourable or unfavourable to the prisoner, I am not now at liberty even to presume; I would rather leave the question, therefore, in the hands of the Court; seeing, as I think your Lordships must do, that this is evidence material for the information of the Court, and material to public justice, and that your Lordship's admitting him now as an evidence for the Crown, will be a protection to him; your Lordship's sitting in a Commission of Oyer and Terminer, stand in the same situation as your Lordships do as Justices of Assize; if it is necessary for public justice, to admit this gentleman as an evidence, he will be admitted in the same way that other witnesses are.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. And the Attorney-General would grant a noli proseqnt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adair. And even if he is indicted afterwards, no Court would proceed against him, having given evidence before your Lordships.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. I will tell you what at present we incline to do, and to hear Mr. Erskine's objection to it; we cannot absolutely protect this witness, but we can tell him, that if he chuses to tell the truth and the whole truth, that though he has no right to the King's pardon, yet, upon the recommendation of this Court, there is no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170047"/>doubt but he will have it; and leave it to himself whether he will be examined or not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. I have very little to say to your Lordships, upon this question, there is but one idea occurs to my mind upon that. I think if there be any one thing which distinguishes the character of English justice above all other, it is the great caution with which precedents are made, when there is a particular instance on which some other person might be convicted. I am very little accustomed, as your Lordships know, to stand in the situation which I do; it has not happened a great many times, in the course of my professional duty; and though I do not affect to be much acquainted with the forms, though I am with the general principles of criminal justice, I never heard of an instance of a witness being addressed in the manner in which this witness is proposed to be addressed; many witnesses have stood in the predicament that this witness does, and I submit to your Lordships, it would be making a promise which the Court cannot legally do; and, my Lord, after the excellent opening of my honourable and learned friend, the evidence of Captain Donnisthorpe cannot be necessary to prove what he proposes to prove.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord: your Lordships will forgive me, if I take the liberty of adding a few words, in a case of such importance; and, my Lord, I really feel myself in a much more embarrassed situation than before, because I am perfectly aware, that if Capt. Donnistorpe should not be examined, very important facts, in favour of the unfortunate gentleman at the bar, must be excluded from the consideration of the Jury. My Lord, we are not now debating whether this gentlemen is to be examined, aye or no, but whether he is to be put into a situation of indemnity; I must, for one, take the liberty of interposing my objections to his being placed in that situation. My Lord, I have not heard from the learned gentleman, who opened this case, any precedent for such indemnity; I will state several precedents, from whence, the impossibility of a witness being placed in that situation, is, I think, clearly to be inferred; I shall state them from memory, and, I believe, that memory will be found to be correct. I had the good fortune to pass many of my younger years under the learned gentleman who has opened this cause, and, if I know any thing of the principles of criminal law, it was from the advocate for this prosecution that I have learned them.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I remember several instances, while I practised in this Court; the first is, the case of Dr. Dodd, who was tried for the forgery of a bond upon a noble Lord; upon that occasion, it was not conceived, that the attesting witness to that bond, who certainly had no moral guilt in that transaction; it did not occur to any body, that he could be entitled to any hope of indemnity; but that course was taken which is the constant practice, that an accomplice in guilt may entitle himself to a pardon, by making, antecedently to the time of trial, a full confession of his guilt, and so obtaining his pardon; thereby giving him such a claim upon the clemency of the Crown, as could not resisted, In that case, Mr. Robertson was the witness, and he was taken sub silentia before the Grand Jury; at which one of your Lordships, who I believe formed a part of that Court, was sorry, saying, that a counsel for the prosecution shall not be permitted to apply privately for a witness be carried to the Grand Jury; but the Court were to be asked leave to take the witness. It is a thing I have seen an hundred times since I have attended in this place.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I now come to the case of Mr. Puresoy; a case where I had the honour of conducting the prosecution, and my learned friend, Mr. Erskine, had that gentleman's life entrusted to his care. General Stanwich was the second; he was called, and so anxious were they, that persons absolutely attended as counsel for the witness, and yet there was no idea of indemnity in that case.</p>
               <p>My Lord, the next is, the case of Mr. Allen and Mr. Morris, who were tried at this bat; I was not present; my learned friend, who was then Recorder, might be present; Mr. Allen was a principal in the duel; Mr. Morris was Mr. Allen's second; and the gentleman who fell, was Mr. Delaney; Mr. Delaney, I believe, was his second; in that case, the second for the person who fell was examined as a witness; and he was not permitted to ask for the indemnity now asked by Capt. Donnisthorpe; and, I trust, that as it never has been done, your Lordship will not now make the precedent.</p>
               <p>My Lord, there is another case; the case of Colonel Gordon; and there was no question but the death of Col. Thomas was occasioned by his hand; the death was proved beyond a possibility of doubt; I had the honour of being one of the Colonel's counsel; Lord Chief Justice, then Lord Chief Baron, Eyre, presided; Capt. Hill, if I do not mistake, was the second to Colonel Gordon; he had all the feelings of a man of honour about him; he did not wish to be examined; and the Lord Chief Baron immediately, of his own motion. stated to Capt. Hill this: - Capt. Hill, it has appeared in this cause, that you have had a share in this matter, which may involve you in a degree of criminality; you may chuse whether you will be examined or not. Capt. Hill felt as every man of honour felt; he wished not to be examined; but, considering that his evidence might be of use to the Colonel, he submitted to be examined; bat not upon an offer of indemnity; and, therefore, I contend, that Capt. Donnisthorpe cannot be examined upon such promise of indemnity.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adair. My Lord, I shall not press this matter one jot further than your Lordship shall be perfectly satisfied, that what you are about to do, is regular and conducive to the ends of justice; I reply rather on account of the argument used against it, than from any anxiety that I feel upon the point, for I have other witnesses to the fact.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. Then Brother Adair, let Captain Donnisthorpe be called in, and I will tell him the situation in which he stands; if he chuses to take the risk, there will be an end of it.</p>

               <p>Court. Mr. Donnisthorpe; you have been called here as a witness, and you hesitate to take the oath, doubting how far what you say may affect you hereafter; now, in answer to that doubt, the Court tell you this; they cannot compel you to be examined, but if you chuse to be examined, you must fulfil the terms of your oath, which is, to tell every thing you know, the truth, the whole<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170048"/>truth, and nothing but the truth; you will have that honorary claim to the mercy of the Crown, which all accomplices, in criminal cases, have always had; and it is the established practice of the Courts of Justice of this country, where a witness does acquit himself honourably and fairly between the Crown and the party, that the Court should use its influence to protect that witness against future charges; if, under these circumstances, you chuse to be examined, the Court will hear you; if you think yourself not sufficiently secure, the Court cannot compel you; if you are examined, you will be liable to the whole cross-examination of the Counsel for the prisoner; and you must tell every thing you know respecting this business; I cannot explain your duty in shorter words than those of the oath; it must be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Captain Donnisthorpe. I will be guided by your Lordship's advice.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you in the month of June, 1784, go to Cranford-bridge with any body in a carriage? - A. I took up at Turnham-green a lady, to go to Cranford-bridge, with a Dr. Morrell; I used to stop at Mr. Goddard's, at Cranford-bridge, as I went backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Q.What passed at Cranford-bridge that took your particular attention? - A. I stopped there to freshen my horses, and for the lady to get out, which she generally used to do; when I stopped, there was a lad waiting with a post-chaise; he was the first boy; what he said to me induced me to go through the house; as soon as I had got the lady out of the carriage, I went to the back of Mr. Goddard's garden, and there were some gentlemen fighting a duel in the common field about 50 or 60 yards from the garden.</p>
               <p>Q.Describe to my Lord, and the Gentlemen of the Jury, what you observed? - A. I saw no more than four; one of them, as soon as I came to the hedge side, I knew was Mr. Rowlls; two of them stood to the east and two to the west; it might be about 18 yards from each other; Mr. Rowlls was dressed in a light coloured waistcoat, with stripes round the pocket-holes, and narrow lace up the border, I cannot say positively, but to the best of my recollection he had no coat on; I heard some lady cry out, "Gentlemen, is not three times enough to try your courage, or do you want to murder one another;" a Lady D'Arterie they called her; soon after the same lady, to the best of my knowledge by the voice, said, Lord D'Arterie wanted to speak to them, and then they all four came very near where I heard the voice come from, to the best of my recollection, but I did not hear any conversation pass; they then went back to their ground again that they came from, and presented their pistols at each other; Mr. Rowlls's pistol went off, and the other gentleman's did not go off; I did not know his name; they said it was a Mr. England; then he presented the pistol again, and it went off, and shot Mr. Rowlls in the groin, as near<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170049"/>as I can recollect; he took a bit of a feel, and fell on his left side.</p>
               <p>Q.What then became of the person who had shot him? - A. He went through the field, I believe, with the rest of the people; I should have interfered for Mr. Rowlls, as I knew him so well, to have prevented it, but there was a cry of keep off, that our lives were in danger, and to leave the business alone; but I cannot say whether it came from Mr. Rowlls's party or the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go up towards Mr. Rowlls as he lay on the ground? - A. I cannot speak to that.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you an opportunity to speak to Mr. Rowlls? - A. No; when I went through the hedge into the field, I could not see any life in him; I took up the pistol that was in his right hand, and went and said, Mr. Rowlls was no more; and then I saw the two gentlemen who stood to the west come round into the bowling-green house, and put their pistols into a box, which they put into a port-chaise, and made the best of their way towards London; one of them came out of the chaise again to get a sword, or pistol, or something he had left behind and got in again.</p>
               <p>Q.From the opportunity you had of observing the person who shot Mr. Rowlls, are you able to guess whether you should know the person again? - A. I don't know that I should; I don't think I should; I did not know any of them but Mr. Rowll.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you know him; who was he? - A. He was a <rs id="t17960217-27-viclabel159" type="occupation">brewer</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. He was rather a wild, dissipated young man? - A. I don't know; he was a joculer, merry young man.</p>
               <p>Q.The two gentlemen that went away, went away in a chaise and pair? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a chaise and pair waiting for Mr. Rowlls and his friend? - A. No; I saw but one chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. If you don't know it, it is easy to say so; do you happen to know whether there was a chaise and four in readiness for Mr. Rowlls? - A. No, I do not.</p>

               <p>Q. How far distant were you from the combatants then? - A. I suppose, not above a dozen, or fourteen yards, as nigh as I can recollect; it was a cart-house upon the same land. I saw Mr. Rowlls with his coat off; I did not know Mr. England; Mr. Rowlls, and Mr. Donnisthorpe, his second, walked up to the other gentleman, and his second, and I think I heard one say he would give 100l. and the other said, he would have 200l.; and then Mr. Rowlls turned short upon his left, went to his ground, and fired at Mr. England.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say who it was that said he would give 100l.; and who it was that said he would have 200l.? - A. I cannot recollect; I have had two sits of a fever since, so that my memory has failed me very much; one just before last Christmas, and the other just after this affair happened; I cannot recollect many things that I should do in my business now.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Sandeford.) Q. You say you saw a pistol presented just before Mr. Rowlls fell; was it fired as soon as it was presented? - A. It was a considerable time, so that a person had time to take a particular aim.</p>

               <p>Jury. Q. You said the pistol snapped; was it primed afterwards? - A. No; he held it in his right hand.</p>
               <p>Q. That was Mr. Rowlls's pistol? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.But the other pistol that did not go off, did you see it primed in order to discharge it afterwards? - A. I did not particularly notice; there was not any flash in the pan, so that the priming might remain in; but it went off afterwards, because I saw him fall.</p>
               <p>Q. What time do you think it was from the pistol snapping first, till you saw it fired? - A. I cannot speak to the time; It might be the space of a second or two.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Lawes. Q. Did you live at Cranford-bridge in 1784? - A. Yes; I worked, as gardener, at Mr. Goddard's; I was there when two gentlemen came into the room where I worked; I was nailing a tree against the wall; I did not know them; I saw them open a box with pistols in it; and they got out at the window, instead of out of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round, and tell us if you see either of the persons here? - A. I cannot be sure, because I never saw the gentleman before nor since; I saw but two fires; I cannot say which fired first or last; but I saw Mr. Rowlls fall, and the other gentleman got into a chaise and went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many pistols were fired?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170050"/>- A. I heard as many as five, but I cannot say any further.</p>
               <p>The Right Hon. LORD CREMORNE sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Sergeant Adair. Q. Did your Lordship stop at Cranford-bridge, at the time that the affair happened, which is the subject of this enqury? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Will your Lordship have the goodness to tell us what you saw and heard at the time; you were at that time Lord d'Arterie? - A. Yes; I went up stairs to write a note, to send back by the postision; while I was writing, I heard a shot; I was told there was a duel fighting; I immediately went down to a field where there were ten or twelve people; there was the Rev. Mr. Burrows, and Lady d' Arterie, met at the bottom of the stairs; Mr. Burrows and I agreed to go down and endeavour to stop further disagreement; to see if it could not be adjusted; we went down to the hedge, and Mr. Burrows addressed himself to the combatants; the second of Mr. Rowlls told us, we had no business there; it was not an affair of ours; and desired we would go away; upon this, there was no answer made; Mr. England advanced some steps towards us, took off his hat, and said these words, "Gentlemen, (says he) I have been cruelly treated, highly injured in my honour and character, let there be a reparation made to that, and I am ready to have done this moment." Immediately upon Mr. England's retiring to his ground again, the second of Mr. Rowlls addressed us a second time; and told us, it was no affair of ours at all, that if we did not go away, he should be obliged, however unwillingly, to make use of the word impertinent; Lady d'Arterie was there, while we were speaking, and fearing some words might pass disagreeably, she ran down alarmed along side of the hedge, where we were; and told the second, upon his making use of that word, "Sir, (says the) neither Mr. Burrows nor Lord'd Arterie, mean the least impertinence, be assured they do not; only give them leave to try if they cannot interfere so as to prevent the consequences."Mr. Rowlls's second said, "Gentlemen, I beg you will go away; madam, I beg you will go away." Upon that, we retired; the Rev. Mr. Antrobus went up, with Lady Cremerne, and I don't know whether Mr. Burrows went up with her, to prevent her seeing any consequences that might shock her; I staid in the bower till I saw Mr. Rowlls fall.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your Lordship an opportunity of seeing by whom the shot was fired, upon which Mr. Rowlls fell? - A. I did; that person was Mr. England.</p>
               <p>Q.Should you know the man again? - A. I never saw him but that once in my life, that I am not clear, about it; before Mr. England fired his pistol, Mr. Rowlls came up and spoke, but so low, that I did not hear what passed; Mr. England stood at his arm and drew back the pistol; I don't know what it was owing to, and Mr. Rowlls came up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Erskine. Q. Your Lordship has given evidence so very distinctly, that the Court and Jury have an opportunity of knowing it, and I shall only ask you one question; you have stated the language in which Mr. England addressed your Lordship, which is too plain to require a comment from me; did your Lordship see any thing which took off the impression made upon your mind by what he said to you of his disposition to peace? - A. The impression upon my mind was, that he was desirous of being done with it, if there was that reparation made to his honour.</p>
               <p>Q.On the other hand you observed great violence on the part of Mr. Rowlls's second? - A. I certainly did.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted Mr. Rowlls was near enough to be witness to that violence of his second? - A. He was close behind him.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Burrows, I believe, is a very respectable clergyman, and a friend of your Lordship's? - A. Nobody more so; he is since dead.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Will your Lordship have the goodness to step down towards the bar, and see if your Lordship knows any person there?(The Court ordered that several persons should stand with Mr. England, at the bar).</p>
               <p>Lord Cremorne. A. I am not quite clear, my Lord; it is so long ago, that I cannot upon my oath say.</p>

               <p>Mr. Mingay. Q. Have you any doubt upon your mind? - A. No; I was present at the time this unfortunate affair happened; I went to Cranford-bridge, at the request of Mr. Rowlls, the deceased, as a friend of his; we were at Windfor the night before the duel; and he asked me to go over with him; I heard two pistols fired; I saw nothing of the duel; but I met the prisoner after it was over, going into a chaise; a girl said, "Good God! Mr. Rowlls is shot!" Mr England came up at the same time, with two pistols in his hand; he threw up one of them in the air, and said, "yes; and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170051"/>I would not have shot him now, if he had behaved like a gentleman.</p>

               <p>Q. How late was it when you left him? - A. Between ten and eleven o'clock; I lived at Eton at that time, and I went home.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you with him when he drank some spirits in the morning? - A. No; I did not see him in the morning.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adair. Q. Do you remember, about the month of February, 1784, any proceedings, in Westminster-hall, between you and Mr. England?</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. You must not preface your question by appealing to that which you cannot prove in Court; alluding to certain proceedings, which are, not proved, neither can be proved; and in the next place, this being charged in June, you have not shewn any connexion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. Q. Do you mean to give any intermediate evidence?</p>
               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adair. A. No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. Then we are all of opinion you should not offer it.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Lord Derby). Q. You have given us an account of the conversation that passed at Ascot, can your Lordship tell how long that was before the duel was fought? - A. I know nothing of the duel, of my own knowledge; but, I believe the duel took place next morning.</p>
               <p>(Mr. England put in a written defence, which was read by the clerk, as follows):</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, I will lay the condition of my mind before you, as it existed throughout the transactions, which, indeed, were the causes of the unfortunate event, which brings me. a long exiled and suffering prisoner, before you; and I address you most solemnly, and in the presence of God, to whom alone I can appeal for the truth of my declaration. Mr. Rowlls had soread reports injurious to my character; and to remove this unfounded and ruinous imputation, I solemnly declare, all my conduct was directed; and it is surely incredible that I should be desirous to expose my life to the most imminent peril, in pursuit of an insignificant sum of money; but yielding to the feelings of honour, I was anxious to redeem myself from shame, urged by a principle that has always been considered by juries with tenderness and indulgence. The situation in which, most unfortunately I was placed, by his conduct, led to the altercation in the stand, as proved by Lord Derby, was resented by the deceased, by a public challenge, accompanied with insults and reproaches, and threats of blows, which left no alternative between my consent to meet him, and the relinquishment of the title of a gentleman, and of every comfort that renders human life any other than an intolerable burden. Gentlemen, still speaking in the presence of God, who knows the heart of man, I received my adversary's challenge, and met him in the field with no other sensation than regard to my wounded character, which I laboured to repair without danger to Mr. Rowlls, and struggled to avert from him all dangers, in a manner almost without parallel in any one case where affairs of honour have ever unfortunately been brought to such a crisis; after I had exposed myself three times to death, because the declaration which was to restore my character, was refused; I fired my pistol in the air, the signal of peace and reconciliation; I did so to give Mr. Rowlls an opportunity to do me justice, without a possible restection upon his own character; I did that at the risk even of my own honour to satisfy his, and to avoid the horror I felt at being the cause of death, by the possible accidents of that unfortunate situation. The honourable and learned advocate for the Crown indulgently directed your attention to this circumstance in my favour; after the interference of the gentlemen who attended us, all justice was refused, and I was left to the dreadful alternative of retiring disgraced and dishonoured, or submitting to the progress of the duel, which he was resohed to pursue; again, I received Mr. Rowlls's fire, without the least disposition to return it, exposing my life to further peril, keeping danger from him, seeking nothing but the privilege of living not disgraced, which, in my mind, is worse than not living at all. For the proof of these transactions, I need not now appeal to the testi<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170052"/>mony of witnesses, because a most disinterested and honourable nobleman providentially present, by mere accident, upon the spot, has proved it; but it has appeared in evidence, that the unfortunate gentleman came to the field with sentiments and feelings widely and fatally different from mine, as appears by Lord Cremorne's evidence; but unfortunately Mr. Rowlls came resolved, that nothing should terminate the quarrel but his death or mine; and with the resolution also, to make no reparation to my honour, though his could not have suffered; because I offered to go publickly to the stand, and satisfy him. My own conscrence acquits me of malice; and I leave myself in your hands, upon the liberal principles avowed by the learned and honourable advocate for the prosecution, who does not wish to shut out of your view those circumstances which, in this day, may bring before you for judgment, the most humane and best of mankind.</p>

               <p>The Right Hon. the MARQUIS of HERTFORD sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. I believe your Lordship has had some opportunity of acquaintance with Mr. England? - A. None, previous to the unhappy affair which occasions his appearing at this bar; but I have observed his humane conduct abroad for fifteen years past, particularly at the Spa; he was always distinguished by the civility and respect which he shewed towards every person with whom he had intercourse; he always behaved generously and handsomely to his countrymen when in distress; and, instead of promoting quarrels and diffention, would endeavour to avoid them; I have observed instances in which he has shewn a very pacific disposition, so far as was consistent with the character of a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. From your Lordship's observation of the character and conduct of Mr. England, and from facts communicated to you, by others, do you take him to be a troublesome man, promoting quarrels, or a peaceable man? - A. I am persuaded, from all I have seen of him, he is totally devoid of the murderous disposition imputed to him out of doors, and which, I hope, is wiped away by the handsome manner in which Lord Derby has spoke of him.</p>
               <p>Court. We cannot hear that, my Lord.</p>
               <p>A. Mr. Garrow put it to me very generally; I beg your Lordship's pardon.</p>

My first knowledge of Mr. England was in or about the year 1783; I frequently met him at places of public resort; afterwards at Spa, in 1787; his behaviour, as far as ever it came under my observation, was decent and gentleman-like; his deportment, instead of that of a man seeking quarrels, was that of a man strenuous to avoid them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to you, from his general deportment, to be a man of a quarrelsome disposition? - A. Quite the contrary: and, I must beg leave to add, that my opinion of his disposition, in that respect, was formed previous to the unhappy accident which took place, and has been continued down to this time.</p>

             Rowlls, on the 18th of June, 1784, at Cranford-bridge, by shooting him with a pistol. It appears, in the course of this evidence, that the death of Mr. Rowlls ensued in consequence of a duel, and therefore, before I sum up any evidence to you, it will be very proper that I should open your minds upon the law of this land, on the subject of duelling, and I believe I shall have the concurrence of my two brothers on the bench with me, when I tell you that there is no doubt, that in point of law, when two parties meet together deliberately, and not in the then heat of blood for the purpose of seeking each others lives, that whoever gave the challenge, if either falls, it is murder in the other, by whose hand he falls. I state this, not on the authority of the Judges of this day alone, but I will state to you a series of authorities of the ablest and best men that the courts of judicature of this country have ever known, from Lord Coke down to the present time.</p>
               <p>Lord Coke, in a case, very similar to the present, the case of one Taverner, who had fought a duel, who had fled his country, who was outlawed, who returned after that outlawry, and got his outlawry reversed, was afterwards tried at the bar of the King's-bench, and in that case, Lord Coke, assisted by Croke, Dodderidge, and Haughton, laid this down for law: "This," says he," I say, for law, that if one only do give the cause of provocation, and send the challenge, and the other accepts of it, and upon this they enter combat, and he who sends the challenge is killed, this is clearly murder in the other." My Lord Hale, as humane a Judge as ever sat in a court, adopts this case, and cites it in his treatise for law. My Lord Chief Justice Holt, who had as tender a regard for the liberties and lives of his fellow-subjects as any man ever had, in the case of the Queen and Moggeridge, supposes this case, that in a set duel there are mutual passes made between the combatants, yet, if there be original malice between the parties, it is not the interchange of blows will make any alteration in the original intention. If a time was appointed to fight, as suppose the next day, and accordingly do fight, it is murder in him that kills the other; but if they go into the field immediately and fight, then but manslaughter. My Lord Raymond, who was a great ornament to the judicature of this country, in giving the opinion of the judges in the case of Major

            , who had killed a Mr. Gore in a duel, cites with approbation these two cases from an author of authority, of the name of Crompton; he says, "Two quarrelled, one says, if you go into the field, I will break your head, and there one kills the other, murder. Two fell out on a sudden in the town. and they, by agreement, go into the field presently, and one kills the other, murder." And he follows this case up with this doctrine,"though the law of England is so peculiarly favourable as to permit the excuse of anger and passion (which a man ought to keep under and to govern), in some instances, to extenuate crimes even so heinous as that of taking away man's life; yet in these cases it must be such a passion, as for the time deprives him of his reasoning faculties; for if it appears that reason has assumed its office, if it appears that he reslects, deliberates, and considers, before he gives the fatal stroke, (which be cannot as long as the sury of passion continues,) the law will no longer exempt him from the punishment, which, from the greatness of the injury, and the heinousness of the crime he justly deserves, so as to lessen it from murder to manslaughter." This doctrine is again adopted by Sergeant

            , in his pleas of the Crown, and is also adopted by Mr. Justice Foster, whom the public revered for his humanity; and it is followed up by Mr. Justice Blackstone, in very particular words: he says, "Express malice is when one with a sedate, deliberate mind, and formed design, doth kill another, which formed design is evidenced by external circumstances, discovering that inward intention, as lying in wait, antecedent menaces, former grudges, and concerted schemes to do him some bodily harm. This takes in the case of deliberate duelling where both parties meet avowedly with an intent to murder, thinking it their duty as gentlemen, and claiming it as their right to wanton with their own lives, and those of their fellow-creatures, without any warrant or authority from any person, either divine or human; but in direct contradiction to the laws, both of God and man, and therefore the law has justly fixed the crime and punishment of murder on them and on their second, also; yet it requires such a degree of passive valour to combat even the dread of undeserved contempt, arising from the false notions of honour, too generally received in Europe, that the strongest prohibitions and penalties of the law will never be entirely effectual to eradicate this unhappy custom, till a method he found out of compelling the original aggressor to make some other satisfaction to the affronted party, which the world shall esteem equally reputable, as that which is now given at the hazard of the life and fortune, as well of the person insulted, as of him who hath given the insult." Upon this ground, I have no doubt in stating to you, that where parties meet deliberately together, seeking the life of each other, and have not the excuse of sudden provocation, and such passion as overpowers their reason; there is no doubt that the law considers, that if one falls, the death of that person is procured by murder, and that the other is guilty of that crime. The law here you see is strict and positive; there is a false notion, and a fashion in the world, on the other side, it will be for you to say, after I have stated the circumstances of this case to you, whether you think there are grounds to suppose here that there was any sudden passion or provocation; whether the parties were in such heat of blood as not to know what they did at the time they were fighting the duel; if you are of opinion there was no such heat of blood at that time, then I must tell you, that if you pronounce the prisoner guilty of manslaughter and not of murder,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170054"/>you will give way to the fashion of the times, at the expence of the law of the land.(Here the learned judge summed up the evidence to the Jury, after which he proceeded as follows:)</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, upon these facts the prisoner's case is to be lost you, and I believe I have the concurrence of my having on the bench, when I tell you that a deliberate due upon whatever provocation in the eye of law, is plater; for the law does lean to repress those false notions of honour, which men unhappily have taken up among themselves; it will keep the peace, and will keep it diligently and carefully whenever there are any opportunities of intersering, but will not suffer a person, through a false notion of honour, to meet deliberately in a field, with a design to take away the life of another. at the same time the law says, if they meet under circumstances of sudden provocation, the man who takes away the life of the other is guilty of manslaughter only.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, you have heard the circumstances of this case; there is a quarrel at Ascot-heath races, and a very gross insult is given on both sides as appears to me; for on the one side there is a public proclamation, that the deceased would not pay what he borrowed, and then there is an attempt to strike Mr. England, accompanied with these words, "what do you mean by that, you rascal, you scoundrel." or some such words; the next day they meet at Cransord-bridge, coming in different parties; it does not appear that they had met in the room before they got to the field; you find that there is great heat on the part of Mr. Rowlls's second; it rests on the prisoner to shew that he had received, immediately before the duel, some ground of provocation; there is nothing of that kind shewn on the part of the prisoner. It appears from Lord Cremorne's evidence, that at the time that his Lordship and others intersered, Mr. England took off his bat and said, "Gentlemen, I have been cruelly treated, highly injured in my honour and character, let there be a reparation done to that, and I am ready to have done this moment." Upon these words, gentlemen, I had better make no comment at all; I shall leave you to consider whether these were the words of an angry injured man who had received that morning any particular insult; or of a man who did it in consequence of what passed the day before, deliberately at Ascot races. - If you think they are the words of a deliberate man, they make against him; if you believe they are the words of an angry man, as relating to something that passed immediately before the duel, they are in his favour; on the other hand, you have this declaration which makes against the prisoner, that after he had shot Mr. Rowlls, instead of going up to assist Mr. Rowlls, he makes off for his chaise; and, in consequence of the exclamation of the servant girl, he says, "I would not have shot him now, if he had behaved like a gentleman:" you will consider that expression, whether that shews that he was in possession of his senses at the time, and whether it shews matter of deliberation and coolness, and such as the law will not consider as varranting you in declaring this to be a manslaughter; namely, it you find Mr. England to have been cool, and in the possession of himself before the duel, during the tuel, and after the duel, the law is strict; if on the other and you think he had met with any provocation that morning (none appearing before us,) so as to carry him to the field in great heat of blood, then the law does so far indulge, and allow for the insirmities of human nature; as to authorize you to say, upon your oath, that he is guilty of munslaughter only. - Under these direction it will be for you, gentlemen, to decide.(The Jury having withdrawn about twenty-five minutes, brought in a verdict <rs id="t17960217-27-verdict161" type="verdictDescription">

            </rs>).</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke immediately passed sentence as follows:</p>
               <p>Richard England - You have been convicted, through the mercy of the Jury, of the crime of Manslaughter only, having been indicted of the crime of Murder. The grounds on which the Jury have gone, it is not for the Court to enquire after; I have no doubt that they have satisfied their own consciences in acquitting you of the murder; but you stand before the Court under such circumstances as do not lead this Court to incline to shew any particular lenity to you; you have fled the justice of your country for twelve years; you have, in the course of that time, had benefit from the death of several witnesses who were examined before the Coroner; and, by not chusing to meet the justice of your country immediately after the crime was committed, you have prevented the Court from knowing fully all the circumstances of this case; such circumstances as have come before them, lead the Court to think that your case, though of Manslaughter, is by no means a favourable case of Manslaughter; for you have met your fellow-subject deliberately in the field, and, for aught that I can see in the course of this evidence, you have perfectly preserved your recollection and deliberation during the whole of the transaction. It is very much to be lamented, that the laws of honour, which prevail among, I am afraid, almost all the ranks of society at this time, should be so directly in opposition to the public law of the land; but it is so, and it often serves, and in this instance it has served, to prevent you from executing the dreadful, the grand, and the ultimate vengeance of the law.</p>
               <p>Having been convicted of Manslaughter, the Court think it proper to set you forth as an example in future, to let the world know, that they cannot commit even the crime of Manslaughter in a duel, without subjecting themselves to very considerable punishment; such punishment as the Court are warranted in inflicting, they do inflict upon you.

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 29th of January last, between six and seven in the evening. I was informed somebody was taking some iron away; I went to the door, and the prisoner was coming past with the iron; I said, Bill, your master wants you; he said he would come presently; I said, I want to have a word with you now; and he put the iron behind him; I told him he was a thief, and I had detected him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. Where did you first discover the prisoner and the iron? - A. At the front door; he had taken it off the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a wall to the street, and the iron was upon it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he was coming round to the shop-door? - A. He was come clear from it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell you he had taken the iron from a man who had taken it from the wall? - A. No, he did not.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner take the iron off the wall adjoining to my father's shop, between six and seven in the evening, after he had left off work, and go round the side of the house with it, near the ruins of a fire; and I went and informed my mother.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. It was pretty dark at that time? - A. Not so dark but I could see it.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was it from the ruins? - A. About as far as I am from you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my defence to my counsel.(The prisoner called seven witnesses, who gave him a good character).</p>

               <p>LEVI COWEN sworn.</p>
               <p>I know the prisoner. Last Sunday morning I met him, and he asked me if I wanted to buy any goods; I told him I did; with that he took me home with him to his house in Petticoat-lane, and shewed me nine sixpences, five half crowns, and three shillings; he asked me six shillings for them. I put my hand in my pocket and pulled out half a crown; I told him I had not money to purchase them; he told me to leave the half-crown, and bring the three shillings and sixpence before twelve o'clock, and I should have the goods; with that I went and acquainted Tipper, Mayne and Purnell, who are officers, of it. I returned and went up into his room about twelve o'clock, and the officers staid below.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you and the officers before you went to the house? - A Mayne marked three shillings and a sixpence, and gave them to me to make up the money, and they searched me; I had nothing upon me but that three shillings and sixpence. When I came to the house, the officers staid below, and I went up into the room, and saw the prisoner with a child on his lap, and a woman paring potatoes; he asked me for three shillings and sixpence, and took out of his pocket a paper of the money, five half-crowns, nine sixpences, and three shillings; I gave him the three shillings and sixpence, and he gave it to the woman. When I entered the room there was a frying-pan on the fire, and some base metal in it; the officers then came in, and searched me, and found the five half-crowns, the nine sixpences, and three shillings; they searched the prisoner, and found three sixpences upon him; the woman was putting the three shillings and sixpence in her pocket as the officers came into the room, and they took it from her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. This is all truth you have been telling us? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body by when the prisoner said this to you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It all depends on your credit? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went again and found him above stairs, and he gave you the money? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why were the officers not to go up with you? - A. Because, if they had come up, he would not have given me the money.</p>
               <p>Q. You went up stairs, and the officers came up to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170056"/>Q. The officers had so good an opinion of you, they searched you before you went up? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they search you? - A. They searched all my pockets and waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not possible for you to conceal this money that the officers might not find it? - A. No; I don't know where I was to put it but in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you not have put it in your bosom, or somewhere where the officers would not find it? - A. I am not such a lad as to do that.</p>
               <p>Q.What are you? - A. A Jew, and sell lemons and oranges.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you always give the same account of this transaction? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the same account to the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell the Magistrate you got only seven shillings and sixpence. - A. Yes; I told the Lord Mayor seven shillings and sixpence; that was a mistake which I immediately corrected, as soon as the words were out of my mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you correct it till the officer told you? - A. As soon as I said seven, the officer said nine.</p>
               <p>Q. The officer said nine, and then you said nine? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your reason for doing this? - A. For the public good.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an officer. On Sunday last, between ten and eleven o'clock, the last witness called at my house, and, in consequence of an information from him, I sent for more assistance. I went to Houndsditch and joined Tipper. I took three shillings and sixpence out of my pocket, and marked them, and gave them to the last with 1s. I stroked him down, to see that he had no more money. I did not put my hand in his pockets; he said he had no more, only two in halfpence; I did not feel the halfpence; then we went to a ginger-bread baker's in Petticoat-lane; we let the last witness go up first in order to complete his bargain; in the course of a minute we proceeded up two pair of stairs. As soon as we entered the room, we saw the last witness, the prisoner, and the woman; there was a frying-pan close by the fire, and a piece of metal in it of some sort; I then perceived something in the hand of the last witness; he put his left hand into his left coat pocket, I immediately caught hold of it, and out of his hand I took a paper containing five half-crowns, three shillings, and nine sixpences; I asked him where he got this money; he immediately said he had it from the prisoner; the prisoner did not say any thing; I put the money in my pocket; I am clear it is all counterfeit; I have been in the habit of apprehending persons with bad money; I then proceeded to search the prisoner, and in his left hand breeches pocket I found three base counterfeit sixpences; they are not finished, they want rubbing and putting in a liquid; they are not in a state for circulation. (The money was all produced, and handed to the Jury).</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the woman? - A. I did not, I was engaged with the prisoner and the last witness.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. These sixpences are not such as could be passed off? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You rubbed down the witness Cowen before you went to the house? - A. I did not put my hand in his pocket; I asked him particularly if he had any more money</p>
               <p>Q. If he has sworn that you put your hand in his pocket, he has sworn that that is not true? - A. Certainly; for I did not put my hand in his pocket.</p>
               <p> - PURNELL sworn.</p>
               <p>I went with the last witness and Tipper, on Sunday morning, to the prisoner's lodging; we went up stairs, and Mayne searched the first evidence, and found some bad money in his pocket; I saw the woman putting something in her pocket; I went and took the three shillings and sixpence out of her hand; it was the same that Mayne had marked.</p>
               <p>Mayne. There is one particular shilling I can swear to, it has a dent in it; I marked them all.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you mark them? - A. With a sort of a scratch with a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. You believe that three shillings and sixpence to be the same you gave to Cowen? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you mean by saying these sixpences are not finished; they appear to have been in circulation? - A. They have been in circulation; they are not in the state they have been at first.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ally. I understand that you are paid by the Mint for your trouble of attending here? - A. I don't know that I am; I have never been in the business before.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mayne). There is good pay, I believe, for attending here? - A. No, not sufficient for taking a man out of his business.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am now, in this present situation, an innocent man; I never saw the evidence before in my life till he came up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mayne). These things were in a paper? - A. They were in a brown paper, in the hand of the first witness.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way were they put up; were they solded up? - A. No; they were all loose together.</p>

On Saturday evening, the 30th of January, seeing her go out in the manner I have described, I desired my brother to follow her, which he did, and, on his return, related what he had seen; I desired him to mark a variety of articles she was likely to take, to mark them on the back, which he did. The next day, being Sunday, in the morning before the family went to church, the parcels remained the same as they were in the evening, in the different holes of the shop; after returning from church, about one o'clock, there were several of them missing; the prisoner was the only person left at home that morning; in the evening, about six o'clock, it is the custom of my mother to send the servants to church, and thinking that the might take that opportunity of taking the goods, I went down in the shop in the dark, and disposed myself so as to have a full view of the prisoner, without being discovered myself; after waiting some time, the prisoner came down stairs, apparently with a heavy bundle in her hand, and went out, I immediately followed her, and before she had got ten or a dozen yards from the door, I overlook her, and taking hold of her arm, I desired to know what she had got; she made answer, what was that to me; I desired her to come back and let me see what it was, she refused; my brother coming up, took hold of her other arm; she then came back with us; taking the parcel from her, we discovered it to be very heavy; we then sent for Woodman, the constable; we examined the parcel, and it consisted of a variety of screws and nails that had been marked the preceding evening,(producing them): the constable examined her box and bed-chamber, in her presence, and found a quantity of nails concealed on a shall behind her bed, that had been marked the evening before; they were delivered to the constable, who has had them in his possession ever since.</p>

               <p>Q.Does any body else sleep in this bed-room besides herself? - A. No; those found upon her were tied up in parcels; thousands, two thousands, and so on, as they were marked in the shop</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. There are a variety of articles in the indictment more than were found upon her? - A. There were some in the bed-room, and some found upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. The parcels found in the bed-room, and those taken upon her, were nearly the same quantity? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She had an opportunity of taking them at different times? - A. I don't know; those in the bed-room that were marked, must have been taken between the time of marking them, and the time they were found.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know what number of parcels were marked? - A. No; I don't know what parcels in particular; my brother marked them.</p>
               <p>GRORGE KNIGHT sworn.</p>
               <p>I am brother to the last witness; I marked several parcels of nails on the Saturday; these are three of the parcels I marked; they were found in her apron; they are tacks, or nails; 3000 at the rate of 1s. a thousand, 7000 of larger nails, and about 3000 screws; there are about 15,000 of the larger nails, at the rate of 20d. a thousand; 12 gross of screws, worth 2s. a gross; the rest were found in her bed-room; I did not mark any of the screws.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. All these might have been taken at different times? - A. The screws might; the tacks were all taken at once.</p>

               <p>These things have been in my possession ever since; they were taken from the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing yourself with respect to the blinds? - A. Sometime in July last, or beginning of August, we missed a number of fixtures from the house, and I informed Mr. Welch of it; among which were the Venetian and canvas blinds, mentioned in the indictment; three of the canvas blinds and four of the Venetian blinds were fixed, and the rest were lying loose in a back office; I was present when they were afterwards found, on the 25th of January, in the lodgings of the prisoner, in the house of a man of the name of Levi Hayes, in three different rooms, two of them up two pair of stairs, and one up three pair.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know from any thing the prisoner has told you, that he had any connexion with those rooms? - A. No: All the things mentioned in the indictment were found in that house.</p>
               <p>Q. You have valued them at 30s. is that about the value? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. When did you agree for this house for Mr. Welch? - A. The 23d of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the deeds executed? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You missed the things as long ago as July? - A. July or August.</p>
               <p>Q. That is upwards of six months; had you other people working in this house? - A. There were other people.</p>
               <p>Q. They were found the 25th of July, at this house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Any other person as well as the prisoner might have taken them to this house? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. From July to the time you found them, they might have been through many hands? - A. They might.</p>

He was; there were some blinds loose in the back room, and in the one pair of stairs the blinds were fixed; they were missed while the prisoner was at work there; I had the blinds from Mr. Sapwell's, and went with Mr. Fletcher to see whether they would fit the places in the one pair of stairs; I sitted the blinds to the places where they were suspected to be taken from in Mr. Welch's house, and they sitted exactly; I observed they had not been unscrewed, but torn off with a narrow chissel, or a screw-driver; the hinges of the blinds were bent, and there was the impression of the instrument in the bead of the sash frames they hung to; I believe the blinds I had at Sapwell's, and fitted to the places, were the blinds that were taken away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are a journeyman carpenter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And so is the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not, as a carpenter, take the blinds down in this way? - A. I should probably have unscrewed them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170059"/>Q. The prisoner staid in the service of Mr. Ponder, and worked in Mr. Welch's house till November? - A. I cannot say exactly.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any body else use this third floor? - A. A poor old woman we gave it to almost out of charity, and another person.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Palmer). Look at those things. - A. These are the same things that I resitted to the window.</p>
               <p>Q.From the observation you had had of them, and from the marks you saw upon the sitting, do you believe then to be the blinds that sitted the window? - A. I verily believe they are; they are bent hinges; these are the same blinds, no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. They are common Venetian blinds, others might fit the windows? - A. A thousand to one if they did.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you any marks upon them that you can point out? - A. I can say no otherwise than they fitted the place; the hinges are torn off.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. There is no mark but the violence that identifies them? - A. It has not marked the blinds but the beads.</p>

               <p>I am keeper of the New Gaol, in Southwark; I was at the Croydon Assizes in July last; the prisoner was tried there; I have the certificate of his conviction, (producing it).</p>
               <p>Q. Was he tried by the same name that he is now tried by? - A. Yes; Thomas Atwell</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get that certificate? - A. From Mr. Knapp, clerk of the assize; I saw Mr. Knapp sign it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ally. Q. This is a copy of it, I take it? - A. No; it is the original, (it is read).</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you this man in custody before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that this is the same Thomas Atwell that was tried for stealing that trunk? - A. Yes; I have known him some years.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure it is the same man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had him in custody before his trial? - A. No; I took him in custody the 8th of August; I was present when he was tried at Croydon, and I am certain he is the same man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you know what became of him afterwards? - A. I took him on the 29th of December; I went down to Reading, in Berkshire, in consequence of an information I received; I found him at the barracks at Knightsbridge.</p>
               <p>Q.Not in any custody? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. You found him at the barracks? - A. Yes; I found him there as a soldier.</p>
               <p>Q. He had enlisted, had not he? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had a conditional pardon? - A. He had, I took it back to the Duke of Portland's office; I never broke the seal.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You understood he had enlisted? - A. In the Duke of York's regiment of foot guards; he was to go to join Colonel Maitland's regiment, to go to the West Indies.</p>
               <p> - HILTON sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to the keeper of the county gaol of Surrey: On the 9th of December, I was ordered,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170060"/>by the gate keeper, and the keeper that is at present, to conduct the prisoner at the bar to Portsmouth, with a letter received from the War office directed to Lieutenant-Colonel Maitland, &amp;c. &amp;c. Portsmouth; that letter I delivered to the keeper, when I came back.</p>

               <p>Court. (To Alport). Q. Have you that letter? - A. No; I carried it to the office as I was ordered.</p>
               <p>Halton. I went with him to the Spread-Eagle, Gracechurch-street, and conducted him to Portsmouth; when I came there. I enquired for Colonel Maitland; I could get no intelligence of him; I applied to the Governor, and was informed, that the fleet had sailed, and he was gone with the fleet to the West-Indies. I was then directed to the Transport office, I found I could get no conveyance to deliver him; I then took a place for myself and him, to bring him back to London. I walked about with the prisoner, I had no place to lodge him in, he had no irons on, till about five o'clock; when he made an excuse that he wanted to go to the privy; the privy was in a small yard along-side the dwelling where we were, and I followed him at a little distance; and the door that let out into the yard was a door that opened towards me, in a narrow passage, he turned the door before me, and I walked gently after him, and when I turned the door I missed him; I thought he was gone to the privy, I looked there and found he had made his escape. I then proceeded round Portsmouth to discover him, but I could not hear any thing at all of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. I believe the first tidings you heard of him was, that he was in the barracks at Knightsbridge? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Through what channel was it that you received information of him? - A. I had received information that he had enlisted as a soldier.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know of any letter he had written to the Duke of Portland, specifying that he had enlisted in the Duke of York's regiment? - A. I did not see the letter, I heard that there was one.</p>
               <p>Court. In strictness of law I cannot ask the Jury to trisle with their oaths; this man is guilty of being at large; but when I find that that man immediately after enlisted, I shall direct the Jury to find him guilty; and offer my recommendation to his Majesty, that he may be sent to the West-Indies now; the fleet had failed, and he could not join it.</p>

               <p>Q.How came you to observe the sheep? - A. Because I used to look after them every day, and I think there were twenty in the first lot, before any was drafted off, that were marked, and nine in the other lot; those twenty were reddled almost all over more so than those nine were; Mr. Spair. and I, and his little boy, drawed ten of them away sometime before; I cannot say how long, it is sometime back; and then Mr. Spain sent for the remainder of that lot, and never let me know; and then there were two of these nine taken away; I sent Mr. Spain word, and he came and looked after them, but could not find them; and then, the 5th of this month, the seven were fetched away; I saw them in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there then? - A. Seven out of the nine.</p>

               <p>My father is a sheep salesman, in Smithfield-market; as I was going to market on Friday night, the 5th, about a quarter after six, I met a man with seven sheep of the Southdown kind, on Paddington-hill, just on this side the Red-lion, Westbourngreen, in the Harrow-road; he was a tall thin man, with a light coloured coat, very much of the appearance of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the sheep marked? - A. I don't know the mark, there was a reddle along the back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any mark at all? - A. No; he was driving them up the hill very fast.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner? - A. I think he has very much the appearance of the man.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. It was so dark you could not see the marks of the sheep, nor the countenance of the man? - A. No.</p>
               <p> - FLEMING sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a labouring man, the prisoner came to my dwelling-house on the 5th, in the evening, in North-Cumberland-mews, Mary-le-bonne parish.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he come to you? - A. I was in bed, it was about seven or eight o'clock, as near as I can tell; he asked my wife if I could go to market the next morning with some sheep; my wife said I was not satisfied with what I went with before.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner? - A. At six in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of your own knowledge that he came the over-night? - A. Yes; I heard him.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you hear what he came about? - A. No; I cannot say I heard what he said; he left word he would come the next morning at four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he call the next morning at four o'clock? - A. No; at six.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed? - A. I opened the window and looked out, and he asked me if I could go to market for him; he said my wife seemed to signify I thought it was too little money to go for; he said, he would give me 6d. more; I came down and harnessed the horse, and put it to the cart, and went along with him; I went to St. George's-row, and there we put seven skins in first, some straw over them, and put in six carcases; we came to Newgate-market; the prisoner carried the sheep into the market, and I stood with the cart; the seven skins I took to the skin-market, the top of St. John's-street; some the prisoner pulled out, and some I threw out; he drew the skins into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170062"/>the yard by the legs, four one time, and three the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Into whose yard? - A. Mr. Harwood's yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Harwood there? - A. I did not see him, for I never got out of the cart at all, and then we both went away.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know exactly how many he had alive? - A. I cannot exactly say; he asked me if I would have any thing to drink for my trouble, which I refused; I came away, and left him in the place where he was at work.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you understand the meaning of boning something? - A. Yes, thieving; upon that, he said, if some of you will pursue him we shall take him; I was the second after him; just as Lumley got over the style, he cried, "here he is," when I got to him, he had laid hold of him, which was about four yards from the ditch; me and another young man held him by the collar, while Lumley went to the ditch and took the property out; we then brought him back to the Coach-and-Horses, and delivered him into the hands of the constable; there was a coat, waistcoat, and breeches; as the young man and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170064"/>I held the man by the collar, the breeches gingled; and Lumley said, there is something in the pocket, let us take it out, left it should fail out; and he took out seven shillings and sixpence, and two pocket-pieces.

               <p>Examined by Mr. Peatt. I am a surgeon: I was sent for by Robert Thacker, on the 27th of last month, to meet him at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Be so kind as to state distinctly what you know of this? - A. By the request of Mr. Justice Addington, I went into a private room to examine the child; that is the child; she is under my hands now.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the result of her examination? - A. I examined her, and found the exterior parts very much inflamed.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What was that inflammation owing to? - A. There was a very great discharge; I should suppose owing to perforation; on the further examination, I found the neck of the virgina very much lacerated, and a very great discharge; as to the complexion of the discharge, I was not positive whether it was venereal or not, at that time; to confirm my opinion, I went over to the

            , where the prisoner was confined, to examine him also; I found a strong ghonorrhoea from the urethra; I have had the child under my care ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Has she any symptoms of this venereal now? - A. She is under a mercurial course now, and a strong discharge upon her; she has the gonorrhcea upon her at this time.</p>
               <p>Q. You examined this child; were the appearances you saw, the effect of violence from some person or other? - A. No doubt but some puncture was the occasion of that inflammation; I have not the least doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the hymen destroyed? - A. At the first examination I could not be positive, being dark at night.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you quite certain from your professional knowledge, and that knowledge applied to the observation of that child, are you quite clear that that child had been penetrated by some person? - A. Not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170066"/>the least doubt of it, because, passing the finger up the passage, I found it extremely inflamed; the second time I examined her at my own house, I passed my finger half an inch or an inch, and found it very much inflamed; the hymen was destroyed in some measure, but whether from the puncture, or the acrimony of the discharge, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you been long a surgeon? - A. About sixteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had much experience in this way? - A. I mostly practise surgery.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I will ask you a question for the sake of the public, and enlightening the public mind upon this subject; is it possible for a man, having a venereal taint of this sort, to receive any benefit from connexion with a child? - A. It is an extremely false idea.</p>
               <p>Court. This idea cannot be too well understood, because many poor miserable wretches have that notion? - A. I should suppose quite the reverse, because any thing that irritates the penis must inflame it and encrease the discharge.</p>
               <p>Court. That has been the uniform answer of every surgeon that I ever heard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. My Lord, I understand that the father, at the instance of the mother-in-law, was arrested, a day or two before, and he is now retired, from fear of being arrested; he was here this morning.</p>
               <p>Court. If any person offers violence attending here, the Court will instantly take notice of them; the man is perfectly safe here if you can find him, and every man is in a Court of Justice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. The woman that she told it to is kept out of the way also.</p>
               <p>Court. (To the child). Q. How many days after he had used you ill was he taken up? - A. The Wednesday after.</p>

               <p>I am a soldier in the first regiment; I was drinking with the prisoner on Monday, the 25th of January, between eight and nine, we had two pots of beer, and two slices of bread and cheese; the clock struck nine as we came out. I suppose we could not have been in more than half an hour.</p>
               <p>Court. What leads you to remember that? - A. I was going down for a bed to Westminster; we were both for guard that morning.</p>

               <p>Q. You had two pots of beer? - A. I think it was two; I don't think we had any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet the prisoner? - A. Coming up to the armory-room in the Tilt-yard; Busby was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear of the prisoner being taken up? - A. On the Wednesday I went up to Bow-street, to know what was the matter, as I had known him a great while, and knew him to be a man of a very good character.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Where have you been this morning? - A. I have been in Court, but was informed, being a little embarrassed in my affairs, that an officer was ready to arrest me as soon as I had given evidence here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. You are perfectly safe in coming here; and you shall be protected in going home.</p>
               <p>Thacker. I am the father of the child; she was eleven year old last New-year's-day; the prisoner has been quartered upon me three or four months, I cannot justly say to the time, as I have not the billet about me; with respect to his behaviour while with me, I had not much reason to find saul, I thought him a quiet kind of man; and I employed him to do little matters for me, and gave him victuals, at different times.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of what passed between him and your daughter on Monday the 25th of January? - A. I was out of town; and when I returned, on Wednesday evening, I was told my child wanted to see me; she told me she was hurt, by the prisoner, upon the bed; that she was ordered by her mother-in-law to go to bed that night with the maid, she used to sleep alone; that she fell asleep after the maid got up, and this man came up stairs, and came to bed to her; that she cried out, and nobody heard her.</p>

               <p>Q. When was this? - A. On Wednesday in the evening; I went that evening to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. She had not been to Bow-street before that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had another soldier in the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his name? - A. Dixon.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to think any other man has used your child in this way? - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the maid servant? - A. I cannot find her; I have been endeavouring to find her this two or three days, but could not find her; she has been gone away this month, I believe; she went away immediately after this affair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you turn her away, or did she go away? - A. She was turned away by my wife.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish your Lordship to ask Dixon what the girl was turned away for?</p>
               <p>Witness. For being in liquor, my Lord.</p>
               <p>(Dixon called in again.) Court. Q. Why was that maid servant turned away from Thacker's house? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Robert Thacker.) Your child complains she is harshly treated by her mother-in-law, I hope you will take care of her; it is known in Bow-street, and it is known here; and it will be very necessary for her safety that she should treat the child better in future. - A. I have applied to an Attorney to draw up articles of separation between us, upon this very subject.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a jeweller and silversmith, in Dame-street, Dublin.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at the bar at any time, and when? - A. I saw him either the 16th or 17th of December last, he called at my house with two men, one of the name of Willet, a jeweller, who lives in my neighbourhood, and an auctioneer's clerk, whom I also know.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his name? - A. I don't know, I never heard his name.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his business? - A. They introduced this man to me, telling me he had a number of diamonds to dispose of; that I was a fit man to purchase them; the appearance of the man made me suspect he had not come by these diamonds property; I desired him to leave the diamond pin, which he had with him, and I would consult some person better acquainted with the value of it, which, upon consulting with those men, he consented to do.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time did any conversation pass between you and him? - A. Nothing more than the price that he asked for the pin, which was 150l.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again? - A. The party went away then, and I went to consult a friend of mine, Mr. Osborne; the prisoner returned in half an hour, to have my valuation; I begged him to walk into the parlour; and I told him, I hoped he would excuse my suspecting that he did not come by these things property; and that if it turned out otherwise, I should apologize to him, or something to that effect; I told him, it was my duty to investigate the business, and that he should explain in what manner he came by the article; at this, he seemed a good deal hurt; and said, if I did not chuse to purchase the pin, to give it back to him; which I refused to do; he then said, his wife had lived servant to the Princess Mary, Elizabeth and Sophia; I am not positive as to the three names; but I am to Mary and Elizabeth; he said, they were given to her for her services, that diamond pin, and others, which, he said, he had; I thought the story an extraordinary one; and, he said, there could be no doubt of it; and that he had a quantity of diamonds coming over from the other side; by which, I understood, he meant England; which he had recovered by an action of trover, since his wife's death; I told him, this story would not satisfy me, and requested him to point out some one in this country to give him a character, otherwise I could not part with it; upon which, he mentioned the name of a Mr. Lee, that keeps a music shop in Dame-street; I went to Mr. Lee, to enquire his character, and he said, after some time recollecting himself, that he had known a man of that name, that had lived a waiter at Deally's club-house.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. What did the prisoner say his name was? - A. Lee; I mentioned the circumstance of bringing the pin to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any further conversation? - A. I told him, that the man he had reserved me to, had given me rather an indifferent opinion of him; that it was my duty to send for an Alderman, which I did; and gave him in custody to Alderman Twiddey.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know that pin again if you were to see it? - A. Yes; the Alderman desired I should lodge examinations against him, which I did; he lives within a few doors of where I live.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the prisoner committed in consequence of those examinations? - A. Yes; he was taken to prison, under the custody of Richard Warren. (The pin was produced). This is the pin I received of the prisoner; I am positive of it; I put my mark upon it, and it has it upon it now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dingwall. It is a tripple star brilliant pin, estimated in the indictment at 192l. which it cost us.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Moore). Where was this lodged? - A. I deposited it with Alderman Twiddey.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here? - A. No; Alderman Twiddey sealed up the diamond, in my presence, and lodged it in the national bank.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You received it from the Alderman again, and are sure it is the same you received from the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You told my Lord, and the Gentlemen of the Jury, that you are a jeweller in Dublin? - A. Yes; and a silversmith.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe Dame-street is as public a street as any in Dublin? - A. I have a great many customers.</p>
               <p>Q. It is an open shop? - A. Yes; sitted up exactly as they are here in London; I am not so much in the diamond way, as the silver line.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner produced the pin to you; he did not come by himself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He came with two persons whom you knew? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. One was Mr. Willet? - A. Yes; he is a jeweller; his wife keeps a milliner's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a man of respectability? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q.Was that person that he referred you to, the only person he referred you to? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he refer you to a person of the name of Swarn? - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he refer you to? - A. A Mr. Lee, who keeps a music-shop in Dame-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Mr. Lee very well? - A. Yes, intimately, and could have relied upon any thing he said.</p>
               <p>Q. You left the prisoner in your house? - A. Yes; under the care of my young man.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you came back again, you found him there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your young man here? - A. He is not.</p>
               <p>Q. The person did give you some account that he knew him some time ago, as a waiter at a club-house? - A. Yes; four years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. And the man gave you a true information that he did know him? - A. Yes; Mr. Lee described the man, and it was certainly the same.</p>
               <p>Q. So that it was not a false account that he gave of himself? - A. It was not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. He told you he had other diamonds? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was not after the time that your suspicions had been awoke? - A. No, it was before; for my reason was, to endeavour to get the whole of the diamonds.</p>

Four or five days, on or about the 20th or 21st of December, as I was locking up the prisoner's door, the prisoner met me on the stairs, and he told me he was very much frightened about Alderman Twiddey not taking bail about the robbery; I told him I was very sorry for it; do you recollect, says he, you were talking last night of getting the keys of your prison altered; I told him I did very well; then he asked me if I knew how

             made his escape; I told him I did; don't you know, Mr. Warren, says he, I have a woman's face? you have, sir, says I; he asked me what was my place worth a year? I told him 40l. a year; says he, Mr. Warren, I will make you a present of 6 or 700l. worth of value in diamonds, if you will let me escape; he pulled a prayer-book out of his pocket, and he kissed the book; he swore he would tell no one on the face of the earth how he made his escape; and as I was a newly-appointed jailer, no notice would be taken of me; the next day he called me over to the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you appear to refuse this or yield to it? - A. I seemed to agree to him in every thing; says he, do you recollect, Mr. Warren, what I was talking to you about last night? I do, sir, says I, he called for pen and ink and paper, and wrote down the value of different articles; he made mention of different articles upon a piece of paper, which he gave to his father.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ally. Did you see him give it to him? - A. Not at that time; he sent for his father.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see his father? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him give it to his father? - A. I did; and at the bottom of the note, with speed; the father and mother brought the property that evening.</p>
               <p>Court. What did they bring? - A. A diamond star pin, a pair of diamond ear-rings, a watch, with a gold chain, and some pearl rings, and a gold watch broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you deliver the articles that the father gave you? - A. I gave them to Alderman Twiddey; I put my mark upon them.</p>
               <p>Q.Should you know them again if you were to see them? - A. I should; (they are produced).</p>
               <p>Court. Who gave them to you after the father and mother had brought them? - A. The prisoner at the bar, between ten and eleven that night; when the father and mother gave him the property, he told me, I had them for you, says he; he called me into a room, and put them out of his pockets; says he, here is a diamond star pin worth 300 guineas, a pair of brilliant ear-rings worth 200 guineas, two diamond rings worth 20 guineas, a pair of gold earrings, I really forgot what the value he set upon that was, a gold watch broke, he said I could get it very easily repaired, worth ten guineas; I gave some directions to Thompson, his bed-fellow, and Lee hid himself in the kitchen; I sent Thompson in to look for him; he told Thompson he would not go to bed that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say that to Thompson? - A. I did; he said something to Thompson to aggravate him, and Thompson was going to fight with him; called him a rogue; I told him, Mr. Lee, I will let you go in the morning, never mind Mr. Thompson, says I, you have vexed him; I forced him into his bed-room; and when I was forcing him into his room, Mr. Warren, says he, have you deceived me? no, says I; says he, for God's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170072"/>sake run me through the body; the next morning, about nine o'clock, I went home; says I, Mr. Lee, what sort of a watch was that you gave me last night, that you said I could so easily get repaired? he put his hand in his pocket, and gave me another gold watch, and two guineas more.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that broke too? - A. No; he owned that himself; he told me it was worth 40 guineas; that he would send me 40 guineas on Saturday, and some plate; I told him I was very sorry for him; that it was my duty to fetch him and the property before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do so? - A. I told him it was my duty not to betray the gentleman that appointed me; and Alderman Twiddey committed him to Newgate, in Dublin</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the watches and seals? - A. I left them with Alderman Twiddey.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put any mark upon them? - A. Yes; they were all marked by Mr. Moore, in my presence, and Alderman Twiddey's presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know them again if you were to see them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was the prisoner carried before Alderman Twiddey at that time? - A. He was. (The gold watch produced). Upon my oath this is the watch that I had from the prisoner; my name is wrote upon it, (the broken watch produced).</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that is the watch you delivered to Alderman Twiddey? - A. I marked it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. That watch, my Lord, is not in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Witness. Here is a diamond star pin, which has my mark upon it; a pair of gold ear-rings are marked with my name, in my own hand-writing; a gold chain and seal, with my name upon it, he made me a present of that, and I wore it; a pair of brilliant ear-rings, with my name upon it; four rings, with my name upon a piece of paper attached to them; a gold ring studded with diamonds, there is the private mark of the shop, and my name upon; and I also know it by a dent in it.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you all this property, now produced, from the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. This man was committed by Mr. Twiddey to your house? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. He was committed there only on suspicion, I believe? - A. Just so.</p>
               <p>Q. He had been a week in your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then, being afraid he should not get bail, he offered this property to get his liberty. Now, you tell us, that it was after your agreement with him, that he sent to his friends for these things, after you had promised he should go, when a sufficient recompence was made to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.These things were brought by other persons to him? - A. Yes, by his father and mother.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand he gave you a watch one night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The next morning, you asked him what kind of a watch it was? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any reply to it? - A. No; he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. It was entirely in the expectation of getting his liberty that he gave you these things? - A. He thought I would let him go.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this watch-chain, and seal, that you wore, brought by his father and mother? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q.And the watch that he took out of his pocket? - A. No; that he constantly wore.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you known him? - A. I had seen him in the neighbourhood of St. James's, about two or three years; he lived, as I understood, in Angel-court; I live in Bury-street.</p>

            ? - A. I have seen her.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the prisoner acquainted with her? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, don't you know? - A. No further than seeing her and him in company, as I should see any other man or woman; they passed as man and wife; I cannot say that they were married.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any children? - A. This man came to my house, in the character of a labouring man, some time last summer, but the exact time I cannot say; he asked me if I knew any woman that gave suck? I told him I knew a Mrs. Brown, in St. James's-street, without a husband, that I thought would be very glad to get a shilling; and he begged of me to go to Angel-court, to Mrs. White's, where the child was, and I went with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose child was it? - A. I cannot tell the father of it; by his taking care of it, I supposed it was his.</p>
               <p>Q. But did you understand, from your conversation with him, that it was his child? - A. Yes; he and I brought it down from this Mrs. White's, she had the care of the child at that time; I gave the child to this Mrs. Brown, I carried it to her; and that is all that I can tell about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he say was the mother? - A. This woman that went by the name of his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the woman after she was at Mr. Dingwall's? - A. I never saw her in Mr. Ding<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170073"/>wall's house; I heard her name was Sarah Chandler; I don't know.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did the woman go by the name of Sarah Chandler? - A. I never heard her name till I heard it since this passed.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you see her afterwards? - A. At Mr. Dingwall's door once, but I did not know who lived there.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see her at Mr. Dingwall's? - A. I cannot say when it was; I was going to the palace.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what time of the year was it? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Winter or summer? - A. The latter end of the fine weather; she was washing Mr. Dingwall's door upon her knees, wiping and washing the door; but I never had any acquaintance with the woman in my life.</p>

               <p>Q.As if she was a servant of the house? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever hear him speak of her as his wife? - A. I never heard that he was married to her; but she used to go in the street by the name.</p>
               <p>Q. But he told you that was his child, and this woman the mother of it? - A. I suppose, by their having the child between them, that it must be so; he never told me any particular thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to be persons living together as man and wife? - A. I believe all the neighbours thought so as well as me; I cannot say whether they were or not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You supposed this man had a child by this woman? - A. I don't know, because I know neither of them.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was this watch at the time you left the house? - A. Put in the escrutore drawer.</p>
               <p>Q.How did you find the drawers? - A. There was a key in the drawers that belonged to the other room.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the diamond rings in the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that watch? - A. It was in the iron closet. On the gold ring, studded with diamonds, there is my own mark; it is a parchment label, with a mark to denote the price.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is that worth 8l.? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Dingwall.) When you returned home, was there any violence on the house? - A. A show-glass was broke; the door was fast.</p>
               <p>Q. There did not appear to have been any violence? - A. No.</p>

             told me he had found the things, and asked me if I would make a purchase of them; I said I was not a judge, but if they would trust me with them, I would enquire in two hours, and purchase them; they left them with me; I asked a man the value of them; I told him all the rest afterwards; the man lives in Petticoat-lane; I sent for him, he would not come; those things that are valued at 230l. he and his son valued at 30l. I offered them for sale very openly, which I would not have done, if I had known they had been stolen. Mr. Moore knows I did; he said he wished to have some more conversation with me before he bought them; a person came in and said he had known me 12 years, and knew nothing but honour and honesty of me; there are men in Court know I was four months at Lord Malden's; I appeal to your Lordship to make an enquiry into my character. Before I would be out of employ, I would go into the lowest capacity in life. I was stopped, on the 17th of December, by Mr. Moore, he took pains to enquire my character; I recommended him to Mr. Swaine; he came in to Mr. Moore's parlour, and declared he knew me; Mr. Moore went to Mr. Lee, and, when he came back, he said I had been only a waiter, and could not come honestly by the things. I was sent to Mr. Warren's, on the 17th of December, in the afternoon, and was there till that day eight days; when I had been there five days, I sent to employ Counsellor Manley; he said it was a bailable offence; he came again in the morning, and produced three newspapers, which he said were just arrived from England, and that the things had been stolen, and it was a dangerous thing; Mr. Warren said, if I would give him the things he would liberate me; I sent for a pocket handkerchief with the things, and gave them to him. This woman is perjured; she says my brother came in; he is a chairman to a lady, No. 66, Dorset-street, Dublin. I don't know a woman of the name of Chandler.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. This was about eight at night? - A. Within five minutes up or down.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a dark night, very misty? - A. It was misty.</p>
               <p>This violent blow must have stunned you a little? - A. It did, undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you coming from at that time? - A. Finsbury-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been in company? - A. Yes, with one person at a gentleman's house.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been drinking? - A. I cannot say, it might be a pint; it don't signify cross-questioning me, I have said the truth, and can say no more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ally. It is my duty to cross-question you a little.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot recollect what you drank? - A. No; I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any view of the person previous to the time you were knocked down? - A. I passed them; I did not know who they were, they jostled me, and then knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to swear, when the prisoner turned down, and you were one hundred and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170075"/>fifty yards from him, and being stunned with the fall, that you can swear to the face of the man? - A. I never said I was one hundred and fifty yards from him.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you had run one hundred and fifty yards before you came near him? - A. I was about eight yards from them, and ran one hundred and fifty yards, then I came near them.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to the watch-house, was the prisoner searched? - A. I believe he was searched; I saw him searched.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing found upon him? - A. I believe nothing but a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. He had never been out of your sight? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Were you examined before the Lord Mayor? - A. Before Alderman Newnham, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the same account there as you have here? - A. The very same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you fix upon another man? - A. No; I said, I believed a person who was there, was one of the party, but I was not certain; I believe so now.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not the Alderman commit him? - A. He did, for another hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen your money before this time. - A. About half an hour before I was knocked down; a few minutes before I left the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You fixed upon another person before the Alderman, and he had so much doubt, that he dismissed him; did you never hear any thing of a reward? - A. Never; I never was in a Court before.</p>
               <p>Court. About eight o'clock you were going by these men, and they followed you, and before you could say a word, you were knocked down? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see the person that struck you? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. You said your pockets were rifled of a half guinea, a half crown, and a sixpence; had you recovered so far as to take any observations of the persons? - A. As I lay on my left side, there was a lamp on the right side, and I had a perfect view of the prisoner's face.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How soon did you get up? - A. I got up immediately; I picked up my hat in my left hand, and ran with it in my hand.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You never lost sight of the men till they stopped? - A. I never lost sight of any of them, till they ran different ways; I never lost sight of the prisoner till I put my hand upon him.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. What business are you? - A. A collar-maker; I work with Thomas Mayo, No. 231, Upper Thames-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long have you worked with him? - A. Ever since I have been in town; three years last October.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a clerk to the East-India Company: On Sunday evening last, going down Bread-street, from Cheapside, I heard the cry of watch repeatedly; I saw the prisoner, with two others, running, and as they advanced within a few yards of me, they halted, and became from a run to a walk, a sharp walk, scarcely to be called a walk; I heard the prisoner say to the other two, "don't run, or they will be after us," which caused me to suspect the prisoner and the others had been doing what they ought not to have done; but, on the man not calling stop thieves, I did not intercept them, or stop them; and they passed me and turned round the corner to Watling-street; the prosecutor. Joshua Harrison, by the time they got to the corner, was within three or four yards at the farthest; when the prisoner turned the corner, I took no further notice; but by missing my friend, James Wheeler, who was running, with the prosecutor, after the prisoner, I ran about thirty or forty yards; I came up with them just at the time they had taken the prisoner; and, by Joshua Harrison repeatedly crying "watch, watch," a watchman followed; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170076"/>prisoner stopped, and said, here is the watchman if you want the watch; Harrison said, I likewise want you, as well as the watch, "for," says he,"you have robbed me;" and he denied it; and said, he was not the person; he knew nothing of it; they gave charge for charge, and they went to the watch-house; when I came up to the prosecutor, and saw him in a dirty condition, I knew him, and went with them to the watch-house; I have done business for his master two years, and knew him perfectly well; I went to the watch-house, and can repeat what passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner by at the time? - A. Yes; he was in charge, in the watch-house at the time.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What was it? - A. The constable questioned the prisoner, respecting the charge against him; what he was by prosession; and where he lived; he said, he was a horse-dealer, and that he was just come from Snow-hill; and that he lived in Barbican; the constable asked, what business he had in Bread-street, to go from Snow-hill to Barbican; he said, he had business there; he was searched; he had no money; he said, he had none; his having no money about him, caused a suspicion; and he asked him, if he had any friends to bail him from going to prison; he said, he had friends, but would not trouble them that night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. You said, you had a suspicion, because he had no money in his pocket? - A. The people had a suspicion of a man of his appearance having no money.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw these men they were turning into Watling-street? - A. The prisoner did; I cannot say which way the others turned.</p>
               <p>Q. After they turned the corner, the prosecutor was four or five yards from the corner? - A. He did not turn the corner immediately, but crossed the way; had he turned short round the corner, the prosecutor would have lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been to my sister's, in Red Lion-street; I was going into the Borough to Mr. Hurst, about a horse; in Watling-street I heard a man cry out</p>
               <p>"watch, watch;" he was very much in liquor; I turned round, and said, here is the watch, and he laid hold of me, and said, I had robbed him.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Goodwin). Was the prosecutor in liquor? - A. He was a little in liquor, rather merry; he could run as well as if he was not in liquor; he gave a clear account at the watch-house; he said, they thought me drunk, but I was not so drunk as they thought for.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Harrison). Q. Did you swear to any other man before the Magistrate? - A. No; being examined before the Magistrate, there was a person there, they had some discourse together; the Magistrate said, do you know that man; I said, I did not know him, I believed he was one that was in the company; the Alderman bid them shut the door, that none might escape; and he slipped out of the hall; the Alderman asked me, if I could swear to him; I said, I could not; I believed he was one of the men.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect being before Alderman Newnham? - A. Perfectly well; on Monday last, I had some little business in the city, for my master, a person asked me to go, through curiosity, to Guildhall, this man was standing at the door; I had a thought of a warrant being granted against me, for an assault, and thought it best to make my escape, and I went out; this gentleman gave the alarm of stop-thief; I did not stop, but when the alarm of stop-thief was given, I immediately stopped and surrendered myself to this man; the prosecutor, before I came in, said, that is the man, and I will swear to him; the gentleman desired me to step over the bar, and when I came within a yard or two of him, and unbuttoned my coat, he said, he could not swear to me; I said, if you could swear to me at fourteen yards distance, why cannot you swear to me now; the Alderman said, he must commit me till the next morning; I brought several persons to my character the next day, and the Alderman discharged me; I believe he would swear to any man.</p>

               <p>I was crossing the top of Cheapside, on the 21st of January, about half past seven in the evening; as I was crossing towards Newgate-street, a coach was coming down, I stopped while the coach passed; a little boy was behind the coach, crying out, which drew my eye between the coach and the wheel; he was behind the coach riding; I saw the prisoner at the bar pulling his parcel, and saw the boy crying, and he pulled the poor boy down upon his hands and knees, and then ran away with the bundle under his arm; I cried out stop thief, and ran after him as fast as I could; before he crossed <placeName id="t17960217-40-crimeloc230">Cheapside</placeName>

               <p>I shall be ten years old next June. I was going to Sir Benjamin Hammett's with a bundle of cloths for three of the clerks; This the bundle (producing it). In the middle of Newgate-street, the prisoner got up behind the coach with me, and he asked me where I was going; I told him I was going along Cheapside, that was all the conversation that passed between him and me.</p>

               <p>Q. What did he do then? - A. He did not do any thing to me; but, at the bottom of Newgate-street, he snatched the bundle from me behind the coach, and he fell down, and the gentleman took him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am innocent of the crime laid to my charge; I know nothing at all about it; when I was taken, I was upwards of thirty yards from the coach, and, I declare to God, I am as innocent of it as the child unborn, in regard of taking it away; I was lame at that time, was the reason of my riding behind the coach.</p>

               <p>On Friday, the 29th of January, I lost eleven Seville oranges, eleven China oranges, and twenty-seven lemons, out of my cellar; they are worth 2s. On Thursday the 28th, about eleven o'clock in the evening, I went down in the cellar; I had missed a bag of oranges; I searched the cellar, in expectation of finding them; and found a smock frock laid in a corner; I took it up, and found there was a bag with fruit in it; the bag was tied, and the smock frock tied over it; I untied them both, and told the fruit out of the bag; there were forty-nine in the whole; I tied them up again and put them where I found them; the prisoner was a <rs id="t17960217-41-deflabel235" type="occupation">weekly man</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Vaughan. Q. As to the fruit, of course, a man of your credit will not pretend to swear to oranges and lemons? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no mark upon the bag? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not in the indictment? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never missed any fruit you suspected to be taken by the prisoner? - A. You had better not ask me that question.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on the Thursday or Friday, to which you are now speaking, take any oranges away? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.How long has this man been with you? - A. I believe about five months.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who he lived with before? - A. A grocer, in Bishopsgate-street, the corner of the Four Swans Inn; I don't know his name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever happen to lose your gold watch at any time? - A. The prisoner, I believe, did bring it up to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it? - A. I left it in the privy; he gave it to my apprentice, which was certainly a very good act.</p>
               <p>Q. This watch was of something more value than the oranges? - A. Yes; I should have been very much vexed if I had lost it; it was not a gold watch; but it was certainly of considerable value.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the bag there too? - A. Yes; I saw one end of it hang out of his apron, and then he went out; and I called the other man twice, his name is Charles; and then I called my master; he went after the prisoner, and caught him directly by the Cooper's Arms, in Botolph-lane; I saw my master take him, and I saw the fruit in his hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Vaughan. Q. The Cooper's Arms is a very little way from your house? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were these upper leathers lying? - A. Upon a cross bench behind the counter, one upon the other; he came to work about seven in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. His business is to open the shop? - A. Sometimes; but it is the business of the younger porter to open and shut shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the course of his business that morning lead him to the place where these upper leathers laid? - A. He must go there to unscrew the screws.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the shop that morning? - A. I came a little after seven, and found him there; he went out to breakfast between eight and nine; I had missed them before he went out.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any directions from your master, did you sollow the prisoner? - A. I did; he was got about two doors, I called John, he returned, and I advanced; I said, you must come back; he said,</p>
               <p>"why, what is the matter?" I said, John, there is an unfortunate circumstance happened, I have missed two pair of upper leathers, and you must go back; he hesitated, and rather refused to come back; but when I seemed determined, he came back with me; Mr. Jackson was waiting in the shop; we went up into the ware-room, and Mr. Jackson said, you must, or you shall be searched; I laid hold of his coat pocket, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170080"/>prisoner, in a very affecting way, said, I have got them; he took one pair out of one pocket, and another pair out of the other, and gave them into my hands; I have had them ever since, (produces them).</p>
               <p>Q.Are there any marks upon them? - A. There is my name upon them.</p>
               <p>Q.Where they marked before you took them from him? - A. There is the mark of the currier's man upon it.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there any further conversation between your master and the prisoner? - A. No more than the unfortunate man went down upon his knees, and begged for mercy, and he would do any thing if he would spare him; he said,</p>
               <p>"no John, I will hear nothing, say nothing, I have caught you."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did any such thing as this pass - the man said, he was in want of shoes, he had taken them and meant to account for them? - A. Not a word.</p>
               <p>Q.Was any promise made him, if he would tell any thing about it? - A. None at all; Mr. Jackson was very guarded.</p>
               <p>SILAS RANCE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the foreman that sells the leather; I happened to be there when the prisoner was brought back; they shut the door, and Mr. Jackson desired me to bear witness; that he had some suspicion of his robbing him, and he had some property about him; I left my work, and Mr. Jackson desired Cooper to search him; he first denied that he had any property about him, and then, he said, I have some of your property, Sir, and he put his hand to his right hand pocket, and pulled out one pair of upper leathers, and then to his left hand pocket, and pulled out another pair; I went for a constable.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, I did not disown having the property about me; but I did not mean to wrong him of them; I never did wrong any body in my life, to my knowledge; he has entrusted me with a great deal of property; I leave the rest of my defence to my counsel.</p>

               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>JOHN COOPER called up again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. This man has been in better circumstances, I believe; he was a horse dealer, in a considerable line? - A. Yes; since I have known him he behaved as a willing servant, and always did what he had to do cheerfully, and has sometimes done a job at over hours; he has a wife, a very honest woman.</p>

               <p>About a quarter after nine o'clock, on the 11th of February, Mr. Hill, the pawnbroker, sent for me; when I came into the shop I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner at the bar; there was nothing but the counterpane upon the counter; I asked the prisoner where the rest of the things were; the prisoner said, if I would go with her she would show me where the articles were; I went to her lodgings, and behind the door, upon an old hamper, the sheet was hung to dry, which she gave me, and a night gown.</p>
               <p>Q. Before she made this discovery, had you made any kind of promise? - A. No; as I was taking her to the watch-house, I asked her what became of the washing-tubs; she told me, she had sold them to Mr. Prior, a broker; I went to Prior's, with the prisoner, and found one of them; he had sold the other; Mr. Prior acknowledged he had bought them of her; I took her to the watch-house, and locked her up.</p>

               <p>Q. Is there any entry of the beer delivered to Mr. Corbet on that day? - A. There is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any entry delivered to Mr. Gouldstone? - A. There is, of three kilderkins.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing, in point of fact, of this day in particular; were you in the counting-house that evening? - A. I have not a recollection that I was; we have a store-house clerk that keeps a check account against it when the dray is loaded; he and the check-clerk count it over; and then in the evening, he is to give an account of what he has done with it; he returned at night, and has charged the beer to the different people, as is here mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you, in your pocket, any receipt, purporting to have been given to Mr. Corbet for beer? - A. I have, (produces it.) It is the hand-writing of

            ; it appears from the book, no beer was delivered to Mr. Corbet; and that there were three casks of beer delivered to Mr. Gouldstone.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Does the beer he was supposed to have received that morning, agree with the account he gave in the evening? - A. It does, exactly; he accounts for all the beer he received in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he return any beer that day? - A. If I look in the book I can tell; he returned one kilderkin, and seven sirkins, which he deducts from the quantity which he took out in the morning, which leaves the balance exactly right.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. When did this man leave your service? - A. At Christmas last.</p>
               <p>Q. These books are continually under your inspection? - A. They are, when I think proper to look into them.</p>
               <p>Q. And always under the inspection of your clerks? - A. It is his business to enter the beer into that book; and then it goes into the hands of the posting-clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge him with this entry at all before he left your service? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any difference now depending between you and this man; any charge of wages on his part? - A. He has sent me a bill for wages, of 12l. 3s. 101/2d. I have a set off for that of 34l. odd.</p>
               <p>Q. This demand he made before you brought this charge against him? - A. He wrote his bill out and sent it by his wife; I have never spoke to him at all upon the subject.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, upon the oath you have taken, whether he did not make this demand against you, before you made the accusation against him? - A. He certainly did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you took him up? - A. Perhaps a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he send more than once? - A. I never saw any body from him but once; his wife called once, and said she wished I would pay her husband's wages; and I have seen neither him nor her since.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been told, by your servants, that this man has been sending for his wages? - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170082"/>Q. Have not you reason to know that he has sent more than once? - A. If he has, Mr. Bittlestone will give you an answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, as a man of credit, don't you how that he has sent more than once? - A. Upon my oath, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you reason to believe, from your servants, that he has sent more than once? - A. I will not charge my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q.Try your recollection again? - A. I cannot say stronger than I have said.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, has it not been told you by your servants, that he has sent repeatedly for his wages? - A. If he has, I have no knowledge of it.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not more than a week before you took him up, that he sent in this account? - A. I have seen the prisoner several times since he left my service, in his last place, and he never mentioned a word to me about his wages.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose employ was he when you took him up? - A. In Messrs. Sharpe's employ.</p>
               <p>Q. The way, in which the account is made out, is, that he and the store-clerk together, make out the quantity of beer received for him to carry out? - A. They do.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you have not known frequent mistakes to happen about the quantities sent out, or the quantities received back? - A. Certainly; it is a very possible case to make a mistake.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it not frequently happen? - A. If it does happen, we don't hear of it.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask again, does it not frequently happen in your brewhouse? - A. It has happened several times with Butler.</p>
               <p>Q. This account, checked by your own clerk, tallies, does it not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Then your own clerk; whom you trust, has vouched, that the quantity brought back, and the quantity delivered, make up the quantity sent out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If there is any mistake in the account, you will make him answerable for it? - A. If they mistake, we certainly do.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not the constant practice, if a man's account is not correct, to make him pay the difference? - A. The only incorrection possible is, the man is to enter a less quantity than that he carries.</p>
               <p>Q. My question is this, whether if you find any mistakes in the delivery, and less is delivered than set down, is it not the constant practice to charge it against the man, and either make him pay for it in money, or deduct it from the wages due to him? - A. If we conceive it to be really a mistake, and not downright negligence, we don't.</p>
               <p>Q. If you consider it as negligence and carelessness, you do make it matter of account between you? - A. Certainly so.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you now consider this man as liable to pay you so much money? - A. No; I don't consider him as liable to pay any thing upon the face of his own account, taking it for granted his account is right.</p>
               <p>Q. But if you find afterwards the account is not right, do you not constantly charge the man with the difference? - A. I never charged him with the difference of any thing in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, when you find the party's account not right, is it not the constant course of your house to put so much against him, and if the account is not right, do you not charge it against him? - A. I have already said, I never made him pay the difference of an 8s. in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not the practice to make other persons pay it? - A. I have considered it as a right, but I never exercised that right; I have not a recollection that I ever did; I am sure I have not in Butler.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not, when you have found the account of others wrong, made them pay the difference, where there is an actual difference, whether you impute it to blunder or design, do you not make the party pay the difference? - A. I don't recollect hardly an instance.</p>
               <p>Q. Give us the few instances that you recollect? - A. Then I say, I don't recollect an instance.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say then, you did not recollect hardly an instance? - A. Surely, if you had not stopped me just when you did, I should certainly have said, I had not a recollection of an instance.</p>
               <p>Court. It is perfectly clear, and thus far you have got it, that when a man takes out beer and does not account for it, he must be answerable for that beer; but, says he, though the right is in me, I don't recollect an instance where we have exercised that right.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys Q. You say you have a set off of 35l.? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, is not this very beer included in that set off? - A. No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Every thing but this beer, I suppose? - A. No, certainly not; there are other things besides.</p>
               <p>Q. Every thing but the beer, included in your indictment? - A. No; 22l. of it is for receipts that we have against him, which he has received and not accounted for.</p>
               <p>Court. The question is, whether the beer you charge this man with selling, and not accounting for, you have made him debtor for? - A. We charge him with it as our clerk, in the morning.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You say there is a balance of an account; do you, in that balance due to you, include the beer which you now accuse him of having stolen as your property? - A. Certainly not; if it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170083"/>is so, it is a perfect mistake, it is in my partner Bittleston's hand-writing, I will run through it, and see.</p>
               <p>Q.Pray do be so good? - A. I see my partner has put the name of Corbet down.</p>
               <p>You see how incautious you are, you swore just now, it was not included in the set off.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is that book? - A. It is a book of mistakes and blunders that have come against this man, and which has been wrote down here as memorandums, as they have occurred at the counting-house.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Whether you have in the balance of the account made, as a charge against him, this beer, as delivered to Mr. Corbet? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that set off include this beer which you say never was sold to Corbet, and you make him debtor for that beer? - A. He is made debtor in this book for the beer.</p>
               <p>Q.Which book is written by your partner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you make him debtor for? - A. Twenty-two pounds seven shillings and six-pence, receipts coming against him, and the amount of this book is 11l. 19s.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You have charged him as your debtor with 11l. 19s. including the beer delivered to Corbet.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Gurney, Mr. Kirkman has now put a compleat end to the cause, because he first of all states the practice of the trade, which is a very proper one; there is an account taken in the morning of all the beer that he receives; in the evening. he is to account to whom he has sold the beer, and he is likewise to return the receipts when he does not bring the money; and it has been asked upon cross-examination, whether in case of accidents or mistakes, he does not account for it; he does not charge him with it, he says, he is liable, but he does not recollect an instance of it; but it appears, that, for this very beer he himself has done that which has made a debt of it, for, says he, we have charged this account with the identical beer he has sold to Corbet, and therefore we have made him our debtor, and therefore the law says, you shall not afterwards charge him with felony, you having made him your debtor.</p>

               <p>I am a carpenter: On Saturday night last, between seven and eight, I was coming past the house of Mr. Parke, and heard the rattling of copper.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door of the house open? - A. No, locked; upon hearing of this rattling of copper, which I had often heard going past the house, I called one of my men, and sent him for Mr. Dalton; he and another came, and five or six more; Mr. Dalton went in first at the casement window, which had been broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. Broke open by you? - A. No; we found it broke open; when we got into the house, I saw the prisoner trying up copper.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you discover where that copper came from? - A. Yes; from the top of the next house to that he was in.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose house did that turn out to be? - A. It belongs to the assignees of Mr. Park; built by Mr. Young, and assigned over to Mr. Park; it has been sold since. We took the prisoner away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the copper sitted to the top of the house? - A. No; John Dalton saw it fitted.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were they both empty houses? - A. Yes; it had been robbed a great many times of copper and sashes; I had been watching for some time back, though I was not at that moment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me do any thing with the copper? - A. I was not the first that went into the house, but I saw it tied up in an apron; I don't know that it was his apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else in the house before you went in? - A. I cannot say; we could not find any body else.</p>

               <p>Q. Did it appear to have been fresh cut, or to have been cut a long time? - A. Fresh cut.</p>

               <p>My Lord and Gentlemen. On Wednesday night last, I went out about a little business; I was out later than I should have been; it might be after twelve o'clock; I could not get a coach to go home; I took a walk round James-street, Covent-Garden; I went into a public-house; the prisoner was there; he asked if I was Irish; I told him I was, and he offered his service to see me home; the landlord of the house said, it was fitter for him to go to bed; he followed me out of the house; I did not see him for a good way; he came up to me in <placeName id="t17960217-50-crimeloc286">Greek-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you hear the foot behind you before the prisoner had his arm round your waist? - A. Exactly at that time; I charged him with taking my muff, and charged him with the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the muff in his hand? - A. No; I don't know what became of it; there was neither man, woman, nor child there, but the prisoner; I charged the prisoner with the watch, and he charged me, and we both went to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you bid the watchman look for the muff? - A. No; I did not believe it was of any service; I had not the recollection of mind, or I would have done it with pleasure, but I was quite frightened; it was very dark.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him take it? - A. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the prisoner continue with you after you had lost the muff, and before you called the watch? - A. Five minutes, we walked on together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge him with taking it before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170087"/>you got to the watchman? - A. No; I did not, I was so frightened.</p>

               <p>I am the manager of Mr. Edmund Hill's powder-mills; we have lost large quantities of saltpetre from the 14th of April to the 19th of December; when I made up my accounts, I always found short weight; in November ten hundred weight went of it; and, in December, thirteen hundred weight.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it prepared in any particular way? - A. Yes, calcined, as it is in no other place but his Majesty's magazine; nobody in the whole kingdom, but those who make gunpowder for government, have it calcined in that way; it was all marked as this is (producing a cake with the weight marked on it); the prisoner Mobbs was servant to Mr. Hale, a gardener at Twickenham, (two or three years back, or more than that; I don't know any thing of the other prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not one of the pieces that was stolen; have you seen any that was stolen? - A. I have, but it was melted down; I don't know it; there is some of it here.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You come here prepared to speak the whole truth, I hope? - A. Yes; I know both the prisoners. The prisoner Mobbs worked with me in digging gravel on the Hanwarth-Road, the gravel-pit is within a quarter of a mile of the powder-mills, to the best of my knowledge. I was at work with him about fifteen weeks ago, and he asked me if I would assist him with the property belonging to Mr. Hill, which was saltpetre; I agreed to his terms; and he said, he would satisfy me for my trouble; we went from our work that night, or the night after, between five and six o'clock, to Mr. Hill's mill, he got in at a hole where there were some boards taken away, at the back side of the coal-house; he took out, to the best of my knowledge, about a hundred weight; I took it of him, and put it on one side till he thought it convenient to come out again; we put it into a basket, and a bag, and put it on our shoulders; we were there near an hour; we took it to his house, and he put it into a shed adjoining his garden; I applied to Mr. Birch, of Twickenham, for a horse and cart for Mobbs, he let me have it; and the next morning, between five and six o'clock, <rs id="t17960217-51-off291" type="offenceDescription">

               we took the same saltpetre to London in the cart; it was in cakes, but some were broke; we carried it according to the description of Mobbs, to his brother-in-law, William Bateman, the prisoner
            </rs>.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does he live? - A. It is not in my power to tell you; it was carried to a shed in the alley where he lives; Bateman went with Mobbs and the saltpetre; I stopped at Bateman's house till they returned, they returned together. Bateman desired of Mobbs to come up stairs and he would settle with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those the words? - A. They were, I am sure; they went up stairs, I did not go up with them; we returned home with the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any part of the saltpetre, or any thing else, for what you did? - A. I received a guinea from Mobbs when I helped him bring it from the Mills.</p>
               <p>Q. You took about a hundred weight? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you carry to town? - A. About six or seven hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Bateman? - A. By Mobbs's account, he is a cutler.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. For a guinea you would break into any house? - A. No; he desined me to assist him, and said he would pay me for it.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave the Magistrate an account of all the bad tricks you have been guilty of? - A. I gave him an account of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever live with Mr. Howard, a baker? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he turn you away for? - A. He did not turn me away; it was by the agreement of my friends.</p>
               <p>Q.Whether your friends did not agree that Mr. Howard should not prosecute you? - A. I don't know; there were false witnesses brought against me; it is a hard thing for an innocent man.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been a thief in this instance? - A. We are all guilty of faults.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew very well you were to be prosecuted if you did not give evidence? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you taken up? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Then was it not in your power to tell whether you would be prosecuted or not? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. What had Bateman to do with it? - A. I don't know any thing he had to do with it, but put saltpetre in it. In the middle of December, he applied to me to dispose of a quantity of saltpetre for him; I took a sample of six ounces, it was at one Mr. Moore's, in Wentworth-street; Mr. Gabriel informed me it was there; I took it out of the bag it was in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Bateman say where it was? - A. I cannot say that he did; I told him I would try to dispose of it for him. I saw Bateman a day or two after, and told him I had offered it for sale, and was to have an answer in a few days; I told him I had got a sample of saltpetre from Mr. Moore's, and carried it to Mr. Macrae's, in Whitechapel; I received no answer from him till I was apprehended; Bateman was in my shop at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that it was the saltpetre that you were apprehended for? - A. I did not till afterwards; Bateman said, he would bring Gabriel forward, whom, he said, it belonged to, and that he would own it.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he done so? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever go out of town with Bateman? - A. No; about the beginning of November I was to have gone with him, in a chaise cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know what you were to go for? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How much faltpetre did Bateman tell you he had to dispose of? - A. Between four and five hundred weight.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in cakes, like that, (shewing him one)? - A. That at Mr. Moore's was in pieces. When I was taken into custody, and Gabriel was not brought forward, in the evening, I was permitted to go and endeavour to apprehend Bateman; Mr. Moore and I apprehended him just by his own house; I said, you are the man I was looking for; you must go with me; he said, very well; let me go peaceably; when we had got a few yards, he offered to run away; I ran after him, and caught him again; I kept him at my house till the officer came in the morning about eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You were apprehended and bound over to appear here, to answer to this charge? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You understood from Bateman, that this saltpetre belonged to Gabriel? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You took the sample from Gabriel's direction? - A. I took it by both their directions.</p>
               <p>Q.Then how dared you to state to the Jury, that it was only from Gabriel's direction? - A. I stated what I knew concerning it, as near the truth as I could; I don't know any thing that I have said wrong. Bateman told me, Gabriel would inform me where I should get it.</p>
               <p>Q. Bateman said he would bring Gabriel forward? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were apprehended? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Bateman was not apprehended? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He was by at the time you were apprehended? - A. Yes; but he went home when I was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. You know by giving evidence you save yourself from being prosecuted? - A. Yes; I look upon it in that light; I wrote a letter to the Magistrate, and stated every thing that I knew about the business.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know that by giving that account, you would be admitted an evidence? - A. I had some expectations of it at the time, but was not satisfied I should.</p>
               <p>Q. And the letter was wrote to the Magistrate with the hopes of being admitted an evidence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know where this shed is? - A. In Essex-passage; Bateman lives full half a mile off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Bateman in that shed? - A. Yes; the first time I saw him, Mobbs and he were leaving saltpetre there; he was there every week almost.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen Bateman there in the course of December? - A. Yes; Gabriel dealt in gun-stocks, and sometimes he was there about them.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Medwin). When the cart came to town did you put the saltpetre in the shed opposite his house? - A. No; Mobbs told me, it was carried about half a mile off from there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you it was half a mile? - A. No; by going the second time I thought it was that; he told me, the second time, that he had lodged the saltpetre in that shed the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who that shed belongs to? - A. No; I did not see any body there but Bateman and Mobbs.</p>

               <p>Q.Have you seen Mobbs since he has been taken up for this offence? - A. Yes; I shewed him this letter, and he acknowledged it to be his hand-writing; and said, he would disclose what he knew of the matter; and the jailor gave him a sheet of paper to write it out; but when he was before the Justice, he said, circumstances had happened since, that he had altered his mind.(The letter read, purporting to be his confession).</p>

               <p>I live in Wentworth-street, I am a fallow-chandler and oilman; I know Bateman by sight; in December last, Gabriel came and asked me to lend him a copper for melting saltpetre; Bateman and Gabriel were both there; they were there three or four times while the saltpetre was melting.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apprehend Bateman, or assist? - A. I did, along with a man of the name of Dickins; Dickins was himself apprehended at first, and was let go.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the saltpetre before it was put in the copper? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.There was some saltpetre found at your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You have no dealing in saltpetre yourself? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with Gabriel? - A. Three or four years; he keeps a chandler's and cheesemonger's shop, in Love-lane; and I serve him with candles.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me he was a chandler and cheesemonger; did not you think it strange that there should be some hundred weight of saltpetre, at a chandler's shop? - A. He merely came and asked me to lend him the copper; I did not ask him any questions where he got it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Dickins? - A. Yes; he is a cheesemonger in the same street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever lend this copper before for melting saltpetre? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you asked no questions about it? - A. No; I knew the man.</p>
               <p>Q. The officers found the property in your house? - A. Not all; they took a tub full away; I was out when Dickin was taken. Mr. Fish afterwards came into a house were I was, and asked, if Bateman was there, and if Mr. Moore was there; I said, yes; he said, come along with me, and explain what you know of this; I went with him to Bow-street, and told him how it came to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Fish communicated a suspicion, that the saltpetre was stolen? - A. I cannot swear whether he did or not.</p>

I cannot be positive who was the Bank clerk that attended the transfer, but I think it was Mr. Bicknell; at the time of the transfer, there was an observation made upon the name of the person who signed it, that there were two f s put instead of one name, upon which, the prisoner was informed, that as there was a mistake in the transfer of the name, there must be an affidavit made, to prove him to be one and the same person; I informed him, that he must go with me to the clerk who usually makes out affidavits, but he was not there; I desired him to wait till I came to him again; and when I returned, they had absconded.</p>

               <p>Q. Every thing upon the transfer, so far as the transfer was concerned, was complete? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After this, did you ever see the young man or the prisoner again? - A. On the 25th of January, I met the prisoner, and apprehended him; I never saw the young man again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. It is my duty to submit to your Lordship, under the correction of your Lordship, the objection I now take, at the moment that transfer is about to be offered to your Lordship, as purporting to be a proof of an interest in Harrison. My Lord, I take it, that not only all indictments, should bring the words within<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170092"/>the express Act of Parliament, but that the evidence should also bring the facts within the express words of the indictment. The indictment here charges this man with forging, or causing to be forged, a certain transfer. Now, my Lord, I humbly submit to your Lordship, that that which is charged to be forged and counterfeited, and that under which Harrison is said to derive his interest, is not a transfer; and that under that, Harrison had no legal interest. My Lord, to complete and constitute a transfer, it must be signed by the party transferring, and accepted by the transferee, and it has been admitted by the candour of the learned Gentleman who opened this case, that the latter constituent part is entirely wanting; that Harrison did not accept this transfer, which the executors on their part undertook to convey to him. And, my Lord, without these formalities, I submit to your Lordship, that it is that sort of thing which could convey no currency, and consequently no imposition upon society; that it is nothing more than a dead letter; that under which, no dividend could be received, and upon which no action could be maintained; but, my Lord, I do not stop here, for the Act of Parliament will be admitted to apply to every fund constituted by Government, and which is inserted in the very act, creating those funds, and the second section of that act runs thus: "And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that it shall and may be lawful for the Governor and Company of the Bank of England,"&amp;c. (reading the clause of the act).</p>
               <p>My Lord, I therefore submit, that that which is stated to have been a legal interest in Harrison, could not be a legal interest, inasmuch as it wanted that sort of formality, constituting an interest in law.</p>
               <p>The learned Gentleman, in his opening, has endeavoured to establish a distinction between a transfer on the part of legatees, and to an ordinary purchaser; from whatever source the learned Gentleman may have drawn that distinction I know not; sure I am, that the highest authority he can produce is a loose and lax, and perhaps reprehensible practice; but your Lordship will adhere to that sort of practice only, which by the act is expressed in terms as strong as language can be. My Lord, I will suppose for a moment, the converse of the proposition, and that, instead of this being a signature, without an acceptance, it had been an acceptance without a signature; is it possible to suppose, that such an instrument could be in law, capable of that sort of forgery, now charged upon the prisoner. My Lord, it can no more be said, that such a thing is a transfer, than that the preparation of a deed of assignment can be called an assignment, wanting the names of the parties.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I will refer your Lordship to two cases in my humble judgment, extremely in point; the first is the case of the King and Mossatt, tried at the Old-Bailey Sessions, in January 1787; it is in Mr. Leach's book 337."

I, which enact, in order to restrain them under a limited sum, that the place of abode shall be described, and other particulars; and the section concludes with saying, that all notes and bills of exchange negociated under this act, shall hereby be declared to be void. My Lord, in that case, the question referred to the Judges, was, whether if the bill of exchange set forth in the indictment be void by the above statutes, the forging of it can become the subject of a capital offence, within the meaning of those statutes. In February sessions, 1787, Mr. Justice Gould signified that the Judges had taken this case into their consideration, but that they thought it a subject which required further deliberation. In the May Sessions following, Mr. Justice Ashhurst delivered their unanimous opinion, that as the forgery was committed before the expiration of the statutes 15

            . chap. 51, and 17 George III. chap. 30; the bill of exchange, if real, would not have been valid or negociable, and that therefore the forging of it was not a capital offence. I submit with great deference to your Lordship, that this is a still stronger case than that which I am this day called upon to defend, in-as much as the bill of exchange was that sort of thing, which, by currency in society, might obtain, but not so in the present case; this could not legally be transferred to a second person; no second person could receive a dividend, or maintain an action under it; but is for want of that grand legal formality enjoined by the statute, a dead letter.</p>
               <p>My Lord, there is another case within the present experience of your Lordships, that I own appears to me analogous to this, because, if this be a transfer, it is not the thing charged in the indictment as an instrument establishing an interest in Harrison; I mean the case of Lyon, who was indicted for forging a certain receipt, or acquittance, purporting to be a receipt; it was demurred to, that the instrument was neither a receipt nor an acquittance, inasmuch as it was not filled up by the name of the person from whom the money was received.</p>
               <p>The opinion of the Judges was delivered in May, 1795, when one of your Lordships was pleased to say, "The"instrument must be set out, that the Court might see,"from its tenor, what it purported to be; and that it is"that which the law has protected. These receipts"ought to be filled up with the name of the subscriber;"it is then, and not before, an acknowledgement of the"payment of money, and becomes a receipt. If any"one takes a blank (for it is not a receipt), without a"name; he has no reason to complain of it as a fraud,"because, if he had looked, he must have seen that it"was no more than waste paper."</p>
               <p>My Lord, I submit, therefore, that this piece of paper, called a transfer, is not a transfer, unless it be attended by those formalities enjoined by the statute; for those formalities, essential as they may be in this case, happen to be entirely absent; and that it is that which, for want of acceptance, conveys no legal interest to Harrison.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Jackson was followed by Mr. Balmanno, on the same side; and on the part of the Crown, by Mr. Fielding, Mr. Knowlys, and Mr. Giles, to whom Mr. Jackson replied.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Lawrence. It appears to me, that this comes to the single question, whether the acceptance is a part of a transfer? if it is, the transfer is not complete; the indictment is for forging a transfer. Let us<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170093"/>see what a transfer is. - The Act says, that for all transfers of any sums of money, there shall be books kept, and an entry made of them; which entry shall be conceived in proper words for that purpose, and shall be signed by the persons making that assignment. It seems to me, that the transfer is complete on the part of the person who undertakes to assign that stock; however, if upon turning it more in my mind there should occur any reasonable doubt, then, unquestionably, in a case of life and death, I will take care that the opinion of the Judges shall be taken, if any doubt should occur to me that I am not aware of at present.</p>

I did; on the 14th of January, the prisoner came to me with Mr. Unwin, and a young man whom I did not know, to execute a transfer; after it was filled up, the prisoner signed to the identity of the young man who had signed William Harrisson; as the young man was signing his name in the book, I saw him sign two f s, whereas the transfer was filled up with one; I asked him, if that was his regular mode of signing his name; he informed me it was; I told him it differed with our books, and we could not admit it as a legal transfer, unless he went before a Magistrate and made an affidavit; they then went from our office, and I never saw them after.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the young man in the soldier's cloaths, is that the young man? - A. I don't think it is.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jackson. Q. You are a clerk in the Bank? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there not a standing order among the Directors, that no transfer shall be made till it is previously accepted by the party?</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are not all the orders of the Bank Directors in writing? - A. I believe they are.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. Do you not take orders from your superiors? - A. Most assuredly we do.</p>
               <p>Court. You cannot examine as to that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I did not mean to rob my nephew, William Harrison; I had a little cottage to sell; I was in distress.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>- WALSH sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Jackson. Q. I believe you are one of the superintendants of the Three per cent. Consols office? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. If the order be in writing, I have no right to ask you, but are you under such orders from your superiors, that no person shall transfer stock unless it is previously accepted by the party? - A. Public orders are stuck round the Bank of England, with clauses of the Act of Parliament.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what extract, and from what Act of Parliament it is, that is adjoined to those orders so stuck up? - A. An extract from the clause "That all stock must be accepted before the transfer is made." In the Three per Cent office we don't stand for acceptance before the payment of the dividend; but we don't suffer it to be transferred till there is an acceptance, unless it is by mistake or inaccuracy.</p>
               <p>Q. When dividends are about to be made, warrants are of course made out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any distinction made in those warrants, applicable to such as have, and such as have not been accepted? - A. In all the rest of the offices there are, but not in mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any check made in the ledger upon such occasions? - A. Yes; a mark, by which the clerk knows whether it is accepted or not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The rule is, that dividends may be paid without acceptance, but cannot be transferred without acceptance? - A. Yes; there are positive orders from the Directors to that purpose.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Suppose a person who has not accepted the stock comes to transfer it, do you make it accepted first, and then transfer it? - A. I don't know that they do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. It does sometimes happen that it is done without acceptance, when it is done by stock-jobbers? - A. Yes; it is too often.</p>
               <p>- SHARP sworn.</p>

               <p>I have known the prisoner a great many years; I have always considered him as an honest industrious man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. We have a very long lift of witnesses to his character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. There is no doubt in the world but he had a very good character before this time.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been at work in Essex; I came up to go to the hospital, being very bad; I went to get some work to support three motherless children; I went in there to ask for work, and I saw this saw outside the door; I took it up, and then this man came, and said, I had got his saw; I told him, then I begged his pardon; he let me go fifty yards, and then came running after me again, and said, you old blackguard, you shall go and ask my master's pardon, before you go now.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Mendez). Q. How far had he got from the shop when you took him? - A. About fifteen yards; as we came to Devonshire-street, he slipped from me, and ran five or six yards.</p>
               <p>Jury. Are you sure you left the saw in the shop? - A. I cannot swear it, but I believe I left it in the shop; I had used it three or four hours before.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; on the third of February, 1796, I was in possession of Mrs. Holbird's house for the King's tax; Esther Cavannah gave me charge of the prisoner; in his pocket I found a broken telescope tipped with silver; she said she would swear to that being in the box when I packed them up; I told the prisoner I should take him to the Compter; he said, for God's sake don't take me, I will tell you where the things are; I made him no promises at all; I asked him where they were, and he said, in Golden-Fleece-Court, in the Minories, in a cellar which he paid a groat a week for the use of to keep his baskets in; he sells fruit about the street; I went with him and found the things covered over with some hay; I brought him back to Mrs. Holbird's, and the box with me; Esther Cavannah informed me they were all right; that is all I know, (produces the things).</p>
               <p>(To Esther Cavannah). Look at these things; whose property are they? - A. Mrs. Holbird's; she is confinement.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. While she was in trouble, I moved all the furniture for her as quick as I could, for fear they should be seized; and I went to her in prison, and she desired me to sell these things to pay the taxes; I shewed the constable where I had put them for safety; I am as innocent as the child unborn.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Cavannah). What is Mrs. Holbird in consinement for? - A. For keeping a disorderly house, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner remove any of the things to avoid the taxes? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Hindes.) Did the prisoner remove any of the things that they should not be seized? - A. Not to my knowledge; the officer seized the things for the taxes, and sold the things for them.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.)</p>

After I had done work, I went to my wife; we returned about eight o'clock, found the door locked, and nobody at home; she had left the key next door; when I had got the key, and opened the door, I saw the prisoner's shoes on the floor; I went up stairs, and found a box of mine open, that was left locked; I am sure it was locked, because, as we sweat very much in our business, I went up for a handkerchief, and, the box being locked, I could not get one, I missed the things mentioned in the indictment,(repeating them); we went in search of the things to the pawnbrokers, but could not find them; the constable found my wife's cloaths upon her; my coat was found at Mr. Parker's, the pawnbroker, by the constable.</p>

Last Monday fe'nnight I assisted my man in bringing some beasts into the market in the morning, and, about nine o'clock, I sold Mr. Alexander several beasts, among which was the ox in question, for 24l. 10s; when I sold him, he was with thirty-four others in the drove; he was about eight years old, a fellow to six other beasts that had been all worked together for several years, single in harness, as horses draw.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a gamesome ox, likely to stray? - A. Quite the reverse; he was very much cut up by his journey; if he had been taken away, and had been at liberty, he would certainly have returned to his fellows, from his attachment to them, if he had been at a small distance. About half an hour after I had sold him, Mr. Alexander's drover came to fetch him, and the others from the drove, and he was missing.

On missing the bullock, I turned round, and offered 40l. reward for the person that had taken him upon conviction.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen Slokam that morning? - A. Yes, and was insulted by him as usual; I used to employ him, and turned him off.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the Bear and Ragged Staff? - A. Yes; it is about one hundred and fifty yards from where I was, the other side of Smithfield. Slokam came to me about half an hour after the beast was missing, and said, I must either drop, or come down a Quid before I could, or then I might have him again, or some such expression; I perfectly understood his meaning; it is a cant name for a guinea in Smithfield; I took no notice to him, but I was determined to lose the bullock rather than give a guinea to reward villainy; in the afternoon, he asked me it I had found my bullock; I told him I had not; he said, if I would give him a guinea, he would endeavour to find him, having heard of a bullock at Hackney, and that he would saddle his horse immediately and go after him; I made him no reply, but went to Bow-street; I directed my book-keeper, whose name is Bovill, to go and offer Slokam half a guinea to look for the bullock; I went to the prisoner, Slokam's house, in Bowling alley, Cow-cross, and found him in bed; I offered him half a guinea to find it; he said he would do nothing for half a guinea, but for a guinea he would, I told him I wanted to go out of town early next morning; he said I might depend upon it he should be found, and I might go; I told him to take him to Mr.

               <p>Q. Was that the same bullock that you had missed? - A. Yes; it had both my mark and Mr. Alexander's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You have known Slokam many years? - A. I suppose five years; he has been a drover all that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Alexander bought the bullock, you know; - A. Yes, for 24l. 10s.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a good bargain for you, you know? - A. The bullock was worth the money, and the money was worth him.</p>
               <p>Q. If it was Mr. Alexander's bullock that he had paid for, how came you to order him to be sent to Mr. Smith's, in Goswell-street? - A. Because I must have given Mr. Alexander back the money, and Mr. Smith had got a convenient place to put it in till the next market day, when I could sell it again, if Mr. Alexander did not chuse to take it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not usual to deliver the bullocks in Smithfield as soon as they are paid for? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you suppose Mr. Alexander would not take it? - A. I did not know, but my not delivering it to him the day he bought it, he might be obliged to buy another.</p>
               <p>Q. You found it at the very place it was ordered to be taken to? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether slokam was by when you offered 40l.? - A. I cannot say, but, in my own mind, I don't doubt it, because I made it as public as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. He said you must come down a Quid, that is a guinea? - A. Yes, before I should have it again, that after I had offered 40l. reward; I come up to Smithfield once a fortnight, generally from Christmas till after Lady-day; I am not very regular.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard of a stray bullock? - A. Yes, in that stile.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard of a stray bullock being recovered? - A. I have heard of their being recovered in that way, but I would scorn to recover any of mine in that way.</p>
               <p>Q.Is not the Bear and Ragged Staff a usual place for stray bullocks to be taken to? - A. It is very<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170098"/>possible, but it is a house I never went to in my life; I have heard since that it is; it is a place, like many others round Smithfield, when butchers cannot pay for their beasts, they are locked up there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand any thing more than that he would use his endeavours to find him? - A. I understood that he knew very well where he was.</p>

               <p>Q. Is is open over-head? - A. Yes; there are several doors to it; some that you can see through, and some that you cannot; some with pieces of board cut out for light to look through, or put your hand through.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see Slokam there? - A. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came for it? - A. I was not present when it was delivered.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. This beast was put in your yard, which is a place where beasts are usually put in? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HILL sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant at the Bear and Ragged-staff; I delivered the bullock to both the prisoners, between six and seven o'clock on Tuesday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen it at all before that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Trebeck. Q. You knew these men very well, and if they had come for half a dozen beasts, you would have delivered them? - A. To Slokam I should, he locks up a great many beasts at our house.</p>

               <p>I am headborough in St. Luke's parish; it was my night up at the watchhouse; the 16th of this month I was walking down Golden-lane, as I generally do once or twice in the night; I heard two people coming up on the other side of the way talking one to the other, this was a little before three in the morning; I heard them making use of bad words; I crossed over to them, and seeing me crossing over, they walked along rather faster; as soon as I got to the corner, they turned up Playhouse-yard; I saw the glasses between the men, they were carrying them in their hands, and they made a great rattling one against the other, which gave me a suspicion they had got something they should not have; seeing me follow, the other went forward, and this man dropped the glasses, and I stopped him.</p>
               <p>Q.Were the glasses broke? - A. No; they were set down by the wall, and were not damaged at all.(produces them).</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner had the possession of these two glasses? - A. Yes; I made a particular remark of him, his coat being out at both elbows, and his shirt hanging out.</p>
               <p>Rivers. This glass is mine; there were four lost out of the yard, only one of these is mine; they left each a stick in my ride, the one on one side, the other on the other.</p>

               <p>I am a box-maker; I live two doors from Mr. Tyrrell's, in Water-lane; I was at work in the shop, I heard the cry of "stop-thief," I jumped over the window, I saw the prisoner and the prosecutrix; I pursued him as far as Shoe-lane, and there he was stopped by some dray-man, or dustman; I don't know which, but he let him go and I collared him directly; but before I came up to him, I saw him throw the watch down; I brought him back to the prosecutrix; he was given charge to a constable, who was coming by accidentally, and brought to the New Compter, and from thence to Guildhall; I gave the watch to the constable.</p>

               <p>(There were several other Counts charging the like forgery, varying the intentions).(The indictment was stated by Mr. Dauncey).</p>
               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adair. May it please your Lordship Gentlemen of the Jury. - It becomes my duty on the part of this prosecution, to state to you the nature of the charge against the prisoner at the bar; and of the evidence by which it is supported, in order that you may be able to direct your attention to the principal points of that evidence, and to do that which will be extremely material to the prisoner, and to public justice, to distinguish the application and bearing of the evidence that will be laid before you; because it will be necessary for me to produce a considerable portion of evidence, which of itself will not criminate the prisoner at the bar; in order to establish a fact, without which, we cannot even begin to make a charge against the prisoner. It is certainly equally necessary to justice, that your minds should be prepared, that no further than that evidence is distinctly brought home to the prisoner, by facts fixed upon himself, or clearly within his knowledge, can any tittle of that evidence affect either the life or character of the prisoner; and no man, I am sure, will be more anxious than myself, not even my learned friends, to whom his defence, against so important a charge, is entrusted, will be more anxious than I shall be to point out that distinction in any evidence that I may offer to the Court, and in the outset to do that which my learned friends are not permitted to do, to caution you myself, to strip your minds of every thing which you may have heard or read respecting the transaction in question. The charge against the prisoner arises from a transaction of great public notoriety, and many things may have passed which are entirely unfounded in truth, and, therefore, from any thing you have heard, or any impressions made upon your mind, well or ill-founded, ought you to suffer, in the flightest degree, to enter your minds, but to wipe off, as far as it is possible for human nature to do, every recollection upon the subject, as if you were perfect strangers to every thing but what you may hear in Court, and from that, form your opinion, whether the charge is so made out, as to justify you in finding a verdict that will affect the life of the unfortunate prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the crime of forgery is one that is destructive of all security of property, and which tears up by the roots, the confidence necessary to be placed in solemn legal instruments; in short, leads to every kind of plunder, and is therefore justly estimated, by the law, the highest order of crimes that can be committed in a state of civilized society, and punished with death. It is the duty of Juries, in all cases to take care in judicial enquiries, not to proceed upon vague grounds of suspicion, and certainly peculiarly so, in cases that affect the life of the party.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, having thus shortly called your attention to the importance of your duty, it becomes necessary to give you as distinct and concise a narrative as possible, of this transaction; I will afterwards point out the more important facts, which apply to the questions you are to try; and give you a general statement of the nature of the evidence by which it is to be supported.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the will in question purports to be the will of a gentleman of the name of Lewis; and the first question for you to decide will be, whether that is the genuine will of the party or not; because, if upon the evidence in this cause, you should find reason, when you have heard both sides, either to think that this is in fact the will of Mr. Lewis, or to entertain any considerable doubt, whether it is or not, we certainly cannot proceed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170104"/>one jot further; for no evidence of suspicious circumstances, no evidence of mysterious conduct, nothing that tends to involve the prisoner in general suspicions, can have the smallest effect; if you are doubtful whether this is a genuine instrument, for the prisoner is not in the outset called upon to prove that it is a genuine instrument; God forbid that he should; but we are called upon to prove, in this case, something which partakes of the nature of a negative, but which is, however, an affirmative proposition, capable of proof that it is a forgery. The first point, therefore, for you to consider is, whether this is the genuine will of Mr. Lewis, or whether it is a forgery; which, if we should establish beyond any reasonable ground of doubt, for you are not to expect mathematical demonstration in the proceedings of the administration of justice; but you are not to pronounce him guilty of a forgery, if a reasonable doubt can be entertained, by conscientious men upon their oaths, fairly considering the circumstances of the case. And, gentlemen, if we should make out that proposition, still the prisoner will stand unaffected, unless we bring home a knowledge and participation of the prisoner in the acts of those persons who fabricated the instrument.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, Mr. Lewis, the real or supposed testator, was a clergyman, a gentleman of a liberal education, and of considerable accomplishments; a man respected in the neighbourhood in which he lived, for the character of a man of letters, and for a peculiarity of character, which may not be immaterial for your consideration, in estimating the probability of his having first made any will at all; or, secondly, a will of the kind which is the subject of this indictment; he was, besides being a man of letters, a proud and reserved man; not extremely communicative of his affairs; little disposed to confer with strangers, even upon trisling matters, much less upon matters of importance; and still less with persons of inferior rank, or of doubtful and suspicious characters. Mr. Lewis had been, through a considerable part of his life, involved in a litigation respecting the authenticity of his mother's will; it appears from some of the evidence in the cause, that that circumstance had made a strong impression upon his mind; what the nature of that case was, is totally immaterial; and it would only be wasting your time to allude to, further than to explain some of the declarations of Mr. Lewis himself, which have reference to the subject of this charge; it is sufficient that he had a strong impression of the forgery of his mother's will; and that that circumstance weighed so much in his mind, as, joined with other peculiarities in his character, to produce a determination in him, which appears to have continued to the time of his death, never to make a will himself; but, to use his own expression, to let the law make his will, and dispose of his property: you will find, therefore, that upon several different occasions, and to several different persons, for some time antecedent to Mr. Lewis's death, which happened in the month of January, 1795, he has declared, cost he never meant to make a will, and never would; and sometimes with allusions to the transactions of his mothers' will.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, you will find also, that he had no great esteem or affection for the family of a person named in this indictment, who is not now forthcoming to public justice; a Baronet, of the name of Sir

            , who had married a cousin of Mr. Lewis's; and in whose favour, as to a very considerable portion of Mr. Lewis's effects, the will in question is supposed to have been made; I mean in favour of Lady Briggs, and her posterity, not to Sir John himself; you will find, however, that the unfavourable impression he had received of the character of Sir John Briggs, had induced him to declare, at a period not very distant from his death, and long subsequent to the date of the supposed will, that none of the Briggs' family should have any portion of his property.</p>
               <p>This gentleman, so circumstanced, resided at Hygga, in Monmouthshire, a few miles distant from the town of Monmouth; he used to go frequently into Devonshire, partly on account of his health; he returned from thence to his own house, with a fevere indisposition, which terminated in his death, which happened at Monmouth, at the house of a relation, Mrs. Kane, the mother of Lady Briggs, in whose favour the will disposes of one half of his real estates, during her life; notwithstanding that circumstance, I believe you will find no hint was ever dropped by him, that he either had made or intended to make any disposition of his property by will; the universal impression by all his family, that this gentleman had died intestate; notice was given of his death to his different heirs at law, for he possessed several estates, some of which came to him by his father, and some through his mother; to his estates at Monmouth, the present prosecutor, Mr. Morgan, was maternal heir at law; there was no trace of a will found among his papers, nor no suspicion entertained, at that time, that any will was made. In that situation, the parties entered into possession of the different estates, and things remained in that situation from the time of his death, the 11th of January, till the 5th of April following; when a very singular transaction happened; a letter was received by a gentleman of the name of Lewis, at Monmouth, from a person of the name of Isgar, dated Bath, who stated, that the Rev. Mr. Lewis was indebted to him for witnessing his will; and, desiring to know where he might address him, in order to be satisfied for the trouble he had taken upon that occasion. This was a very singular occurrence, both in its nature and the time and circumstances, under which it came forward; and it was a singular sort of charge, for, I believe, it is one of the first instances of a bill brought in (at a distance of so considerable time from the date of the will) for being a witness to a gentleman's will. This extraordinary letter excited a great deal of speculation; and Sir John Briggs thought proper to set out for Bath, to enquire for this person, of the name of Isgar; he went with other persons, to Isgar; he asked him, if he knew any thing of a will of Mr. Lewis's; he replied, that he did; and, what is still more surprising, this man, an obscure man, resident at Bath, at this distance from Mr. Lewis's family, not only was a witness to the will, but had the will in his possession. Isgar produced the will; and, on the 5th of May following, this will was brought by Isgar to Monmouth; delivered to Mrs. Kane, the mother of Lady Briggs, who was appointed one of the executrixes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170105"/>Gentlemen, I ought now to state to you, what the will was; it bears date the 10th of August, 1791; near four years before the death of the testator, so that you will find, that most of the declarations of Mr. Lewis, the testator, that he never would make a will, are posterior to the date of the will; that he never had made a will, and never intended to make a will. The will is drawn formally, not with the appearance of having been drawn by a gentleman in Mr. Lewis's situation-a man of letters, a gentleman, and a clergyman; but drawn formally and scientifically; as if it was drawn by a man of the law, as you will find by the provisions.(Reads the will, for which see the evidence).</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the parties claiming under the will brought an ejectment for a moiety of the lands lying in Montgomery, against Mr. Morgan, the maternal heir at law of those estates, which had come to the testator from his mother, and who had entered upon them, upon the presumption, that Mr. Lewis died inteslate; that ejectment was tried at the last Summer assizes, at Hereford; and it becomes necessary to state, that upon the trial of that ejectment, a verdict was found against the authenticity of that will, for the defendant, the heir at law; and, here again, I think it my duty, on the part of the prosecutor, to state to you, that you are far from being bound or concluded by that verdict; that verdict does by no means prove this will a forgery; I will go further, I will say, that as against Mr. Crossly it is no evidence, that it is a forgery, because Mr. Crossly was not a party to that cause; nor appeared as an attorney in it, and therefore it is extremely possible that all the evidence may not have been distinctly laid before that Jury; or if it was, that that Jury may have formed a wrong opinion; you are therefore not bound by that verdict even to believe that this will is a forgery, which is the first thing we have to prove; but it is necessary to state that fact to you, that such a verdict was found. The noble and learned Judge, who tried that cause, thought it his duty, in furtherance of public justice, and in order that a transaction of so soul a nature, if that verdict was right, might be the subject of further investigation in a Court of proper jurisdiction; for it then became the subject of criminal jurisdiction; it was thought proper to detain the will: and Austin and Isgar, the witnesses to that will, were apprehended by warrant, and committed to Hereford Gaol; and while they were so in custody, one of those witnesses, whom I have already mentioned as residing at Bath, in an obscure situation, and of no very good character, thought proper to give intimations that he was ready to make a discovery of, what he alledged to be the whole truth; he purports to be a witness to that will; he therefore must have knowledge as to the question whether it is or not the will of Mr. Lewis; it was thought deserving of attention, and conducive to public justice, to attend to his offer; the Mayor of Hereford, accompanied by some other persons, with Mr. Stoke, the attorney for this prosecution, and attorney for Mr. Morgan, upon the trial of that ejectment, attended; Isgar repeated his offers of disclosure, and, in fact, gave an account before the Mayor of, what he stated to be, the truth, of that transaction. You will see, therefore, that that person, who stands in the light of an accomplice, who has witnessed a will, which he now says was a forgery, who upon the trial swore to the execution of that will, must necessarily for public justice, be brought to-day before you as an evidence: I need not, after giving this description of him, tell you, with how much caution you ought to receive testimony from so soul a quarter; I will even go the length of saying, that that testimony is wholly undeserving of credit, unless it is very materially confirmed by circumstances proved by unsuspected witnesses. Upon this verdict, however, and upon this disclosure of Isgar, other parties were apprehended; Sir John Briggs left the kingdom; that circumstance, however it might affect him, if he was now upon his trial, can have no influence upon your judgment with respect to the prisoner. Mr. Holland, another of the parties, has also withdrawn himself from public justice; Bowden, the other witness, being dead.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I have thus given you a narrative of the transactions which have led to this prosecution; it will now be necessary more particularly to state to you, the nature of the evidence, by which you will be enabled to form a judgment upon the two questions that will be submitted to your consideration; first, whether you are clearly satisfied that this is not the will of Mr. Lewis, which it purports to be, but is a forgery; and secondly, if it be a forged will, whether you have sufficient proof brought home to the prisoner at the bar, to satisfy you that he was one of the persons concerned, either in the immediate act of the forgery, or in publishing that will, with the knowledge that it was forged.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, that the will is a forgery will be to be collected from the substance of the will itself; from the characters and descriptions of the witnesses that have subseribed it; from the declarations of the testator upon the subject, compared with the will, the date of the will, and certain other evidence in the testator's hand-writing, found in different papers belonging to him, which are pretty strongly applicable to the question, whether the will is or not a genuine will: you will find that this will is made principally in favour of that very family to which the declaration of the testator was applied, long after the date of the will, that they never should have any part of his property; and the authenticity of the will will be still more materially affected by the will itself, which, pursuing the legal form which men of the law are used to, revokes all former wills made by Mr. Lewis, the said testator; from that, you are to infer, in the very teeth of all the declarations that you will hear, that this was not the first will he had made, but that he was in the habit of making wills from time to time; that it was necessary to revoke all former wills; and that applied to a person who repeatedly declared, subsequent to the date of the will, that he had never made a will at all.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, you observe the will bears date the 10th of August, 1791, that it purports to be witnessed and executed at Bath; and in point of fact you will learn, if it is necessary, from the noble and learned Judge, who tried the ejectment, that the witnesses swore to the eexcution of it at Bath; and they are, I believe, all of them, residents at Bath; now it will be pretty clearly, and unquestionably proved to you, that on the 10th of August, when this will bears date, Mr. Lewis was at home at Hygga in the county of Monmouth, and it will be prov<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170106"/>ed to you, by something more positive than vague recollection, by accounts of transactions at Hygga in his own writing, of things brought in, and payments made by him to different persons distinctly and regularly from a day prior to the 8th of August, down to the 12th of the same month, and afterwards to the 20th; but, from the 20th to the 27th of the same month, there is no entry made by Mr. Lewis in that book; the possible conclusion at least from which is, that he might have been absent from Hygga at any time, or the whole time, between the 20th and 27th of August. Mr. Lewis having been at home at the time the will bears date, proved clearly that the will could not have been executed by him at Bath; and this being more generally talked of than the prudence and reserve that ought to have been used, would admit, it became pretty well known that there would be strong evidence against this will, if that will was attempted to be applied to the day of its date, it appearing therefore, that that could not be the true date, and that unless the will was antedated, it could not be the will of Mr. Lewis; it is pretty remarkable, that afterwards, upon the proof of the will, the witnesses admitted that the will was antedated, and fixed the time of the execution in that very period in which the blank in this memorandum-book occurred, and a very lame apology indeed was made for antedating it; the reason given, was, that the draft of the will was left blank, and that it was filled up with the word tenth, because there was not room to write a longer word in the blank. Now, when you come to find, that this account was not given till after it was known, that the will could not have been executed on that day, that will be a circumstance of very strong suspicion indeed.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, from these circumstances, therefore, there seems to be strong evidence, that that was not the will of Mr. Lewis, and having laid that foundation of probability, I will add direct and positive testimony, by persons long and well acquainted with the character of his hand-writing, and who, I am told, will be extremely clear upon that point, that this is not his hand-writing. Gentlemen, besides this, you will find a very strong body of evidence, extrinsic of the will, to shew that a will was intended to be forged, and was actually forged for Mr. Lewis; you will find a meeting held with Sir

            , similar to those contained in the will, that is now contended to be his genuine will, similar exactly in the principal demises of the estate, the legacies somewhat differ in their amount, but are to the same persons, and in short there seems to be little doubt, that with the alterations which it would occur to a man of business, to make in this instrument, this paper was the prototype of the will now produced as the genuine will of Mr. Lewis; but that will is so ignorantly drawn, so illiterally expressed, so full of mispelling, in short, upon the face of it, so impossible to be the will of Mr. Henry Lewis, a gentleman and a clergyman of learning and education, that the moment it was read over by a man of sense, or a man of business, the observation which you will find afterwards was in fact made, must occur-this will not do, this can never pass as the will of Mr. Henry Lewis, but there is to that draft a signature of Henry Lewis, much more like his writing, than the will in question; but that is not all, for that paper contains absolute demonstration, that some persons were attempting to forge a will for Mr. Lewis, for it appears most distinctly, that when that draft was rejected as impossible to pass for the true will of Mr. Lewis, persons have been practising upon that sheet of paper, for you will find the name of Henry Lewis written over twelve or thirteen different times, sometimes Henry Lewis, sometimes Lewis only, and sometimes Henry only; in short, to imitate the handwriting of the testator, as will be proved by this paper.</p>
               <p>Why then, Gentlemen, that naturally leads me to the principal evidence in the cause, I mean the evidence Isgar, the accomplice; you cannot expect that many witnesses can give precise and positive testimony to an act of forgery, it will never be committed in the presence of any person who is not implicated in the guilt; it seems to me, therefore, that it can rarely, if ever, by any thing but accident, occur, that a Court, or Jury, can have direct evidence of the fact of forgery from what may be fairly called a credible witness; and in this case, the only direct evidence will be that of an accomplice; and, of an accomplice, I will fairly state to you, as little deserving of credit in himself, as any accomplice that can be called into a Court of Justice; because, he not only comes to tell you, that for hire and reward he became a subscribing witness to a forged will, but afterwards, that he came into a Court of Justice, by perjury, to support that forgery, stating himself to be present at the execution of that will by Mr. Lewis, which, he now says, never was executed at all; therefore, you will certainly not feel yourselves called upon to believe any thing that Isgar says, merely because he says it; or because he says it upon oath. I will now read to you the account Isgar has already given, and will, probably, again give of this transaction. Isgar states, first, a conversation which passed in London, in the month of February, with a person of the name of Clarke, an attorney, in Nottinghamshire, who will make a considerable figure in this transaction; and another person, respecting the writing of a will upon a blank sheet of paper, upon which the persons name should be subseribed. Holland was also present, and a reward was promised, at that time, to Isgar; and, he admits himself, from the pressure of distressed circumstances, to have assented to this wicked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170107"/>plan, and agreed to lend his assistance. He then states, that Holland, in the month of March, brought to his house, at Bath, a draft of a will, purporting to be the will of Henry Lewis; and that this was after the death of Mr. Lewis, that he produced a sheet of paper with the name Henry Lewis written upon it; he says, Holland, at that time, told him, that the paper was old enough; you see the meaning of that; that the will purporting to bear date four years before the testator's death, if the paper had been made a few weeks before, it would have furnished a means of detection. He admits that he himself copied that will upon the piece of paper so prepared he says, he sent it by the post, with a direction that he received from Holland; that Sir John Briggs called upon him with the will which he had so sent, and said, that that will would not do, for that the testator was a very particular man, and certainly would not have signed such a will as that. Sir John took it away, and, afterwards, Holland called again with the same copy, and asked if he could find a witness who could make good marks; upon which, he says, he soon after saw William Austin, the other witness to the will in question, and told him, that he knew how to put him, Austin, in the way of getting 100l. that he told him it was to put his name to a will; and Austin said, that he would do it; he says then, that Holland, Austin, and himself, went to a public-house in Bath, where Holland produced the will so copied; and Holland himself then went through the form of publishing that as the will, and then gave Austin a note for 100l. for value received, payable at Nando's coffee-house; he says, that for some time afterwards, and in his original account, given before the Mayor of Hereford, it appears, that the first time he saw Sir

               <p>Gentlemen, I have now gone through the account of this nefarious transaction, by a party confessing himself to be an accomplice. Gentlemen, from the difficulty of bringing forth transactions that in their nature shun the light; the wisdom of the law does not wholly reject the restimony of accomplices, but directs Juries to receive it with great caution; unquestionably, because a man who comes into Court to impute to himself a degree of guilt equal to that of the prisoner at the bar, is not entitled to the same belief as what the law calls a fair and credible witness; but it would be perfect nonsense if the law admitted such evidence to be examined, and at the same time said, that when he is examined, you shall in no case be permitted to believe it; that would be an absurdity, which cannot be imputed to the laws of this country. The law therefore takes the middle line, which is the line of justice and common sense; it says, we will hear what a man has to say, who even stands (to make use of that vulgar expression) in that blasted situation that I have described; but we will hear him with caution; we will attend very minutely to the circumstances of the story that he tells; we will judge of its probability; but we will go further, we will examine whether he is so confirmed by written evidence, or by facts proved by credible witnesses, as to satisfy the Jury, that though the story is told by a person who himself is not worthy of belief, is nevertheless a true story.</p>
               <p>Now, Gentlemen, I have endeavoured fairly to state the point of view in which you are to consider the evidence that is to be given by Isgar, and it now becomes my duty to state to you, what the circumstances are, by which this evidence of Isgar is to be consumed. Then, Gentlemen, the first material thing that Isgar states is, that

             subsequent application; now that will be confirmed in the most clear and satisfactory manner, by the fabricated draft, upon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170108"/>which I have already observed; with that number of names to it, found in Holland's house; that therefore Holland was possessed of a paper, as described by Isgar, is certainly true; for that is proved beyond a possibility of doubt. Another very particular circumstance that confirms it is, that this very paper is in the hand-writing of Isgar, who says he wrote it. Another very remarkable thing is, Holland saying to him, that the paper was old enough; now you will find, that in a letter found at Crossley's house, from Clarke, couched in very mysterious terms, which indicated pretty strongly, that they were engaged in some nesarious transactions together, and which concludes with this remarkable expression,"I have some very choice paper forty years old:" so said Clarke to Crossley, on the 6th of March, 1795. The other parts of the letter are so unintelligible, that I have not ingenuity enough to apply them to this or any other transaction. Gentlemen, when you find that, and also the other correspondence that will be produced to you, between Clarke, Crossley, and Holland, writing to one another in this enigmatical manner, will confirm that part of the testimony of Isgar.</p>

               <p>The next point in which Isgar's testimony is confirmed will be this, that after Austin had subscribed his name to the paper produced by Holland, and had agreed to become a witness, Holland gave Austin a note for 100l. payable at Nando's coffee-house, for value received. I will give you unquestionable proof that that part at least of Isgar's testimony is true, because that when Austin was apprehended at Hereford, that very note was found in Austin's hat. That note is antedated; for it is stated by Isgar to be in March, 1795; and the note is dated the 12th of December, 1794; and when that note is produced, you shall have the examination of it; you shall hold it up to the light, and you will see very clearly, that though it bears date upon the face of it on the 12th of December, 1794, the note was written some time in 1795; because you will see that the figure 4 is written over a 5; that therefore must have been written in 1795: it was delivered to Austin in March 1795; the 12th of December, 1794, therefore, could not have been the date of it. That part of Isgar's testimony, therefore, is true beyond all doubt.</p>
               <p>The next confirmation of Isgar is this, that in April he and Austin came up, at the desire of Sir

            , to London, to meet Crossley, where the forgery was committed. Now I shall prove that Austin and he appeared in London together about that time; that will be proved by the person with whom Isgar lodged, in St. Martin's-lane; and by the sister of Austin, who will prove that Austin was in town at that time; and the person with whom Isgar lodged will prove that Austin came to him while he was there: that is another confirmation of Isgar's evidence. His connexion with Crossley will also be proved; from some very material circumstances it will appear to you, that Crossley was seen with these men, by credible witnesses; and the witness says, that Mr. Crossley made use of the same expression to him that Holland had before done, in telling the witness that he had taken care in seeing that the paper was old enough for these purposes; there it is only necessary to remind you again of Clarke's letter to Crossley, stating, that he had got choice paper forty years old. He says then, that Mr. Crossley dictated the letter he wrote to Monmouth, respecting the will; that may or not be true; it is no further confirmed than shewing that they were together; but that such a letter was received is certain, for it bears date upon the 5th of April, and being antedated, it was not received till a period late enough to be written after the time he met. Crossley in London; it was not actually received, I believe, till the latter end of April, some days after Isgar had been in town, and had been seen with Mr. Crossley. Then Isgar states, that he was to have 500l.; that he received a bill of 501. which he paid to Crossley, and 10l.; in that you will find him confirmed by a letter of Crossley's, on the 2d of May, to Holland; in which he states that fact; and in another letter of the 2d of June to Holland, he says, "I have now advanced 70l. 10s."60l. on account of his bill for the goods, in which"your 50l. is included." So that it is a proof that Mr. Crossley paid 10l. and this bill for 50l. makes exactly the 60l.; in which Mr. Crossley himself states, the bill is included."The ten guineas is paid by order of"Monsieur." We cannot say who that was; it was likely to be Sir

Then, he says, "however let me have the 70l. 10s. by" return of post, and it may be best to let him have 40l."more, as he so much presses; but of this do as you"please; I told him, you ought not to pay for the"goods till the sale money was paid to you." Now these are circumstances which do pretty strongly confirm the testimony of Isgar. There is also in this letter of the 2d of May, very strong matter of crimination against the prisoner; for you will find him giving a false account of some transactions, in which he was then concerned; in that letter you will find the prisoner had the andacity to make use of the name of that very respectable gentleman who at this moment attends here, I mean Sir

You will also find that Eberno was to be at the King's-head on Monday, and that Crossley writes to Holland, and expresses great uneasiness at not hearing of Isgar's arrival; it will apear that Isgar was not at the King's-head, as Eberno was expected to be, but was prevented, as he says, for want of money; he goes, in fact, to Bath, and from Bath to Monmouth, but not till late on Tuesday the 5th, when he carried the will in question; and Mr. Crossley afterwards had advice from Mr. Clarke of the arrival of Isgar at Monmouth, upon which you will find he sets his mind at rest, which it was not till then, owing to the non-arrival of Eberno at the King's-head on the 4th.

             told me to advance him five"guineas more, which I did; you might as well request"the payment of that five guineas, as it is best to keep"no account but what is clear." The conclusion of the letter says, "I hope Mr. Eberno will not be kept an"hour at the King's-head, as I have given him orders to"depart as soon as possible." So that as soon as Isgar had done his business, that is, carried the will, he wished him to get away as fast as possible, and I believe, when you are satisfied that Eberno means Isgar, you will have as little doubt that Sir

             and Mr. Crossley; after that, Mr. Crossley returned to London, and you will probably find that the forgery was there planned, which was afterwards executed at Mr. Crossley's house.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, another circumstance will strongly confirm the account given by Isgar; he tells you the way in which he received the 60l. he says, Mr. Crossley gave him change out of it; he says, that Mr. Crossley gave him two Abergavenay bank-notes for five guineas each; I will prove that two such notes were seen in the hands of Isgar at that time; he tells you further, that Mr. Crossley paid him that 10l. by a draft upon his bankers, Morland, Hammersley, and Co. in Pall-mall; I will prove by the clerks of that house, that that draft was received by a man of the name of Isgar, so that in many points his story is confirmed, and in many points that connect him with the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, there is, besides that, a letter found in Mr. Crossley's possession, from Clarke, manifesting some intelligence he had received from Mr. Crossley, by means of a person of the name of Vincent, who is referred to in some other of the letters, in which he says, on the 13th of September, 1705, (a letter found at Crossley's, after Holland's house was searched);</p>
               <p>"I"have received your's, and am sorry Dixon's sample"is found; what a fool must he be to write so many"names as you say he hath done." Now I will prove Dixon to be a name by which Holland was known; and when I produce the draft of the will, with so many names subcribed to it, it is impossible to doubt that this will is a forgery, and that this letter had reference to it. He says, "What a fool must he be to write so many names,"as you say he hath done; you may be certain it is all"his own doing; I have had no letter. - Vincent called"here while I was with you; he said, he should call"again before he went back into the West, and from"him I shall have the whole history."</p>
               <p>Now, gentlemen, these circumstances confirm very strongly the testimony of this witness, in points directly connected with the prisoner at the bar. - And, Gentlemen, at the time Mr. Crossley was apprehended at his house, in the Adelphi, the first paper that appeared lying upon his desk, was the blank cover of a letter, having the Hereford post-mark upon it; and being of a date referrable to this transaction, it suggested itself instantly, that some light might be thrown upon the transaction by this letter; Mr. Crossley went to his private drawer, but upon being asked respecting that cover, he he denied having any knowledge of the letter from which that cover was torn; he supposed it was something that had been destroyed by some of his clerks; upon opening the private drawer; there were two particular papers, upon which Mr. Crossley made this observation, I suppose this is what you want. - Now you shall hear what that was which Mr. Crossley supposed they wanted; you will find it was the half sheet torn off the cover I have already described to you, and as that will be matter<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170110"/>of eye-sight, I shall say but little to you upon the subject; if you place them together, it will appear that the waterlines in the paper correspond, and the water-merk is torn in the middle; you will therefore be convinced, that that is the letter which belonged to that cover; it is a letter from. Hereford, written by Austin to Crossley; the evidence of it, as against Mr. Crossley, is, its being found in his possession, under the circumstances I have stated; it is a letter complaining of the hardships they had suffered in jail, Isgar and Austin being then in jail; upon this charge, Isgar not having at that time made any discovery; it is dated the 29th of September,</p>
               <p>"I"shall be glad of your answer as soon as possible, to"know what we are to do, &amp;c." (See the Evidence). Now this letter from Austin is found in a private drawer at Crossley's; it is first denied by him, and then he said, this is, I suppose, what you want. This is a very strong circumstance, which seems to have nothing particular in it, except from the story of Isgar; and is a very essential paper to implicate Mr. Crossley in the transaction.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I beg pardon for having taken up so unreasonable a portion of your time; I have endeavoured to point out, as clearly as I could, the circumstances brought home to the prisoner at the bar, by which the evidence of Isgar will be confirmed; and the greater part of those circumstances are by written evidence, proceeding very much from the prisoner himself, or found in his possession; if therefore the evidence of a person, totally discredited as to his own veracity, can meet with belief in a Court of Jutice, and if it cannot, I know no purpose for which the law receives it; the circumstances of confirmation do appear to entitle this evidence to be received at least, with much attention, and well weighed by the Jury. It is not my duty to press it further upon your minds, you will judge for yourselves; assisted by the directions you will receive from the learned Judge on the beneh, whether applying the whole of those circumstances that fairly do apply to the evidence of Isgar, weighing on the one hand the character of the witness, and on the other the material circumstances in which he is confirmed, you will pronounce your judgment whether you believe that evidence or not.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, I shall call the evidence on the part of the prosecution, again asking pardon for having trespassed so much upon your time, in the sincere hope that the evidence may not come up to my statement; no man will be better satisfied, if, upon a full and fair examination of all the circumstances, you should feel yourselves authorized (in point of conscience, and with attention to your duty, and the oath you have taken) to acquit the prisoner at the bar, than I shall be; but if you should entertain no rational doubt, and your minds are clearly satisfied(as in a case of this nature you ought to be) of these two propositions - that the will is a forgery, and under the knowledge of the prisoner; then it is a duty you owe the public, to bring to justice the perpetrators of so foul a transaction as this.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. From whom did you receive that? - A. It was read by me, given in evidence in Court, and I was ordered by the Court to take possession of it.</p>
               <p>Q. From whose hand did you receive it? - A. I believe Lord Kenyon's; I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Further than from the belief that his Lordship delivered it to you, you don't know from whom you received it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You won't affect to be positive that the noble Lord delivered it to you? - A. No; I will not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. As to whether that instrument was read in the cause or not, that of course you can only speak to from memory of the supposed contents? - A. I marked it at the time, and have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to tell my Lord and the Jury the title of the cause? - A. Doe on the demise of Kane and others, against Morgan, Esq.</p>
               <p>THOMAS STOKES sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Mils. I am an attorney, at Monmouth; I was acquainted with Mr. Lewis till the day of his death.</p>
               <p>Q. For what length of time? - A. For about eleven years.</p>
               <p>Q. During that time, were you employed by him to transact any business; or were you acquainted with his house? - A. For upwards of seven years I was attorney for him in several causes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Mr. Lewis? - A. A clergyman.</p>
               <p>Q. What fortune had he? - A. I believe he had estates, freehold and copyhold, to the amount of 800l. a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any personal estate? - A. Very trisling.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know his habits of life? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they; with whom did he associate? - A. With Mrs. Kane and me; at Sidmouth and Monmouth he passed most of his time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he live with persons of his rank, or persons of inferior rank? - A. With persons of his own rank.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he was a scholar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How nearly was Mrs. Kane related to him? - A. I believe they called one another cousins; but I don't know whether they were so related.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you often seen him write? - A. Many times.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you seen him write his name often? - A. Very often.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that signature and say what you believe of it? - A. I have examined it frequently, and my opinion upon my oath is, that it is not Mr. Lewis's hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. State any thing you see particular in that hand-writing that makes you think so? - A. It is wrote more formal, not with that degree of freedom and case with which Mr. Lewis generally<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170111"/>wrote; from the observation I have made upon it, it appears to me as if some part of the pen had went over after some of the letters were formed.</p>
               <p>Q. From your knowledge of his hand-writing, and your observation upon that, what is your opinion? - A. That it is not the hand-writing of Mr. Lewis.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, in the course of your acquaintance with Mr. Lewis, hear him at any time, and when did you first hear him, speak about his will? - A. In 1789, I was concerned in Iitigating a cause for him about his mother's will; I was in London with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. My Lord, we humbly conceive, that this can be no evidence; it is most truly, most distinctly, and most honourably stated by my learned friend, who has just now opened the case for the prosecution, that it cannot be, unless this will is brought home to the prisoner. My Lord, if we were in a civil cause here between persons, litigating this property, connected with this family, and capable of course from that connexion of applying for evidence to counteract evidence of the description that is now given; I understand the objection was not taken before the noble and learned Lord who tried the cause, but supposing it was taken; if it was admissible there, it is not admissible here: Mr. Crossley stands (a mere stranger to the deceased), charged with a crime, and therefore, if the authenticity of the will is first to be settled or destroyed, and if Mr. Crossley cannot be affected till that authenticity is destroyed, the authenticity ought not to be effected by the evidence now offered before your Lordship; because having no concern with this testator, undoubtedly he has not the opportunity of answering it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, the evidence, now offered, is, declarations of the testator, of two sorts; with respect to his being testate or intestate, and with respect to his intention, whether he should die without a will or not; and to be sure there are many persons, very honourable persons, have, during their life-time, stated such declarations, that they have made no will, when it has turned out afterwards that they have made one; I speak from my own experience; declarations of this kind are frequently made, when the persons themselves have actually made a will; and therefore I conceive it to be extremely dangerous to admit this upon the first branch of the cause; the question, whether this be or not Mr. Lewis's will, I submit, is not evidence; it is impossible to enlarge upon it, it is a simple question.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. My Lord, I think I am merely to consider it from the situation in which Mr. Crossley stands; Mr. Crossley, being here in this situation, has a right to object to any part of the testimony, however it may appear to the Court, only to be matter of form or not; he having a right to object to that testimony, so he offers his objections to your Lordship; now, my Lord, a declaration made by this gentleman, he not now being living, there is no posible way in the world in which that declaration, as I conceive, in a criminal cause, could be produced here. My Lord, if he had made that declaration in articulo mortis, it could not have been produced; no situation could have been given to render that declaration available, and indeed it passes as a mere hearsay, not applicable to the case, but only applicable to that first part of the case, which the learned Sergeant has acknowledged he must establish, before he can go to the immediate corpus delecti here, but having a reference by possibility; here the prisoner calls upon your Lordship to pause before you receive it, and before it is received, I take it for granted, that your Lordship would expect from the gentlemen on the other side, to say under what sanction this declaration would be made evidence in a Court of Justice; that it has a bearing upon the first part of the case, which we, as counsel for the prisoner, are bound in duty to take; it appears to me, without troubling your Lordship further, that it is impossible in the nature of things, that any thing that gentleman has said, in the course of his life, under any sanction whatever, could be made evidence in a Court of Justice, in a case where the prisoner is trying for his life.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. My brother Adair stated, in the opening, very properly, two points to consider, whether it is a forged will or not; and whether it was forged by Mr. Crossley. As to the first, if Mr. Crossley had nothing to do with it, it is of no consequence whether it is a forged will or not; but it is incumbent upon the prosecutor to make out that this is a forged will; I think it is evidence subject for the observation of the Jury; his declarations are, in my opinion, evidences.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell. Q. State the declarations you have heard him make respecting a will? - A. I was in London with him in 1789; I was then concerned for him respecting litigating his mother's will; he lodged at Peele's coffee-house, in Fleet-street; and there, in the act of writing a letter, fell down in a sit; I thought it a very proper opportunity to remind him of the unsettled state of his own affairs; he told me then, he had not made a will; he never would make a will; the law should make his will; in the year 1791, I received a letter from a Mrs. Harman, of Bristol, who was the heir at law of Mr. Lewis, and in very distressed circumstances.</p>
               <p>Court. Do not tell us the contents of that letter. - A. I made an application to Mr. Lewis, to relieve her necessities; this he refused, on account of his own pecuniary embarrassments; saying, that she must wait till he was dead, then she would have all; she being his heir at law.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the person, I believe, who is now claimant? - A. It is upon the paternal side; he had frequently told me, that she was his heir at law; in the month of October, 1793, I received a letter from a Mr. Jacobs, of Bristol against Mr. Lewis, desiring to have him arrested; Mr. Lewis and I had a little shyness in consequence of it; I thought it my duty to send for him; I informed him of the circumstance of having a writ against him: on the 22d of October he was at my house, for the purpose of putting in bail to that writ; I joined in a bail-bond with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170112"/>Court. We don't want all those circumstances. - A. I am coming to it; he then told me that he had never made a will; he never would make a will; and that the law should make his will; this I am positive was on the 22d of October; I don't confine myself to these three times only, he has many times told me so; but I don't fix my memory as to the times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear him make any contrary declarations? - A. Never; they were constant and uniform.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Mr. Lewis die? - A. The 11th of January, 1795, and was buried on the 16th of the same.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before any mention was made, or any report made of a will? - A. I heard of a letter being sent to Monmouth the latter end of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Kane lived at Monmouth? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he die? - A. At Mr. Kane's house.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have some papers here? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Produce those you had from Mr. Phillips first? - A. All but one, which I had from the officer that searched the house,

On the 7th day of October last, I went with a search warrant, backed by one of the officers at Bow-street; and a warrant to apprehend Mr. Crossley at the same time; Sayer, an officer, went with me; I found these papers I now hold in my hand, and a cover of a letter, on Mr. Crossley's desk.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you come upon him by surprise? - A. Yes; he did not resist any thing; I asked Mr. Crossley for the contents of that cover; I saw the Hereford post mark upon it; and that made me so pressing for the contents of it; he made me some kind of an evasive answer, either that they were destroyed, or he knew nothing of them; we then proceeded to our search, and I permitted Mr. Crossley to take his papers out of his private drawer; the key of which he had: and I observed that he kept under his left hand two small papers; and appeared anxious to conceal them; I told him, he must let me have them; and then he gave them to me, saying, I suppose this is what you want; and he then gave me the two papers I now hold in my hand.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he point to one of them particularly? - A. No; he did not; he gave them me both at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him upon the letters appearing to be signed by the name of Clarke? - A. Yes; he told me it was Mr. Clark of Worksop; I then took the papers away; there were some books also.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you get those papers from? - A. Millar, the officer, gave them to me; I made him mark them; and they have never been out of my possession; these books have been out of my possession some time: upon Mr. Crossley going to Hereford, he wished to have access to these books; I gave them to Mr. Barrow, the Mayor of Hereford, on the 10th of October; I think that was the day that Mr. Crossley was committed; I did not take the books from Mr. Crossley's house; Sayer, the officer took them; he has marked them, and I marked them also.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. They were found at Mr. Crossley's, and you have them here? - A. Yes; I received them from Mr. Barrow, in December last; since which they have not been out of my custody.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have the register of Bowden's death, the other witness to the will? - A. I have,(produces it).</p>
               <p>Q. Have you examined this? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it an exact copy? - A. It is; from the parish of Bethwick, in the county of Somerset; he was buried the 10th of November, 1794, (the witness produces a copy from the bail-book, of the bail put in for Isgar upon the 1st of May, 1795).</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search for any bail put in by Isgar? - A. I have searched in the Crown office for the whole of Hilary term, 1795, and Easter; there is no recognizance in the name of Eberno: I made the same search at the Prothonotary's of the Court of Common Pleas; afterwards at the Three Secondaries of the Court of Common Pleas; afterwards at the Four Judges Chambers; the Court of King's Bench; Exchequer office; Lincoln's Ian; I searched through every office, and could find no such thing: this is an office copy of the record of the judgment in the cause of Doe, on the demise of Kane and others, against Morgan, (producing it).</p>
               <p>Mr. Mills. Q. I believe you were present, or applied to by Isgar, before he was admitted to bail? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he spend much of his time at Sidmouth? - A. The latter part of his time; he left Sidmouth a few days before Christmas-day, 1794.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170113"/>Q. How long had he been there at that visit? - A. I suppose he had, to and fro, for two or three months.</p>

             were near Sidmouth at that time? - A. Yes; his eldest son was near Sidmouth with the militia, and sometimes at Sidmouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with Mr. Lewis upon the subject of the family of the Briggs's, and particularly respecting his will? - A. The conversation I had was, I used to ask Mr Lewis about Sir John Briggs; he said, he knew little or nothing about Sir John, and he should not concern himself about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him about this son? - A. I had; I told Mr. Lewis that Sir John's son would probably be at my house with the other officers of the militia, and asked him to come and spend the evening there; he told me, as Sir John's son was there, he should not come; I said, if he was displeased with Sir John, why with his son; that as he had some property to leave, he said, he should never give any thing, directly or indirectly, to Sir John, or any part of his family.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear him say whether he had or not made a will? - A. I never heard him say it.</p>
               <p>Q. You have frequently seen him write. - A. Yes</p>
               <p>Q. Have you frequently seen him write his name? - A. Frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as look at that will, and see if you believe that to be the hand-writing of Mr. Lewis? - A. I do not think it is.</p>
               <p>Q. In what does it appear to you to differ? - A. Mr. Lewis would take his pen from the end of the n, before he made the r; and frequently be a break off between the n and the r.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon the whole, do you believe that or not to be his hand-writing? - A. I believe it is not his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PHILLIPS sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. You were attorney in the cause tried at Hereford, between Mrs. Kane and Mr. Morgan? - A. Yes; for the defendant.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you at London at the time of the death of Mr. Lewis? - A. Yes; he died at the house of Mrs. Kane.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you acquainted before that time with Mrs. Kane? - A. Yes; intimately and confidentially.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you called in upon the death of Mr. Lewis? - A. I was; in consequence of a note that I received, I went to Mrs. Kane's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any searches when you were there? - A. Yes; I searched the pocket-book of Mr. Lewis, and the other papers brought to me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What day was this? - A. The 11th of January.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon that search, did you or not find any will of Mr. Lewis? - A. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.(Hands him a book). Do you know that book? - A. Yes; I saw this book with some other papers sent me from Sidmouth, by Mrs. Jenkins.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the hand-writing? - A. I have very frequently seen Mr. Lewis write, and I believe this is hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at that will, and tell me, whether in your opinion that is the hand-writing of Mr. Lewis? - A. I don't think it is.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you speak generally, or are there any particular circumstances in the writing that induce you to say so? - A. It appears differently from the signature that I have seen him sign several times.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the difference between this signature and that you have seen him sign several times? - A. The letters appear to be rough, and not with the same freedom and ease that he was used to write with.</p>
               <p>Q. By rough, do you mean jagged? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver any to Mr. Phillips; and where did you get these papers that you did deliver to Mr. Stokes? - A. I had received a number of papers that I had received from

               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. As to that kind of evidence, as far as my own practice has gone, it is such slight evidence, that forte persons will say one thing and some another; I have heard witnesses say, that in their opinion a signature must be a forged one; and on the other hand, others have said, that they did not believe it to be a forged one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adair. I will not press it, my Lord.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Mills. Q. You were acquainted very well with Mr. Lewis? - A. Yes, for several years.</p>
               <p>Q.Shortly state if you remember hearing him make any declarations respecting his will? - A. He has frequently declared to me he never intended to make his will; that the law had made his will.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before his death? - A. As nearly as I can recollect, about two years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect in what way he expressed himself; did he speak of his intention to make one? - A. That he had had so much trouble with his mother's, that he never would make one.</p>
               <p>Right Hon. Lord KENYON sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adoir. Q. Does your Lordship recollect examining the witnesses to the will in question, when it was produced at Hereford assizes? - A. Yes, perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Will your Lordship have the goodness to state to the Court the account given by one of those witnesses, Austin, with respect to the execution of that will?</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. If I could, in point of form, appeal to the noble and very learned Judge to pronounce upon the competency of the evidence, I should not trouble the Court; because, if my own life was at stake, instead of the gentleman's at the bar, I should be very glad to have that matter decided by the noble Judge who is called upon to give evidence, and I shall only say it does appear to me to be so extraordinary a proposition, that I shall not offer another sentence upon the subject.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. I should wish my brother Adair to state how it can affect the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adair. I conceive that upon the question whether this is or is not a genuine will, the account given of that will by the witnesses who attested the execution of it, is evidence against the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. Where are those witnesses?</p>
               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adair. Austin is in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. You cannot examine his Lordship certainly to that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adair. As far as they do go upon the question of its being a genuine will or not, though it has not the least relevancy, and if I had been informed that he had said one single word respecting Mr. Crossley in that examination, I am sure I would not have called the noble and learned Lord.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. Do the witnesses swear that it is a forged will?</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Adair. No, my Lord, it is perhaps a little awkward upon the question of admissibility.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. If Austin was here, and they were both upon trial, I certainly could not resist the evidence; but as it is not so, I certainly must.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Russell. Q. I believe you were the defendant in the ejectment tried at Hereford? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that ejectment was brought, were you in possession of the estate for which it was brought? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.From whom did you inherit it? - A. I was in possession of it as maternal heir to Mr. Lewis.</p>
               <p>Sir JOHN SCOTT sworn.(A paper handed to him).</p>
               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adair. Q. Do you know a person of the name of Eberno? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever give any advice to Mr. Crossley whatever, touching the subject matter of that letter? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any knowledge of the facts referred to in it? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no idea perhaps of going into the West at that time? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow.</p>
               <p>Q. You inherited that estate as maternal heir at law? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At what distance did you reside from Mr. Lewis during the latter part of his life? - A. About five miles.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I take it for granted, as you were to inherit a considerable part of his property, that you frequently visited, and were upon very intimate terms? - A. Not for the last two years of his life.</p>
               <p>Q.I don't mean to ask any improper question; but was the property, supposing this will to be out of the question, devolving to you, considerable? - A. To the best of my recollection it is worth nearly 200l. a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, though there was no particular intimacy between you for the last two years, did you meet occasionally upon friendly terms? - A. I cannot say we did.</p>
               <p>Q. Very much the contrary, I believe? - A. Yes; he had taken offence at some part of my conduct, and refused to speak to me when I accosted him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170115"/>Q. So that if accidentally you met in the street, and had civilly accosted him, he would not notice you? - A. After he had refused me once or twice, I never attempted it.</p>

               <p>Q. How lately might you have seen him before his death? - A. I cannot speak with any accurate precision; it might be within three or four months to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Did his resentment continue down to the time of his death, as far you know? - A. We were not upon speaking terms, as I told you, for the last two years of his life time.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Mrs. Kane? - A. Very well.</p>
               <p>Q. The mother of Lady Briggs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Lewis pass a great deal of his time at her house; we have heard that he died there? - A. I cannot say as to that.</p>
               <p>Court. The last witness said that he did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell. Q. Do you know what proportion the part that you took, as maternal heir, bore to the whole property? - A. In the proportion of 170 to 830.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You have not been intimate with him for the last two years of his life; upon what terms were you with him the two years before? - A. Upon very good terms.</p>

             came in the day before the funeral of Mr. Lewis? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you? - A. My son and Mr. Holland; we went into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Sir John there when you first came into the room? - A. Sir John was not come when I went into the kitchen; Mr. Morgan said, don't go away yet, I expect the Baronet presently, he is gone in search of Mr. Lewis's will, I hope he will bring good news with him; soon after he came in, and Mr. Morgan asked what news, he looked very down, and said, he could not find a will; we went into the parlour and stopped till two or three in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Sir John say any thing more about the will? - A. Mr. Morgan asked him if he had met with any intelligence of the will; he said, no, he blamed Madam Kane, and said, through her conduct he had lost 2000l. or upwards; I said, sure, was it so much; he said, at least that; he said Mr. Phillips came up from, Monmouth to give us the possession of the effects; I refused it, he said, had he been there, he would have had a will, or would have choaked him. Mr. Holland said it was not too late to have a will; Mr. Holland said, if you had a will, how would you do as to signing it; Mr. Holland said he would trust no man to sign it, he would do it all himself; Mr. Holland tapped me on the shoulder, and said, I will run the risk of my neck for Sir John; and Sir John, and Mr. Morgan, and Mr. Holland, went all three out of the parlour together, and left my son and I in the parlour; they stopped out some little time, it might be from five to ten minutes for what I recollect; Mr. Holland then returned in by himself; he desired me to be absent; in a few minutes in came Sir John and Mr. Morgan.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go out? - A. I did not at that time; when they came in, as is always a custom, in Mr. Morgan's house, he said, Weaver, clear the board, and then be going home; I said to my son, it is time for us to be going; I looked for my hat, and felt for some silver, I had none, Sir John gave me a thilling, I went out and gave the shilling to the girl and went home.</p>
               <p>Q. After this, did you see Sir John before the will was produced? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember at any time seeing a man of the name of Vincent? - A. I saw him several times, particularly one morning after the affizes at Heretord.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you ever seen him at Mr. Holland's house? - A. I had never been at Mr. Holland's house when Vincent was there, till that day, after the affizes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the family? - A. Yes; I took him to be a part of the family.</p>
               <p>Q. He was at the trial? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him in the neighbourhood? - A. Yes, several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing he did there? - A. He bought and sold horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he buy and sell any thing else? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Holland's hand-writing? Yes; I have seen him write.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you present when Mr. Holland's house was searched? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you see any papers that were found there? - A. I did.</p>

               <p>Q.Should you know them again? - A. Yes; I read every letter of them; Mr. Lewis searched the drawers, and every letter he found, he handed over<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170118"/>to me, and I read it, and carried off every thing I thought of consequence, (a paper shewn him).</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember that? - A. I recollect it very well; I wrote my name upon it with a pencil; Mr. Lewis took the papers away with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. You have had occassion to repeat this story several times in public and in private? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And always in the same way? - A. As near as I recollect; I might not recollect every transaction of the night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the fire lit in the parlour before you went in, or after? - A. I believe, before we went in.</p>
               <p>Q. It was very cold at that time? - A. Very cold.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a remarkable expression you have used-Mr. Holland tapped you on the shoulder and said, I will run the risk of my neck for Sir John? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite as certain of that as any other part of the conversation? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a remarkable part of the conversation? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were examined at the affizes of Hereford? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not say a syllable of this at that time? - A. I believe, I did not recollect it at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. You certainly did not state it at that time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Holland there at that time? - A. I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't happen to know whether he was there or not? - A. I believe, he was ill at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not state it at Hereford? - A. I might forget a great many expressions.</p>
               <p>Q. Sir John was very much cast down? - A. He seemed to be low, when he came in, his spirits recoverted, and he damned, and swore pretty well.</p>
               <p>Q. He complained he had had a fruitless journey? - A. I think he said he had been at the Star in search of the will, between the passage and Hereford.</p>
               <p>Q.Whether you or your son recollect the cir-cumstance of Mr. Holland saying he would run the risk of his life for Sir John? - A. I told my son to recollect as near as he could every passage that happened that night.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that; since you came to town, of before? - A. Before.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the Hereford affizes, or after? - A. Before the affizes.</p>
               <p>Q.Your son Tom told you what he had recollected? - A. He shewed it me, he had put it down upon paper; after Mr. Phillips had been at our house, he wrote down his recollections upon paper, and I did the same as near as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the affizes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you taken the trouble to write down since, any thing that you have recollected? - A. Yes; before I came to London.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you brought it with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it this circumstance of Mr. Holland's tapping you on the shoulder, and telling you he would run the risk of his neck for Sir John, first struck you? - A. I made a memorandum of it before the affizes; but I had forgot it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in your son's memorandum? - A. I cannot say, I believe he did not recollect it, when of course we compared papers together.</p>
               <p>Q. Sir John had no shyness about this at all; he spoke of it as you and I should about buying beasts at the market? - A. It was publicly enough.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Holland asked, how would you manage respecting the signing of it; and then Mr. Holland said, I would trust nobody to sign it but myself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure Sir John made no answer to it? - A. I am positive he did not; there was nobody present in the parlour when he tapped me upon the shoulder, but my son and myself; Mr. Morgan was gone out.</p>
               <p>Q. Sir John was not in the room? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. But I am speaking as to the time that he tapped you upon the shoulder? - A. He was in the room then.</p>
               <p>Q. And nobody answered the question? - A. No; he put the question and answered it himself; he said, I would not trust any body; I would do the will myself.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time Mr. Holland and Sir John and your son were all present? - A. Just so, and Mr. Morgan.</p>
               <p>Q. You were attentive to the question he put to Sir John? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore, if Sir John had made an answer, you are sure you must have heard it? - A. I am positively sure he made no answer.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Isgar give that account of himself freely or voluntarily, or were threats made use of? - A. As free as man could possibly do; he gave his evidence very free.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time receive any books; if you did, tell us from whom you received them, and to whom you delivered them again? - A. This book I received from Mr. Stokes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. (To Isgar). Q. You heard just now, what was mentioned by Mr. Stokes here, which you can confirm; I take it for granted that you are the person who proved the will, as one of the witnesses to it, at the affizes at Hereford? - A. Yes; I did.</p>
               <p>Q. We have also had the Magistrate here, Mr. Barrow, who delivered this into Court as your voluntary declaration upon oath? - A. It is so.</p>
               <p>Q. He tells us further, that it was read over to you, and that that erasure was made at your request, not containing that matter you could swear to; and that all the rest was deliberately sworn to, by you, after you had heard and read the contents; is that true, sir? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q.Take it into your hand; that information which you have in your hand, you know, of course, as you have reason to know, and to recollect, the contents of that information you have sworn to?</p>
               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adair. This is a cross-examination before he is sworn in chief.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. My Lord, I certainly could, if I chose, read the whole of it: you have, in that information, contradicted directly, the oath you made at the affizes? - A. Yes; I believe I have.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. Now, then, you will withdraw.(The witness goes out of Court.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. My Lord, the objection I am about to make is, to the competency of this witness; and, my Lord, I make that objection after very long deliberation, and after much discussion of the subject. Your Lordship may depend upon it, that in what I now say, I am strictly addressing myself to the Court; I could indeed give your Lordship my honour, if it were necessary, that I rise simply to address the Court upon that point of law, and not by a side wind to depreciate the witness in the understanding of the Jury.</p>
               <p>My Lord, the objection that I take to Isgar is this, that the whole foundation of the credit which is due to any witness in Court, as Mr. Sergeant Adair has well expressed it, is, that he speaks under the solemnity of an oath; your Lordship can hear nothing from any man under any other fanction. My Lord, I admit, if any credit whatever can be given to his oath in a Court of Justice, he must be examined, however blassed his character may be, however he may be a witness totally unworthy to stand in a Court of Justice, however in the opinions of all who receive his evidence, and are to deside upon it, he may he perjured; upon subjects collateral to the subject in question, I would not waste your Lordship's time upon the objection; because, however infamous a man may be, however it may be his ordinary habit to impose no rules of veracity upon himself, he is still a witness; and upon this plain ground, that a man, however wicked, is not always wicked; he has not always temptations to wickedness; and although a man may have forsworn himself a thousand and a thousand times, unless the mark is set upon him, by a judgment of perjury, he shall be received as a witness, because his oath may have some value in the particular instance in which he is to be sworn; because his oath has never been opposed by his oath in the particular instance; and it is impossible for the Judge to say, that the man is not entitled, perhaps in the opinion of the Jury, to some scintilla of credit upon which other testimony may be built. But, my Lord, the objection which I take to the witness is this, that he is called up here, or he is called up for no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170120"/>thing; to say that that will to which he has given authenticity upon his oath before the learned and noble ludge, who sat here some time ago, at Hereford, which he swore he saw executed in the presence of the deceased

            ; that he did not see him execute it; that it was not signed in his presence, or in the presence of the witnesses. Now, my Lord, the first matter I have to ask your Lordship is this, and by the answer I receive to that proposition, let my objection stand or fall, are these two propositions collateral to one another, or are they not? - If they are not absolutely inconsident, and abselutely and directly repugnant to one another, my objection falls undoubtedly as it ought. Suppose I had asked him-did you not, at the affizes at Hereford, swear you saw a man on Thursday: and after that, swore you did not see the same man on Thursday? in matter, collateral to the subject, it might have been said, and truly, to destroy all credit due to this man; because, how can the Jury take the oath of a man who has acknowledged in public Court, that he has forsworn himself? yet, peradventure, the man who has forsworn himself upon these different occasions, may not have the same temptation to commit a perjury in the instance before the Court; and therefore it is for the Jury to weigh, in point of credit, and not for your Lordships, in point of competency, to repel the oath of a witness standing under such derestable and abhorrent circumstances; but, my Lord, that is not this case. This case is-that the man having sworn two ways, first that it is the will, and then that it is not, offers, by his oath, to give one of those propositions a preponderance over the other, so as to build something in addition to that oath, by telling your Lordship that this will is not the will of

               <p>Now, my Lord, the question is, whether any credit can be given to that? any credit-my Lord, I should ask what credit? if a man has sworn to two propositions diamettically repugnant and contradictory of one another, which involves him, upon his own confession, not only in a perjury, but a perjury in the direct instance before the Court; how is it possible? I speak to reasonable men, and I speak in point of competency, not in point of credit, that if the competency of a witness is to depend upon any authenticity that he can give to a transaction upon his oath, if his oath is divided between these two propofitions, and has equally belonged to both of them, how is it possible to give him any credit. Now, my Lord, in order to try this case; and I observe your Lordship turning to some authority, which is natural enough. My Lord, no man feels more reverence than I do for the collective wisdom of ages, which constitutes the law of this country; no man bows more implicitly than I do to the authority of precedents, which, undoubredly, build up, and cement the fabric of our laws and constitution; and wherever I find a precedent, although the inclination of my judgment is strongly drawn against the foundation upon which that precedent is built; I bow to the precedent, unless I find it in the situation of those precedents, if any such there are, that are diametrically repugnant to the principles of jurisprudence everywhere, and aspecially to the principles of justice as immecmorially acted upon in this country, My Lord, it is a maxim which cannot he broken in upon, that it is only the sanction of the oath that consers the competency upon the individual; if a man knows nothing of the Supreme Being, the internal appeal to whom constitutes the fanction of an oath, he cannot be sworn at all; he may, if he is of another religion, because, in whatever view the mind of man has the impression of the Divinity stamped upon it; it is supposed that person speaks under the insluence of the education he may have received; but what is the case here? the man has sworn that it is the will, and he has sworn that it is not. Now, my Lord, I mean to give Isgar something that does not belong to him, in order to try this case; I will suppose he is no accomplice, and was now to be examined, and was to swear, that upon some given day, the 26th or 27th of April (no matter what day) this forgery was committed by Mr. Crossley, and the case so closes, could your Lordship leave it to the Jury? would there be any thing to leave to the Jury, with no other circumstances added to it? and we shall come to see whether when a thing is nothing, any thing added to it can make it something; good God! is it possible for any man, whose reason is not disordered, to say, that when a man has sworn the will was a true will, and the same man has sworn the same will was not a true will, that your Lordship upon his single unsupported evidence could desire the Jury to guess at which of his oaths is the true one, and to put the man's life in jeopardy, by even stating it to be evidence to go to the Jury. Now I am either wrong in this, or I am right, and I desire to have the opinion of your Lordships upon this, whether the man, blasted as he is, if that could be removed from him, so that your Lordship might, when the man is examined, put the cause upon his evidence, aye or no; could the Judges of England state that a man who had sworn two propositions staring one another in the face, upon which you have nothing to do but to arraign him according to the law of England, upon his own oath, without any extrinsic evidence, laying hold of him-as such a miscreant ought to be laid hold of, what could he avow, but that one of the two propositions was uttered by mistake; but here, the man admits that he signed the oath with deliberation, and was subject to no mistake; that he took the second oath also with deliberation; and that the one is true and the other salse, would your Lordship's leave it as a matter of evidence, which of the two are true, upon the evidence of a man who alone is to tell you, which is true, the very same man who has shewn himself to be entitled to no credit whatever, when he has sworn to these two repuguant propositions?</p>

               <p>Now, my Lord, let us see whether what I have now stated is broken in upon by any of the rules and principles of law. My lord, I hold in my hand the observation made by my learned friend; Mr. Sergeant Adair, upon the law concerning accomplices; and I agree with him, it has been lucidly and properly stated; and I know that the favour and tenderness shewn to human life in this country, so remarkable for its justice, has frequently led to a delicacy upon the subject of accomplices, that I never felt, whether an accomplice shall be examined first or after he is corroborated; I think he ought to be examined first, for the best of all possible reasons, because<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170121"/>he is a competent witness, though the humanity of the law is such (but I am not addressing you upon urbanity) that it is only from tenderness, that after an accomplice is admitted, the Court will not build any thing upon his testimony, unless he is confirmed, because of the great danger there would be of admitting such a man as a witness; but I do say, that though he is a worthless witness, and though undoubtedly he deserves what Mr. Sergeant Adair stated of him, and which I shall not repeat, yet still his evidence must go to the Jury, because he has not, by swearing both ways, destroyed, by his own conduct, the foundation of all credit due to his testimony, which foundation is alone the fanction of an oath.</p>
               <p>Now, my Lord, I come to the last point, and I do confess, I think, and, my Lord, I have thought of it a great deal, that it is impossible for a greater fallacy to be imposed upon the human understanding than this. This man is a worthless incredible witness, and taken by himself, my learned friend says, he is of no value at all; he does not put it of small comparative value with other witnesses, but he states boldly that he is of no value at all; but he says, though it may be true that his oath cannot receive any fanction from a Court, yet that there may be circumstances arising from Mr. Crossley's own act accumulating upon one another, which may fasten the crime upon Mr. Crossley, I agree to it; and though, undoubtedly, I should do my duty to the utmost to the prisoner, yet, most undoubredly, if I saw such transactions belonging to him, I should say, he must suffer the law upon that evidence; but the question is, whether by taking Isgar's evidence as the foundation, and taking it as nothing, you can erect it into something, by surrounding it with other matters, which, as far as they throw light upon one another, do, I admit, constitute a body of evidence which may, peradventure, in this case, be sufficient for conviction; but I would humbly ask your Lordship, (I speak earnestly, my Lord, because I speak feelingly,) how can that confirm the evidence of that man, which was before stated as nothing; and how can that nothing be converted into something, by the addition of other materials by which that nothing is to be supported?</p>
               <p>My Lord, I know there is no other way to support moral truths, but by turning back to that which is the foundation of all certainty, I mean the calculations of matter; the calculations of matter, and the truths belonging to them, must be the foundation of all your reasonings in the world; then I would add this: I want to make up a sum, and for forms sake I begin with nothing but a nought; I put down that nought, and then I am to make up a sum by the progression of numbers, by a great number of units, which will amount to a particular sum in the calculation, be it so; those different units may be sufficient to answer the purpose of the calculator, and may answer the purpose of material demonstration for which they are produced; but will the adding them together, or multiplying them together, erect a nothing into something; and will you make that progression of numbers different, when added to that which was before nothing, and make them tell differently in any quotient, because there is that before it, which it is admitted, by itself, is nothing; but which having lost its nothingness. acquired a local habitation, and a name? My Lord, I can only say, my mind revolts at such a propossion, and I shall think I am getting into a second childhood, when I find my mind stagger from the contrary proposition.</p>
               <p>Then, to bring your Lordship back again, added to this, you have the man as an accomplice, I have been trying him as not being an accomplice; and the reason why I have tried him as not being an accomplice is, because it entitles me to give your Lordship a view of the subject, that I could not have given you if he were an accomplice; because, if he were not an accomplice, your Lordship would be driven, perhaps, in the coarse of the cause, to come to this very principle, that after the man had finished his evidence, and the case was finished, your Lordship would be driven to say to the Jury, that it was matter for them to deliberate which of the two contrary propositions is the true one; and which none but he can divulge, by only the same oath which had been given equally first to the one and then to the other; why, then the only answer is this, if a man swears to two propositions, the oue extremely improbable, the other very much probable: that the one has nothing to give credibility to it, that the other is confirmed by every thing that confers credibility, would you not then admit it? - yes, certainly; but not that the witness shall add any thing to it, upon his oath; I can examine the proposition as it is an intrinsic proposition; I can examine all the probabilities by which that intrinsic proposition is supported upon the one hand, and by which the improbability is made stronger upon the other; and when I have done that, I have sufficient, by the rules of criminal law, to direct a Jury, upon all those circumstances together, to find a man guilty of forgery; I should do it with a calm spirit, and with a consciousness that I was performing my duty to the country; but what I dread and tremble at is, - that upon your Lordship's judgment, which I should be sorry to hear pronounced, that man, as he has described himself, is to be set up here, and is to lay a foundation, and that the Jury are to suppose, under your Lordship's judgment, as they must undoubtedly, if your Lordship sets him up as a witness; it is telling the Jury some credit is due to him; it is leaving it to them undoubtedly; but it is allowing him some credit; when, I contend, not a scintilla of credit is due to him; and which it is admitted at the very moment it is received, to be in fact good for nothing. I confess, it does make a strong impression upon my mind; it appears to me, to be making use of evidence of no value at all for that is my proposition); and after you have got it, then you build other things upon it, by taking a foundation which is, in fact, no foundation at all; and if the man is ultimately convicted, it will not be upon the circumstances themselves to which credit is due, coupled together, but upon these circumstances built upon that which in the opening is admitted literally to be nothing.</p>
               <p>I beg your Lordship's pardon, for having detained the Court so long; I feel this objection strongly, and I therefore have expressed it strongly.</p>
               <p>The objection to laizar's competency was supported also by Mr. Garrow and Mr. Fielding; when Mr. Sergeant Adair rose to answer them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. Brother Adair, you need not trou<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170122"/>ble yourself; I have paid great attention to Mr. Erskine and Mr. Garrow, as I always do; they are very able men, but they have not brought conviction to my mind; and it is a singular stage in which they have taken the objection, after having sworn the man upon the voire dire, because he has perjured himself in the very fact in question before the Court; that the man has sworn contrary ways before, there can be, I presume, no doubt; I know nothing but from the opening on the one side, and the statement on the other; I will suppose this man has sworn to facts directly contrary one to the other, but he is brought here now, not with any conviction upon his head, he is brought here as a person who labours under very great suspicions; but he has not been convicted of the crime of perjury. Now, it is admitted in the course of this argument, that, if this man had been convicted of the crime of perjury, and pardoned, or if he had been pardoned without any conviction, his evidence might have been received; if that be so, I cannot point out to myself any ground upon which that man, who, if he was pardoned, might be received as a witness, should not be an admissible evidence, when not having been convicted, no pardon can be necessary. I do not now chuse to say a word about the credit that I think may be due to him; - not a word about what the Jury ought to think of the witness; here after we shall hear what he says, and how he is corroborated; but, in my opinion, in strict point of law, this witness is admissible.</p>

He called upon me when he received that will; he said, this will<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170123"/>not do; Mr. Lewis was a very particular man, and therefore we must get a better one; do you know one George Crossley.</p>

               <p>Q.After you had sent this will, you saw Sir John Briggs, and he said, the will you sent would not do; had you sent any other will than that at that time? - A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you why it would not do? - A. He said, Mr. Lewis was a very particular man, and therefore, that will would not do; we must get a better; he would have a little alteration.</p>

               <p>Q. What passed at that meeting while Mr. Crossley was present at the Three Tuns? - A. He desired that me and Austin might accompany him and Mr. Holland; at least to meet them at the Globe, at Newton, the morning following, which was on a Saturday, I think, the 11th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Newton? - A. Between Bristol and Bath; Austin went before with Mr. Crossley; and Mr. Holland and I rode after.</p>

               <p>Q. What had you said to Mr. Austin about it? - A. I told Mr. Austin this, that I knew a person that wanted a witness to a will, and that he might get 100l. if he wanted to get 100l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he refuse, or did he agree to it? - A. Mr. Austin said, I would put my name to an hundred wills for that money, or something of that sort.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Mr. Holland and Mr. Austin together at Bath? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between Mr. Holland and Mr. Austin relative to the will? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What passed between them? - A. Mr. Austin and Mr. Holland were at a public-house with me, the French Horn, or Seven Stars; Mr. Austin would not agree to do any thing in the will without a note for 100l. to make sure of his money; he said, he could not give him a note of 100l. unless they should recover the property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Holland at last agree, or refuse to give the note of 100l.? - A. He gave the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know it, do you think, if you saw it again? - A. Most certainly I should; (it is shewn him); this is it; here is an alteration; he would not have "or order," and it was interlined"James Smith."</p>
               <p>Q. Was it ready written? - A. No; I believe the stamp was out of my own pocket.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any particular recollection as to the date of the note? - A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went with you to Newton? - A. Mr. Austin and I went, and Mr. Crossley and Mr. Holland; we rode there.</p>
               <p>Q.What day was it? - A. I think the 11th of April, but I cannot be sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect of whom you hired your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170124"/>houses? - A. I believe it was Aborfield or Merrifield, a man that keeps horses, in Corn-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find Mr. Holland and Mr. Crossley there, or how? - A. When we went to get the horses, we saw Mr. Holland and Mr. Crossley riding by before us, about 100 yards distance.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to Newton, did you see any body there? - A. Nobody else, and Mr. Austin did not come in at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed there in the presence of Mr. Crossley? - A. Mr. Crossley drew up a long copy of a note to send to Mr. Lewis, to inform him that I had a will of such a person's, one Lewis, a corn-factor, of Monmouth, I believe.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at any time ask him, or he you, any questions about the will? - A. I asked him about the will, I asked him why he made two parts; he said, that he made two parts for this reason, in case I should be detected, and Mr. Austin at the trial, that he and his clerks might come and prove that the old gentleman left it with him.</p>
               <p>Q.What became of the two parts of the will? - A. One was put up in a cover directed for Mrs. Kane, after I had left the will on the table, and the other Mr. Crossley kept.</p>

               <p>Q. Who transacted the business of the bail? - A. Mr. Crossley got me the bail, and procured me the attorney, his name was Price, I believe.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did you stay after the bail was put in? - A. I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Mr. Crossley, after you had asked him the question about that will, did he say any thing more about the will, that you can recollect? - A. Not in particular; he said he took care that the paper should be old enough, that it might not be discovered.</p>
               <p>Q.What became of the letter you wrote to Mr. Lewis, at Monmonth; when did you send it? - A. I suppose, about the 12th or 13th of April, I am not quite sure to the day, it bears date before that, I believe.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect who that banker was? - A. Ramsden, or some such thing, it was No. 57. I think, in some street, I forgot what; Hammersley, or some such thing, if I was to hear it I can tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in St. James's-street, or the Hay-market, or Pall-mall? - A. In Pall-mall, I think; I am not sure.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon after your return from London did you go over to Monmouth? - A. Two days.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what day you returned from Monmouth? - A. I don't.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week? - A. I cannot say; I was to be with the will at such a time, at Monmouth of the Monday following, I think at eleven o'clock; but I could not go, and therefore it was some time first.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it stopped you from going to Monmouth at that time? - A. I did not get from London in time.</p>
               <p>Q. But how long after you reached Bath was it? I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you go with? - A. One John Edwards.</p>

               <p>Q. Is it or not, the paper you carried to Monmouth? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at that; is it the same paper you had from Mr. Crossley? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adair. This, my Lord, is the cover at I have now shewn the witness.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at that, (the will), is that the same that was afterwards produced upon the trial at Hereford? - A. It is.</p>

               <p>Q. Then your answer was, that you were come to speak the truth; was it so? - A. I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q.You know very well, after you had made that oath, you were commited for the forgery; that you were taken up, and sent to prison? - A. I know I was sent to prison, and am now.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, how long after you had been in prison did you begin to tell the story you have been telling to-day? - A. Some time after.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had, some time after, confessed that you committed this forgery? - A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call signing your name to a forged will; do you mean to swear you did not know you were guilty of a capital offence for having unered a will knowing it to be forged? - A. I did not know it then.</p>
               <p>Q.Perhaps you don't think that wrong? - A. I don't think that was right.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't think it a very wrong thing not for once or so. What do you think of the one that you did over now with the name of Lewis to it; do you think that a forgery? - A. I don't know; it might be a forgery.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that when the blank paper was said to be old enough, as it was said by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170127"/>Holland, and you were desired to copy it over the name of Lewis, you did not know it was a forgery? - A. I positively swear I did not know it was a forgery then; I did not think it right not withstanding.</p>
               <p>Q. You practised as an attorney? - A. I was an auctioneer.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you ever practise as an attorney? - A. I have been an attorney's clerk; I don't deny that.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not practise as an attorney, state yourself to be an attorney, and do business as an attorney? - A. I never stated myself as an attorney yet.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not practise as an attorney? - A. Not by myself.</p>
               <p>Q. I will give you the names of a few causes, and see whether you practised in any of them: in Parry against Pyander; did you practise in that? - A. I had nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - A. I was not concerned in the business any more than the gentlemen here.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know any thing of it? - A. I served the process for the attorney, one Akerman.</p>
               <p>Q. You were his clerk, were you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to serve the processes? - A. It was sent to Bath.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was not Akerman acting as your agent, in that very cause? - A. He positively was not.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got into prison, you underwent an examination before Mr. Barrow, the Justice? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had then a perfect recollection of all the circumstances that belong to this transaction? - A. I recollected some of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your recollection get better after a long course of time? - A. I was at a nonplus.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not been two months in goal before you were examined? - A. It might be.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know so? - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told those gentlemen, all this abominable business you have been describing, was planned before you came to London, when Mr. Crossley was at Bath; that you took horses, and that Mr. Holland and Mr. Crossley rode together, and you and Austin together; that one went to Newton, and then to Linton; that strikes me as the most important part of the business, does not it you? - A. I cannot say; what I have said now, is, before God and man, positively true.</p>
               <p>Q. How did it happen, that though the Magistrate has said it was read over to you deliberately, that you made erasures where you could not swear to it, that there is not one syllable of having seen Mr. Crossley at Bath? - A. Because there is a part of it told, and part not; there was not time to take it all down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Mr. Barrow that circumstance? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not? - A. I don't mean to swear about it; I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that when you were admitted an evidence for the Crown, that at that time you did not recollect? - A. I did not know I was to be admitted an evidence for the Crown at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you prosess to tell the truth to Mr. Barrow? - A. I did; but Mr. Barrow did not ask me, and I did not tell him; and there may be some more yet, perhaps, that was not put down.</p>
               <p>Q. If I recollect you right, Mr. Holland, when at Bath, told you that would not do, for that Mr. Lewis was a very particular man? - A. I did not say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Who said so? - A. I did not say so.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say? - A. Sir John Briggs told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before, or after Mr. Crossley went to London? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So that this was managed before Mr. Crossley went to London? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have said nothing about it in your examination? - A. It was all managed before, I tell you.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever asked, at the assizes, whether you had seen Mr. Crossley before; what did you answer to that? - A. I said I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say, you only saw him once by accident, coming out of the King's-Bench? - A. I did not say that I had not seen him any more than that.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that you did not? - A. To the best of my recollection, I did not swear that; I don't recollect any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear you did not? - A. I cannot; I am come here to tell the truth, I hope, and I will do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you saw him coming out of the King's-Bench, and that was the only time you ever saw him in your life? - A. I don't know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that examination; did you give an account to the magistrate of all you knew, and did he write it down? - A. I did not say I did.</p>

               <p>Q.Did not you prosess to give an account of all you knew? - A. No, they did not ask me; I did not give every particular instruction, every word, that I knew of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the Magistrate that Mr. Crossley desired you to write that letter you sent to Mrs. Kane? - A. Mr. Crossley wrote that letter, and I copied it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170128"/>Q. Did you tell the Magistrate so? - A. I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe you told him so? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q.Suppose it should turn out that you did not tell him so, why did you not? - A. I cannot answer the question.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, if you can account for not having told the Magistrate; supposing that when that comes to be read, you should not have told the Magistrate one syllable of having seen Mr. Crossley at Bath; how can you account for it? - A. I only described the heads of it, and this was left out, perhaps.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know Mr. Gray, the jailer? - A. Yes; I know him very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any conversations with him upon the subject of this? - A. Yes; previous to my giving this relation to Mr. Barrow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any previous information of what you have laid before the Court to-day? - A. Not in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear you had no communication with him after that time? - A. I have talked to him several times, but not in particular.</p>
               <p>Q.After Mr. Crossley was committed to prison, had you not conversed with the jailor, Mr. Gray? - A. I don't know but I might, several times, as he comes to lock me up in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't recollect whether you had or not? - A. Not private conversation.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I understand you to say, that, subsequent to the time of Mr. Crossley being committed, you never did speak to Mr. Gray upon the subject of Mr. Crossley being brought there? - A. Previous to the time of Mr. Crossley being brought there, I had said, to be sure, that the will was a good will, till I told Mr. Barrow the rights of it; and after that, if I did say any thing to the jailer, I certainly did say, that Mr. Crossley was concerned in it with Austin and me.</p>
               <p>Q. So that after Mr. Crossley was committed, and after you had laid an information against Mr. Crossley, you said the same thing to the jailor that you had said in your information; that is to say, that Mr. Crossley was concerned with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never said the contrary since Mr. Crossley was committed? - A. I might have said, that Mr. Crossley was not the first person that pointed out the will to be made, because it was Mr. Holland.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say to Mr. Gray, after Mr. Crossley was committed, that Mr. Crossley did not know certainly any thing of the will, but that you were obliged to swear to it? - A. No; never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. That you positively swear? - A. Yes; positively.</p>
               <p>Q. I have now given you time to recollect yourself, and my Lord has got your answer down; now let us see how long you will stand by a thing, and in how short a time you will swear and unswear Mr. Gray asked you, whether Mr. Crossley had any knowledge of the will; and that you said Mr. Crossley did not know any thing of the will, but you were obliged to swear it; and upon being asked, how you could accuse Mr. Crossley, you said, that you, to your knowledge, could not possibly accuse Mr. Crossley of it? - A. I deny saying any such words to the jailor, or to that effect.</p>
               <p>Q.Vastly well, sir; now I want just to see whether I have got the rest of your evidence correct; I shall trouble you with very few questions now; you went, at the desire of Sir John Briggs, to London, and Austin with you; you went to the Golden Cross; Austin went to the White Horse Cellar; you went to Mr. Crossley on the Sunday morning, and told him, that Sir

             wanted to speak to him, &amp;c. (repeats his evidence)? - A. There are words there that are wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. In the morning you went first of all and saw Mr. Crossley? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You delivered your message from Sir John Briggs to Mr. Crossley? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he gave you three guineas, or three guineas and a-half; now what time was that? - A. Monday morning, near twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. And you asked him why he made two parts of the will; and he said, he made two parts of the will in case you should be detected, and Mr. Austin, at the trial; that he and his clerks might come and prove that an old gentleman left it with him; now that is a very remarkable expression, that must have struck pretty deep; it was not a thing one would hear and forget very much; did you tell that to the Magistrate? - A. I believe I did; I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Q. You think you did? - A. I think I did; I think you will find it in the paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember receiving this letter from Akerman, in which, he says, he is sorry to be informed, the public term me the notorious Jacob Isgar's agent; now, upon your oath, do you mean to say, you did not employ Akerman in any of the causes in that paper? - A. Only in my own; three or four of my own.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was employed in those causes? - A. No attorney but Akerman.</p>
               <p>Q. How comes Akerman to speak so in that letter? - A. Because one Wilmot sent it to him.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you there when any conversation passed between Mr. Crossley, him, and you? - A. No further than (the 13th of April was a Monday) Mr. Crossley called at my house, between twelve and one o'clock; he left word for me to go to the Three Tuns; I went there, and there was a bowl of punch upon the table; I asked Mr. Crossley how he came down there; he said, he was going upon business to Gloucester, and round there; he asked me for some money that I borrowed, in London, of him; he asked me to pay him that, which I did, we sat down and drank a glass or two of punch together, and presently in came Isgar; and Mr. Crossley said, will you be bound for Isgar, for what he owes me; I said, no; I was bound too much already.</p>

               <p>Q. I will put you in possession of a remarkable expression that accompanied it; that if it was necessary, you would be the hangman? - A. I might say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not you say so? - A. I don't know but I might.</p>

I might the latter part of it.</p>

             should be at the King's head, on Monday, at eleven; I have since then settled the matter of Eberno, which Mrs. Allen last wrote about, and the bail was put in, so that nothing can, but his own want of prudence, prevent his attending to the appointment; he see off by the coach at four this morning, and has faithfully promised to keep his appointment. I hope Sir John will not fail to meet him, that he may at once dispatch his business; for he is much too apt to get drunk, and the sooner he returns the better; for I cannot answer for his prudence, if in liquor; and when any thing pleases or displeases Mr. Eberno, he is generally drunk on the subject. I am well satisfied you may trust him, as he will faithfully bring the money to account; so that you need not fear him on that head; but a man that gets drunk, is not a fit person for business, and therefore I would have you to act more cautiously, in future; the 50l. you gave him last is accepted; and I told him where to have the cash, and he had it, the full 50l.; and Sir

             desired me to advance him five guineas, as it is best to keep no accounts but what are clear. Mrs. Allen has a desire you will write her fully on the business, and how it is managed, and what is done (that she may know her money is properly laid out). You must be prudent and diligent in the business, and there is no doubt of success, the security is so good, and so very perfect the title, that no one can miss of approving the matter; so that there need no begging the question; and if the money is not advanced, on the security, when Mr. Eberno brings it, it may be got elsewhere - so I would have Sir

             told when you see him. Pray any compliments to our friends; and, I think, if Sir John comes into your part this summer, you may shew him this; he will the better understand how to act; and as I have, when I saw him, told him the whole truth of the case, I am satisfied he has too much understanding not to see it is right; besides, as he is in the habits of approving titles, he must be better and more perfectly satisfied by an open behaviour and disclosure of the full truth, than by any thing kojt back. I hope Mr. Eberno will not be kept an hour at the King's-head, as I have given him orders to depart as soon as possible. I am, Sir,</p>

               <p>"DEAR SIR,</p>
               <p>"I have received your letter last post; it is not convenient, at this me, to come to London to meet Mr. Dixcy, as I am not well, and noble, at present, to take so long a journey. I want much to go Leicester; I must go there next week. I hope Dixcy hath got is accounts allowed before the Master (I suppose 2000l.)</p>
               <p>"I have sent Dixcy a jobber, a man of judgment and money; he ath set off to Dixcy's house well mounted, by way of Worcester; suppose he will be there some day this week; he comes to take view, and see situation, before he fixes; his name is Vincent; I hope he will find Richard at home, and that all things will be made greeable to them both. If Richard should come to London this week, he must hasten back to see the merchant; he will go to the King's-head, Monmouth, and send over for Richard.</p>
               <p>"We have a great miss here; you may tell Richard, Old Nick went over to Worksop manor last night, and took his old acquaintnce, Wake; he was an idle devil not to fetch him ten years ago; he also fetched, last week, Briggs Rotherham, the Justice of Drauseld - they will make a good hroil together.</p>
               <p>"I have both seen and sent to Gillet's brother, to do something or him, and have had a deal of trouble about it; they have put off o consider from time to time, &amp;c.; I sent again yesterday; his brother Thomas seems to be now most forward to assist him, and promises to come to me here on Wednesday next; I will do all I can o serve the poor man, you may depend upon it; and I will write o him as soon as I know what will be done; I will do my best for his interest."</p>

I have seen the party which I told you I would; I have every reason to think I can get it; but you know there is no promising, certainly now, till you have the sum in hand. I have told you, I would do every think I could to serve you, and he assured I will; I hope I can do it shortly; but remember, I have never said absolutely I could do it; you know I told you how I was situated; I'll do my best, and hope I shall be able to oblige you; but don't depend upon it till you have it hand.

I wish I may see you before your other affairs are to ripe. I wish the meeting had been nearer Bath. I shall bring hills with me such as you may want, and let me have all you can in return, and we will finally settle what is to be done.

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, I have scarcely been able to hear one half that has passed; I wish your Lordship would permit Mr. Erskine to make some observations for me, as to the letters; I have not been able to distinguish any thing.</p>
               <p>Court. I cannot suffer your counsel to speak for you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. In the situation then in which I stand, I will content myself with my counsel calling evidence; all that is possible for me to relate, is, that I know nothing of the charge; those things which relate to money transactions, have no relation to this will; I know nothing of the will, and have not the least conception; I gave no other answer to Mr. Clarke's letter, than this, I certainly received the letter on Monday, in which it was stated, that some papers were found; but so little it struck me, having no knowledge of this will, that I wrote to Mr. Clarke, charging him, that I suspected, if there was any thing in the business, it must be a draft of his own, and that letter is his answer to me; if the letter is reffered to, it will be seen that it is a letter in answer to one of mine, in which I must have charged him with something. As to the letter of Austin, it is well known, after Sir John Briggs applied to me, to defend him,(there are letters to prove he employed me); he told me he was entirely innocent; I never saw Sir John in my life till after the assizes; as to the evidence of Isgar, there is not a word of truth in it.</p>
               <p>Court. There is a letter in which you say you have consulted Sir

               <p>Prisoner. That is a letter Mr. Clarke desired me to write, respecting the sale of Mr. Holland's estate. With respect to the entry in the day-book, I have no doubt I shall be able to give a satisfactory account of that, and that the evidence of Isgar in that part cannot be true. That letter, where Sir John Scott is mentioned, must have been wrote from dictation; I have something on my memory, that something of a title to the Holland estate was enquired into.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. Without breaking throught any of the rules your Lordship has laid down, I shall merely state to your Lordship what I mean to call to first; as the rest of the evidence is all in confirmation of Isgar's evidence; therefore I shall begin with contradicting him, in every part of his testimony that relates to the cause; he denied having spoken to the jailor any thing respecting Mr. Crossley's innocence.</p>

               <p>Q.What was it you said to Isgar? - A. I menmentioned to Isgar one night, when I was locking him up, particularly on account of having the misfortune of losing some prisoners, I lock them down with a chain; I said, for what, do you accuse Mr. Crossley? I thought there was enough of you without him? Isgar said, I am hauled into a hobble, and must get out as well as I can.</p>

               <p>Q. You have been sitting in a room all this morning; so that you have not learned this story of the 26th of April till to-day? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of day? - A.

               <p>Q. Did he tell you before he went away whether he had seen the gentleman? - A. No; I asked him if he had succeeded in his wishes; he told me he did not know whether he had or not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he occasionally talk to you about his affairs, and his manner of disposing of them? - A. He did not talk no great deal to me; but the last time he talked to me about it he was going into Devonshire, and he went from thence to Sidmouth; we were talking in the parlour, he said, I am growing an elderly man, Mrs. Perkins, and I wish to settle my affairs; and I made answer to him, why then, I suppose, the Morgans will have a great deal of your property.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know when this was? - A. I think in the year 1791; because he mentioned a family of the name of Rumsey, that were at that time at Sidmouth; he told me, at the time, every thing about it, but I have forgot now; when I said I supposed the Morgans would have a great deal of his property, he said no, Mrs. Perkins, I will take care they never shall ahve one penny or it, they shall not inherit a pennyworth that I have, I will take care of that.</p>
               <p>Q. This was before he went upon his trip? - A. Yes; and when he came back, he came to our house again, as he used to do, two or three times a week; and he said, he had been at Sidmouth, and that, in either going to Sidmouth or coming back, he had been at Bath.</p>

               <p>Q.Did he say any thing more at that time? - A. Not about any thing of that sort.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure that, in that conversation, he said the Morgans should have nothing? - A. He said he would take care that they never should inhert a pennyworth that he had.</p>

I did not, I heard him say, if there was a will in the saddle-bags, or any where else, may be his heir at law might find it, and he might not be the better for it; and that his sister-in-law had acted very imprudent in the time of his illness; and, that if he had settled his affairs, he would have done it he was certain.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you in Court when they were examined? - A. I cannot say whether I was or not; because, I think, if I remember right, every evidence was kept out of Court, and by Mr. Stokes's desire.</p>
               <p>Q. You were examined before the Weavers; after you had been examined, did not you stay in Court and hear the remainder of the cause, or part of the remainder of the cause? - A. I did not; I might or might not.</p>

               <p>Q.Will you six any hour between eight and ten, or between eight and eleven? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you or not, six a time between eight and eleven? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the Weavers there before he came in or not? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot swear whether the Weavers came there before or after? - A. I think it was after.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Crump come? - A. He came to take a little farm of me, about two o'clock; and he staid from that time till about eight or nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go away before nine? - A. He very likely might, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went first? - A. Crump and Jones went away together.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you six some time at which they went away? - A. About nine, to the best of my memory.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, how long did the Weavers stay after them? - A. They went away before twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. You will swear the Weavers went away before twelve? - A. I will swear my house was shut, and the Weavers did not sleep at my house, and that I went to bed before twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Holland was not there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard nothing at that time about a will? - A. No; only that he had been at the passage, and different places, searching for the saddle-bags; and I think that Mr. Phillips, who was employed for the heir at law, had given him the key, or something.</p>
               <p>Q. Then on that day you did not hear of any intention of framing a will for Mr. Lewis; when was it you first offered a bett, that a will of Mr. Lewis's would be found? - A. I don't know that I ever offered a bett of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you did not offer a bett that a will of Mr. Lewis's would he found after this conversation? - A. I was one day at Monmouth with Mr. Lewis, and he told me he had received a letter from one Isgar at Bath.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever offered such a bett? - A. There were wagers talked of, but not by me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who talked of wagers? - A. Mr. Holland, and Mr. Lewis, a bailif, were at my house one day, and I had seen on the Saturday before, a letter, that there was a will of his in Bath, which he shewed me at the public-house, at Bath; I cannot say what house it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What did that letter express? - A. To let Mrs. Kane know that there was a will in favour of Mrs. Kane in his possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect that letter? - A. No more than I have mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear it read, or did you read it? - A. I think, I heard it read.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say from your recollection, that that was the contents, or substance of the letter, that this Isgar had a will to deliver to Mrs. Kane, and that the will was made for the benefit of Mrs. Kane? - A. To the best of my recollection, the letter did express that word, or something to that effect.</p>
               <p>Q. This was a letter that Mr. Lewis, the cornfactor, had at Monmouth? - A.. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Who would bett, when you knew he discovered it immediately to Mrs. Kane; who would bett with you? - A. It would have been no bett.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear, before this letter was produced, that you had not talked about a will, that you were sure a will would be produced? - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Weaver (the elder)? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember saying any thing to him about a bett? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never tell him you were sure a will of Mr. Lewis's would be produced on the next Monday? - A. I never did, before that letter came, or any other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Weaver a will would come upon the next Monday, and advise him to bett upon that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not he a farmer? - A. Yes; he is a freeholder.</p>
               <p>Q. He is a respectable man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not advise him to go and bett about a will of Mr. Lewis's? - A. Not till after I saw the letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not six the Monday as a day upon which this will would probably be produced at Monmouth? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, in fact, lay a bett about this will? - A. I never received one shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you if you ever laid a bett about this will? - A. Dr. Powell, the surgeon, offered to lay me two guineas to one, which I agreed to, and that bett was withdrawn; that is the only bett I ever made.</p>

               <p>Q. From his general character, do you think him a man to be trusted upon his oath; I ask you, if you were sworn to decide a question as a juryman, would you find any man guilty of any offence upon his evidence? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You think him too infamous to decide any thing upon his evidence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>THOMAS KIRBY sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Erskine. Q. Where do you live? - A. At Bath; I have lived there twenty-five years.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you known Isgar? - A. Fourteen or fifteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you known him in all his situations? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his character? - A. His character is well known to all the world; I have known him a baker; an articled clerk to several lawyers; then a sheriff's officer; I was bound one year for him to the sheriff; but the second year I declined it, on account of his conduct; and then he was an auctioneer; he had one auction, and sold the man's goods and kept the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear of a worse man in your life? - A. Lately he has been very bad indeed.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Garrow. I have lived at Bath about eighteen years; I have been acquainted with Isgar about a dozen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to tell those gentlemen, from his character and conduct, whether his character is a good one or the reverse? - A. Not a good one.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it very bad? - A. I never knew any good that ever he did.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adair. I desire, the deposition of Isgar before the Magistrate may be read; they have produced a great body of evidence, applying to different persons, and accounting for a number of persons upon a specific day, the 26th of April; they have adduced a body of evidence from various parts of the country, to speak to that particular day, I therefore now desire that the information of Isgar, giving an account of that transaction, be read, to shew that in that information there is not one single word that points at that particular day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. My Lord, I cannot sufficiently express my astonishment at what I have now heard from Mr. Sergeant Adair; when I consider the humanity of his nature, I confess I hardly know where I am when I stand up, to hear my learned friend's observation. I am astonished; I meant to have asked to have it read, but I had closed my evidence; the witness, Isgar, comes to day to fasten forgery upon the prisoner at the bar; the scene of that forgery, in point of time, and in point of place, he lays at the times that I must bring home to your Lordship's recollection; he says, that he arrived in London upon the 25th, in the evening, or 26th in the morning, it is immaterial which: that he put up at the Golden Cross; that he went to Mr. Crossley; that Sir

             wanted to see him at the Golden Cross; that Mr. Crossley refused to go to the Golden Cross, and desired to see Sir John with him; that he went so far on the way with Mr. Crossley to Sir John; and that upon the evening of this Sunday, the 26th of April; not upon the examination of the learned Sergeant alone, but upon my cool and cautions cross-examination, knowing the importance of the testimony, I fixed it upon him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170153"/>positively and unequivocally, to be the only time he saw Mr. Crossley in London; and what is much greater astonishment, that in that information there is not an iota that leads to the idea of this meeting at Newton, or at the Three Tuns, or having had any knowledge of Mr. Crossley, relating to this will, but in London: my Lord, that is not all; but, he says, the next day, Monday morning, before twelve, he saw Mr. Crossley again; good God! am I in England! and am I here in a criminal trial, past the hour that criminal trials are generally over; and after my strength and patience is exhausted, to hear, that when three persons brought together by a witness infamous beyond the power of language to express; a witness not competent but by your Lordship's judgment, which I must reverence, because it comes from the Bench, whatever I may think of it myself; when that man, himself an accomplice, scarcely within reach of testimony, when your Lordship gives me (to your honour be it spoke) the hint -</p>

               <p>Court. I gave you no hint.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. Then I will take it that your Lordship gave me no hint; what is the proposition now? that the prisoner is not to be tried upon what this man has sworn against him to day, in Court; that though the Jury should, peradventure, believe he did not see Mr. Crossley upon the 26th or 27th of April; that, peradventure the Jury may believe that Austin was not in the condition in which he is placed by the witness; that Holland was not in the condition in which he is placed by the witness, and that the other man also was in the condition in which he is placed by his unfortunate child, whom nothing but duty, I am persuaded, could have induced my learned friend to torture in the way he did; and the prisoner is to be tried upon the speculation that this was in May; because, when his story was to be made when he was in gaol, he states it to be in May.</p>
               <p>Court. You mistake my Brother Adair; you had better hear the Sergeant, and you had better not speak so loud; you know, you are addressing the Court.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. I am addressing myself to your Lordship; and I am addressing myself to your Lordship in an audible voice; because I cannot speak upon a subject that agitates and affects me without speaking in the tone in which I now speak.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adair. It is difficult for my learned friend to know what I mean; he has, no doubt, misunderstood entirely, the purpose for which I desired to have it read; it was not for the purpose of opening a door for him to change the day, which he has unequivocally fixed, by his evidence to-day, to be the 26th of April; it was no such purpose, I should disdain such a purpose; nor was it for the purpose of shewing that he fixed another time, with that view, upon his examination on a former occasion, so as to give the go-by to those witnesses who have been produced: but, called upon, as I am, it is my duty to state distinctly and audibly, the reason why I do desire the paper to be read, and the effect it appears to me it will have when it is read, and in that I shall not be irregular. - My Lord, a great body of evidence has been adduced, prepared before-hand, brought together from distant parts of the country, that could not have been acquired since twelve o'clock today, in order to shew where three different persons were on the 26th of April; I will ask, how any body concerned for the prisoner at the bar knew before to-day that it would be material to prove where these persons were on the 26th of April.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I must beg to interrupt the learned Sergeant, and I do it with all the temper that becomes this place; I do assure the learned Sergeant, that the reason I took the liberty of interrupting him is, that I apprehend what your Lordship called upon the prosecutor to do was, to state some legal principle, in the application of which this piece of evidence is admissible.</p>
               <p>Court. I think that they ought not to bring forward this evidence, it is matter of observation by me to the Jury, and there is nothing more in it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adair. My Lord, I am perfectly satisfied.</p>
               <p>Summing up.</p>

            . The particulars of the will, it is hardly necessary for me to state to you, the nature of the offence you are aware of, and you know, that by the laws of this country, the forging of a will, or the assisting to forge, or the uttering after it is forged, or the causing and procuring to be forged of any will, is a capital offence. The prisoner therefore is standing here to answer, at the peril of his life, the charge that is brought against him. I believe, the best course I can take, will be to sum up the evidence to you first, and then make my observations; there can be no observations in point of law; you can have but one question to try, whether Mr. Crossley forged it, assisted in forging it, or procured it to be forged, or uttered it after it was forged.(Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence on the part of the prosecution; and then proceeded as follows:)</p>
               <p>Now, Gentlemen, this is all the evidence on the part of the prosecution; and as this evidence stands, if you think proper to give credit to the testimony of Isgar, there can be no doubt, but that the case as it was opened by my Brother Adair, and as it is laid in the indictment, is fully and completely proved, because you have the general evidence of connections between Crossley, Holland, Isgar, Austin, and Clarke, of Worksop; you have evidence that Sir John Briggs, and Austin, and Isgar, were all in town upon the 26th of April, and Isgar tells you, that at that time the will was brought out by Crossley himself for them to sign; Mr. Crossley must know, that such a will, not being executed by the testator, must have been a forged will; indeed the man himself had been dead some time, therefore you have this case fully and completely made out, if you think proper to give credit to Isgar's testimony, without which you have not a case made out, by which you can find Mr. Crossley guilty, for without him you have nothing to connect him with Austin, or with Sir John Briggs, against both of whom there is an indictment for this forgery; but if you give credit to Isgar, you have abundant evidence to find Mr. Crossley guilty of this charge; but you are aware that those who conduct the defence of Mr. Crossley, have contradicted the evidence of several witnesses, and particularly the testimony of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170154"/>Isgar. It will now become me to state to you the contradiction they give to Isgar's testimony; and you will find that Isgar fixes Sir

             being in town upon the 26th of April, and Austin's being with Isgar at Crossley's house, in order to meet; that they call witnesses to prove that Sir John Briggs was else where, and to prove that Austin never was at Crossley's on that Sunday.(Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence on the part of the prisoner, and proceeded as follows).</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, this is all the testimony on the one side and on the other, and really at this time of night I do not find myself equal to the talk, and perhaps I should rather weary you that assist you, in going at much length into it. I have summed up the evidence generally, and I will make this observation upon the testimony of Isgar; the evidence of an accomplice is a very slender, trifling evidence, but if that accomplice is corroborated materially to the point in question, it certainly will have considerable weight. If an accomplice is confirmed in certain particulars, but that as to all the circumstances which affect the life of the prisoner, he standing uncorroborated, and in many respects contradicted, it will be for you to say, in such a situation as that, whether you think that Isgar's testimony ought to be believed. Now I do not recollect, that in any one circumstance in which Isgar swears, respecting the personal interference of Crossley, in the execution of this will, that he is corroborated either by any one witness on his side, or on the part of the prisoner, but he is contradicted, and yet it is by witnesses, who labour under a very strong degree of suspicion; for those witnesses do, in some respects contradict each other. It would be idle, as my brother Adair has stated to you, to call a witness, and tell you that the law allows him to be admitted, and at the same time to tell you that the law will not allow you to give him credit; I cannot tell you that, but you will consider the situation in which he stands; you heard the way in which he gave his evidence; he now tells you that he is sorry for what he has done, and that what he said last is the true state of the case; and he is corroborated in many of the circumstances by other witnesses; but as to the material business of the 26th of April, his being at Crossley's house with Sir

            , there is no tittle of evidence in the course of this cause that corroborates it; on the contrary, he is contradicted in the alibi, both as to the circumstance of Sir John Briggs being in London at that time, and as to Austin being at Crossley's house that Sunday afternoon, and as to Crossley being in town on that day.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, with respect to the first part of the question, as to whether this will is forged or not, perhaps I ought to say something to you upon the subject of the will itself; and I have seen so much in the course of this trial, that I take it for granted, that it is a forged will; there are several witnesses who do not believe it to be the writing of Mr. Lewis; the circumstances of its being in the hands of such a man as Isgar, brought to Mrs. Kane so long a time after the supposed testator died, and I don't recollect immediately what other circumstances; but these two circumstances do make such an impression upon my mind, as to lead me to draw the conclusion, that this will is a forged will; but the question remains still for you to decide, whether Mr. Crossley was the person forging it, assisting to forge it, or in causing it to be forged; and as to that you have nothing but the evidence of Isgar, as to what passed upon the 26th of April. It is observed by the learned Counsel, who lead for this prosecution, that there is no way by which the prisoner and his witnesses could get at the date of the 26th of April; It is very extraordinary, that all of them should come here apprized of that day, how to account for that I cannot say; I am told, that in the examination, which is not produced before us, there is no mention of that 26th of April; therefore, what it is that has brought them so well acquainted with this day, really rests on my mind in such a state of uncertainty, that I cannot account for it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, so long since as last Michaelmas Term, all these witnesses swore in the Court of King's-Bench for the purpose of my being upon bail, we traversed, and then came out the day.</p>
               <p>Court. It must have transpired by some means or other; here they all come to prove, that Crossley, Austin, Holland, Isgar, and Clarke, of Worksop, were connected in a way that must blast the reputation of all of them in all future time; and though they prove them all connected together, yet that wicked, that bad, that blasted connection ought not to have such a weight with you, as to give credit to Isgar alone, unless you think the fact clearly brought home to him; you will pin your attention wholly to that fact of the 26th of April, which rests wholly upon his testimony, and he not being corroborated by any body, but contradicted by a number of persons, under very suspicious circumstances, you will say whether you like those suspicious circumstances, or whether you think proper to give credit to Isgar, when he says Mr. Crossley was present on that day; if so, you will find him guilty; if you have any doubt, in all cases, especially in capital cases, you will lean to the side of mercy.(The Jury withdrew at half past three o'clock in the morning, and returned at four with a verdict of)</p>

            </rs>.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Knowlys stated the indictment.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. May it please your Lordship: Gentlemen of the Jury; I am obliged to my learned friend for putting you so distinctly in possession of the nature of the charge. The crime, in a few words, consists merely in this - in sending a letter, either with a fictitious name, or without a name, demanding money, or other valuable thing; and this offence, for reasons<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170155"/>that I am sure will start into your mind at once, was thought, so early as the reign of Geo. I. to be a crime deserving of a capital punishment. By that statute, it is enacted, that if a man shall send a letter, in such a way as I have suggested to you, demanding money, or other valuable thing, he shall suffer death.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, both from the appearance of the unfortunate man at the bar, and from the character he has assumed as a gentleman, and a literary man, to which, indeed, from his letter, he seems to have a title, it becomes doubly irksome to see a person of his situation and character in the place in which he now stands, for this most obvious reason, that we hope, in proportion as education takes place, and its consequent improvements in society, we hope, and the probability is strong, that offences will not be committed by persons of that description; but, at the same time, knowing as you all do, and as we must all feel, that depravity makes its appearance often about those who have the best education; and that crimes of a particular dye are only committed by men who have had some education: and you will have abundantly to lament the nature of those offences, which are committed not only at this time of day, but also in all ages of the world, by those persons who have affected to be literary characters.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, it is necessary that I should now introduce to your acquaintance, Mr. Oldham, the prosecutor of this offence: I dare say, every one of you know the long shop in Holborn, an ironmonger's, where Mr. Oldham lives: about twenty or twenty-two years ago, he was an apprentice to Mr. Dolly, who was then carrying on the same sort of business, to which Mr. Oldham has succeeded, from industry in his employ, and from other circumstances, that I dare say were pleasing, from his attention to Mr. Dolly; when his apprenticeship expired, he was taken into partnership; it unfortunately for Mr. Dolly happened, that he was afficted with very severe disorders, long before his death; and, I believe, for three years, his infirmities were such, as to confine him to his chamber: during this time, the principal business, of course, devolved upon Mr. Oldham. How it was, or how it should have happened, that there was any the least degree of ill-will towards Mr. Oldham, in the mind of a man, whom I shall presently state to you, it is impossible to conceive. Upon Mr. Dolly's death, there was an attorney in the neighbourhood, Mr. Peake, who spread it abroad, that Mr. Dolly had not died a natural death; and he, in the indulgence of his malignity, attributed the cause of his death to Mr. Oldham; luckily for him, the matter was spread abroad before the interment of Mr. Dolly; and, in consequence of that, it became expedient, that every enquiry should be made, even going so far as demanding an inquest of the Coroner upon the body; the inquest took place, and every body was satisfied; every body brought there by Mr. Peake, every soul was satisfied, that the death was natural, occasioned by the visitation of the Almighty. Gentlemen, in consequence of this, Mr. Oldham, pursued as he was, by the bitter malignancy of this man, wished to expostulate with him; and a conversation was had, in which he did not at all recede from the first point of malignaty, telling him that he was a bad man; that he had committed the murder; and he himself would be the hangman. In consequence of this, Mr. Oldham brought his action, and recovered, by the verdict of a jury, in the Common Pleas, five hundred pounds, for the damages of the slander. Gentlemen, this was twenty years ago; after this, every thing that the trick of the law could procure took place; till at last it went to the dernier resorte, into the House of Lords, where the verdict was confirmed; and thus, in the most solemn way, the reputation of Mr. Oldham was rescued from this slander.</p>
               <p>This story, then, Gentlemen, you will perceive at once, has been at rest for two-and-twenty years; how it came to the knowledge of the prisoner at the bar, I cannot possibly conceive; but from that circumstance has arisen all the motives which have begat the present correspondence, which I will state to you, in hopes that, by working on the mind of Mr. Oldham, he should extort money from him, through the medium of the anguish that he might possibly beget in the mind of Mr. Oldham; not from Mr. Oldham being apprehensive of any retrospect that was at all to alarm his bosom; but having known what malignity at a former time could do, and how apt people are to catch up too greedily any story that is related, he might well apprehend that much inconvenience and much sorrow would attend the revival of such a story that had been so long at rest.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, it therefore happened, that upon the 7th of January last, without there being the least degree of acquaintance between Mr. Oldham and the prisoner, he received a letter, in these terms:(Reads the letter, for which see the evidence).</p>
               <p>This letter inclosed a square; the contents of which I will now read to you, (reads it).</p>
               <p>This letter was sent to Mr. Oldham; the intimation, you see, was, that a publication was to be expected in the Daily Advertiser; and you will readily believe, upon the receipt of this letter, by Mr. Oldham, that he had immediate recourse to the advice of his friends. An advertisement in the daily paper made its appearance, and in consequence of that, a second letter, the letter upon which the prisoner now stands indicted, was sent to the coffee-house. Gentlemen, therefore, it is the contents of that letter, as they shall apply to the Act of Parliament in question, that, under the direction of his Lordship, will become the matter of your serious investigation; I shall take the liberty, therefore, of suggesting to you, under the direction of his Lordship, how far I think, without much hesitation, there is a clear application of the Act of Parliament to the business in question; and that the words in the letter are nearly conformable to the letter as well as the spirit of that Act of Parliament.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, we charge it to be a demand of a valuable thing; first, therefore, let me set that at rest; a Bank note is demanded, and that that is a valuable thing there is no doubt; but whether a Bank note was or was not a valuable thing, at the time of passing of this Act of Parliament, would not be a question of any importance, inasmuch as that clause must of course, according to the common ordinary nature of things, have a prospective operation; and things which might become valuable in process of time, being demanded of another,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170156"/>there could not be any description of value applied to them at that moment; yet, becoming of value in process of time, of course the Act of Parliament would apply to those things, and those things would satisfy, the act. The principal point, then, will be, the consideration of the term demand; you observe in the letter that my learned friend has read to you, and which will be read to you again, that there is this species of request, I will call it so for a moment-"enclose a Bank note." You will have an opportunity of seeing the letter, and you will see in what manner the work enclose begins; and you will judge of the context. Gentlemen, I do not wish to avail myself of any nice comment in this case; but you will see that all the preceding sentences are finished, and it begins after a dash, "enclose a Bank"note." Suppose the letter had begun with that, unquestionably there would have been a positive demand; how it is altered by the context, is for you to consider. Gentlemen, this, therefore, brings me to the consideration and import of the term demand, as it stands in the act, which must receive its construction according to the common apprehension of mankind; a demand is something more than solicitaion; it is something less than a command; you all of you understand what it is when you demand payment of a bill; if a man demands his rent, still where he has a right to have the thing solicited, it is called, in common language, a demand. Why, then, Gentlemen, let this term have its construction according to the common understanding of mankind, giving, if possible, that construction to it that shall be most favourable to the prisoner at the bar; I am sure that will be the direction of the humane Judge who superintends in this case, and it will be equally your inclination, without any direction, upon the subject.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, having stated the law, I shall now proceed to state the facts that will be laid before you in evidence. We have since discovered, that the prisoner at the bar, either is, or was, or pretends to be, an attorney; I believe he may be, and that he had chambers in Furnival's-Inn, which is not far from Mr. Oldham's; whether the sight of the house, and the appearance of such a manufactory, or, that the consideration that a manufactory of that sort first be got the story, we cannot say, but it is easy to suppose, that, from the appearance of wealth, something of this sort might have suggested itself to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Oldham, in consequence of receiving this second letter, began to be more and more anxious about it; and, as he was advised by his friend to answer these letters, so as to make the person planning the scheme go on in the prosecution of it; Mr. Oldham, by letters first of all, said, he could not conceive to what the letter alluded; and, not with standing, he denied every part of this charge, he wished for an interview; but at last, he was advised, by some gentlemen eminent in the prosession of the law, that the matter was so far compleated, that it became incumbent upon him, for the sake of public justice, to take the first opportunity of apprehending him; and, on the 20th of January, a letter was sent to the Cambridge Coffee-house by Mr. Oldham's clerk; the attorney of Mr. Oldham, assisted by the proper officers, were to be there; they placed themselves in convenient situations, and, in the evening about six o'clock, the letter was put into the bracket; of course, the eyes of those who were to watch, were upon the bracket; in a very few minutes afterwards, the prisoner at the bar got from his seat, went to the bracket, took the letter, returned to his seat, opened it, read it, and put it in his pocket; instantly, upon this strong proof, Mr.Sarel, Mr. Oldham's attorney, told the officers to apprehend Robinson, for that he was the person; he was apprehended; and, immediately upon his apprehension, he said, I suppose it is on account of this letter; they told him it was; upon which he asked Mr. Sarel if he knew Robert Reed? no, says Mr. Sarel, I do not; says he, he is an acquaintance of mine, he desired me to call for this letter, and I have a letter from him desiring me so to do; upon which he produced a letter, purporting to be a letter from 
               <persName id="t17960217-71-person920">
                  Robert
                   Reed
               <interp inst="t17960217-71-person920" type="surname" value="Reed"/>
                     <interp inst="t17960217-71-person920" type="given" value="Robert"/>

                  </persName>
            , desiring him to call for a letter that would be there left. Gentlemen, what will you say to this contrivance, manifesting such a pre-meditation of scheme, when I tell you, that this letter from Robert Reed was in his own hand-writing, in order to furnish him with a defence; so feeble is the human mind, when in a course of wickedness, and so apt to conceive that that may prevent detection which is to furnish the means of punishment. - Gentlemen, if this is not sufficient, there is another circumstance, which shews the watch of Providence over us, that villainy should not be suffered to execute its schemes; the very letter that he had in his pocket on the 20th, purporting to be written only the day before, had the post mark upon it of the 13th, and in consequence of this, Mr. Robinson was apprehended.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, here then you have the nature of the evidence to be produced. Of course it will be incumbent upon me to prove the hand-writing; and if the handwriting were to be the only evidence in the case, of course you would deliberate extremely upon that sort of evidence; although I shall prove it as strongly as it is possible to prove a hand writing; but, after the fact at the Cambridge Coffee-house, it is almost unnecessary, because the proof is so strong as not to require that auxiliary; but when you have the proof of the hand-writing, beyond all possibility of doubt, there can be no pretence, I am afraid, on the part of the prisoner, that can give the least likelihood of his shifting this offence from his own shoulders to another; he being an attorney, and in the situation of life that he is described to be, he was aware, that a more open thing would have exposed him at once to the fang of the law; and to avoid that fang, it was, that all this artful contrivance was made use of; if you see this clearly, you will reject all his pretences. In every case in the world of crime, it becomes the consideration of the Jury, how far the intention is manifested; however it may be surrounded by art; however it may be clogged by those pretences that may for a moment admit of another construction, you will exercise your understanding upon it; I am sure, that understanding will always have a sufficient guidance under the judgment of his Lordship, to give every doubtful matter its proper weight in favour of the prisoner; but if upon the result, there is no doubt, I am sure there is nothing in this case that can be called favourable, the offence being of a nature that I am sure you yourselves must feel.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170157"/>(Evidence for the Crown).</p>

            ? - A. I served an apprenticeship with him, and about the year 1772, he made me an offer of partnership, which I accepted.</p>
               <p>Q. That gentleman died, I believe, about twenty-two years ago? - A. Yes; two or three years after we had been in partnership.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any report raised that you had been the author of his death? - A. Yes; by a neighbour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, in consequence of that, bring an action against Mr. Peake, an attorney for raising that report? - A. I did, and another person both, and had very heavy damages.</p>
               <p>Court. Don't talk of damages; you obtained judgment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. That report was unfounded? - A. Totally.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as tell us how this transaction first took place, which forms the subject of the present indictment? - A. May I be permitted to look at a memorandum that I made at the time the occurrences happened, to refresh my memory; I only wish to refresh my memory as to dates; I wished to be very correct as to the receipt of the letters, and therefore I made memorandums; I will not deviate a hair's breadth from the fact, you may depend upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your house, where you received these letters, situated in the city of London? - A. The counting-house where I sit, and where I received these letters, is in the City of London; the manufactories go into the country. On the 7th January, I received a letter, inclosing a kind of frontispiece, with a dismal etching upon it, as he calls it; this is it (producing it,) it came by the penny-post, late in the evening; I saw the post-man lay it down upon the front counter; in consequence of that letter, I went next morning very early to my solicitor; in consequence of which, agreeable to the request made in that letter, an advertisement was inserted in the Daily Advertiser; this is the advertisement, (producing a newspaper).</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of having put in that advertisement, did you receive any other letter? - A. I did; I think the next came on the 12th of January, (produces it); this is the letter, it came by the Penny-post, and was delivered at the same place in London; that also was consulted upon by my friends, and it was thought proper to send an answer; in consequence of that, a letter was sent on the 14th to the place appointed in that letter, with an intent to lead to a detection of the writer of them; I thought it my duty so to do: In answer to that, I received a third letter, almost immediately, on the same day; (producing it), I consulted my friends as before, and sent an answer; I then received another letter, making a fourth, which inclosed this paper, (producing them): some gentlemen were waiting, who had bespoke a dinner at the Cambridge Coffee-house, where the answer to that letter was to be directed; there was Mr. Sarel and his clerk, a person of the name of Rivett, from Bow-street, and some others; I did not go myself; they went long before the time that the letter mentioned, to take off all suspicion; I sent the letter between five and six, the time specified in R. R's letter; I was always very punctual; I sent it by my clerk, Evans, who had carried all the others; I saw the prisoner afterwards at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing that was said reduced into writing by the Magistrate? - A. I believe it was; I left it entirely to my attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask whether, when the prisoner was examined, it was reduced into writing or not? - A. I am not positive.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was not.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am not certain, one way or the other, but I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time learn where the prisoner lived? -</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. I submit to your Lordship, this gentleman is not competent to relate any thing that fell from the mouth of the prisoner himself, after he has admitted that Mr. Bond's clerk reduced it into writing.</p>
               <p>Court. He has not said so.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The prisoner said he lived in Furnival's-inn, and he produced, I believe, a direction; in consequence of which, I went to Furnival's-inn to enquire, and they told me he had not been there for many months; at last I discovered that he lived in a court behind my premisses, just within sight of the windows, which commanded a view of my premisses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. I shall of course have occasion to Cross-examine Mr. Oldham; with your Lordship's permission, I will wait till after the letters are read.</p>
               <p>Court. Very well.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170158"/>Q. Was the prisoner's examination reduced into writing? - A. It was not; only the examination of the witnesses.(Mr. Oldham called again.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. I believe you are, yourself, a Magistrate? - A. I have that honour for Middlesex and Buckinghamshire.</p>
               <p>Q. You condescended, I believe, to assist your fellow Magistrates upon that occasion? - A. I sat close to the Magistrates.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you offer your opinion, upon that occasion, with your Brother Magistrates? - A. When I was asked a question I answered it; I am sure I should bow to their better opinion.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it happen to yourself, sitting there, to use any kind of threats? - A. I believe, persons now present know that I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or did you not? - A. No; I did not; I said, I would bring him to justice, if I could; that I found it my duty.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you use something like this emphatic expression, that you would pursue him while you had a shilling? - A. I told him, when he was treating it with trifling and ridicule, I considered the offence of that aggravated kind, that I would have found him out and brought him to justice, if it cost me every shilling I had in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say you would take care he should not be at large again? - A. I am sure I had the thanks of the Magistrate for what I did; I would sooner he would have clapped a pistol to my head.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as tell us what was said before the Magistrate? - A. I will: after one letter, or two, had been read, he, in a very insolent manner, said, to me, "why don't you produce all the letters, and your answers; you have received more letters than these; why don't you produce them, and the answers that you have sent." I turned round to him, and said, you could never know this if you had not sent those letters; now I am convinced, and I have not a doubt in my mind; I then produced them immediately, and laid them before Mr. Bond.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What did he say to your observation, that you were now convinced, and had not a doubt in your mind? - A. He did not seem to make answer to that; he said, if I could even prove the hand-writing, it was only a mere misdemeanour, and he would bail it; Mr. Bond told him, his opinion differed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. Had you not, previous to his saying that you had other letters, intimated that you had received other letters? - A. I don't recollect that I had mentioned it, even to Mr. Bond.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to recollect yourself? - A. I do not recollect that I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear, that before he made that observation, you had not intimated that you had been pestered with those letters, or that you had received others? - A. I made this observation -</p>
               <p>Court. Q. No, no, the question is, had not you said, before Robinson made that observation, that you had received other letters? - A. I do not recollect that I had; I don't think I said that till he demanded them.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you had not? - A. I solemnly believe I had not said one word, nor did not mean to bring them forward; I have not put it down in my memorandum; I am very careful about my word, much more about my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not said so in the prisoner's hearing? - A. I do not believe I had, because I was surprised when he called for them, and then I was convinced he knew the whole of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you mentioned to your Brother Magistrates, or other persons in the room, that you had received other letters? - A. I had mentioned it to a Magistrate, but he did not attend the examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you mentioned it to a single person then in the room? - A. I don't recollect that I had, except Mr. Sarell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not upon the reading the second letter, which evidently refers to some other, that he said that? - A. I do not recollect whether it was upon the first or second letter.</p>
               <p>Q. When this letter in question was read, evidently referring to a correspondence, did not he say, produce the whole? - A. He said, produce the verses also; how could he know of the verses?</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Why will you be arguing; attend to the question, and give an answer to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Do, Mr. Oldham, attend to the question; I don't at all wonder at your agitation.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. Did he say, produce the verses, and say nothing of the letters? - A. He said, "why don't you produce the letters and the verses.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure whether it was upon the reading of the first or second letter? - A. I believe it was upon the first; and soon after they began reading of it; I don't wish to go a hair's breadth beyond the truth.</p>
               <p>Court. Pray don't go on in that way, but answer the question; who is suspecting that you would go beyond the truth?</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You say he called for the verses; were those verses at all included in either the first or second letter? - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What was it that he said about the verses? - A. He said, "why don't you produce all the letters that you have received, and the answers that you have sent;" I said, I had received others, and here they were; and then, he said,"why don't you produce the verses, the verses came in the last letter."</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Fielding. I am a waiter at the Cambridge coffee-house; I remember the last witness delivering a letter to me, which I put in the bracker at the corner of the bar, on the right hand coming into the coffee-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any person take that letter from the bracket? - A. Yes; the prisoner at the bar; he came from the top of the coffee-room, and took it very soon after.</p>
               <p>Q.Is it a large room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.How many feet in length? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he open the letter? - A. Yes; he walked up the room, opened it, and read it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Sarell and the other gentlemen there? - A. Yes; they took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sarell called again. Q. You went to the coffee-house that evening? - A. I did, on the 20th of January, in consequence of a letter that Mr. Oldham had received; the letter that has just been given in by Evans, was wrote; and it was agreed, that myself and a clerk of mine, with an officer from Bow-street, and another person, should go to the coffee-house before the hour that the letter was requested to be left; it was proposed that the letter should be brought at six o'clock precisely; at six o'clock Mr. Oldham's clerk brought the letter, and gave it to Harris, the waiter, who put it into the bracket at the right hand of the bar; in about three minutes after, I saw Mr. Robinson, the prisoner; I did not know him at that time, but I saw him come to the bracket and take out the letter with a degree of tremor; as soon as it was taken out of the bracket (his coat was rather loose), and he put the letter down to his right side, as if to conceal it; he then went to the extremity of the coffee-house, and sat down in a box; very soon after he had sat down, he took the letter from his pocket, or from his side, I don't know which, and opened it and read it; whilst he was in the act of reading the letter, I was willing to discover whether it was the real letter he was reading; I saw a news-paper lying upon the table in the box; I went to the table and took the news-paper from thence; when Mr. Robinson saw me come towards the table, he folded up the letter; I had merely an opportunity of seeing that it was that letter; still, however, wishing to be satisfied, I went to the bracket to see whether I might or not be mistaken; I observed that the letter was gone from the bracket; I then seated myself again, and turned towards the prisoner, who was at that time in the act of reading the letter a second time; I then mentioned to the officer, Rivett, that that must be the person we were in pursuit of; and I wished him to be taken into custody; the officer went up to him, I went with him, and I mentioned to Mr. Robinson, that we wanted to speak with him; and we withdrew into a private room; when we were all in the private room, Mr. Robinson, producing the letter, said, I presume you want me upon the subject of this letter, or to that effect; I told him, we did; he then asked me if I knew Mr.

               <p>Q. When this letter was produced, did you make any further enquiry who Mr. Read was? - A. Yes; Mr. Robinson repeated again, that he was either a friend or an acquaintance, I am not sure which was the expression he made use of; I asked him where he lived; he told me, he did not know; he said, he was to meet him that evening, by appointment; and, that if I would let him go, he would bring Mr. Read; I told him, I could not do that; he had, a little before that, taken out his card, and said, he was an attorney, in Furnival's Inn; I told him, I was very sorry to see a man in the profession, in his situation; and wished him to tell me where Mr. Read lived; I defined he would tell me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170160"/>where the appointment was, that I might have an opportunity of finding him, that he himself might be liberated, or to that effect; I think, he said, he did not chuse to tell where it was; I think, he afterwards mentioned, that he lived in one of the streets over Blackfriars' Bridge; nothing further then passed; but when Mr. Robinson was before Mr. Bond, I pointed out to him, that the letter which I just now produced, signed

R.'s letter of the 12th; to that Mr. Robinson made answer, that it did, and that he had taken the first letter; that is, Mr. Oldham's letter to R. R. of the 14th; and, I believe, then the Magistrate took the information of the witnesses, and Mr. Robinson was committed.</p>
               <p>Q.Rivett, of course, knows nothing more than you have stated? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jackson. Q. I understand you to say, that when the prisoner took that letter, you thought he shewed some signs of tremor? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q.Notwithstanding that, he read it in the public coffee-room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were privy, professionally, to the whole of this correspondence? - A.Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This letter, which you saw him take, was the last of the whole correspondence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say, that he did not feel himself at liberty to discover who Mr. Read was, from a point of honour? - A. I am sure there was no such word as point of honour; I think he said, he could not tell me where Mr. Read lived; he said, it was an acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Q. But unless you would enable him to keep his appointment, he could not undertake for the production of Mr. Read? - A. Unless I would permit him to go at large.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say he did not feel himself at liberty to discover who Mr. Read was? - A. He did not, nor to that effect; the answer was, that he could not tell me where he was to meet him, or that he could not say where he lived; he could not produce him, unless I gave him leave to keep the appointment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not learn from him, that he was confidentially employed by Mr. Read? - A. He afterwards mentioned that he was Mr. Read's attorney; but I think that was before the Magistrate, I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. I put it to you again; I ask you if the inference you drew was not that he was confidentially employed by Mr. Read. in this business? - A. I was very sorry to be satisfied in my own mind that Mr. Robinson was the writer of the letters.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether, on that night, or at any other time, Robinson said he was Mr. Read's attorney, you don't know? - A. No.</p>

               <p>"SIR,"It remains with you to judge how far the publication of the piece, to which the enclosed paper refers, can or cannot affect you. Give me leave to observe, that it was put into my hands some months since by a man of genius, a prisoner in the Fleet, who had not himself the power of getting it ushered into the world. Although I am a literary character, and concerned in some of the daily prints, I hesitated at promoting an attack of so serious a nature as this, and resolved to take some time to consider of it. The death of the author, which happened soon afterwards, occasioned the manuscript to be mislaid amongst my papers; but as I have repeatedly been called upon by the widow of the deceased (who has four children with herself entirely destitute) to make some use of the MS. I have rather thought it adviseable to take this step first, supposing, from what I have understood of your character as a gentleman (liberal and open-hearted), that you would sooner administer to the necessiries of this unhappy family, than urge me (or any one else) as their friend, to the publication of a work of this kind to relieve them.</p>

               <p>"Perhaps, if you were to peruse the MS. It would convince you that the author had, by some means, got possession of circumstances, rather important in their nature - as to what foundation they may rest on, I pretend not to hazard a conjecture - but so it is - and I have only further to observe, that in me, Sir, you will find a gentleman incapable of acting in any manner unbecoming that character. I have reasons (which must, on consideration, be obvious to you) for not chusing to avow myself - but you may be assured that no steps whatever shall be taken in this business for eight days to come; you will therefore have time to deliberate and to determine.</p>
               <p>"If you take no notice whatever of this letter, I shall conceive myself at full liberty to let the matter take its course. And however I may regret the necessity I am under of so doing, I shall feel a particular satisfaction in knowing that I gave you, in a gentleman-like manner, an opportunity of preventing it.</p>

            Oldbam, Esq, Brook-street, Molborn.</p>
               <p>"SIR,"I am well pleased to find that I am not likely to be mistaken in the idea I have entertained of you. Amongst men of a proper and liberal way of thinking, an understanding on such a matter as this, is the easiest thing imaginable - and in repeating that you will find me a gentleman, I wish you to be satisfied that I am as incapable of taking any unmanly advantage, as of wantooly sporting with the feelings of any one. I have ever despised and execrated the cowardly assassin who, skulking in obscurity, sends forth his malignant shafts to wound the peace and the character of individuals, and I have therefore uniformly resisted every overture that has been made me for such a purpose. My situation, as a literary character, has teemed with temptations, but a sacred principle of honour has superseded them all. The subject on which I have addressed you, has long lain dormant, and it was because I thought the attack of a most serious complexion, that I hesitated for such a length of time in giving any counternance to it - not that I ever fought for any circumstances to influence my judgement or qualify my opinion - and, for ought that has ever come to my knowledge, it may be allthe "moonshine of"the moment."</p>
               <p>"I am, therefore, so far candid, and, I trust, not indelicate; and it will be at least a satisfaction to you to be told (with a solemnity becoming the character I have prosessed myself), that not a foul but myself is in possession of a line of the MS. nor has it ever been out of my hands, or perused or heard by any person living since first I had it - so that when it is committed to the flames, all will necessarily die with it. Of this you shall have a testimony so clear and unequivocal, that it will not be possible for you afterwards to doubt.</p>
               <p>"Thus much I have suggested for your satisfaction. You will now give me leave to say something in behalf of the cause I have engaged in.</p>
               <p>"I have no objection to an interview, and I readily close with your proposition; but there are a few preliminaries first which I must beg leave to adjust - perhaps I may be more anxious to urge them, in order to have some proof of your sincerity - after which I am at your service.</p>
               <p>"In order to relieve a destitute and unhappy family, struggling with sickness and with sorrow, will you permit me to be your almoner? will you enable me to dispose of a little of your money as I shall see occasion? It is a duty I owe the cause of humanity to urge it. Remember, Sir, I am now only making my appeal to your benevolence; I am holding out no delusions to exact the involumary tribute; I am asking you as a gentleman, as a man, to give me some earnest of your intentions, to prove what I am so strongly inclined to give you credit for - enclose a Bank-note in a letter, addressed to R. R. and let it be left at the Cambridge Coffee-house, the top of Newman-street, in Goodge-street: on the side of the bar, at the entrance of the coffee-room, is a bracket for letters, let it be placed there between the hours of eleven and one, on Thursday next, and at five o'clock on the same day a line shall be sent porter to your house, to acknowledge the receipt - after which, if you will name any day (Friday excepted) in the following week, on which it will suit you, in the evening, to take a bottle of wine, at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170162"/>the king's head Tavern, Middle-row, Holhorn, or elsewhere, I will with pleasure attend you; our meeting is, however, to be private and "sete-n-sete," then, possibly, over the ashes of the MS. a phoenix may arise that may prove a forerunner to friendship.</p>
               <p>"I shall send to the Coffee-house between the hours of one and four; and I will venture to say, that you will have no reason to be dissatisfied with the event of this correspondence. To obtain a confidence, it is necessary, or at least reasonable, to expect that one should be reposed.</p>
               <p>"I have the honour to remain,</p>

            - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I shall now read Mr. Oldham's answer to the second letter that has just been read of the 12th.</p>
               <p>Mr. Oldham. This that has now been read, is the answer to the first letter I sent; the first letter I received was answered by the advertisement; it was dictated by my friends and wrote by Evans.</p>
               <p>It is read, dated the 14th Jan. 1795, no signature, addressed to Mr. R.R. to be left at the Cambridge Coffee-House, top of Newman-street, in Goudge-street.</p>
               <p>"SIR,"Your letter which I received on Tuesday, signed R.R. has not afforded me that explanation which I expected; and I thought my answer to your former letter in the Daily Advertiser, would have convinced you that I was ignorant of what could be intended by the paper you sent me in the letter, or what MS. you could be possessed of, the publication of which could be of such importance to me, who am not conscious of ever having done any improper act. But, Sir, as you are a gentleman, and a man of honour, assure me that you have seen and read the MS. in question, and that it contains circumstances rather important to me, I will give you credit for the assertion; and, permit me to say, that you will find me deserving of those characters. But in answer to that part of your letter of the 12th. respecting the Bank-note, which you request of me, I must freely confess, that although I am ever happy to administer to the relief of my fellow-creatures in distress; yet, in a case like the present, not knowing any of the parties or their situation, you cannot wonder I should delay sending any thing, being desirous of seeing the MS. Alluded to, before I send you any remittance; and, therefore, I trust, you will not be offended at the trisling delay this occasions; assuring you, that if you will favour me with a sight of it, you may rely on my honour of returning it with a proper acknowledgment; or, if it be more agreeable, I will meet you alone at any time and place after Tuesday next, that you will mention; and I have no objection to have the meeting at the King's head Tavern, Middle-Row, Holborn; but if you have any preference to another house, pray name it, and I will attend you with pleasure."</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. (To Oldham). Q. Did the prisoner call upon you to produce your answers before or after the reading of the letters? - A. It was while the first lotter was reading, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. You succeeded your late master in business? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, you were fortunate enough to gain the affections of his widow? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the death of your late master? - A. Twelve or fourteen months.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not happen, at that time. that some persons amused themselves with writing squibs, and things of that kind upon the occasion? - A. I never saw any nor heard of any.</p>
               <p>Q. Give me leave to ask you, when you wrote these letters, solemnly pledging your honour, in the way that has been read, and inviting further communication, was it not with a view that this person should produce the manuscript in question, whatever it might be? - A. With this view, and this only, I declare, upon my oath, to bring him to justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Granted; but when you expressed so much anxiety to see the manuscript, after the contents were thus intimated, did it not arise from a curiosity to see what it might contain? - A. Not any; but merely to bring the man to justice; I would have parted with my heart's blood, before I would have given him any money.</p>
               <p>Letter read, dated Thursday, half past twelve o'clock, Grecian Coffee-House, Temple.</p>
               <p>"SIR,"I wish I had said sufficient in my last, to have made any farther explanation unnecessary. I am perfectly satisfied with your attention, and should really feel comfortable, if I could, consistent with circumstances, comply in every respect with your wishes, and unreservedly to place that confidence in you, which, perhaps, you have some right to think yourself entitled to. But this is a very delicate point, a matter of the nicest discrimination, and a very little reflection will convince you, that although I might be justified in producing the MS. at an interview, I could be no means part with it thus hastily, without a manifest breach of confidence and honour. Of me, personally, it is very true, you know nothing, but you have politely given me credit for my assertions. Hence it follows, that I am possessed of something - that something has led us into a correspondence; but whether founded on facts or not, I still repeat, I have no kind of inclination to risque a conjecture. I have assured you (and you seem to take it for granted) that I am a gentleman, and a man of honour - surely then you can commit no great error in confiding to a person of this description, some little earnest of your sincerity. I have not, with bold indecency, presumed to dictate to your liberality. I have reason to know you possess the means, in a very high degree, and to believe that you have a-disposition to be generous, but I have left to yourself to exercise it as you please. I have merely hinted to you, that a Bank-note(without affixing any specific value to it) would pave the way for an interview we might both have reason to be pleased with. And if I am worthy of your confidence in one respect, I cannot be altogether undeserving of it in another.</p>
               <p>"If it will, in any measure, be satisfactory to you, I will (if you desire it) promise you on my word (and as a pledge of future confidence between us). that I will not part with any note you may send me, until after our interview; nor shall the parties know I have received it; I will myself administer a trifle to their immediate necessities - still reserving the power to do as I please with it after you and I have met.</p>
               <p>"I shall send to the Cambridge Coffee-house again between eight and ten this evening, when, I trust, you will have considered the matter, and I shall find my request complied with; it may be necessary, however, to add, by way of preventing any further waste of time in epistolary intercourse, that my conduct is generally marked by a firmness and consistency, which I seldom see occasion to depart from; - nor will you, after this declaration, seek to alter my purpose, or in any other respect to urge me (not) to insist on a sacred adherence to this ten or of the letter. I remain, Sir,"Your most obedient, and respectful servant, 14th Jan. 1796."R. R."</p>

               <p>"P. S. I have not the MS. about me; but, if sending you a page or two of it, will be any kind of satisfaction, I will transcribe the first half dozen stanzas, and send them to your house by twelve to-morrow."</p>
               <p>J. O. Oldham, Esq. Brook-street, Holborn. (Porter paid).</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170163"/>Q. (To Oldham). This is a copy of the answer you sent to that letter. - A. It is.</p>
               <p>It is read, dated 14th Jan. 1796, addressed to Mr. R. R. Cambridge Coffee-House, Newman-street.</p>
               <p>"SIR,"Upon my return this instant, I found your note, dated from the Grecian Coffee-house, Temple. I am sorry that I am under the necessity of repeating, that I with to see the MS. or a few pages of it, before I comply with your request of sending a Bank-note, for as I have not the pleasure of knowing you, and am aware that I never injured mankind, I am at a loss to guess the subject upon which the MS. can be written. I have already assured you, that I will act honourably with you; and hope you will place some confidence in that assertion. - I have no with to get the MS. from you, if it will be my breach of confidence in you to part with it. But I with to read it, I own; and, therefore, if you will appoint a meeting after Tuesday, I will wait upon you with pleasure, when I can read it in your presence, and you can take it with you again (not wishing that you should be guilty of any breach of confidence on my account) with any thing that I may think requisite; but before Wednesday I cannot meet, as I am going out of town to-morrow, and shall not return until Tuesday night. You, I trust, know that confidence in me will not be misplaced, and therefore pray give me my own humour for a little while, and you may have no occasion to be dissatisfied."</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. (To Oldham). Q. Whether, in point of fact, it ever afterwards happened to you to receive a manuscript? - A. I received, what he calls a part of one, in a fourth letter.</p>
               <p>Letter read, dated Tuesday noon, 19th Jan. 1796, signed R. R. and addressed J. O. Oldham, Esq.</p>
               <p>"SIR,</p>
               <p>"I have complied so far with your earnest wishes, and with the promise in my last, as to send you enclosed nearly half the MS. I would rather you had suffered me to have my humour, but there seeman ingenuousness in your manner, which I interpret into a sacred principle of honour, and which, I am proud to say, I was never yet mistaken in or deceived by.</p>
               <p>"In regard to the MS. permit me once more to declare, that I know not the grounds (if any) to which the subject is directed, and I am perfectly disposed to believe, that you speak truth, when you observe, that you are not aware of having ever injured mankind. Animated by that consciousness, no man need shrink from enquiry, and far be it from me to suffer you to be disturbed; I have interested myself merely with a view to serve and to relieve a wretched groups of destitute sufferers, and by delegating me, as your agent, to administer to their distresses, you are certainly securing yourself another source of satisfaction.</p>
               <p>"Between the hours of five and seven to-morrow evening, I shall look for a letter from you, addressed as before, to the Cambridge Coffee-house. I am thus particular in naming the time, because it gives me an opportunity to ascertain the proper moment for sending, and besides prevents any impertinent hands from getting possession of the letter. I have only to add, that I have not a doubt but your next will contain the expected (and I may say the promised) remittance-after receiving which, if you still desire to see me, I will with pleasure attend you any evening but Friday, and will leave to yourself to determine; I have no partiality for the King's-head, Middle-Row, but I think it better than a coffee-room, as our business would be rather of a private nature.</p>
               <p>"And now, Sir, I have placed a confidence in you, with the fullest assurance that it will be returned. The MS. enclosed is only a copy, and you may, if you please, keep it; but when we meet, the original shall be destroyed, and I will give you the most solemn unequivocal testimony, that not a line of it is any where extant, and that it has never been out of my possession, or seen or read by any one bet yourself.</p>
               <p>"I am, Sir, your's, &amp;c."</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170165"/>Mr. Jackson. My Lord. It falls to my duty to address to your Lordship certain objections that seem to me to arise upon this cafe, resolving themselves into this main proposition, that the evidence does not meet the charge in the indictment, or satisfy the meaning of the statute on which it is founded. My Lord, however it may be the right of every person, who is brought into the perilous situation of the prisoner, to interpose, before your Lordship, any kind of objection that can technically, or, in point of law, be taken; and however your Lordships' humanity hourly leads you to be the guardians and expositors of that right, I do assure your Lordship, that I should be extremely unwilling to employ that discretion which your Lordship's condescension allows to advocates upon all occasions, to offer to your Lordship any objections that do not appear to my humble capacity to have that weight with them, that such circumstances and such a situation call for.</p>
               <p>My Lord, the first objection I shall submit to your Lordship is, that the sending, which the Act peremptorily requires, has not been established. It must forcibly have struck the mind of your Lordship, that the only proof of the sending, is derived from an inference which establishes this man to have been the hand receiving the last letter of a long correspondence. My Lord, I submit, that that sending never has, on any occasion, nor would your Lordship now suffer it to be established by mere inference, but it must be a substantive sending; and, your Lordship knows, a common delivery has been held not to be a sending; and, without detaining your Lordship upon this point, I am sure the circumstances of this case have made a greater impression upon your Lordship's mind, than any thing I can say upon the subject.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Lawrence. I don't know what you allude to, by saying a common delivery is not a sending, within the Act of Parliament.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. My Lord, in Hammond's case, the Judges say,</p>
               <p>"In all cases so highly penal as the present"case, it is certainly necessary not only to consider the"intention of the Legislature, but to bring the offender"within the words of the Act of Parliament itself."The act of merely writing a threatening letter, will"not constitute this offence; for, unless the writer, or"contriver of such a letter, afterwards sends it to the"party, whole fears, the threat it contains, was calcu-"lated to alarm, it cannot possibly produce the mis-"chief which the Legislature intended alone to suppress." So that it turns upon the fact of delivery and not sending.</p>
               <p>The next objection I submit to your Lordship is, that this is not a letter without a name signed thereto, with in the meaning of the Act on which it is founded: a letter which contains initials cannot be said to be a letter without a name; and I submit to your Lordship, that though it may not amount to a name, which is said to be the discriminating appellation of an individual, that still it does amount to a designation, that law, reason, and the common intercourse of life has suffered to pass for a name. Bills of Exchange to an immense amount are accepted by initials, and upon these bills, so accepted, an action may be maintained. When the initials of men are forged, they are also of consequence enough to maintain an indictment. And your Lordship knows, that in certain eminent branches, perhaps of our own profession, and in many other circumstances in life, it is some degree of indication of rank and elevation, and is frequently resorted to as a substitute for signing a name.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I should not trouble your Lordship to hear abstract reasoning, if I was not fortified by the Legislature itself, in the Acts which I am humbly endeavouring to interpret. Your Lordship knows, this Act professes to be explained and amended by the 27th of

               <p>My Lord, Mr. Fielding, in his opening, seemed to think aid could be borrowed from that Act. I submit to your Lordship, no aid can be borrowed from that Act, unless the indictment had brought the offence within the express words of that Act; because, that Act of 9

             I. states only two offences, namely, that of sending a letter without a name, or sending it with a fictitious name. The statute 27

            . states three offences: sending a letter without a name, sending a letter with a fictitious name, and sending a letter with marks, or fictitious marks. I admit, that if this second statute had been merely intended to explain the order of proceeding upon the first, that concluding - contrary to the form of the statute, would have been perfectly sufficient; but I believe your Lordship will find it laid down, that where, as in the present case, an Act has been continued from time to time, and received considerable additions, and is then rendered perpetual, I contend, that no aid could be derived from it, unless the conclusion had been - contrary to the form of the statutes.</p>
               <p>My Lord, if it should be contended that this is driving the prosecutor to the 27th of George II. which enacts a punishment for threatening with murder or the burning of houses, although it should not exact money. My Lord, I reply to that, that I shall refer my learned friend to another Act, upon which alone this indictment could be founded, which establishes this offence to be a high misdemeanour, and which Act, I shall beg leave of your Lordship, presently, to advert to.</p>

               <p>My Lord, the next objection which I submit to your Lordship, is, that this letter does not contain a demand, within the letter, or the meaning of that Act of Parliament; I submit to your Lordship, that the letter must be a threatening letter; that is, that the demand it contains must be a clear and peremptory demand, accompanied with an intimation of bodily harm, in case it be not complied with. My Lord, I feel myself warranted in that proposition, by act 9 
               <persName id="t17960217-71-person943">
                  George

             I. to which I contend this indictment must be confined, and beyond which it cannot be extended. Your Lordship will learn from the title of that act, that it is "an act for the more effectually punish-"ing evil and wickedly disposed persons going armed"in disguise, and doing injury and violence to the pro-"perty of his Majesty's servants." Your Lordship well knows, that that act was introduced, in order to correct violences of a nature extremely atrocious, and which obtained at that time; but that nothing could be more distant from its contemplation than that species of offence<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170166"/>this day brought before your Lordship, and which is attempted to be engrasted upon that act. And,my Lord, I conjecture so from the only legal way of making out the meaning of an Act of Parliament, namely, its preamble,which after stating the then predominant evils of breaking into parks, cutting down timber, robbing warrens, and fish-ponds, going armed in disguise, stealing the King's deer, and a number of enumerated violences, goes on to enumerate that among the evils which this act meant to guard against."That whereas such persons"have likewise solicited several of his Majesty's sub-"jects, with promises of money, or other rewards, to"join with them, and have sent letters in fictitious"names to several persons, demanding venison and mo-"ney, and threatening some great violence if such their"unlawful demands should be refused."</p>
               <p>My Lord, I submit to your Lordship, that the obvious intention of that act was to correct violences of so atrocious a nature, as those to which I am alluding, and I feel myself still further fortified in this conclusion, by the doctrines of your Lordships upon every occasion where this species of offence has been brought before you; that it does happen regularly, and I hope it will turn out providentally for the prisoner, that your Lordships have constantly and invariably attended to the words "threatening letter," and also laid down that it should be that kind of threat that shall be so clear and unambiguous, that it shall be impossible to misunderstand the fort of bodily harm that it meant to convey. In Girdwood's Cafe, in Mr. Leach's Book 143, that impression was strong upon the mind of one of your Lordships; the question that was there left to the Jury was, whether there was a sufficient evidence of its purporting to be a letter threatening to kill and murder. My Lord, I conceive that the constant understanding of threatening letters under this act of 
               <persName id="t17960217-71-person944">
                  George

                  </persName>
             I. which this act professes to amend and explain is, that they threaten bodily harm if its request is not complied with; and what induces me to refer to that case is, that though the letter upon that indictment was nearly as strong a one as could be penned, namely,</p>
               <p>"I am sorry to find a"gentleman like you, would be guilty of taking Ma-"callester's life away for the sake of two or three gui-"neas; but it will not be forgot by one who is but just"come home to avenge his cause; this you may depend"upon, whenever I meet you, I will lay my life for"him in this cause; I follow the road, though I have"been out of London; but on receiving a letter from"Macallester before he died, for to seek revenge I am"come to town, I remain a true friend to Macallester.</p>
               <p>"J. W."</p>
               <p>My Lord,upon this letter, strong, powerful, and atrocious as it seems, the jury find the party guilty; the Judges say, that they thought the construction the Jury had given to that letter was, in their opinions rather trained. I merely mention this to shew your Lordship, that not only the Legislature, but that your Lordships uniformly have interpreted every letter sent under this act,as a letter,not only a threatening letter, but that kind of threat, clearly and expressly containing an intimation to do bodily harm. My Lord, I don't know choosen offence of this description has been brought before your Lordships upon a capital indictment, and put to the awful issue of life and death. This was a negociation to obtain a manuscript, which might well raise the curiosity of the party, a manuscript which I am certainly not called upon to defend; but to satisfy your Lordship that it does not come under this Act of Parliament,but another expressly providing for that species of offence; for however atrocious that manuscript may seem to the moral eye, your Lordship, as long as a subsequent statute, provided for that kind of crime, will govern yourself by the later and more humane statute, which must be understood so far to repeal the operation of the former. My Lord, your Lordship has seen, by the course of the evidence, which has been adduced before you, that I am perfectly warranted in calling it a negociation for the possession of a manuscript; for though Mr. Oldham may assure you, that when he pledged his sacred word of honour, that no harm should arrive to his person, when he produced the most solemn asseverations of how well placed his confidence might be, that at last, all that did but produce the whole object of the negociation; for the letters before your Lordship are nothing more than such a negociation, and the only point of difficulty throughout, seems to be,(each of the parties solemnly pledging their honour, their gentility, and their good faith) whether the manuscript should be first delivered, or the money paid; and, my Lord, however unpleasant that manuscript may appear, it does itself amount to this, that the few pages that have been so earnestly and so anxiously sought for, under an asseveration so solemn, was at last delivered before the money was given.</p>
               <p>My Lord, the only remaining point that I shall submit to your Lordship, is that the thing here requested, namely, a Bank-note, is not a valuable thing within the meaning of that Act of Parliament. My Lord, it is not necessary for me, upon that, to trouble your Lordship at any length, because I apprehend the proposition is perfectly indisputable, that at the time of passing this Act 9 George 1. neither a Bank-note, or any other chose in action, was within the protection of that act, or even the subject of a larceny. It is true, that by a statute, considerably after that period, the legislature did extend its protection to the Bank-notes and other choses in action, to make it the same degree of felony, as if the larceny had been committed upon effects or goods to the same amount. My Lord, I contend that at the time of passing this Act, the Legislature could have, by no possibility, the contemplation of a Bank-note, being a valuable thing, within its meaning; when speaking of money and venison, I need hardly tell your Lordship, that a Bank note is intrinsically worth nothing, and derives no protection or value, but as derived from the Legislature; and therefore I submit it did not receive that legal value at the time of passing the Act of 
               <persName id="t17960217-71-person945">
                  George

            . and that even now the Bank is within the protection of that Act, and therefore protected from larceny, was neither by that nor any subsequent statute, protected from the sort of offence charged to-day, namely, demanding a Bank note through the medium of a letter. My Lord, I apprehend therefore, that your Lordship will not strain it to the extent, that the Legislature has not strained it, namely, to protect Bank notes from this sort of demand.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170167"/>These are the objections which I have thought it my duty to urge to your Lordship, and I am sure they will have their due and proper weight.</p>
               <p>Court. It appears to me, that the sending is no objection; but it is clear in Hammond's case, that the letter was actually delivered to the person to whom it was addressed. In Girdwood's case, the letter was sent by the Post; and the man was executed. Now, it appears that this letter came to Mr. Oldham by the Post; and it is for the Jury to decide, whether they do not think it was sent by the prisoner. As to the last objection, I think there is no great weight in it; for, though it is not a chose in action, it is a valuable thing, and it would be a threat, within the Black Act. With respect to the other two objections, it seems to me a very difficult thing to say that the two letters of a name to the acceptance of a bill of exchange, is not a name. However, there is something in the argument derived from the act Geo.II. and I think it is a case fit to be considered.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. I beg your Lordship's pardon; I meant to contend, that this is an offence precisely within the statute 30 Geo.II.</p>
               <p>Court. I was going to mention that act, as having considerable weight, but these are considerable points upon the subject of an Act of Parliament;I therefore do not feel myself authorized to give a decision upon so considerable a question. I shall sum up the facts to the Jury, hear what their verdict is, and, according to that verdict, judge whether it is necessary to take the opinions of the judges or not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding.In the case of the acceptance of a bill of exchange, you are immediately led to the knowledge of the place and the person, merely by the initials. As to the letters R.R. they mean nothing; we know

The Judges have attended to this case, and are all of opinion, that this is not a case within the statute 2 Geo.II. chap.253 nor is there any reason to think that such a case was in the mind or contemplation of the Legislature at the time of making this Act of Parliament.</p>
               <p>The instrument itself does not import any property, either general or special in the prosecutor; nor was the prosecutor any one moment in the quiet and peaceable possession of it; it does not appear that the prosecutor had even a property in the paper upon which the note was written, most likely not, for it appears, that the note was written at the prisoner's house. Therefore, the Judges are clearly of opinion, that this paper never was an object of felony.</p>

            , and taking from her person one shilling.</p>
               <p>(Here the learned Judge stated the evidence, and proceeded as follows:)</p>
               <p>The Judge directed the Jury, upon this evidence, to find the prisoners guilty, if they believed this to be a conspiracy and combination of the prisoners to get this money from the prosecutrix; the Jury, upon that occasion, found both the prisoners guilty; and the question for the opinion of the Judges was: "Whether the facts stated, amounted to a robbery in the manner mentioned in the indictment."-The Judges, after consideration, are all of opinion, "That the prisoners were improperly convicted." In order to constitute a robbery, it is necessary that the taking the property should be accompanied with force and violence; or, that the property should be delivered by the owner, under circumstances of terror; and that terror may be of two kinds, namely, for the safety of their own person, or their good fame; it is not compatible with reason, that the law will allow the threat of sending a person to prison equivalent to a forcible taking, because, if a person were threatened to be sent to prison, the law would set them free. There was no reason for such a degree of terror here, as to induce her to deliver her property; but, the threat of a man's good fame, as a charge of sodomitical practices has been deemed sufficient, that being a charge of so odious a nature, as to strike every man with horror. The delivery of the property was not, in the present instance, accompanied with any circumstance sufficient to constitute a robbery; for the prosecutrix said, that she only parted with her money from the fear of being sent to Newgate, and not out of fear or apprehension of any other personal force or violence. Now, that, the law does not allow to be a sufficient ground of terror as to constitute a robbery, as she might have relieved herself by paying the money; the party might have known, that having done no harm, if she had been taken to prison, the law would have taken her immediately into its protection. We are, therefore, all of opinion, that the prisoners were convicted improperly upon this indictment; there certainly might be other means of indicting them for a misdemeanour; the persons who joined in this attempt might be properly punished, but this is not the way of setting about it. Therefore, upon this indictment, we are all of opinion, that see facts are insufficient to convict the parties.</p>
