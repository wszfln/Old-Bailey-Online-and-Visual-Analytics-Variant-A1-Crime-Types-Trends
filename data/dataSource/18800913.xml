                  </hi>. I am a travelling clerk attached to the missing letter branch of the General Post Office—in consequence of the loss of registered letters I was instructed to make investigations—on 3rd September I made up a test letter, and put in it five half-sovereigns, two shillings, and sixpence—I had previously marked them—I addressed the letter to Messrs. Rosenthal and Brunner. 18, Rue de Rivoli, Montmartre, Paris—it was in a registered letter envelope, and I sealed it down with the gum seal and posted it in the E.C. letter box at 4.50 the same day—I made a communi<lb/>cation</p>

               <p>to Inspector Martin at the office, and he afterwards communicated something to me—in consequence of that I sent for the prisoner, and saw him in the Inspector's room about 6.25 the same day—Constable Fry was there—I said to the prisoner "I am an officer from the missing letter branch; are you about to go out on your 6 o'clock delivery?"—he said "Yes"—I said "Are the letters in your bag for that delivery"—he said "Yes"—I said "Have you anything in your bag belonging to the post-office not on your delivery?"—he said "No"—I said "Were you facing up the collection between 5.15 and 5.45 this evening"—he said "Yes"—I said "At what table"—he said "No. 3"—I said "Did you see a letter addressed to Rosenthal and Brunner, 18, Rue de Rivoli, Paris?"—he said "No"—I gaid "I posted that letter at 4.50 this evening out of course, as several letters similarly posted are said to be missing; do you know any<lb/>thing about this letter?"—he said "No"—I said "Have you anything about you belonging to the post-office or at your lodging?"—he said "No" I said "I suppose you have no objection to be searched"—he said "No"—I told Fry to search him—the prisoner took off his coat and placed it on the table, and as he was doing so he removed a handkerchief from his tail coat pocket, and began to cry and wipe his eyes with it—Fry went on with the March—he searched the pockets of his trousers and waistcoat, but found nothing relating to the letter—at that time the prisoner had his handkerchief in his hand—Fry then went downstairs to search the prisoner's looker—the prisoner then put the handkerchief back in his right hand trousers pocket—when Fry returned I told him to search the prisoner again, and I told the prisoner to take off his trousers—he began unfastening them, and removed the handkerchief from his trousers pocket again—I told him to put it down, and pointed to, the table, but he stooped down and put it on the floor—Fry went to pick it up, and he asked the prisoner if there was anything in it—he said "No"—Fry then picked it up between his finger and thumb, and one corner fell down—he then untied a knot in that corner, and handed me the five half-sovereigns, two shillings, and sixpence, which I identified as the coins I had marked and put into the letter—I said to the prisoner "I identify these coins as the same I enclosed in the letter I have been asking you about; do you wish to say anything about them?"—he said "I have had them two or three weeks; I don't carry them for any par<lb/>ticular purpose"—I found nothing of the letter or envelope.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wool dyer, of 50, Warner Street, Clerkenwell—on 17th August, about 10.10, I was in Hatton Garden, at the Clerkenwell end—the prisoner rushed upon me, kicked me heavily on the right knee, cutting my trousers through, and inflicting a bad wound on the knee cap—he then dealt me a very heavy blow with his right hand in the chest, with his closed fist, bringing me to the ground—he knocked me down—he then seized my watch and chain, and dragged it from its setting; it was hanging in his hand—I closed with him instantly, caught him by the collar with both hands, and held him—I caught hold of the watch, and it parted at the bow, and the bow is on the chain now—I struggled and called "Police!"—I regained possession of the watch—I was unable to pursue him, through the blow on the knee cap—he also dealt me several blows on the jew, which loosened one of my teeth, and I was obliged to have it out—we were struggling together for about two minutes—during that time I was face to face with him; I have no doubt he is the man—on the following Monday I was taken to the yard of the Clerkenwell Police-court—I saw a number of men there, and immediately picked out the prisoner.</p>

C. office at 5.30 or 6 o'clock—Bush was sorting that evening, and assisting to dispatch letters for the Northern District Post-office—a letter from Stow-in-the-Wold might have been put before him for sorting—he would also have access to letters of advice from the same place—Hill was opening bags—they were both paid their wages on Saturdays.</p>

I am a clerk attached to the missing letter department, General Post-office—the prisoners are letter-carriers at the Central District office—in consequence of complaints I instructed Cohen on 30th July, and went to the receiving house, 230, Whitechapel Road, where Miss Hutchings handed me some papers, among which was this order for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., issued at Stow-in-the-Wold on 9th July—she also handed me this advice—I went with Butler to the Prince of Wales Sporting Grounds, but did not go in—I saw the prisoners there, and followed them to Burdett Road Railway-station—another young man was with them—I said to Hill in Bush's hearing, "Where did you get that money-order from which you cashed at the Whitechapel office this afternoon?"—he looked at it and said, "I did not cash it; I know nothing about it"—Bush said, "What is the matter?"—I said, "We belong to the Post-office; you will have to go with us to the General Post-office"—he said, "What for?"—I said, "You were seen to go to the office this afternoon and cash this money-order"—he said, "I know nothing about any money-order; I have not been to the post-office</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188009130012"/>
               <p>in Whitechapel Road"—they were both taken to the General Post-office, where I saw Bush alone, and said, "You were seen to leave the General Post-office this morning, and go to the Goldsmiths' Arms, and you were followed with Hill to the post-office in Whitechapel Road"—he said, "I did not go in; Hill went into the office"—I said, "You told me before you did not go; what did you go there for?"—he said, "Hill said, 'Hold a moment, I am going to get a post-card,' and I said, 'Get one for me,' but he did not get it, there were too many people there, and he gave me my penny back"—I produced the post-office order and said, "Where did you get it? Hill says he got it from you"—he said, "I don't know anything about it; I have not given him any money order"—they were afterwards confronted—I repeated the statement, and also showed him two other money-order, and said that Hill said that they were given to him by Bush—Bush said, "He did not get them from me."</p>

               <p>made him write acceptances to send to Switzerland—there was no such thing as an accommodation bill for Roth and Co., there was no drawing on him, and no request for other persons to give bills—I know Holford; he is not here—he is a friend of Casper's; he did not say that Casper had written to him to come and see him at the Horseshoe and Magpie, but I saw the letter—I never saw an acceptance signed by him for the accommodation of Roth—Shaffler was in London during these transactions—the only com<lb/>plaint against Casper is in relation to these two bills—I know nothing of Casper telling Shaffler that it was impossible to go on having these charges made against him to meet bills, and that the matter must come to an end—I know nothing of a conversation like that—Roth and Co. were never in difficulties; I know nothing of their requesting that Shaffler should draw if possible for only 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as their credit was not sufficient to get bills discounted for a larger sum—Mr. Wenge was at the police-court but was not examined—it was arranged in August, when Casper said that they could not meet their bills, that they should be renewed from time to time, and Charles Julius Casper proposed to take the agency for England and put me in as stockkeeper, but nothing was said about paying off the amount run up against him—he was not to give the security of the hardware business, but I believe it was said that it was like putting the two businesses together—I saw bills drawn by Casper and accepted by Young, of Leadenhall Street, but I do not know whether they were accommodation bills—they were posted off to Switzerland—this bill for 309<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is in English, but it has on in German "In need with" so and so—that means that if the bill is not taken up by Casper and Co., it goes back to the bankers—it happened several times in September and October that bills after they fell due at the notary's were taken up—they may have been for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I have seen a letter written to Mr. Adler which was found on Casper, but Wroth and Co. did not communicate with me as to anything found on the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Switzerland, and am a member of the firm of Roth and Co.—I knew of these two bills being accepted by the prisoner's firm—before the bill of 511<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. became due in November the prisoner called at our place of business in London, and told me that he was unable to meet it, and I advanced him 432<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. towards it, so that it should not be returned to our firm—he said that he had 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of his own—the bill became due on 19th November, and on the 18th he said "I have not got sufficient to pay this bill," and asked me if I could advance him 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. towards it—I said "I can do so if the bill of 511<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. has been paid"—he said that it was paid, and it was in his possession—I believed that state<lb/>ment, and gave him 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I got from Jones and Son, as we have no banker in London—that was a trade transaction; we sold them some watches for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., got an open cheque, gave it to the prisoner, and he gave us his receipt—that was the last time I saw him—I found afterwards that the two bills had not been taken up, and we had to take them up ourselves—I</p>

               <p>remained in London till December 31, 1879—I tried to find him, and had got a warrant from a Magistrate—besides these two bills he owes us between 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Vigier's position was inferior to mine—I do not get a commission on sales—I guaranteed bad debts to the amount of half only on salary—I was very intimate with the prisoner's brother, Charles Julius—he came to Switzerland for a holiday in August, 1878, but I did not propose it—I introduced him to the partners—I did not press large quantities of watches upon him, or point out to him watches which would not sell there, being unfinished, which he was to take and do the best he could with—Roth and Co. did not say that they would take bills for six months and renew them; the rule was for thirty days and sixty days prompt—I obtained from Casper his acceptance, and sent them to Switzer land—Casper's bills are not kept separately; they are mixed—this bill is dated November 26th, 1877 (<hi rend="italic">The witness picked out all the bills of Casper and Co.</hi>)—it is true that we only complain with regard to the two bills which are before the Jury—no bill of our firm was dishonoured by Casper and Co, and afterwards taken up with cash when in the hands of a notary or an English endorsee, before June, 1879—it is impossible for me to tell how many bills were taken up from the notary—I always sent the bills to Switzerland; there never was an acceptance signed by him and given to me—I first saw Mr. Ellis I believe in June, 1879; he came and said that Casper had shown him an invoice and receipt of our firm, and asked if he had authority to pawn the goods; I said that he had—I have supplied him two or three times with watches to meet acceptances, by pawning—I do not know whether Wenge knew that they were to go to the pawnbroker; he may have—the entries are made in the appropriation book, where we enter every watch that goes out, and we have a special book for Casper's—Casper never told us what he got for the watches, and it was immaterial to us so long as he was solvent—he pretended that in three or four days he was getting money from his bankers in Germany, and he represented that a friend of his was going to advance the money—Mr. Roth and Mr. Adler did not come over in June; I believe it was August or September; Mr. Vigier did not come to London in 1879 I believe; he came in 1878; we spoke of business at the Charing Cross Hotel—Vigier was here, but he was never put in the witness-box—Mr. Lewis was in the case last September and Mr. Kelly—I was not desirous that the prisoner should obtain goods, from other persons and pawn them and redeem the pawnings at Dobree's—I did not propose that he should get goods from Mr. Perrier, of Crosby Hall Chambers, or from Mr. Hine, of Thavies Inn, or from De la Volta, or from Mr. Chaplin, of Rienne, and turn them immediately into money, so as to clear the pawnings—I did not give him the address of parties in Switzerland—I was there two vacations—I mean to say that the names of a number of watchmakers at Solure, in Switzerland, were not given to him; I did not swear so at the last trial—I never suggested that they were to get watches—the bill of 511<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. does not refer to a special parcel of watches given to Casper Brothers for the purpose of pawning; that parcel was bought by N. Casper, of Switzerland, without my knowledge—we never entered these bills in our bill-book in Switzerland; it is not advised as being done on 15th November under date of 8th August; it is not entered at all—I knew that the bill was current; I have not got it because</p>

               <p>it has nothing to with our English business—he received the last amount on 15th November, and the bill was due on the 18th—we were in such a condition of finance that we parted with the money three days before it was wanted—November 19th was the last day he saw me, not November 17th; I swear that—I did not say on the last trial that the watches were placed in the hands of Jones for him to give us the money on them with a right for him to redeem them, paying our money—we did not let Jones have watches on that occasion with a right to redeem them—I admitted on the last trial pawning watches with Jones—we have pawned less than 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of watches with Jones—I do not believe I told the prisoner that until I got the cheque the watches were Jones's, and I could not let him go—I sent the cheque after Casper at 4 p.m.—I do not know that I sent it by Vigier or that Vigier brought the receipt—I saw him on the 19th, but not on the 18th—I wrote this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to Casper's father dated 29th July, 1880, inviting him to meet me at Cologne—I say in it (<hi rend="italic">In German</hi>), "Nevertheless it even now pains me much to have to open my hand to the criminal conviction of a dear friend"—I saw the father—no proposal had been made as to how much the friends would pay—this is a correct translation (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—a parcel of musical boxes was consigned to us from Switzerland early in 1879, and in October we passed them on to him and took the bill—the goods were sold to Beaumont, of Goswell Road, but we did not have the money—it was proposed at Charing Cross that we should take the agency of Roth and Co., and he might place Mr. Wenge in as comptroller, but we never had the least idea of doing that; we saw it was a swindle—I have sworn-that up to 15th November we had perfect confidence in Casper Brothers, but we never trusted them after October; we had confidence that they would pay their debts—I said that I would not allow them to be the representatives—I was not a partner then; I was made a partner in 1880—I was married in March, 1880—as early as September or October, 1879, I told Casper Brothers that it would ruin me if these pawnings were not cleared up, and Wroth was to know nothing about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The prisoner's firm always met their acceptances up to June; after that some of them had to be taken up by Casper Brothers at the notary's—I know that the firm was pressed for money—the prisoner was to get money to pay the bill from a friend in Germany, on the security of the watches he had from us—Mr. Ellis came to know whether he was in lawful possession of the watches, and we said that he was—after he got his money from Germany he was to redeem the watches—if he had not taken it up we should have had to take it up ourselves—I was not a partner then, but I had full power to do what I liked—I made Roths acquainted with it in September or October—I saw the prisoner on 19th November; I am perfectly sure of that—the letter in German is dated 29th July; that was after the prisoner was in custody—I had given evidence then, and gone back to Switzerland—I was at one time on very friendly terms with the prisoner—I thought in November that he was solvent, and able to meet the bills—I have never received one farthing from him since he went away, or from his bankruptcy estate.</p>

I am an M.D. and surgeon, at 9, Keith Terrace, Shepherd's Bush—about 1 o'clock on 19th July I was called by the prisoner's husband to his house—I went into the back room, and found the prisoner lying on her back on the bed; I undid her dress, and found a thick silk handkerchief tied tightly round her throat; it was brought twice round with one knot in front, as if intended to commit suicide—she was in a state of insensibility and strangulation—after removing the handkerchief she breathed more freely, and in a few moments I and the husband went into the room below, and there found the child dead in a bath, and water in the bath—it appeared to have been dead about an hour or an hour and a half—it was about nine months old; it was naked—there were marks on the left arm, as if it had been held under water—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the cause of death was suffocation by drowning—the prisoner was quite insensible—I had attended her in the previous November, she then showed symptoms of mental derangement—the last time I saw her was on 15th December—she then said she could not bear to be left alone, and that she would make away with herself—I recommended that she should be well looked after, and put under some kind of restraint—I was of opinion that she was not in a right state of mind.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I recommended that she should have a cheerful com<lb/>panion constantly with her, to take charge of her—I don't know whether that was done; if it had been I did not anticipate any danger—her conduct</p>

If I don't have it on Wednesday morning at my lodging, in two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, you can send them to the place. If you do, you shall have the money back in a short time; if you don't, you had better look out, for I know more than you think I do; so I hope you will send and get it for me, for I know you can, so don't write and tell me you can't, for I will have none. If I don't have the money on Wednesday morning you know what to expect. I won't write and ask you again. I hope you will send it, if you don't want to be exposed. Send it to Mr. Thomas J. Edwards, 17, Howland Street. I will never ask you again for anything, so don't forget what I say. Send it soon here, if you can, and I will not forget you.—Yours, Thos. Edwards.") I communicated with the police the following day—it appears to me a threatening letter—I did not put any particular construction upon it—I did not understand it as threatening anything in particular, because I know there is nothing that he could—I have other letters that I should like to call attention to.</p>

               <p>prisoner was at the booking-office door, and tried to catch hold of my arm—as I was in a hurry I passed him, and said "I should think you are cracked," and ran down to catch the train—I looked back, and saw the prisoner having his ticket clipped—he came down to me on the platform, and said "Don't you know me?"—I said "No"—he said "I am Perry, of Aldgate; I thought you were too proud to speak to me"—I said "No, I did not know you"—I then recognised him, having seen him at my em<lb/>ployer's behind the counter—he asked me what ticket I had, and said "I am going first, will you go with me? I will pay the fare," and we both got into a first-class carriage—when the train started he looked over into the other compartment, laughed, and said that there were some girls there—we travelled on alone, and after we had passed one or two stations he asked me if I had ever heard about zoedone—I said that I thought I had seen the advertisement—he said "This is a sample, taste it; don't take more than half"—the bottle was full—it was like this (<hi rend="italic">a one-ounce bottle</hi>)—there was no label on it—I put it to my lips, and took about one-eighth of it, and it effervesced to my nose and nearly choked me; it also made me feel sleepy—he then put some on a handkerchief, put it to my nose, and asked me to smell it—I did so—he saw me making wry faces, and asked me if I would have some port wine to take the taste out of my mouth, but he did not produce any—I said "I would rather not"—after that the train stopped, and a lady came in—that was, I think, the station before King's Cross—the lady got out at King's Cross, and we two were alone again—after the train left King's Cross the prisoner looked out at the window for some time, and said there were some green and blue lights, and asked me to look at them—I said that I did not want to—that was in a tunnel—I fancied I saw him turn round, and I turned round too, and saw something go up in the air, and felt a hard blow on the top of my head—I rolled on the floor of the carriage, and was senseless for a moment—he continued to hit me on my head—I tried to get up; he knocked me down again with the stick—he had knocked my hat off with the first blow—I tried to trip him up and to kick him, but he got farther from me, and continued to hit me with the stick, and as the train was stopping he knelt on my chest and gagged me with his hand—I pushed his hand away and called "Murder—thieves," twice—he throttled me by putting his hand across my throat, so that I could hardly breathe—I was on the floor of the carriage when the train arrived at Farringdon Street—I kicked, but could not attract people's attention—when the train started he hit me with the Stick again, and then he put it down and said "Where is the money?"—I said "I shan't tell you"—he searched my coat-tail pockets, and at last found the parcel in my left-hand trousers pocket, and I said "Take it, take it," thinking he would leave me alone—he took it out and put it on the seat, and commenced hit<lb/>ting me over the head again—I put my hands up to protect my head, and then saw him open the carriage door nearest the platform—he caught hold of my legs and cried "Come on, come on," but I caught hold of the leg of the seat and said "Don't pull me out, you will kill me"—he said "Come on, come on," and pulled my legs towards the door, but did not succeed in pulling me out, as I put my arm round the leg of the seat—he gave it up as a bad attempt, and began hitting me about the head again, but I put my head under the seat, and he hit me about the shoulders—the rail between Farringdon Street and Aldersgate Station is, I believe, underground—I was</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector at Aldersgate Street Station—on 21st August, just as the 11.6 train had left, I heard somebody call out—I ran across the line, and saw a person holding Lewis's arm, supporting him, and blood was running down his face—the prisoner was about two yards away and I think Bell had hold of him—I said to Lewis "How did you come by this?"—he said "That man did it," pointing to the prisoner; he tried to give me poison or laudanum first, and then he tried to chloroform me, and after that he tried to murder me by beating me on the head with a stick</p>

               <p>and he has robbed me of over 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and that it took place in a first-class carriage—I said to the prosecutor "Do you know him?"—he said "No"—the prisoner said "Yes, you do; we are friends, and you know me; I have not robbed you; that is my own money"—I said "Are you sure you don't how him?"—he said "Well, he might have lived against me"—Lewis appeared very ill, and as if he could not stand—I said "Are you very ill?"—he said "Yes, I am very ill and weak"—the prisoner said "It is all right; I did not do it"—I said "How do you account for his being in that state?"—he said "He must have fallen down and done it himself coming along"—I said to Lewis "Were you by yourselves, or was anybody with you?"—he said "Yes, we were in a first-class carriage by our two selves"—the prisoner said "You must let me go, as I have not touched him"—I said "That will not be sufficient for me; I shall send for the police," which I did, and Eve came—I gave the prisoner in custody—I think I saw the prisoner give Eve a parcel, saying "That belongs to him," pointing to Lewis.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Soho Branch, Tuesday. Sir,—Only a few words, about your late boy, to show that he has nothing to do with the letters of June 13th and 14th.

I asked to see the doctor; he said 'He is just gone out.' I said 'What time will he be back.' He said 'I will see,' and went into the room. I followed him in and said 'I will leave a note.' I then took from the shelf two sheets of rough paper, one quire of paper out of a drawer on the left-hand side, and four envelopes, and then two sheets of blue paper. Six weeks previous to that I called, about 7 o'clock, but you ordered me out. I gave the name of Cook. Please show this to Inspector Butcher, of Scotland Yard, and tell him to go to the prison and ask if he remembers the man what refused his name. He has nothing to do with it. Please show this at once, as it will set him free. Show it to the expert. It was my doing.")</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 27, Red Lion Square—I have for many years made handwriting a study—I have before me the envelopes and letters that have been produced, and have compared them with letter <hi rend="italic">O</hi> written by the prisoner, and in my judgment they are all written by the same person; I have not the least doubt of it—on this blotting-paper there is the word "County," and in letter <hi rend="italic">O</hi> the word "Cook"—the C in each of those words is as nearly as possible identical. (<hi rend="italic">At the suggestion of the Court the witness marked the letters and words in the various letters to Lord Oranmore which he described as identical with similar letters and words in letter O, and handed them to the Jury for comparison.</hi>) I say that the whole of the letters and envelopes are in the same handwriting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I remember a case some years ago in which I was employed by the City solicitor, and in which I gave an opinion founded upon the opinion of the City solicitor—when I came to examine the matter for myself I retracted that opinion, and learnt in future never to use my ears, but always my eyes—in the case of Sir Francis Truscott last year I and Mr. Netherclift both gave confident opinions as to the handwriting of a post-card being his, and a person afterwards came forward and swore that he was the writer—I have no doubt in an experience of thirty years I may have made mis<lb/>takes; I am not infallible—in that same Session I gave a confident opinion in Bingham's case as to a forged cheque—the Jury acquitted him, and he is now wanted for forging another cheque—in the Matlock will case one Jury gave an opinion against me and another Jury afterwards gave an opinion in my favour, and the latter verdict has prevailed—sometimes Mr. Netherclift and I have been called on opposite sides, but very rarely—I have said that I could find quite as many points of difference in handwriting as of similarity, but not in points of any consequence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am governor of Her Majesty's prison of New-gate, and have held that post for some years—I was previously deputy<lb/>governor under the late Mr. Jonas—all authorised letters are inspected before leaving the prison—we exercise all possible care to prevent un<lb/>authorised letters being sent—the letters which are sent out are written on special paper marked "Her Majesty's Prison, Newgate"—when prisoners see their friends a warder is specially appointed to prevent anything being taken in or out—it would be impossible for anything to be passed in or out during a visit by a friend of a prisoner—there is a visiting-place, with two iron gratings, about three feet apart—the prisoner stands on the outer side of the outer grating, and the friends on the inner side of the inner grating, and the warder stands with the friends, or sometimes between the two gratings—I could not tell which warder was told off to watch the prisoner; they vary, they all take their turn—the prisoner's solicitor is the only person who is allowed to see him alone, in a special room.</p>

I live at 2, Harriet Street, Lowndes Square, and at had not been sold at Tattersall's—early in the year I had a mare called Morna stabled with him—I told him to sell her 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and give me the money—about 11th May I offered to led Morna to a friend, not knowing that the prisoner had sold her—I did not know that he had received any offer for her till I received a letter—I have never received any money for her—I have not the remotest idea where they are; they are gone, including the mare and I have received nothing in respect of them.</p>

               <p>in the dark as to the reason Mrs. Dilke returned it; I certainly did not know at the time why it was returned—I do not think that was the pony that letter relates to; I think there were two ponies—Mrs. Dilke saw several ponies, and bought one—I don't know who Colonel Ellis is; I know several Colonel Ellises—I do not remember which Colonel Ellis it was who saw the ponies—I do not know which pony Mrs. Dilke returned—my memory is bad—I did not tell pegg not to tell Colonel Ellis why Mrs. Dilke returned the pony; I do not remember it, and I don't think I did—I do not think it is possible that I, knowing that Mrs. Dilke had returned the pony for a failing, told Pegg to show it to Colonel Ellis, and not tell him the reason it was returned; I cannot swear to a possibility, and there are no impossibilities—Mrs. Dilke told me that she returned the pony to Pegg because it had the staggers—I do not remember whether I was in close communication with Pegg at that time—Mrs. Dilke may have sent a telegram to me to communicate the contents of it to Pegg; I forget—I remember all I can; I can't remember everything—I have read this telegram (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Mrs. Dilke communicated with me because she did not know Pegg's address—I was not in partnership with Pegg; he had my horses—we were not under a mutual agreement, he to take my horses and sell them at a profit, and I to take his and sell them at a profit—we were not in partnership at the time Mrs. Dilke returned the pony—in all probability I wrote to him and enclosed a list of the horses which I entered at the Ranelagh Club sale, and said that if he had any to show he must place them in the list and send them to the secretary of the club before Thursday, or as early as he could before that date, because he would not be able to send his horses there without their being entered in the name of a member of the club—the great thing is to get as many entries as you can—it was not for my sake; Mr. Pegg would get the prizes—my horses were standing in his stable, and I thought he would like to enter his horses in my name—I wrote this: "Colonel Ellis would like to see the grey pony Mrs. Dilke had; don't say anything about why it was returned. Colonel Kingscote also wants to see the grey ponies you drove yesterday. Please be down at Marlborough House to-morrow and ask for Colonel Ellis"—I did not know who you meant when you asked me about Colonel Ellia—I believe horses were taken to the Ranelagh Club to be sold in my name which belonged to Pegg, but I was not there and did not see them, and don't know their names; I think I was out of town; I am quite sure I was. not at the show—I remember the show at the Agricultural Hall in 1879.—a horse of mine named Perfection was entered, No. 116; I do not know whether it was entered in my name; I did not enter it, Mr. pegg did—I bought a catalogue when I went in, I suppose, but I do not know whether it was entered in Pegg's name—there were two horses there, Morna and Perfection; at least I believe Perfection, and I know Morna was there, I saw her; I do not know about Perfection—No. 116 entered as Perfection was not Morna; Morna was a chestnut mare and Perfection was a bay—I know Morna was there; I cannot swear whether Perfection was there—I cannot remember whether two were entered or one—I bought a catalogue; I do not know that Morna was entered under the name of Perfection—I do not know that Mr. Sheward was manager to Mr. Robert Perceval, of Eaton Place—I have been to Mr. Perceval's, but do not remember seeing Mr. Sheward there—I know Mr. George Cox, the horsedealer, of Stamford</p>

               <p>Street, Blackfriars—I do not know Mr. Maule, the veterinary surgeon; I may have had a conversation with him without knowing his name—I do not know Mr. Youngman or Mr. James Ennis, familiarly called "Sandy," nor Mr. Hunting, a veterinary surgeon, of Down Street, Piccadilly—I never remember seeing that man (<hi rend="italic">Ennis</hi>) before, nor that man (<hi rend="italic">Sheward</hi>); he may have been at Perceval's, but I should not have known him—I do not know Ennis as Pegg's foreman—I did not know he had a foreman; I never saw him at Pegg's that I remember—I was at Pegg's day after day—I did not buy Morna from Mr. Perceval, nor do I know that Sheward negotiated the transaction; if he is the man who showed Morna to me I forget his face altogether; as far as I know I never saw him before in my life—I took Morna down to the Prince of Wales; J went down at the same time for him to look at her for the Princess of Wales to ride—I don't remember how long I had had her—I had sold her once before, and she was returned—I did not buy her back at a loss of 100 guineas—she was sold at Tattersall's, I forget for how much—I took her back because the gentleman who bought her did not want her, as she would not go in harness—I did not warrant her quiet to ride or drive—I never warrant a horse at all—I do not think I took her back at a loss—I did not tell Pegg that I was going to sell her to the Prince of Wales for the Princess to ride; I told him to take her down for them to look at; how were they likely to buy her without looking at her—he did take her for the Prince to see her, and I went with him—I did not say to Pegg "You ought not to sell that horse to the Prince of Wales for the Princess to ride, because she is not safe"—I made a statement on oath before a Magistrate before he granted a summons against Pegg—I believe I said in my information "The said Arthur Pegg was immediately on the sale being effected to hand me the money, and was previously to inform me who the purchaser was; any offer for the purchase of the mare was first to be submitted to me for my ap<lb/>proval"—I don't think I said in my evidence before the Magistrate in reference to the sale of Morna "Nothing was said about the offer being submitted to me, I never said anything about the payment of money"—this is my signature to my deposition; I may have said so—there were accouatfl between Pegg and me—I have charged him at this Court with stealing a horse called Perfection—I do not know that he sold that horse in August, 1879, and accounted to me for the proceeds—I don't know what he has done, I charge him with stealing it because I do not know what has become of it, he has never accounted to me for it—I swear that to the best of my belief—I do not know what I paid him in August, 1879—I believe there was an account settled between us in September last; I know I paid his bill, but I do not know whether it was by a cheque, I know it was all paid up; I paid him the account he brought me, but I do not know how I paid it—I do not remember whether he brought me an account in which the mare Perfection was entered in my favour on the contra account as being sold to Mr. Jones for 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; how should I know? I do not remember it, that is all I can say; it might have been—I want to know where the animal is—I do not remember that there was a contra account against him, there was the account he gave me—I do not remember anything about Perfection—that was the only account I know of—I find in this account "By contra account 313<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., balance 132<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., paid Sept. 22nd, 1879, Arthur Pegg"—I know a horse called White Cockade, and all I know is that it is missing</p>

               <p>pegg has never accounted to me for it—the balance against me in this account is 446<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the contra account is 313<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that leaves a balance of 132<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I certainly paid him that account, because here is his receipt, but I do not know how—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is Mrs. Dilke's writing; she told me she had sent the pony back to Pegg because twice out of the four times she drove it it had the staggers—I do not know that that was the same pony about which I wrote "Show the grey pony which Mrs. Dilke had; be sure you don't say the reason why it was returned;" it is not possible that I should do so—I am sure I did not say "Be sure you do not say why it was returned," I could not have—it could not be he same pony—Mrs. Dilke saw two or three ponies of Pegg's—I could not have known the reason why the pony was returned, and I do not believe I told him to keep back the reason—I cannot explain it—I have had no dealings with the Duchess of Newcastle, I have not the honour of her acquaintance—I swear I was not at the Eanelagh Club sale at Fulham in Pegg's company, but he rode my horse for me—I was out of town when Morna was sold—I went to Manchester races, and I wrote to my butler, James James, and told him to get the money for Morna—he either wrote or telegraphed to me that she was sold; that may have been on 13th May—I know now that the horse was sold to the Duchess of Newcastle on 12th May, but when it was sold I don't remember—I told James to get the money immediately the horse was sold—I was not then in Pegg's debt; it was directly the other way—if he had any account against me it could only have been for the keep of the hones; there was generally a balance in my favour, and when I wrote to James Mr. Pegg had sold some horses—there was a balance in my favour when Morna was sold; he had got my horse and he had not paid me—I subse<lb/>quently heard that the Duchess of Newcastle had bought Morna for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I do not know from who—Morna was not the least unsafe; she was perfectly quiet—she was not <hi rend="italic">nappy</hi> and false; I have ridden her myself—I said to-day that she was to be sold for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I corrected myself and said 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I made it a strong point at the police-court that Pegg had sold her against my orders for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. instead of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—James told me that Pegg told him that on 12th May he had sold the mare, and that he asked him for the cheque, but I do not know what he said to the Duchess of New<lb/>castle—I don't think he knew who she was sold to till much later; you had better ask him—I know he was there the morning she was sold—I don't think he told me by letter or telegram that she was sold to the Duchess of Newcastle; it is some time ago, and I forget—I never heart from James that Pegg refused to give him the cheque because his account with me was not settled; he promised to send the cheque every day—I have charged him with stealing a horse named Drake and a pair of ponies—I swear that I have not had the money for thorn, nor have they been accounted for to me—I swear that distinctly—I do not know that Pegg entered horses at shows for me in his own name; I entered horses for him in my name at the Banelagh Club, but nowhere else as far its my memory serves me—Pegg bought a team of four roans for me and sent them over to Homburg—I paid him for them; I do not know whether I kept him waiting four months for his money; when he asked me for it I paid him—I did not sell some horses belonging to Pegg; I took two down to Captain Machen; one was a brown hunter; I do not know whether the other was called "The Swell"—I may have recommended horses for him which he</p>

               <p>that letter—I know Pegg's private address, but I did not know it on 12th May—Lord Aylesford did not give it to me; Mrs. Graham did; she lives it 114, Denbigh Street, Pimlico, which was Pegg's address after he left Cadogan Place—I did not know her before that; she came to me about 10,30 or 11.0 on a Sunday night, saying that Pegg had been illusing her, tod she wanted protection, that she had property at her house and Pegg intended removing it at 7 o'clock next morning—that may have been, a fortnight or three weeks after 12th May—I do not think Pegg was arrested there, but the warrant officer went there, and when Pegg heard of it he surrendered.</p>

I first knew Benjamin four months ago—I heard that he came to the police-office, but I never heard that he lodged a complaint against me—there are three compartments in the bar—the passage is 4 or 5 yards long, and the cask was about the middle of it and 2 yards from the bar—I call that the back of the house—there are three doors in that passage—I never saw anybody behind the bar but Benjamin and his daughter.</p>

On 16th August, about 4.30, I saw Hummerston at Seething Lane Police-station—I said "Your name is Hummerston?"—he said "Yes"—I said "You will be charged with others in custody and "there not in custody with stealing a cask of wine at 110, Fenchurch Street"—he said "Yes, that is right; I was asked to do it by <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Hill, who said he had a brother working there who wanted him to take the wine</p>

               <p>and get a truck. I stood by, and Smith with me; we came to the public-house; Smith and Hill fetched the old man, and all four of us went to the Old Mile End Gate. I came in and went back to Bedford Street and received three sovereigns. I had one, Smith had one, and Hill had one; I heard they were in custody, and met Hutt, who told me he should apprehend me for receiving a cask of wine"—I had cautioned him before he said that.</p>

On 17th August, when Harding gave the evidence which he has given to-day, John Barton was in Court, and had the opportunity of hearing what he said—the third examination was on the 25th, and it was then that Barton corrected what he had said on the previous occasion, and said that he had received a sovereign.</p>

I did so, and sat on the truck a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes. Hill then rolled the cask down. He said, "Come on," and we took it down to Bedford Square, went to the Blind Beggar, and then Hill helped me down the steps with the cask, and we rolled it into Benjamin's house.

I am a bootmaker in Pulford Street, Pimlico—on Sunday night, 25th July, about 10 minutes or a quarter past 11 o'clock, I was in Bessborough Street with Mr. Emmett—I had been out for a walk and was coming home, and opposite No. 9 I saw some persons; I could not say how many, because we were bounced upon; there may have been eight or nine—Emmett was knocked down on the door-step, and then Jackson and Gorman were on to me, and I was knocked down and kicked all over, my eye was cut and bleeding—I was held down, I had hold of Dixon with my right hand and he had hold of me—I was trying to get up—some of them said "Keep the b——down"—my watch was pulled right away from the chain, the swivel broke—I did not see who did it—I knew the prisoner before for nearly two years by hanging about the corners of the streets—a constable came up in four or five minutes—Dixon was standing alongside of me and I gave him into custody—I gave the others in custody next day as I came from the police-court.</p>

Henry Montague says</hi>: My wife knows nothing about it; whatever has been transacted has been done by myself with some one else, and I have never broken into the houses which I am charged with. I do not know where some of them are. I certainly did assist to carry one or two things, but I was not aware the houses were broken into. I was asked to wait at the station, and the things were brought to me, so that I might take them by train. Some of the things were sent to me, and many different things were sent to me to be got rid of, but I did not know where to do so. Some of the things were given to me for assisting in bringing the things. I bought some of the dresses from these parties, which I gave to my wife. I was not aware any<lb/>thing was wrong until I was taken into custody. During the time my wife was maintaining herself in Ashburnham Grove I was endeavouring to</p>

               <p>obtain orders for books. I found I could not do so, and was obliged to come home, and at the time I had the things, was about six weeks before I was taken into custody, and one of the men stated I was to keep some of them until he came to lodge in the house I had taken. He was to have the back bedroom and use of the sitting-room. This is also my answer to the other charges." <hi rend="italic">Elizabeth Montague says</hi>: "Last year I maintained myself and bought a dress and under-clothing for my husband at Stagg and Mantle's and different shops.

The other charges he knew nothing about, and did not know where the houses were situated, and it was physically impossible for him to break open houses and bars, as he had been suffering from a weak arm for four years.</hi>

On Monday, 9th August, about 3.45 p.m., I was at Eltham Police station—the telegraph boy came with Miss Gibbs in a carriage—in consequence of what the boy said I called for half a dozen officers—I got four, and we followed the van—it was proceeding down Victoria Road—I saw Johnson getting in—I saw him get out again—he could not have remained in two minutes—I believe he saw me—I am sure he is the man—I saw him dodging about the van, appa<lb/>rently to keep out of my sight—I went and stopped the horses—the van was surrounded by the rest of the constables—Goodson was the van driver—the case against him was dismissed—I laid hold of Johnson—I said "You will have to go to the station with me;" he said "What for, sir?" at the same moment he tried to get away—I had hold of his arm—the other men were taken to the station—when the van was stopped they all commenced to get out—Johnson, Stevens, and Covy were taken into custody—they walked to the station—Smith and Steventon were taken</p>

I am a broker, of 246, Albany Road, Camberwell—in consequence of instructions from Mr. Bignal I put in a distress at 71, Warner Road on 14th January—that was the only distress I put in—I made this inventory (<hi rend="italic">F</hi>)—I saw Mr. and Mrs. Stewart, a sister, and two or three children there—I remained in possession five days, and afterwars withdrew on Stewart signing this document on 19th January.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">This was an agreement to give up possession within four weeks upon the claim for rent being renounced, with a power to make a second distraint if possession was not given.</hi>) These documents (<hi rend="italic">B and I</hi>) are inventories of (distress—I did not sign either of them or give any person authority to do go—I do not know of any distress on 28th January or in March—these are copies of of the original inventory, with the exception of the date.</p>

                  </hi>. I am 28 years of age—from September, 1878, I have been employed by the South-Eastern Railway Company at the Bricklayers' Arms Goods Station as a clerk—I work in an office by myself—I had a man with me for some short time, but he was taken into another office—my wife was employed in a business, not on lier own account—some time before April, 1879, I had put out a child to nurse with a Mr. Meyer, a greengrocer in the Old Kent Road—I was then living at 224, New Kent Road—the first time I saw Josephs was at Mr. Meyer's, about a month after my child</p>

               <p>went there—I don't suppose I saw Josephs above twice in Meyer's house—when we met in the street we said "Good morning"—he knew I was in the service of the South-Eastern Railway—on 27th June this year I saw him accidentally in the Bricklayers' Arms public-house—I went in for a little refreshment—he said to me "Are you a porter on the bank?"—I said "No, I am a clerk there"—he said "Do you have any bullion come up by your line?"—I said "No, it would come up by the passenger train"—he said "Well, if you can make up your mind to lift anything, I can dispose of it to advantage"—I said "Do any of them know you at our place?"—he said "There are some of them that have made their fortunes," he would not say they worked at our place, but he said "I have been a fool, or I should have been in the same position"—he said that Stephen Smith, a party he knew that is now dead, had often talked about me, and he thought I was too quiet, and could not be trusted—I said "Well, perhaps I am as old-fashioned as either of you"—we had some drink Josephs paid for it principally—I promised to meet him next morning opposite the Bricklayers' Arms Station—I did so, and he came to my office with me—there was no one there then—he said "This is just the place for business; we ought to make our fortunes quick"—I said "Do you think so? you had better come down with me and go across tile station"—he did so—we came out again, and I said "Does any one know you in the place?"—he said "I dare say they do, but I should not come in to fetch the goods myself, I shall have them carted"—I said "Who is going to cart them?"—he said "I shall find some one to cart them"—he then left—when in the office I showed him an order of the Messagerie Parisienne, and he said "That is all I want to know, only let me know what goods are in, and I will have them fetched"—I did not know Foster at this time; I first saw him on 28th June in Goldsmith Row, Hackney—on Sunday, the 27th, Josephs came to my house at dinner-time—I was then living at 27 Darwin Street, Old Kent Road—he said "Will you go up to Hackney? I have got the man who will do the lifting job"—I said "Who is he?"—he said "He lives at Hackney; will you hate a ran over now?"—I said "No, I am just going to have dinner; but I will meet you to-morrow night," which I did, at the bottom of Bermondsey New Road, outside the King's Arms, at 6 o'clock—I had to wait three quarters of an hour—I then saw Josephs and two other men, who I did not know—I never saw them before or since—we went into the King's Arms and had a little refreshment—I could not say who paid for it; I know it cost me a shilling or two: then Josephs and I got on a 'bus and went out just opposite the workhouse in Kingsland Road, and then took a short street or two into Goldsmith Row, where we saw Foster standing on a costermonger's barrow—Josephs introduced Foster to D M as "A <hi rend="italic">pal</hi> of mine"—Foster said to me "What is your name?"—I said "Thompson," but they knew different, for in about fire minutes after Josephs called me Brown—Josephs said he had promised to meet Foster there to come down, and he would be the one to cart the goods out—Foster said "You will see me do the job"—he said "Do you remember that van of furniture being <hi rend="italic">sneaked</hi> from the Great Eastern? I said "Yes, I think I remember something about it;" he said "I am the man that did it;" I laughed, and said, "Oh!"—I did not think it was true—Foster said "I dare say you will be able to lift a case"—we then parted,</p>

               <p>with a promise to meet at 9 next morning, at the Apollo, in East Street, Walworth—I did not go there—about 10 o'clock Foster came to my office and Said "What about my case?" I said "i am too buisy now, I will see you at the Apollo at 12 o'clock"—I went there at I, and saw Foster and Josephs there—I took with me an old order of the Messagerie Parislenne, and I tore it up into about four pieces in their presence—I did that with the object of checking the forgery—I said "Can you get that reprinted?" Joseph said "Yes, I can do so, and I will let you have it; meet me here at 8 this evening, and I will let you see some blank forms"—I said there would be a case marked pb—I said that for want of something better to say—I did not see Josephs in the evening; I only saw Foster; he stood on the step of the Apollo public-house—I said "Where is Josephs; he said "He has not turned up"—I said "I must have that old order back;" he said "We had better go to Josephs's house," which we did in East Street, Walworth; it was a marine store shop, with the name of "Jackson" up—I had never seen the shop before—Foster went in, I waited outside—he came back and said "Josephs is not there, we must do it by ourselves," I said "I shan't have anything to do with it"—I know Holmes, we had been in the same service at Carter paterson's in Goawell Road—I remember an occasion when Holmes walked into my office—I should say that was two or three weeks after the visit to Jacson's shop—in the interval I only saw Josephs once, that was at his house in the Old Kent Road—I don't know the number, it was a fruiterer's shop—he told me he lived there, and that he was going by the name of Jackson—he told me that when he first came to my office, he had moved out of Standard Street, and he told me his new address—he had only got apartment there—I went there to get the order back—it was on 16th July, about 9.30 in the morning, that I was at my office when Holmes came in, and whilst he was there Foster came in; he said "What about my case," I said "It has not yet arrived, but as soon as it does arrive I will advise you of it"—he had a good look at Holmes sad went out—Holmes came in again to see me, and we sent out together about I 0'clock to the Kent Tap, kept by Mr. Stanford, and the prisoners came in as we were coming out; they made some remark which I could not catch—I walked with Holmes pretty quick, and had some con<lb/>versation with him, and we went to my lodging in Darwin Street, and when we came out met the prisoners, and we all four went into the Globe public-house—Foster was going to fight me—he said "We have had a horse and cart waiting for two or three hours, and it is all to come to nothing," I said "I shall not be intimidated, and if you are going to carry on like that I shall give you into custody," he said "Do you want your brains knocked out," I said "If it is fisticuffs you want you can have it, but I am not going to be intimidated by you"—he swore and used filthy language—we went into the public-house for decency's sake—when we came out I called Holmes Joe; Foster turned upon me and wanted to know who the hell Joe was; I said "Don't say anything to him, he is a friend of mine"—Foster turned upon Holmes and said "What do you know about the case?" Holmes said "As much as you"—they got into conversation then—I did not hear it—they stood on one side of the road, and Josephs and I went on the other side—we then went to the Brewery Tap at the corner of Page's walk—Josephs and I went in—Foster and Holmes stood on the other side still in conversation—in the Tap Josephs said to me "We hope to have 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>each at the bank Holiday, and I am only too glad to think we shall have it in time for the bank holiday"—next day I saw Holmes in my office—we had some conversation—Foster came ion while Holmes was there, and said "What about my case?" I said "I will let you know about it Shortly"—he then left, and that same afternoon, saturday the 16th, about 2 o'clock I went to the police-station with Holmes, and saw sergeant kimber—I made a statement to him in Holmes's presence—on Sunday the 18th, Mr. Major, one of our out-door superintendents, came to me and I went that night to the office of our-door superintendent, and made a statement to him; and from that time I acted under the instructions, and with the Knowledge, of both Mr. Wallis and Kimber—I next saw Josephs on the Wednesday night following at his house in the old Kent Road—Holmes had made the appointment—his wife was present—he said "I hope you are coming to business now"—I took out of my pocket this advice note of the Messagerie, dated July 21, of the arrival of a case from paris, marked R. W., 18337, 123 kilometres, which I explained to him was equal to 246lb. in weight—he said "Well it, it will be be worth lifting—he had before this shown me some blank order forms, which be said he had got printed; that was in East Street—they were similar to the torn order, and he said "Is ther any silk in now?—I said "Yes P.B.," such a number—that was what I had put on the blank form, and then tore up—upon that there was the signature of W. Butler, a person in the employment of the Messagerie Parisienne—the four pieces were put together again on a sheet of paper, and given back to me, and was torn up by me finally—both foster and Josephs said that it was a very awkward signature to forge—I don't know who was to write it; it was on wednesday night that I showed it to them—we then went to meet Holmes at the Thomas a Becket at 9 o'clock—I saw Josephs there, and appointed to meet in Bermondsey Square nest morning at 8 o'clock—I saw him there with Holmes—Josesphs had given Holmes some blank forms of the Messagerie—Josephs said "I must get away to get my horse and cart ready"—Josephs said to Holmes "you fill up one of the blank forms with the No. R. W., 18337 and sign W. Butler's name"—he said he would go and get his horse and cart ready, and meet us in Mason street at 10 o'clock—I saw him there at 10 o'clock with Holmes; he had not got the horse and cart—he said "Here is a nice nuisance, Foster not turned up"—Holmes said "Take a cab"—I said "Telegraph"—Josephs said he had only got enough in his pocket for a 'bus—I proposed going to the station to get him some money—he said "No", and jumped on a passing 'bus, and went to Hackeny to fetch Foster—at 11.30 the same morning I saw foster and Josephs opposite the Prince consort in the New Kent Road with a young man who I never saw before or since; they had a horse and cart; Foster was just getting out of the cart when I arrived there—we went in to have a drink; Foster said "This is a caution"—I said "Yes, you nearly lost the case"—he said he had mistaken the date—I then told them to drive down to Holmes in the old Kent Road, which he did; I walked behind—I saw foster, Josephs, and Holmes together in the Old Kent Road—they had got out of the cart, and all stood on the footpath—foster said to Josephs "Have you the order"—Josephs said" No, Joe has got it"—Holmes pulled it out of his pocket and showed it them—Foster said it was a d—bad signature—this is the document marked A—I said "you must not come in before 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour"—I then went into the station—I was</p>

               <p>on the platform when Foster drove in with the horse and cart—I said to him "Are you on business?"—he said "Yes, air" as if he was a stranger to me—the foreman proter said "You will have to go to Inquiry officer"—I said "I will show you the way"—I did so, and I saw him give the order in to Mr. Hodson, who endorsed it "Clausen. R.H"—Clanusen was the delivery man—he gave it to Foster—I showed him the way back—he got gate-pass from Mr. Hodson-Foster them went and took hold of a sack-barrow on the platform, and ran it up to the case R. W., 18337—Harris, one of the porters, pointed it out to him, and he ran it into his cart, which was backed up to the platform—he put it on one corner: it was too much for one, and I just gave him a lift—he them drove off with it—I got behind some trucks, and ran out of the station to see it them were going to take it into Paragon Mews, becomes Josephs had told me the night before that they had taken a stable there to break open the case, and put the silk in secks, and cart it away—I did not see the cart again, and I returned to the station—I did not see the prisoners again till they were in custody.</p>

               <p>was at the Great Eastern Railway, Goodman's Yard—I first saw the prisoners on friday, 16th Huly last—I saw foster first in the Bricklayer's Arms station, in an office on the company's premises; he came in while I was there speaking to Brown; I had been there about half an hour—I have known Brown four or five years—When foster came in he said "Have my goods arrived?" Brown said "No, I have had no advice of them"—foster said "Is it any use my calling later in the afternoon?" Brown replied "No, I will advise you immediately on their arrival"—he said "if don't get them this afternoon, I shall lose the sale of them"—he then withdrew—I stayed with Brown about 20 minutes afterwards, we left together—during his dinner hour we went to the public-house kept by Mr. Standford, I don't know the name of it—Brown made a communication to me directly after Foster left—as we were leaving the public-house we met foster and Josephs on the threshold—foster made some remark that I did not catch, and I don't know that Brown replied to it—nothing further passed—me and Brown went for a walk some little distance, and on our return we met Josephs and foster in Darwin street—foster began to abuse Brown, and said that he had not fulfilled his promise to him—I can't give the exact words, because at that time I was not paying any particular attention to them; he was complaining that Brown did not deliver a case of silk to him marked P B, and he used very abusive language to Brown, and swore and threatened him with personal violence—after that Brown and him reconciled the affair, and we all went into a public-house in Darwin street together and had some bitter ale—foster engaged Brown in conversation, and at the same time Josephs began to complain to me, saying that Brown had made a fool of him, that he had a horse and cart waiting there all the previous day, thursday, and on Friday he had it there half a day, and that it had cost him a couple of sovereigns, and then it had come to nothing in the finish—Brown left us then to resume his duty, and I and Josephs and foster went into the castle public-house in Old Kent Road—foster then asked me who and what I was—I told him that I was a railway man, but was not employed at that time—he then suggested that I should try to obtain a situation on the London and North Western Railway, and he would try his best to get on the bank, and that if the affair was successfully managed we should do a very good business—Josephs was present at the time, and he said if the affair was successfully managed, by christmas we should have from 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was all that passed—on that same friday afternoon, in Darwin street, foster showed me a portion of an order, the bottom part of it bearing the signature of W. Butler, and he asked if I could imitate that signature for the delivery order—I said it was a very peculiar one, but I had no doubt I should be able to do it—we arranged to meet next morning at 9 o'clock, at the surrey Arms—I did not keep that appointment—I turned up at 12 o'clock—I met foster and Joseph standing outside the castle public-house against the horse-tough—I asked them if they had been able to do any business—they said "No, you go and see Brown"—I went and saw Brown, and asked him if he was in any way implicated with these men; he said "No, certainly not"—I then returned to the prisoners and told them it was too late that day to do anything and Josephs said "It is too late for to-day, we must leave it till monday"—I then went back to Brown and advised him to communicate with the police, and on saturday we went to the police-Station</p>

               <p>in Bermondsey street—I nest saw the prisoners on Monday morning accidentally, between 9 and 10 near the Bricklayers' Arms station, and they again asked me to go and and see Brown, Which I did and I had scarcely got into the office before Foster walked in and asked brown if he had any Further orders—Brown said "Joe knows all about it, and he will meet you on the Greyhound bridge in 20 minutes"—I went to the Greyhound bridge and met the Prisoners there together—we walked for some little distance, and Josephs said that Brown was funking—I said "Well I think I shall turn up the business"—after that they asked me where I should be able to see them again—I said I had been too often about the station, and I would not go there again—we then arranged to meet at the Thomas a Becket in the old Kent Road next wednesday evening at 9 o'clock—I went there with sergeant Kimber—I met Josephs and Brown standing outside—Kimber was waiting outside—me and Brown and Josephs went into the house and had some beer—we arranged to meet next morning at 8 o'clock in Bermondsey square—I saw an advice note—Brown communicated to Josephs the number of the case—it was 18337 or 18537 RM—Brown made some rather sharp remarks to me because I had detained them a little while, and Josephs said "He is not so very late"—I went to Bermondsey street on the Thursday morning—I was two or three minutes behind time—Josephs was there—I asked him if Brown and foster had arrived—he said no, he had not seen Brown, and he did not expect foster until the first' bus, about 8.40, and that he had left orders, at home for foster to wait there until he came—Brown was rather late, and Josephs asked me to go to his house and bring him along—I went, and met Brown at the corner of Bermondsey New Road and we went back together to where Josephs was standing—Brown asked Josephs if he had got any orders—Josephs then produced three blank forms, and said "You must allow me a little time to get the cart ready"—We went into the sampson's Castle in Greenwich Road—we arranged to meet at 10 o'clock in Mason Street, Old Kent Road, opposite the Bricklayer's Arms station—Josephs gave me this form (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and told me how to fill it up, and I filled it up in the Bricklayers' Arms station—he gave me three; one I spoiled in copying, on the other I wrote the name—I believe the third one was destroyed—when I got to Mason Street Josephs was there—he said "what a nuisance it is that Foster has not turned up"—Brown suggested that he should telegraph to him—I suggested that he should take a cab—he said he had not sufficient money—just then an omnibus was passing, and he jumped on it and went away—he said he would be back in an hour and a half—I had not seen any horse and cart up to that time—I waited about in the Kent Road for some time, and Foster and Josephs drove up in a light cart—Foster was driving—they got out, and Josephs asked me if I had got the order—I put it into Foster's hands—he examined it very carefully, and said "it is a d——d bad copy"—Josephs said no, he thought it was a very good one I said it would be passed immediately, as it was not the writing they studied so much as the form—Foster then took the order, got into the cart, and drove into the station, which was only 50 or 100 yards off—Josephs and I waited about a little while—he then said "We must have some money," and he went into his house in the Kent Road and brought out a florin—Foster was to drive out at the further gate, and we had to be on the look-out for him—we had just got there when Foster drove out—there was a case in the cart—just at that moment Josephs drew my attention to a man</p>

               <p>who walked out of the principal gate of the station with a sack on his head; his head was covered with the sack—Foster said "Who is that fellow there?" I said "I suppose it is some costermonger coming out of the gate"—Josephs continued to watch him very attentively for a little while up the Kent Road, and after that he walked up to Foster and directed him to drive to a public-house behind Horsemonger Lane Gaol; he said he believed we were being watched—he kept a strict watch on the man with a sack till we came to a hoarding, where the man concealed himself—we then walked along the Kent Road, and took a side street and walked up to where Foster was waiting with the horse and cart, and saw no more of the man; it was Ser<lb/>geant Kimber—we all got into the cart, and drove away over London Bridge to a public-house in President Street, Central Street, St. Luke's—Foster said he had a brother or a brother-in-law who had a stable there, and that we would take it in there—Josephs and I waited some time while Foster was away—he returned, and said his brother was away and had the key of the stable with him—so we drove to Hoxton by a very circuitous route; when we had gone some distance Josephs called Foster's attention to a cab that was following us—Foster said he did not believe it was any one for us, but as the cab continued to follow us he put his horse into a gallop, and we went by several streets till we lost sight of the cab—at last we got to Gold<lb/>smith's Row, Hackney, and pulled up at a public-house at the corner of the street—Josephs instructed me to wait there till they were ready for me—I got cut, and they drove about 20 yards farther to a second-hand clothes shop—they there took the case out of the cart, and carried it inside between them—when they came out I joined them, and we all got into the cart and drove to a little by-street, I think no thoroughfare—we left the pony and trap there for a woman to mind, and walked back to Goldsmith's Row after having some beer at a public-house—when we were nearing Foster's house, where the case was left, he told me to go and look in at the window and ask the price of a pair of old boots or something—I went and examined the stock and vent inside, and behind a little partition there was the case—while there I wrote a telegram on a slip of paper to Inspector Fox—I had scarcely finished it when the two prisoners entered—Josephs began to knock open the case with a little hatchet or chopper—Foster took it from him, and very soon opened the case—they unpacked the things, and I kept the tally—they were rather disappointed with the contents—Foster said it was only satin, when he expected silk—there were 18 parcels altogether, 35 pieces—after they had inspected it they took a sample from one of the pieces—I came outside—I said "The place stinks so abominably I must have a little fresh air"—I gave my telegram to a constable—I then went into the shop again, and we all walked back to the cart and got in and drove to Cherry Tree Court, Aldersgate Street—we all got out, and Foster stood by the horse's head, and Josephs went to a place with the satin—I went with him to the entrance of Cherry Tree Court; he said I could not be admitted, as they would only recog<lb/>nise him—I waited in Aldersgate Street—he came back, and said "How much would it come to at 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard?"I reckoned it up at 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—he said if he could take his price he had to be there next day at 12; he said he was not satisfied, and he would try another place—heathen went to 7, Castle Street; he came out, and said the man could not do with it—he had left a sample with the first man he went to see, and said he had drawn</p>

               <p>a sovereign on it—we then drove over the water to a little street where Josephs had a stable; I think it was St. David Street—he there unyoked the horse, left the cart there, and changed the harness to a commoner one, and took the horse to a greengrocer's shop in the Kent Road—I left the prisoners in the Surrey Arms to go and look for Brown—I met Inspector Kennett and two or three other policemen, and told them where to find the prisoners, and they were apprehended—from the time I went to Sergeant Kimber on the Saturday I acted directly under the instructions of the police and the railway authorities.</p>

Carter Paterson's, of 128, Goswell Road—I was at Webb and Poulter's a year and ten months—I left last October for neglect of duty—I went away the day previous leaving my work incomplete; nothing else—I went from Carter Paterson and Co. to Mr. Fricker again—I was twice in his employ—it was after that I went to Webb and Poulter's—I was not discharged from Webb and Poulter's for embezzlement—I will swear it—I was deficient in my accounts by 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but that was in the shape of a debt—part of that was borrowed money, part discrepancies and miscalculations, and part of it something else—Carter Paterson did not send a form to Webb and Poulter to fill up as to my character—they never asked for one—Webb and Poulter did not refuse to give me a character to my knowledge; they gave me one; Mr. Christopher Poulter forwarded it to me by post—it was not in answer to an application—I was with Carter Paterson before I went to Webb and</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical practitioner, of 84, Great Dover Street—about 11.30 on this Saturday night I went to the prisoner's room, and saw the deceased—she was quite dead—she had a stab in her chest—the knife had entered betwen the second and third ribs, diverging a little to the right side—it was a very small would—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and found that the large vein which leads the bloods back to the heart was wounded, though not severed—the would was 2 or 2 1/2 inches deep—it might have been inflicted with a knife of this description—I tried the large blade to the would, and it went easilu throught—the cause of death was haemorrhage into the pericardial cavity: not extensice, but the blood pressing upon the heart prevented its action—a pretty fair amount of force must have been used to send the knife in to that depth—I saw the prisoner in the room—he was very excited, but if he had been drinking, such a thing would sober him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was just a trace of blood on the large blade at the point—I did not submit it to microscopic examination—I should call the small blade rusty—rust may come from blood, as well as from water—in passing a knife through the tissues you are very likely to wipe it clean—very little blood would flow, because there are a good many tissues to go throught, and the blood was very deeply down—I think the wound was made by one stroke—the small blade is too blunt to make a wound like that—I did not try whether it would go in.</p>

               <p>I knew he ought to have had a larger stock than he had—he said he had not—a few days after, the 6th March, I was in the act of crossing Black<lb/>friars Bridge when I saw a van going along which I recognised as the defendant's—it was full of baskets, and I stopped it and took possession of it, and sold the goods—after that I received some information, and made inquiries in the neighbourhood of Wands worth—I applied to the Bankruptcy Court to examine the debtor, and got an appointment for a private sitting, and he was examined on the 18th March, when I was present—in consequence of that I went with Potter to Garret Lane, Wands worth, where I saw Mrs. Steele, and had a long conversation with her—her husband came in; I had some conversation with him, and the result of it was that I went to the back premises, were they showed me a lot of cane baskets worth about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had them taken away the next day—the defendant had never up to that day made any allusion to any of those goods, and they are not included in the inventory made by me.</p>

I am a seaman and was living at 10, Staniforth Road, Battersea, with my wife, on the 9th August—our room was upstairs—the prisoner and his wife lived below—about 6 p.m. I heard some screaming downstairs and then I heard the front door bang to—I opened my window and saw the prisoner leave the house—he said "I have killed my wife and I am going to fetch a doctor"—I then rushed downstairs and opened the kitchen door—I saw the prisoner's wife standing in a corner of the room—she said something to me and then went to a corner of the room, picked up her baby, which was lying on the floor, and gave it to my wife—I lifted her up and put her down at the foot of the stairs—she kept saying she was dying—she then slipped off the stairs in an unconscious state—the doctor came, and about ten minutes after the arrival of a second doctor she died—the prisoner came back with the doctor—the woman had been drinking a little—I had seen her standing at the front door with her baby in her arms before I heard the screams, and she seemed all right then—the prisoner had not come home at that time—I took her to be about 32 years of age—when the prisoner came back with the doctor he said that he had kicked her, and that he supposed he had done it with the toe of his boot—he said he would own to it if he got transported and sent out of the country—before I heard the screams I heard him using very foul language to her—I heard her talking, but I could not hear what she said.</p>
