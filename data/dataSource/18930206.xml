Just before two on 22nd January I was standing in Rosamond Street—I heard a noise, and ran across the road to Waterloo Place, and met Began coming out of Waterloo Place—I caught hold of him, and said, "What are you doing down there?"—; he said, "Oh! it is all right, governor; I only went down to make water"—then Cosgood came over a hoarding about nine feet high at the bottom of Waterloo Place, and walked straight up to me—Began said, "You are not going to leave me like this, are you? There are two of us"—I made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at Cosgood, but he escaped me—I blew my whistle, and took Began to the station—I afterwards went back and searched, and discovered that the prosecutor's closet window had been opened, and that someone had got through there; and the pot-house door was open, and had been forced—I went round to the front of the house and</p>

In consequence of the description given me by Zenthon about ten o'clock, I apprehended Cosgood in Middleton Street, Clerkenwell, about two the same day—he gave the address 8, Whitecross Street; he did not live there—I told him I should arrest him for being concerned with another man in breaking into a public-house in Clerkenwell Close that morning—he said, "No, sir, you have got the right one"—I took him to the station, where he was placed with five others—Zenthon at once identified him—I found one shilling, two sixpences, and a latch door-key on him—he made no answer to the charge.</p>

               <p>I left him with a constable, and went to Lambeth Walk, where I saw William Stelling—at first he denied all knowledge of this—I told him his brother had made an admission that they were both concerned, and he would have to go to the Police-office, and make an explanation—on the way, in a cab, he expressed his anxiety to make some explanation—I said I would give him every opportunity to explain at the Police-office, but it would be used against him—this is the statement be made—I wrote it down in his presence—(<hi rend="italic">This was put in and read, in which he admitted getting the money and giving his brother £21, and keeping the rest of the</hi>£51).</p>

                  </hi>, I am a clerk in the Bankruptcy Department of the High Court of Justice—I produce the file in the bankruptcy of John Brydon—on 6th June, 1891, a petition was lodged against the prisoner by Oswald Eysoldt—it refers to a judgment of 3rd June—on 2nd July a receiving order was made against the prisoner; he was adjudicated bankrupt on 4th July—his public examination was on 12th August, 1891—on 3rd August, just before the examination, Alfred Henry Collins was certified as trustee—the notes of the public examination appear on the file as having been signed by the prisoner—in the statement of affairs the total liabilities are £3,903 2s. 9d., and the assets, after deducting preferential claims for rates, taxes, rent, and so forth, are £525 13s.—E. Thompson is a creditor for £334 17s. 9d., and Diamond stein a partially-secured creditor for £348 10s. 9d.—in the deficiencies account I find the excess of liabilities over assets on 7th July is stated at £1,208 8s. 8d.—the total deficiency at the time of this bankruptcy amounts to £3,377 9s. 9d.—the statement of affairs was filed on 18th July—I see in the statement no specific mention of twenty-two skunk capes and forty skunk skins—I see on the file notes of the bankrupt's private examination, a private sitting on 5th July, 1892—there is the report of the Official Receiver and the order of Mr. Registrar Giffard for the prosecution on 2nd August, 1892, on the file.</p>

                  </hi>, I live at 46, Albion Road, Stoke Newington—from February to May inclusive, 1891, I was a partner in Lynx and Co., furriers and skin merchants, 175, Aldersgate Street—on 15th February, 1891, the prisoner came to our warehouse and saw me, and said he could do with some marten tails; he said he had got a big order from Glasgow for stow-marten tails, and he must have fine tails—I showed him some at 70s. and 80s. per timber of tails—a timber is a bundle of forty—he said he could do with them, and asked the price—I told him—he wanted about twenty timbers, I believe—he said he wanted to buy them, and asked my terms—I said, "Well, if your references are right, and you are a respectable man, my terms are four, five, six, and nine months"—he mentioned the name of Thompson as a person he had dealt with, and he said he was doing business with Apfel Brothers, and I believe Messrs. Eysoldt and Co.—he showed me his bank book, which he always had in his pocket, and said he was paying a lot of money to these people—I looked at it, but what could I see?—he said he could have references from the people he had mentioned, but he would be much pleased if I would not take a reference, as he did not want to let them know—next day he came again, and said he must have these tails; he looked at them again, and said he could do with them; he said he would have them—he also looked at beaver skins, and chose nineteen, which came to £49 17s. 6d.—he had twenty timbers of the stow-marten tails, which came to £78—he arranged to give five and six months' bills, and he gave me a bill for £76 at five months, and another for £51 17s. 6d. at six months, and I delivered the goods on 17th February—no complaint was made about the goods—on 9th April he came again, and said he had orders for some bear goods for Scotland—he went through the whole of my five floors, and chose some minx, brown, black, and grizzly bear and sable, specified on the invoice, coming to £195 15s. 6d.—part of that order was five and a-half beavers, coming, at 45s. a piece,</p>

               <p>to £12 7s. 6d.—after he had selected those goods I said, "Mr. Brydon, that is rather a big order, but if you will be good enough to come into my private office I will talk to you"—I said, "It is a heavy amount; you already owe me about £120; I must know something more about you"—he took out his bank-book, and showed it to me, and told me he was worth 40s. in the pound; that he was a very honest man, and always paid his bills when due; that he was doing from £15,000 to £20,000 of business a year—I cannot say the exact sum; but he had done a big, an enormous trade—I saw in the bankbook there was about £4,000 of returns in a short time—I said, "If that is so I give you these goods again at your terms"—he then signed one acceptance for £97 3s. 6d., due August 10th, and another for £98 12s., due September 12th, which would be at four and five months respectively—those goods were delivered the same day—on 5th May he came again, and wanted some more bear stuff and trimmings—I went round the warehouse with him, and he picked out about £12 worth of goods—I was getting frightened, but thought I would chance it—then he wanted a lot more stuff; I thought he would buy the whole warehouse—I showed him an article worth about 20s., not in his way at all, and said, "Can you do with this?"—he said, "What is the price?"—I said, "75s."—he said, "I can do" with twenty or thirty of them"—I said, "No; I have sold you enough," and I did not sell him any more—I would not go back from my word, and I let him have the £12 worth—he said he would pay that in cash; that he would send me a cheque for it; but I never saw it—about June he came and said, "Can you do me a favour?"—I said, "What is it?"—he said, "My dear friend" (he always called me "My dear friend"), "you know I am an honest man; could you lend me £20, or change me a cheque, as I have got a bill to meet, and I'm short? The money did not arrive from Glasgow"—I said, "With the greatest pleasure"—he gave me his cheque, and I gave him my open cheque for it—my cheque was paid, his was not—his was on the London Trading Bank, and was returned marked "not sufficient" or "return to drawer," or something like that—the day after that I went to him at Kingsland Eoad—I said, "Well, Mr. Brydon, what is the meaning of this? This cheque is returned"—he said, "My dear friend, I cannot help it; I cannot pay"—I said, "How was it you told me a month ago you were worth 40s. in the pound, when you take my nice good stuff, and to-day you cannot pay anything?"—I was a bit faint, and he gave me a drop of whisky—I said he was no good, and I said, "Man alive, pay me my £20 that I gave you ready cash; you robbed me of my goods, and you will rob me of my credit too; pay me the £20, and I will give you a receipt for the whole lot, so that you will not owe me anything"—he refused in a cruel way to give me my £20—he said he would (using a" very strong expression) before he would part with a penny—next day I sent him a writ for the £20—that was recovered under a judgment—the solicitor got it, I never saw it—the five and a-half beavers I sold in April I saw at Mr. Eysoldt's about a month before the bankruptcy, and I recognised them as mine—after the bankruptcy I purchased them back from Eysoldt with some other goods—I saw the bear skins which I sold in April at Thompson's before the bankruptcy, and after I parted with the £20; it might be the day after—I cannot say if it was before or</p>

               <p>after—I wanted to help the man if I could, and as he had given me his cheque in exchange we could have taken him up for obtaining money under false pretences if he did not pay—the goods I saw at Thompson's, and which I recognised as mine, were worth between £140 and £150—I saw Blaustein, Thompson's manager, with reference to them, and also Thompson, who is not a skin merchant; he buys these things from people—I should describe him as buying stolen property—he called himself a skin merchant—Thompson sent the prisoner to me to buy the stuff, and the next week he had it from him at half-price—when I parted with the two lots of goods I believed what the prisoner told me, and I believed he was thoroughly solvent; I would have given him at that time another £100; he looked a respectable man—I was made bankrupt on 17th September this year; I can pay 17s. in the pound; I have already paid 12s. 9d.—I cannot get my discharge till the whole estate is wound up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My discharge was suspended for two years, as the estate was not realised—in 1883 when I traded under the name of Alexander and Co. I was in liquidation—previous to that I paid a composition of 15s., and then I paid 3s. 4d.—I spent ten years from that time, and turned over half a million, and paid all my bills until I came under such hands as the prisoner's—I had two fires in 1885 and 1886—I am not a member of the committee of inspection of the prisoner's bankruptcy—in June, 1892, the Bankruptcy Court sent for me, and asked me to make an affidavit, and I made it—until then I had only spoken of the facts I have spoken to to-day to the official in the Bankruptcy Court—I had shown an invoice—the prisoner told me he was doing a very large trade—I said in my affidavit that he told me he was doing £2,000 or £3,000 a month—I may have said in the affidavit that he told me he was worth 25s. in the pound, but he said he was worth 40s. in the pound—I drew it mild; I have never seen the affidavit since I made it; the gentleman may have put down 25s., but I said the prisoner said he was worth up to 40s. in the pound—I offered him goods not worth a quarter of what I asked, to try him whether he knew what he was buying—he knows the fur business very well, he has been fourteen years in it; he goes to sales himself—I believe he asked me to see the London Trading Bank, with whom he dealt; they gave me no answer—I inquired through my bank—the goods were really delivered before that—I am not sure if I should not have let him have the goods if the reference through the bank had been unsatisfactory; I only asked my bank if they would take the bills—if the reference through the bank had been unsatisfactory, I should not have let him have the goods, but the last bill they would not take, and then I knew something was wrong—as to the £12, if a man owes me £100 I could not refuse him £12 worth of goods; a man must not be discouraged, and although I would not give him another £100 I would give him £12—I recognised the beavers at Eysoldt's by my private mark—the Alderman asked how I knew they were mine, and I said by my mark, and then the prisoner said, "I got them from him"—I recognised them at once as my goods by my private mark, my stamp, like needles through them—I sold no beavers then to anyone but the prisoner—we are wholesale manufacturers—Eysoldt said he got them from the prisoner, and then I said, "They are my skins"—I only sold beaver skins to the prisoner—I don't</p>

               <p>recollect selling them to anyone else—I don't know whether they are the bearer skins I sold in April or in February—I believe Eysoldt was a creditor in my bankruptcy for £1,000, and he had 12s. 9d. in the pound—I had these goods on credit—I owed him about £40,000, and paid him—when the prisoner made the representations to me I daresay someone else was there; very likely my clerk was; Mr. McCullock, my manager, was present, I should say, and another man might have been there too, but he is not here—Thompson has only been established about nine months, and he only did this kind of business—skin merchants very seldom buy beaver skins; they buy from furriers, except the lots from sales—the prisoner is not a skin merchant—it is very unusual for furriers to sell skins to skin merchants; it is like a man with coals selling them to a mine—it is very unusual for a man like the prisoner to deposit skins with a man like Thompson; no respectable firm would do it—I don't know that I have expressed the contrary opinion—I say it is very unusual to deposit or to sell—in June the prisoner's debt to me was about £400—after what he told me I would not have taken 19s. in the pound from him; I made no settlement with him; I said, "Give me my £20 back that I changed for your cheque, and I will make you a present of the lot"—I would have made him a present of the goods he had robbed me of if he had given me my £20—I issued the writ for £20; my solicitor got it.</p>

                  </hi>, I am a manufacturing furrier, at 11, Edmund's Place, Aldersgate Street—about 23rd March, 1891, the prisoner called and said he had orders from Scotland, where he had done very well the previous journey, and he. could do with some more goods—I had had a previous transaction with him, for which he then owed me £65 8s.—I went and had some conversation with my book-keeper, and then I called the prisoner into my office and told him he owed me £65 on the previous transaction, which did not go so high, and unless he could tell me about his standing I should not think of going on any higher—he put his hands up and said, "I am quite surprised at your asking me such a question; I am an honest man"; and he said he had stock, book debts, and so on, and that he was worth about 40s. in the pound—he said he had a good connection in Scotland, and was well known, and on the previous occasion he said that if he had shown the same goods as I had he would have made a better profit than I could, being a native and well known—I believed what he said, and on the faith of his statements let him have the goods—this is the invoice, dated 24th March, 1891, 123 bears and opossums, £71 6s. 6d.; with the previous items of £65 it makes £130 altogether he gave me this bill for £130 at four months, drawn on April 8th, and due on August 11th, 1891—it has never been paid—on 6th May he came again, and said he had done good business in Scotland, and he wanted more goods to fulfil some orders—he then selected some bear victorias and bear trimming to the amount of £72 18s. 6d.; one item was left by mistake, and credit was given to him for that, so that it came to £67 3s. 6d.—he gave me two bills; one of his own for £44 17s. 6d., and one drawn by him, and accepted by Stehr, for £22 6s.—Stehr's bill was met, but the prisoner's was not; it was marked by the bank, "Not provided for"—on 6th June the prisoner came, and said he had taken up two or three acceptances that week, and was short of money term<lb/>porarily,</p>

               <p>£15 from Thompson—I could not say whether I saw the whole lot of the skins I had parted with at Thompson's, but it was a decent quantity of them; over two hundred I could see, a pile of skins—I had a conversation with Blaustein with reference to the racoons—I left the warehouse rather hurriedly on that occasion—that was the last transaction I had with the prisoner—all I have been paid for the goods I sold is the £8 and the £15 from Thompson.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not receive a letter from the prisoner while he was at Glasgow asking me not to present the cheque—he did not come to my place on his return; the £17 found its way to me, and I returned it to Thompson—when I went to the prisoner with the returned cheque he said, "You are a fine young fellow; you have sold my cheque for less money"—I was greatly surprised that he knew all about it—he said, "That there may not be any ill-feeling, there is your £17"—I made an arrangement with Thompson that if I received the £17 I should give it to him—when I went with the cheque to Thompson he said, "Don't worry yourself; it will be all right"—I said, "What do you mean that I shall be all right? I am in for £100 through your recommendation"—he said, "To show you it is all right, I will give you £15 for that £17 cheque on the condition that if Mr. Brydon is respectable, and he gives you the. £17 back again, you give it to me, and I shall make £2 profit"—I was glad to get the £15, and when the prisoner afterwards gave me £17 I handed it to Thompson—I have not seen Thompson about the Court; I have not seen him since the last transaction—the prisoner did not complain about the quality of the sealskin jackets, nor did he offer them back to me for £20; he offered them back, and I went to Goldberg and Langdon, my solicitors, and they advised me not to take them back—I had had the racoon skins for a good time in my possession—I had beaten them every Monday morning so that the moth should not get into them, and as I had handled them so many times I could tell almost every skin—I had had them eighteen months or two years—we keep furs sometimes for five years—Thompson's warehouse is as big as an ordinary room; these skins I saw there underneath the bench; I could see they were mine—I recognised them myself; neither Blaustein nor Thompson pointed them out to me—I said to Blaustein and Thompson, when I saw them, that they were my skins; and I said, "It is a shame of you to come into my place, and see my goods, and take commission of me, and then receive my goods"—I was on the committee of inspection in the bankruptcy from the beginning; I don't think I attended the sittings regularly.</p>

I know you by sight, but I don't know your name"—he said his name was Brydon and gave me a card, and then he said, "I am very glad I met you; you have got such a nice selected stock, and I think I can do a large business with you"—I said, "What sort of goods do you require?"—he said, "I only buy the very best goods"—he saw a lot of bear goods at my place—he said, "They are very nice goods. I can do with them, and I could do with beaver and other sorts of goods. You can ask my reference of anyone in the City of London, any of the merchants. You can ask Mr. Eysoldt, or Apfel Brothers, of Aldermanbury"—he said he had done a lot of business with Diamonstein and Cooper, if I liked to inquire, and he had done a lot of business with a 'lot of manufacturers, Rubenssohn and different people—I said, "How do you do business? Do you pay cash?"—he said, "I tell you, my friend, I cannot pay you cash, because I have got a very large stock, but if you want to do business with me it must be the same as other people; it must be on bills"—after looking at the goods he went away, and came back next day, and said, "You can ask my references, and I will come back to-morrow morning at ten o'clock, and then I will select what goods I require "I said, "Very good; I will go and see about your references"—next morning he came back—meantime I went to Mr. Eysoldt—I made inquiries—next day the prisoner came back, and chose some bear victorias to the amount of £134 14s. 6d.—this is the invoice—I said, "What is the payment?"—he said, "Well, of course, it is the first transaction; and you don't know me; I am a very honest man, and I have been in business for fourteen years, and never dishonoured a cheque or bill all my life"—I said, "What terms do you require for the first transaction?"—he said, "It would be convenient for myself if you could oblige me, and let me have the goods on three or four months' bills"—I agreed to that, and he gave me two bills, one for £70 at three months, and the other for £64 17s. 6d. at four months—I sent the goods to his house—I have received nothing in payment of the £134 14s. 6d.—on 19th May I think it was the prisoner came, and said, "I feel very tired; I have just come back from a journey to Scotland, and my friends have done verys well with your goods. I have sold them at a. good profit"—he said he could sell my goods just the same as bread and cheese, and there were certain articles he had samples of which he could do more with—he said, "I am just going to the bank to pay these in to meet a bill;" and pulled out a bundle of bank notes which he said he had brought from Scotland—he said he was very tired, he would come up to-morrow—on the 20th he came again—I said, "We are only small people, and I am</p>

Don't be afraid"—I said, "I cannot afford to give you any more goods, because we are only small people, and we must pay cash ourselves, and we require cash You owe us now £134. Can you give me half cash?"—he said, "No; I cannot give you half cash, but I tell you what I will do, I will give you two short bills, one for one and one for two months, and when I come back from Scotland next journey, that will be in ten days, I will come back and redeem that one month bill"—I said, "As I believe you won't do me any, wrong, and as you say you are a very honest man, I have confidence in you. I say to you, keep your promise,"—he selected beaver and bear goods to the amount of £101 5s.; this is the invoice—I struck off the £1 5s. to make it the round sum of £100, and he drew these two bills, one at one and one at two months, for £50 each—the one at one month he was supposed to come back and redeem in ten days, and pay me cash for—upon his promise I allowed the goods to be taken away—I did not see the prisoner again till he was at the Bankruptcy Court—about ten days afterwards I heard that he was going wrong; that he had dishonoured a bill—I have received nothing for the £235 198. 6d. worth of goods which I sold—I heard of the meeting of creditors, and went to it—I afterwards cross-examined the prisoner at the Bankruptcy Court—I firmly believed he was an honest man when I parted with the goods.</p>

I could pay you cash. I have some money with me now, which I have to meet a bill on Saturday," and he took out about £150 in notes and showed me—he said he always paid his bills at the time—"My bills never come back"—when I would not give him the stuff so quickly he said, "I am worth 30s. in the pound to-day if I sell my goods"—he showed me a letter from a bank to which Lynx and Co. had inquired about him; and he said, "There is a letter which shows you that you can trust me"—the bank wrote to Lynx and Co., and said they could trust him something about £1,000; but I could not see the letter myself,</p>

               <p>my opinion, he owed me £200 or £300—the skins he deposited were some racoon, Persians, and beaver, I think—I lent him £25 on the deposit of the skins; they were odd lots; I sold them to Mr. Cevesse some weeks afterwards, on six months' terms, for £19, their proper value—Mr. Cevesse identified them as his goods—I was petitioning creditor in this bankruptcy—a bill of mine for £26 was dishonoured, and I placed it in the solicitor's hands, and he. issued a writ for fraudulent bankruptcy—the amount of my claim altogether was £280—I proved for that amount.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had dealings with the prisoner for a number of years—I always found him straightforward; he always met his engagements promptly until that bill—I did from £100 to £500 a year with him—I should not like to say the lending him £25 was not unusual; it happens sometimes with small people who want an advance—I should call the prisoner a small person decidedly; he was not doing a large business.</p>

                  </hi>, I am a chartered accountant—I was appointed trustee in the defendant's bankruptcy on 5th August, 1891—I received from Mr. Wreford, the senior Official Receiver, the bankrupt's books—the assets would pass into my hands for realisation part of the assets was some stock from the premises in Kingsland Road—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the stock lists that I received; they realised £160 11s.; out of that some preferential payments were made, rent and taxes, auctioneer's charges, and law costs; that left a balance of. £32 4s. 11d. to the credit of the estate—the bankrupt attended at my office from time to time—no disclosure was made to me of twenty-seven skunk capes and forty skunk skins in the possession of Mr. Zernich up to the 30th July—I first heard about it at the Police court.</p>

                  </hi>, I am Assistant Official Receiver—in that capacity I have investigated the affairs of the bankrupt, and made myself familiar, to a certain extent, with his books—after his public examination private inquiries were made by myself, and certain statements were taken from some of the witnesses—upon those statements an order for private sittings was made, and on that we obtained an order for the bankrupt's attendance, and the notes were taken by Mr. Edsall—turning to the pass-book, on this 24th May, 1891, the prisoner's account was overdrawn £27 3s. 11d.—a country cheque for £30 was paid in on the 26th—the difference would stand to his credit, less 1s. 8d.—a cheque for £6 was drawn on 23rd May—I have before me a book containing nothing but auction sales—it contains many thousands of lots; they were sold below cost price—he credits himself with the amounts, in his deficiency account, about £400 as a loss, as the difference between the cost price and the price obtained—in his private ledger on page two I find an entry of the sales to Mr. Eysoldt of five beaver skins for £10, under the date of April 12th; at page twenty-four there is an entry of a sale to Thompson of thirty-seven dozen rabbits at £20—on the 29th April there is an entry of the sale of twenty-six dozen rabbits for £7 16s.; the date before that is 14th April—on 12th May I find an entry of the sale of sixty-nine Persian skins to Thompson for £43 12s. 6d., and 263 racoons on the same day £38 9s., with a note Credited by bill due, £52 10s.; cheque. £25; total, £27 10s."—in the general ledger there is an entry of a sale to Mr. Zernich of twenty timbers of martens, £63—on 21st March I find an entry of nineteen beavers, £40—there is no entry of a sale to Mr. Mohlburg on 29th April of six timbers of martens and eighty-four skins—I find the name of Mohlburg in the index, but there is no account in the ledger—referring to Thompson's account I find a number of entries of goods sold, also entries of similar transactions with Blaustein, who is now a bankrupt—no information was given to me by the bankrupt of the goods in the possession of Zernich on 13th and 15th July—I should like to add that all the books and invoices produced were handed to me by the bankrupt.</p>

               <p>Australia had been unexpectedly lost—he said he started in the rug trade in the first instance, and I think he said that he had paid his way and saved £400, and on that he had launched out into the fur business about six years ago—it is all on the notes—in my opinion his books were very badly kept—they include the transactions of which I have spoken, but they did not enable me to state a single purchaser—it is usual in the fur trade to have season sales—I have had three prosecutions in fur cases, and have administered a furrier's estate before this—I am afraid that there are periodical sales by auction—I won't say it is usual in the trade; it is very usual with those that have come into my hands, and in every case there has been a prosecution at this Court—I say that £400 on a quarter's sale is a very heavy loss on goods sold at less than cost price; I cannot say what is the total amount of those sales—all the payments appearing in the bank-book were no doubt paid—I do not know what has taken place since—this book is marked No. 2; this does not contain entries of the monies received and paid since the close of his banking account; I do not see any record of it; there are only about eight accounts here with different persons—in the account marked "General" there is a list of items on the credit side, that extends over one page—I see an item here on June 6th, "Paid Zernich wages, £18 9s. 6d.—that receipt was handed to me by the bankrupt after these proceedings were commenced, after the private sitting—this book was handed over to the Official Receiver at the date of his appointment, which was on 2nd July—there is a schedule containing a list of property, in the form prescribed by the rules of the Court, and supplied to the bankrupt immediately after the receiving order was made—it requires particulars of all property belonging to the bankrupt—it is not adequately filled up by the prisoner; it only sets out the stock at 324, Kingsland Road—if there were skunk skins at Zernich's they ought to have been put down—assuming that forty skunk skins were at the debtor's place of business at the time this statement was made it would be an adequate description—the prisoner swore the statement of affairs on 18th July as on 2nd July—between 2nd and 18th July there was a preliminary examination—I am not aware that the prisoner gave a list of stock to me, or to my department—in this stock-list forty skunk skins were mentioned originally, and it was altered to thirty-nine; there were no skunk capes in that—Mr. Frederick Miller, the auctioneer employed by the Bankruptcy Department, made out the list—the debtor would attend to go over the stock with Miller, who would be instructed by the department to make the stock-list immediately after the 2nd July—within a few days probably of the receiving order, Miller made a report of the stock in hand—I, don't think the list is dated, but in the usual course it would be made within a few days—the summary £845 is of the preceding sheets, which give the details of the stock—it is the statement of Miller, and is presumably correct—the figures are the figures he thinks they would fetch; he would get his information from the bankrupt entirely as to what the goods had cost—the trustee sold the skins and other goods in the stock list, including the thirty-nine skins—the tender accepted was for £160; that was the gross realisation of the stock—the Official Receiver asked the principal people in the trade to attend and inspect the stock, and they reported it as worthless, and practically unsaleable—everything</p>

               <p>that could be sold had been sold, and the rest was practically unsaleable—I had not seen the stock—I imagine that Waller purchased the stock—of the three sealskin jackets, two fetched £24 each, and the third £26—the public examination was on 12th August, 1891, and the private examination was on 5th July, 1892; the debtor appeared then in person—I conducted the examination.</p>

Dornfeldt and Co. for 84 sable marten skins, value £39 18s., sold to the prisoner—I find in the statement of affairs that the debtor set out Dornfeldt and Co. as creditors for the amount, and that he holds acceptances for £84 18s.—I produce another invoice of the same date of L. H. Stehr for £130 8s., less £3 5s. discount, for twelve timbers stow-marten tails—Mr. Stehr appears as an unsecured creditor proving in the bank ruptcy for that amount, and holding two acceptances due the 26th June and 25th July.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">EMILY BERTHA MEDINA</hi>. I am the wife of Alfred Edward Medina, an auctioneer, of 2, Yeldham Road, Fulham—the prisoner was my only servant—she entered my service on 5th July last; I had no reference with her; I took her on her mother's recommendation, a very nice respectable woman—on 17th January, about a quarter past one in the day, the prisoner and I were alone in the house—I went into the dining room to see that the table was properly set—I found the fire burning very low, and no coals in the scuttle—I called to the prisoner to bring in a pail of coals to empty into the scuttle, and I then went into the drawing-room, which is separated from the dining-room by very heavy curtains, leaving the prisoner in the dining-room—in about five minutes, smelling fire, I opened the curtain to go back to the dining-room, and found it black with smoke, and flames reaching from a chair above the chandelier nearly to the ceiling—the easy chair was half way under the dining table, by the side of the fire, with its back to the fireplace—I rushed into the scullery and got a large pan of water and threw it all over the table and chair—T screamed to the prisoner; she was upstairs; she came down, and helped me screw up the tablecloth, and throw it out at the back—the tablecloth was alight, and the table leg was burnt, and the chair seat—I did not say anything to the prisoner about the fire—as my husband did not come in at three o'clock I had dinner with my children—at that time the fire was all out, and we had cleared up all the mess—I left the dining-room between half-past three and a quarter to four, and went into the kitchen, and directly I went to the sink I smelt benzine; it is used for cleaning—I called the prisoner, and asked her if she had been using any—she said, "No, it must be an escape of gas"—I tried, but there was no escape—I had two bottles of benzine, both full; I bought it to clean a dress, but had not used it—I then went up to my bedroom with my little, boy; I had just taken off my dress when the prisoner came up; I asked what she wanted—she said Bertie called her—I said, "Nothing of the kind," and told her to go downstairs; she took no notice, but went to the window where the child was looking out—I was very cross, and turned her out; both her and the child—she went downstairs, but ran up again directly, and said, "There is another fire downstairs"—I rushed down, looked into the dining-room, and saw all the corner of the room was on fire; there was a vase with dried grasses in it and a Japanese fan; that was all burnt, and the vase was broken, and the muslin curtain on the top of the pole was on fire; I stamped it out with a broom—the curtains had not been set on fire, they had caught from the articles on the bracket—with the prisoner's assistance I put the fire out—I told her I was sure that when Mr. Medina came home he would send for a detective—she said nothing—Mr. Medina came home about five—he saw what had taken place; he went out and returned with Mr. Goddard, a neighbour—I went into the yard, and brought in the tablecloth, and showed it to him; we opened it, and we smelt benzine very strongly—the inspector and the fire brigade man came, and we sent for the prisoner's mother—I told her in the prisoner's presence that we</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189302060045"/>
               <p>had smelt benzine, and the prisoner told her mother that she had used some for cleaning a velvet collar, but so very little that she did not think I should smell it—later that evening the inspector took the prisoner to the station—I did not wish to charge her, for I really did not think the girl was responsible—I do not wish her punished now—she seemed so peculiar; she always called me "mother," and I was cross with her, because I thought visitors might hear her—I had a plush ottoman in my bedroom, and she always used to say it was her coffin, and if I missed her I must look for her there—she had very bad health; she went to the hospital every fortnight all the time she was with me; she had some internal complaint; she was suffering from it when she came to me—on the 1st January she came to me before I was up in the morning, and told me that a nurse wanted to see her—she was not ill the first thing that morning, but she was ill by dinner time—she could not eat her dinner, and she went to bed; I told her to go, and I took her up a cup of tea about two o'clock—I went to bed about ten—I saw her about 9. 30—I took her up a cup of tea, and bade her good night—between one and two she came and opened my door, and said she could smell fire—I said it could not be fire, but when she woke me right up I saw the smoke coming through the bedroom door, and I jumped out of bed, and went downstairs to the kitchen—I could not see the fire—I lighted the gas, and saw that the smoke was very great, and the biros were crying very peculiarly—I went to the fireplace, and saw that the smoke was coming from an easy chair, and when I lifted it up I saw that it was all on fire underneath—the prisoner was there—she had followed me downstairs—I put water on the chair, put the fire out, but I would not let the prisoner help, me, because I knew she was ill—all the underneath part of the chair was burnt, with the exception of the springs and the top leather; one leg was burnt—the carpet under the chair was not burnt at all—I had given the prisoner notice to leave every month she was with me, but she was very clean and honest, and I looked over this for those two reasons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The mother told where she had been employed before, and the prisoner gave me the address of one lady, a Mrs. Beeding, and a Mrs. Sherer, where she was four years—the bottles of benzine were kept in a cupboard; I don't know when I had seen them last, but I was in the habit of going to it every week or ten days—the fire we burn in the dining-room is sometimes wood and sometimes coal—on this day a large piece of wood had been put on, and there were coals, with a guard up—I had nearly put the first fire out when she came down—she ran to the tablecloth, and began twisting it round; I don't know whether she scorched her hands—her apron was scorched a little from the smouldering; I had put the fire out then—I might have said to her "Oh, Ellen, we will not burn any more wood in this room"—I don't remember it, nor her saying, "It would be the best plan, for wood is very dangerous"; but I am very hard of hearing—I have burnt wood in the same room ever since—on the second occasion I bad not smelt any fire before she came up, screaming that there was a fire—I have not used the benzine since.</p>

                  </hi>, I am an auctioneer—the prisoner was in my service—on 17th January I was away on business all day—I came home at five—I was shown a chair, three portions of a table cover; and a white tablecloth—the seat of the chair had been burnt right across, to the extent of six inches—I saw the vase and ashes of the grass, and the top of a lace curtain that had been burnt; also the cornice of the ceiling and a gilt picture frame at the side—I sent for the prisoner and asked her if she knew anything of the cause of the fire—she said, "No"—I also spoke to her about the chair, and said, "I think you must know something about this; put on your things and go home, I cannot have you in the house"—she went into the kitchen and began to cry—I went in to Mr. Goddard, and he came and looked at the things—I afterwards went to the station, and the police came.</p>

                  </hi>, I am a licentiate of the College of Physicians, Edinburgh—I practice at 11, Stoke Newington Road—on 21st December I was called in to the prisoner's child Edgar, at 6, Lawrence Buildings, Sandford Lane—the room smelt as if in a dirty condition—the female brought Edgar in naked in her arms—it was in a fit—I exclaimed, "The child seems starved"—she said, "Oh no, it is not starved; the child has had plenty to eat," the other children were brought into the room, and I was asked if they were starved—they were fairly well nourished—I saw three children, one a little girl about fifteen—I asked if they had any milk—they brought me milk, and I asked them to warm it, which they did; and they brought me whisky, which I put in the milk, and ordered them to give it to Edgar—I asked her if the child was—subject to fits, and she said "No," that was the first fit the child had had, and she had that morning given it a piece of camphor—I asked her why she gave it, and she said the child was suffering from worms—I asked if she had put it in a hot bath, and she said she had not a bath, but she had put it into a bucket of hot water—about a tablespoonful of whisky was brought in, and I put the whole of it in a glass of milk for the child—it was brought in from an inner-room—there was about a tumbler full of milk—that was in the house—I said the child ought to have been seen by a doctor before—I left then—about six p. m. I received a communication from the father that the child was dead—I did not give a certificate—assisted by my brother I made a postmortem on 24th December—I found no chronic disease sufficient to cause death—the child weighed 113/4 lb.—the minimum weight of such a child in good health would be 34 lb.—the cause of the emaciation was want of food—there was nothing in the child's condition to make it refuse food if offered it—children refuse food if they are ill—they die of merasmus—emaciation in that case would come from want of food—in this case I should say the cause of death was emaciation, caused by food not being</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Napier Terrace, Islington—in March, 1892,1 was stores manager to C. M. Taylor's Patent Bottling Company, Limited, 62 and 63, King William Street—Bullock was a traveller in the same employment—in March he introduced Mr. Dixon to me at the cellars—afterwards in March Dixon came to the cellars with Hartmann, who he said was a responsible respectable man carrying on a large business as a baker in the Hackney Road—Hartmann heard what was said—Dixon said he would be a good customer—some whisky was tasted, and on 23rd March an order was given for a dozen of it to be sent to Hartmann—on April 11th Hartmann gave a further order for whisky, £2 2s.; that was executed—on March 30th he called, and gave an order for beer, 10s. 6d., which was also executed—I can't say if after the first time he came with Dixon—on April 7th Hartmann came with Schneider, who he said was a confectioner and caterer in the Dawes Road, Fulham—Schneider said he had known Hartmann for some time; they had been good friends—Schneider gave an order for champagne and whisky, amounting to £2 4s.—Schneider said he wanted it for a boating party up the river—the order was executed—after the goods were sent I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">This was headed Imperial Bakery Company</hi>, 103, <hi rend="italic">Dawes Road, April</hi> 14<hi rend="italic">th, and requested them to forward a case of the champagne, which Bullock had mentioned, and a dozen whisky, as a large party had to be ca'ered for on Thursday, signed</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SCHNEIDER</hi>)—I sent those goods—I received this</p>

               <p>letter, with the same heading (<hi rend="italic">This stated that Schneider did not know Collier, nor had he introduced him; that the only two gentlemen hi had recommended to Taylor's firm were Pemberton and Cook; that he should forward the money for his account at the end of the month, and that he should like a dozen of whisky and other goods</hi>)—we sent goods to Collier, of Harwood Road, Fulham, which were never paid for, and Bullock had written to Schneider about him—the goods were sent to him—I received this letter of 19th (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he found Collier was living at Harwood Road, but he could not see him personally, and ordering two dozen of champagne and a price list</hi>)—on June 8th I received a letter ordering two cases of champagne—I sent the two cases of champagne to Schneider on 9th—we wrote to him, and got this letter of June 11th, stating, "We are not able to send your account as promised"—before 23rd June Mr. Bullock called on Schneider, and made a communication afterwards; I never went myself—I received this letter of 23rd June from Schneider (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he would attend to the matter as soon as possible</hi>)—when Hartmann introduced Schneider I believed he was carrying on a genuine business at 103, Dawes Road, as a baker and confectioner, and that he was the Imperial Bakery Company, and that he had orders for the whisky and wine he ordered, to be used for boating parties and the purposes of his business—on April 4th Hartmann came with Hall, whom he introduced as a baker and confectioner in a large way of busi<lb/>ness, at 89, Liverpool Road, Islington—Hall ordered a dozen of whisky, which was sent to his address—on 10th May we received this letter from Hall (<hi rend="italic">Stating that the wine and spirits had been received, and ordering siz dozen Bats and a case of champagne, pints</hi>)—the Bass was sent from our Dean Street Beer Stores—on 1st June I received this letter from Hall (<hi rend="italic">Ordering a case of whisky and a case of brandy</hi>)—those goods were sent—on 8th June I received this letter from Hall (<hi rend="italic">Ordering a case of brandy and a case of whisky, and asking for a full statement of his account</hi>)—those goods were sent, and also three cases of champagne (required for Ascot) on 14th June—the total value of the goods sent to Hall is £22 3s.—we received this letter of 22nd June and telegram of 23rd June (<hi rend="italic">Order<lb/>ing whisky, brandy, and champagne</hi>)—we did not send those goods—on 28th June and 14th July we received letters asking us to execute these last orders; we took no notice of those letters, and forwarded no more goods to Hall—when we first supplied goods to Hall we believed he was a baker and confectioner in a large way of business at 89, Liverpool Road, and we continued to believe that during the time we were supply<lb/>ing him—some time after the goods had been delivered I went to 89, Liverpool Road, and found it was a private house; I called for the account twice, I think—on or about 24th May Hall came with Richardson, and said Richardson was a baker and confectioner, of 115, Dalston Lane—Richardson ordered a dozen of whisky, which was sent to him—on 16th June Richardson came to the cellars and paid £2 2s. for it, and gave another order amounting to £16 17s. for wines and spirits, which were sent to him at 115, Dalston Lane—nothing more was supplied to him—I believed the statement about his being a confectioner in a large way of business at 115, Ralston Lane—about 23rd June I received this letter with the printed heading, "From W. Richardson, wholesale bedding manufacturer, etc., 115, Dalston Lane," and ordering a case of whisky—up to that time</p>

               <p>we had no idea he was a wholesale bedding manufacturer; I think I took the letter to Mr. Taylor—the goods were not supplied—about 8th of May I received this letter from Pemberton, of 4, Redclyffe Road, Kensington, ordering whisky and champagne, which we sent—Schneider introduced Pemberton to me before 8th May, saying that he was a man of means and position—from time to time we supplied Pemberton with £18 9s. 6d. worth of goods, none of which he paid for—I saw him at our place with Garland—I next saw him at West<lb/>minster Police-court on a charge of forgery, I believe—I had this letter, dated 10th May, from Edward A. Cook, headed Gunterstone Road, Kensington (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had tasted their whisky while on a visit to Schneider, and that he should like sample eases of Irish and Scotch whisky and champagne sent to him</hi>)—those goods, amounting to £6, were sent to Gunterstone Road—Cook never came to our place—I received this letter from White (<hi rend="italic">Headed Beauclerc House, 39, Chapter Road, and ordering a case of whisky</hi>), and on May 13th I sent a case to that address—I did not see White till I saw him at the Court—on May 27th I sent another dozen of whisky to White—on 2nd June White wrote this letter ordering whisky, brandy, and champagne—those goods were not sent—he' had been written to about payment, I believe, before that—the total goods supplied to him were to the amount of £4 4s.; that is ail unpaid; he paid nothing—on 28th April we had this letter from Dr. Ross, 24, Uver<lb/>dale Road, S. W., asking for a dozen of whisky, which was forwarded, and on 10th May he wrote asking for two dozen of whisky, which was sent on 1 8th—on 23rd May he ordered two dozen; and there is another order for two dozen of brandy—those last goods were not sent—on 6th May we received this letter from Stewart (<hi rend="italic">This stated that Dr. Ross had given him tern whisky, and recommended Taylor's Company, and ordered a dozen of whisky end some champagne. It added that Dr. Boss had been attending his wife; and that if the bill was sent he would remit if he was not in</hi>)—we sent the goods and the bill; he did not remit—on May 7th we received this letter from Stewart (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he did not like the brandy nor the price, and that he was going out of town</hi>)—I did not see stewart till he was at the Police-court—Bullock saw him—we received this letter from Stewart, headed 5, Lancester Place, Margate (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had never received any account; that he imagined his debt was about</hi> £11, <hi rend="italic">and that he should like more whisky and champagne to be sent</hi>)—that was in July—he had a, bill on June 8th for whisky and champagne; we sent no more after receiving his letter because at that. time we had received information about Ross and Stewart—we received this letter from Stewart (<hi rend="italic">This stated that as he said in his letter he would square up on his return to town, they might have sent his last</hi> order)—the last goods we sent him was on June 8th, when we sent him two cases of champagne and one dozen whisky in answer to his letter of June 8th—that would make up his bill to £4 4s.—we received a telegram, "Wine and whisky advised three days ago not received.—<hi rend="smallCaps">STEWART</hi>, Margate"—early in June Pemberton and Garland came to the cellars, and Pemberton introduced Garland as a man of means and position who lived at Princes Road, Kilburn—he did not say what he was—Bullock was there then—on June 4th wine to the amount of £2 16s. 6d. was sent to Garland—I only saw Garland once afterwards, and that was after the prosecution was started,</p>

               <p>in the Police-court—he came to the cellars and wanted to pay; it was before his arrest—acting under Mr. Button's, our solicitor's, advice we did not receive the money he offered—I remember Garland taking some goods away in a cab—I cannot re<lb/>member when that was-we followed our rule in all these case of sending invoices with the goods—when we get an order from a person we do not know, we make a note of the person introducing—I believed the statements about Garland being a respectable man and a man of means.</p>

We never make a note of what a per<lb/>son says when giving an order—I depend on my memory—most of our orders do not come from Bullock; we had four or five travellers—I believe Bullock was best known to Mr. Taylor, the managing director—if an introduction came through Bullock we should accept it—I have seen Dixon once or twice; I did not know him personally—I first knew Dixon on March 23rd, 1892, or a little before, when Bullock, I believe, brought him to the office—I only knew Dixon a week or two before I knew Hartmann—I think Bullock said something to the effect that Dixon was a highly respectable man—Dixon gave no order and obtained no goods—I cannot say if Dixon came in with Hartmann when Hartmann first came—Hartmann came there with Bullock first—I daresay Bullock, Hartmann, and Dixon were all together the first time Hartmann visited us—Bullock did not introduce Hartmann to me in Dixon's presence; they were all three together—Dixon said in Bullock's presence that Hartmann was carrying On a large business as a baker in Hackney Road—the conversation and order were on 23rd March—I cannot swear that was the first time I saw Hartmann there—on 30th March the order was given, but I cannot remember whether Hartmann or Bullock gave it—the next order was on 7th April, by the order-book; I do not know by anything else—he came with Schneider on the day the order appears in my book—I don't know if Dixon or Bullock were present when Hartmann said that Schneider was in a large way of business—Hartmann also introduced Barrow and Hall—I can swear he introduced Hall—at the Police-court I was speak<lb/>ing from memory when I said, "I do not know who introduced Hall," but now having the book before me in which we put down the intro<lb/>ducer of a customer I say it was Hartmann—our credit is one or two months, never more than three—we have no printed regulations to that effect, but we have instructions from Mr. Taylor not to give more—that rule was never broken, but people used to take longer than three months—when Hartmann ordered goods three months should have been mentioned—I cannot say who mentioned it—nothing is said on the invoice about it—our company has been twice in liquidation—in May it went into liquidation before reconstruction—I cannot say if the three months' credit to Hartmann had then expired—his account was sent in, the last time through Harper, of Trinity Square, accountants, who had all the accounts to collect—they applied to Hartmann, who called on us after this case had started, I believe—he said he had a letter from some solicitors about his account, and he was going to see them—this was before his arrest; but some of the prisoners were in custody at the time—he did not call in May and say he had received a letter from a solicitor asking for payment; it was a</p>

               <p>—Mr. Bullock made the entries in the book from which I have refreshed my memory—I could not say if Bullock was in the cellar when Richardson first came—Bullock would make the entry from what I told him, or he told me, or from what I heard—I have no recollection of the date when Richardson was introduced, if anybody did introduce him—I don't remember it I said that Richardson was introduced by Hall—in addition to the book I have spoken of, there is another book, which I keep myself, in which are notes of introductions; it is the rough order-book—I get the information from what I have heard and seen—when I told the Magistrate that I had made no entry about Richardson, that was referring to trade; there are some entries—Richardson had whisky to drink on the first occasion before he ordered any—after a month he called, and paid for his first order—he might hare had 2s. discount—no doubt he had something to drink—I don't think I asked him for an order; I might have done so—he ordered more whisky—I did not then say, "Let us have a bottle of champagne"—I did not open one—I was not there all the time—some of the directors were in the cellar—I remember the occasion; I went upstairs—Bullock did not say in my presence, "We had better have another bottle"—it was not suggested to Richardson after two bottles, "You had better have a case of cham<lb/>pagne"—we did not send on the champagne to him without express orders—I was not there when a bottle of champagne was opened—I booked the order, and took it from Bullock, no doubt—the order of 22nd June appears to be the only written order from Richardson—his total indebtedness was £16 17s.—the value of the whisky in the written order is two guineas, and the rest of the order was verbal, given at the time I have been cross-examined about—that was the only transaction I had with him.</p>

When we first heard from Boss we knew nothing about him; he was introduced to us by Schneider, I believe—I don't think any inquiries were made about Ross—the first letter Stewart wrote mentioned no other name—up to 5th May we had only sent one order to Boss, and we had not been paid for it—the goods in Stewart's first order were sent directly to him on receipt of his letter; that would be usual—we sent a bill when we sent the goods; it would be sure to go—I swear a bill went with Stewart's first order to Suffolk Street—that is the custom of business—Bullock answered Stewart's letter of 5th May, and then the letter of 7th May was received, and on that the cham<lb/>pagne was sent—the goods were sent to St. Pancras, and the invoice would be sent by post to Suffolk Street—Stewart did not have the inter<lb/>view with, me—the third lot was sent to him after the letter asking us to let him have his account at once—the goods were sent and the invoice with them—when we wrote about a new rule, we had no new rule as to credit, only we did not want to increase the amount of outstanding accounts—the business was reconstructed in May to get a large increase of capital I suppose—I and others were not over anxious to get names</p>

From the ledger I see that Garland came with Pemberton to the cellars on 4th June, and that, to the best of my knowledge, was the first time I saw Garland—Pemberton introduced him as a man of means and position—I should think I had seen Pemberton previously; I could not say—on one occasion I said at the Police-court that I knew Pemberton through Garland; that was a mistake, and is not true—I swore that they called on 12th April; that is a mistake—three months' credit was given to Garland—the statement was sent in at the end of September, when the credit had expired—I and Bullock were present when Garland and Pemberton came to the cellars; I think Mr. Taylor was sure to be there—most likely Bullock took Garland's order—they were sure to have some refreshment—I cannot remember whether Bullock introduced Garland—I do not know that Mr. Taylor asked for a reference—I made no inquiries about Garland—when the prosecution was on Garland showed me a letter, from which I saw that he had been for nineteen years in the London and North-Western Railway Com<lb/>pany's service, and had retired on a pension of £35 a year—I did not know that he was at Messrs. Potter and Sons, in Aldersgate Street—I have no recollection of seeing Garland after 4th June—I heard that he and Pemberton called about 8th August, and that they were intoxicated—I was laid up and was not there—they refused to serve them on that day, and would not take an order—I do not know that Bullock took the order, and that Taylor refused to serve—sometimes the ledger is posted by one person, sometimes by another—I see the words in the writing of Mason, a director, "Will pay on 29th September," against Garland's account—I cannot say if Garland called on 29th September; he called later than that about pay<lb/>ing, because the case had started and we were told to take no money from him; I had just returned from Mr. Dutton's, and remem<lb/>ber it well—I gave Mr. Dutton my evidence—I saw Garland when I came from Mr. Dutton—he gave a card with the name of Letts and Co., the diary publishers, and said he had a situation there then—it was after the Police-court proceedings—I might have said I would sneak to Mr. Taylor about it; I said nothing about writing or letting him know—he did not tell me his address—I told him we could not receive the money, and told him the reason—this was not before the information was sworn—if I had known he was in a situation at Potter's, and had a pension of £35 a year, I should not have trusted him for as much as £9 15s.—until after the information was sworn no inquiry was made about his means.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 39, Grayland Road, Peckham—from November, 1891, until the end of September, 1892, I was traveller on commission to Taylor's Patent Bottling Company—in 1892 Dixon came to the cellars by himself, and we had a conversation—on the next occasion he came with Hartmann, whom he introduced as a friend of his, and as a baker and confectioner in the Hackney Road—I was given to understand that he was a respectable tradesman—Eggleton was in the office and came into the cellars at the time, I believe—to the best of my belief, Hartmann and Dixon spoke to him—I was not as deaf then as I am now; I have been deaf for some years, but I have been rather worse lately from a severe cold—I kept a little memorandum book in which I entered orders that I received—I see by it that it was on 23rd March, 1892, when Hartmann and Dixon came—Hartmann tasted whisky, and gave me an order for a dozen and for three dozen stout—I have also a memorandum of Dixon having introduced him—when I do not know the customers I generally put down the name of the introducer—Hartmann called again on the 4th April, when he introduced Hall—they both tasted whisky, and Hall gave an order for a dozen—he was introduced as a friend of Hartmann by Hartmann and Dixon—I was given to understand that he was a private individual—nothing was said as to what he was—Eggleton was about in the office—I believe Hartmann and Hall spoke to him; I don't know what was said—I have an entry of the order for the whisky for Hall, 89, Liverpool Road—on 7th April Hartmann called with Schneider, and introduced him as being a refreshment contractor, baker, and confectioner in Dawes Road, Fulham—Schneider tasted whisky and ordered some—I have the entry: "7-4-92.—A. J. Schneider, 103, Dawes Road, Fulham, one dozen No.1 Scotch, 40s.; three dozen stout, and half a dozen Killbeggan whisky, "and than "Hartmann one dozen Killbeggan whisky, 40s."—that was an order which Hartmann gave that day—I have no note about Schneider's introduction, but the two being together,</p>

               <p>and both giving an order, I have got them in that way—I presume they spoke to Eggleton on that occasion—generally speaking Eggleton saw anybody who came to the office—I did not keep the books, but only made entries as to what was ordered—Hartmann called in several times—that was the last order we had from him—I next saw Schneider on 2nd April, when he introduced Pemberton as a private gentleman, a friend of his, and a respectable man, living at 14, Radclyfe Road, South Kensington—Pemberton ordered whisky, champagne, port, claret, and beer—that order came to between £12 and £13—I believe he spoke to Eggleton—I do not remember seeing Schneider again at the cellars—Pemberton called again on 9th May; I have an order from him, which I believe he gave at the office—he was alone then—the order was for whisky and champagne, and came to about £5—on 6th May Hall called, and paid for the first whisky he had had, amounting to £2, and he then gave a further order, which I have booked, for two dozen pints of champagne, a case of brandy, two dozen whisky, and six dozen Bass—that came to between £10 and £11—I do not put the introducer against a person's name after the first visit—on 10th May we received an order by post from Hall for one case of champagne, 41s.—on 18th May we had an order by post from Schneider—on 7th May Stewart called—he had previously written, giving an order, and stating that he was introduced by Dr. Ross—when he called he ordered goods to be sent to the cloak-room at St. Pancras Station, to be called for—he saw two or three of us at the cellars; he was speaking "more to my principal, Mr. Taylor, or one of the directors saw him—the goods to be sent to St. Pancras came to about £2 10s.—on 23rd May Richardson came, I believe, with Hall—I have him down as introduced by Hall—I understood him to be Hall's private friend—I can't remember now exactly what was said, but I understood that he was not in business, but was respectable and trustworthy—he gave an order for one dozen of whisky—on 31st May I have it down that Garland was brought by Pemberton, who introduced him as being a friend of his, and a respectable man, and I was given to understand that he had been in the service of a railway company, and was pensioned off—Garland gave the address, 27, Princes Road, Kilburn, and he gave an order for whisky, champagne, and brandy, amounting to £8 15s. 6d.—about two days afterwards Pemberton called and took away two bottles of brandy and a bottle of port—when Pemberton and Garland came together on the 31st May they went away in a cab, taking champagne, two bottles of brandy, and a bottle of whisky with them—on 16th June Richardson called alone, and paid me £2 for his first lot, and then gave a further order for whisky, brandy, and champagne, coming to £16 17s.—I think it must have been in August when Pemberton and Garland came again, I have no date—they tasted whisky, and Garland gave another order, which was not executed; it would have come to £7 or £8—Garland called again some little time after Pemberton's arrest for the forgery, or some case that he was arrested for; it would be about the end of August or September—he then promised to pay for what he owed on 29th September when he drew his money; the three months' credit had then expired—this pencil memorandum in my book, "Pay on 29th September," was probably made by Eggleton—Eggleton said something to me, in cones<lb/>quence</p>

               <p>of which I went to Schneider's house, 103, Dawes Road—I found the shop closed, and the windows whitened all over; that would be in June—I saw a female there, who I presumed was Mrs. Schneider—I then went to Hartmann's, 178, Camberwell Road, a baker's shop and post-office—I told him about Schneider's place—he expressed surprise, as he believed he was doing business—he said he had known him for some years, and he always believed him to be a respectable man; that he believed he had had an oven built there—later in the month I went to Richardson's in Dalston Lane; it was a private house, with no appear-ance of a bakery business; it was a kind of semi-detached villa—there was no appearance of a wholesale bedding manufactory being carried on there—I called at Hall's, 89, Liverpool Road—it was a private house, with no appearance of. a bakery or anything—neither Hall nor Richardson were at home when I called on them—these entries in these two books are in my handwriting—they are memoranda of the persons who introduced the various customers—in posting up the ledger I put not merely the statement of account, but the person introducing, from my rough book—I met Stewart in the Bay-tree Tavern, St. Swithin's Lane, and I asked him if he knew where Dr. Ross lived—he said he did not—when Schneider called on the 7th May and asked for the goods to be sent to St. Pancras, he said he was going down to his wife, who was ill at Manchester—he gave no address then—he afterwards gave an address by letter, which a friend of his left—in consequence of that letter the goods were sent to St. Pancras on Friday—the address at Manchester was 21, Akers Street—the order was for a case of champagne (pints), 42s., and a case of whisky, 42s.—I did not know the name of the friend.</p>

I had confidence in any introduction of Dixon, whom I had known as a respectable man for five years—I was satisfied with him, and nothing was said about a reference for Hartmann—I don't think anything was said about the terms of credit; I could not swear to having stated any particular time—I cannot swear that nothing was said about credit—the terms of the firm were three months—I never made special terms—my commission was 10 per cent on whisky and 5 percent, on champagne—I received no exceptional terms for selling to Hartmann—I became intimate with Hartmann, and used to call of my own free will at his shop in the Camberwell Road—I did not press him for orders—I had no reason for believing Hartmann was anything but a respectable man until these proceedings—in July I called on him to borrow some money for my own private use, not for the firm—he lent me 10s.—it was not my duty to collect accounts—I don't remember asking for something on account of what he owed to the firm—he did not write saying he had paid it to the firm—I had no letter from him about the 10s.—he called at the office and mentioned the 10s. to Mr. Eggleton, who told me that Hartmann had called to pay the account, and wanted to deduct the 10s.—I then wrote to Hartmann—I did not repay the 10s.

               <p>more than two—in my book I have Hartmann and Schneider down—if two introducers come I might only put down one—no introducer is written against Schneider, but Hartmanns order follows Schneider's, and I remember their calling together—we did a good deal of business—very likely other people were there when Schneider came in first—I kept no note of the conversation—I made no inquiry about Schneider, I was only traveller—I relied on Hartmann, who was introduced by Dixon—Pemberton gave an order in Schneider's presence, to the best of my belief—I could not swear that Schneider was present—Schneider and Pemberton had drinks when they came—Schneider introduced Pemberton as a friend and as a respectable man—I won't say that he said more than that he was a private gentleman and his friend—when I went to Hartmann, after finding Schneider's shop not open, he seemed surprised that the business was not going on, and he said as a possible explanation that Schneider was building, or had built, an oven; I could not swear to the exact words—at the time Schneider gave his first order nothing was said about the length of credit, and there was nothing to call his attention to it—some wine merchants give six months' credit, or longer.</p>

I am a director of Taylor's Patent Bottling Company, King William Street—in April, May, June and July I was constantly at the cellars—I have seen Hartmann, Schneider, Garland, Pemberton, and Dr. Ross—Schneider told me he was a caterer and confectioner—I believe he said he catered for parties up the river; he said he could introduce very good accounts—I have had a conver-sation with Pemberton when he was there with Garland; the last affair was in August, when they wanted to take away some whisky, and I said it was not to go unless it was paid for—I think Pemberton said that Garland was his landlord—Pemberton first said he would pay us a cheque for his account if we let Garland have the whisky, and I gave instructions not to let it go unless it was paid for at the time—he said nothing to me—Pemberton pressed me to let Garland have the whisky—I should not have served Pemberton any longer unless he paid his account.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. OVEREND</hi>. I cannot say whether Hartmann called to pay his accounts or not—I said at the Police-court that I was the only director who knew anything of the business—there is Hart-mann's order in the order-book; I did not write it; Eggleton would have written it, I should imagine—I assume that the liquidator male application for payment—we make-inquiries through Stubbs as to customers, but I held Bullock mainly responsible for all orders through him—I told him I should hold him responsible for all accounts he introduced—I cannot say if reference was made to Stubbs about Hartmann—Bullock had been in our employment sometime prior to 23rd March—it was under-stood that he should make inquiries; he may not have understood me about it—I did not attend to every detail—we desired to reconstitute our business on as large a scale as possible, and it was to our interest to obtain as many good orders as possible—our capital has been completely subscribed; we did not go to the public at all—when we went into liquidation the ordinary three months' credit of our firm had not expired in Hartmann's case—it was after Pemberton was prosecuted that these accounts were placed in Mr. Dutton's hands, and it came out in that way.</p>

I don't say we trusted to Bullock entirely—I said, "I trusted to Bullock's word in the case of all the defendants, and it was for Bullock to make inquiries"—I was not actuated by any false pretences made to me personally—our company went into liquidation on 11th May for reconstruction, and in December, 1892, went into a voluntary liquidation again before reconstruction—the business is not being carried on now—our rule on these accounts was one month's credit—the total amount owing us now is about £3,000; a considerable amount of those are credit expired accounts apart from the prisoners'—the prisoners owe us together roughly about £150—I thought Bullock's conduct very reckless generally, apart from the prisoners, and dismissed him.</p>

Young and Son's offices, at which Schneider was present—this is the notice convening the meeting—an offer of 2s. in the pound by instalments was made—the first instalment was paid 11th May, 1883, and the second on 11th June, 1883, I believe—on 9th July, 1892, I was present at a meeting of creditors at Young and Son's offices; Hartmann was there—there was a proposal of 1s. in the pound, but it was not put to the meeting, and nothing was done, as Mr. Waydelin, the mortgagee, said he should foreclose—I think no money was paid in that insolvency.</p>

The rent of the house was £45—there was nothing to prevent Pickford letting Richardson have the house; bat under the agreement Pickford could not sublet without our consent—nobody could carry on trade there except by a breach of agreement; it was a private house—the rent was paid regularly up to September, but not to me—I did not collect the rents.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Sergeant B</hi>). I have been engaged for some time past in making inquiries in this case—I received papers from Mr. Dutton as the foundation for my inquiry—when the warrant was granted on 5th November it was given to Church—on 12th November, at half-past nine a.m., I went to 24, Hackney Road, a baker's shop—I saw Hartmann, and said, "I am a police officer; I hold a warrant for your arrest"—I read it; it charged him, with eleven others, with conspiring to defraud Taylor's Bottling Company—he said, "I had two cases of whisky, one Irish and one Scotch, and about 10s. worth of beer. I was introduced to Bullock by a man named Dixon. I had it delivered at my shop in Camberwell Road, where it was drunk. At that time I had a post-office, and was guaranteed for £200, and it is not likely I should defraud anyone of a paltry £4. No one has ever called for the money; and I once went to Mr. Taylor's to pay it, and they would not take it, but referred me to a solicitor in bankruptcy"—when charged at the Station he made no reply—he had 2s. 4d. and some papers on him (<hi rend="italic">These were a letter from Eggleton, and one from the liquidator asking for payment</hi>)—on 13th November I went to 39, Chapter Road, Walworth, about White—on 21st November I saw Cook, who was living at 103, Dawes Road, where Schneider had been living—I told Cook I was a police officer, and held a warrant for his arrest for conspiring and obtaining wines and spirits from Taylor's Bottling Company—he said, "I have known Schneider for about two years, but I don't know anything about his financial affairs. I also know Pemberton; but I did not conspire with anyone, and made no false pretences. I sent for the goods, and they were delivered with an invoice, but they never sent for the money. I was going to see Mr. Taylor now to pay him"—I have the word "now" in my note—I took him to Walham Green Police-station, and read the warrant to him—he made no reply—I found one shilling and three slips of paper on him—I searched his lodgings at 103, Dawes Road, but found nothing—there was very little furniture there—he was lodging there with his wife and family—there was no appearance of any business there; there was a place for a shop downstairs—I did not arrest Garland, but I searched him—I found on him two pawntickets not relating to these cases; one was for a silver watch, and the other for a coat and vest—on 5th September I arrested Pemberton for forgery at 150, Finbury Road, Garland's house, where</p>

               <p>Pemberton lodged—he was subsequently convicted here of forgery on 17th October, and had
nine months' hard labour—on 14th January I saw Richardson at Upper Street, Islington. Police-station—I told him I was a police officer, and had a warrant for his arrest for conspiring with Hartmann and others—he said "As I know all about it, I am not sorry you have come; it has cost me more keeping out of the way than it was ever worth"—on the way to the Station he said, "I only know two of the men you have got; that is George Hall and Hartmann, but I never went to Taylor's place with either of them. I heard Hall telling another man about Taylor, and I went up myself. I had a case of wine first and paid for it. They then pressed me for another order, which I got, but they never called for the money. It was about £16 worth; had they sent me a bill, I should have paid"—he also said he had some champagne to drink on the occasion when he gave the order downstairs in the cellar—I searched and found on him eight-pence—I found Cook's sister was living at 29, Gunterstone Road—Barker Street is a very poor little <hi rend="italic">cul-de-sac:</hi> it used to be stables at one time.</p>

Richardson said he had been in the neighbourhood for some time; that he went to Liverpool first when he heard he was wanted, and stopped for some time, and then came to London, where he had been in the neighbourhood ever since—I don't think I told the Magistrate he went to Liverpool when he heard he was wanted—he said he had seen Nursey.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HORTIN</hi>. I found on Garland these letters from the London, and North-Western Railway Company, and from Messrs. Letts and Co.

               <p>when I had my quarter's cheque, and offered them part of the account, but they refused to receive it"—shortly afterwards I saw Schneider at Walham Green Police-station, and read the warrant to him—he made no answer—I took him to Walton Street Police-station in a cab, and on the way he said, "I was dealing with a legitimate firm, and I may owe them a little bit of money, but I have had a lot of losses myself"—I found documents on him, but nothing relating to the charge—on 15th November, about seven p.m., I went with Macguire to Holborn Viaduct Railway Station, where we saw Stewart in the refreshment bar—I called him outside and said, "I am a police inspector, and have a warrant for your arrest for conspiring with others and obtaining wines and spirits from Taylor's, King William Street, to the amount of about £150"—he said, "Conspiracy? It is monstrous. Who did I conspire with?"—I said, "With a number: Schneider, Garland, Cook, and others"—he said, "I don't know any of them; I owe Taylor a debt of £10 or £11. I was with a medical friend of mine, Dr. Boss. I had some whisky, which was very good, and I asked him where he got it. He told me from Taylor's, and I said I should like some. He said, 'You go there and see Bullock, the manager, and say I recommended you,' and I went and ordered some. They sent me some whisky and champagne; some to my chambers in Suffolk Street and some to Margate"—I took him to Walton Street Police-station—the warrant was read; he made no reply—on the evening of 21st November I saw Hall at Dais ton Police-station—I said, "lama police inspector, and have a warrant for your arrest"—I read it to him—he said nothing then; but before I took him away he said, "I met Hartmann and another in the City one day, and they asked me to go and taste a drop of good whisky. We went to Taylor's, and I ordered a case of Scotch, and I afterwards had some more. I did not conspire with anybody. It is only an account between us"—9s. Id. was found on him.</p>

On 23rd November at midnight I went to 40, Mill Lane, Deptford—it is a common lodging-house—I saw Beezer there—I said to him, "I am going to take you into custody for being concerned with another man not in custody in robbing and violently assaulting a lady on the 14th November—he replied, "I thought you took in <hi rend="italic">Fat headed Tommy</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Subway</hi> "(meaning two other men) "for that job at Cat-ford"—I said, "Well, it is not for the job at Cat-ford, but another one"—he said, "You will have to prove it; there's one thing, they can't identify me by the description in the paper"—I said, "You have had a fight with another man"—he said, "Yea, someone has put us away"—I said, "Very likely"—at the Station I said, "What is his name?"—he said, "Harris," but subsequently he said, "His name is James Beezer."</p>

               <p>as to taking him into custody for assaulting a lady, that was all he heard—this robbery created a sensation in the neighbourhood, and was talked about—three or four nights after two men were arrested; that was for the Cat-ford job—those two men were known to Beezer; they all lire in Mill Lane, but. they were men of a different description altogether—Beezer did not say he was put away in consequence of a fight in a publichouse—I made those notes of what passed at the Station, directly after I got there—I know that another lady was called to identify these men—I can't say whether that was in consequence of another outrage committed since the prisoners were in custody—I had nothing to do with it; I am not in that district—there is always an inspector in charge at the Police-station, and two or three men—I was in company with Inspector Pitman when a bag was found.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective P</hi>). About half-past one, on the morning of 24th, I went with Inspector Pitman to 40, Mill Lane—Donoghue, came outside, and I said, I snail arrest you for being concerned with another man in custody for robbery with violence at Rushey Green, Cat-ford, on the 14th inst"—he said, "Is my pal Harris locked up?" I said, "Yes"—by Harris he meant Beezer—he said, "When did you say it was, the 14th? that was on a Monday. I was not at Cat-ford that night; I can prove I was at Croydon that night, selling laces in the street; you can't prove that we done it, nor nobody else; it would take a lot to prove that. I think you have made a mistake; but you will do your best to do it, no doubt"—I took him to the Station, and after he was identified and charged he was put in a cell, and. Beezer was in the next cell—I was in the passage; the doors of the cells open into the passage, and the door from the passage opens into the inspector's office—there were no other prisoners in the two cells—about eleven a.m. Donoghue said to Beezer, "How are we going to get out of this? What shall we say? I wish we had that paper with our description in it; it don't answer to ours"—Beezer said, "Did the <hi rend="italic">split</hi> say anything to you about the fight we had? They know something; I said it was not about the <hi rend="italic">posh</hi> "(that is a slang term for money)—Donoghue said, "Yes; never mind, Jem, don't let it be down upon you yet; we shall be remanded till the woman gets well; but she won't know us; if that woman had recognised us it would have been all over with us; if we get sentenced, what can they give us?"—Beezer said, "They all will pick us out except one; never mind, cheer up, old boy"—I wrote this down as the men said it—I was not present when the prisoners were identified.</p>

               <p>November last I was attracted by screaming—I ran to my surgery door, looked over the gate, and saw somebody lying on the other side of the road calling out loudly—I went and rendered her assistance, and called for help—I recognised her at once—two men came up, and helped me to carry her into my house, where I made an examination; I found certain injuries to the left leg; subsequently at her own house I ascertained them to be serious injuries.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a domestic servant to Helene Heale, of Accatia House, Battersea—on Friday night, 23rd January, I was the last person up; at ten the house was fastened, and the windows shut—I was awoke about a quarter to five by hearing the handle of a door moving twice—my mistress and I went downstairs—we tried the handle and found it locked, and went to bed again—at six my mistress called me, and I went downstairs with two young ladies; I found a light, and all the doors open—I went straight for a policeman, who came back with me—two of the windows were broken just at the fastening—the kitchen window was half-way up, the lock was burst off the cupboard, and all the clothes turned out on the floor—we missed four dinner napkins, a tablecloth, and two cloaks—these produced are two of the napkins.</p>

I live at 21, Park Place, Clapham—I am a domestic servant, by the week, not regular—the prisoner is my brother; I live with him and my father, and a married sister and her husband—I was living there on 27th January—I remember the officer coming to search the room on Saturday, 28th; it might have been between three and four—there was no one in the house; he walked in without knocking; he did not show any warrant—he asked for my father—I said he was lying down—he said, "Has he come home drunk?"—I said, "Certainly not"—the detective was very insulting—the prisoner came home in the afternoon about half-past three; I was there all day—the plumber and the other workmen came in about half-past four or a little later—Mr. Mead asked me for a light, as it was getting rather dark—they left about five, or five or ten minutes past—the prisoner left between ten minutes or a quarter-past, it might have been later; that was the last time I looked at the clock—he left in plain clothes.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant</hi>). On August 16th I arrested Jarvis at 44, Long Lane, Bermondsey, and found there some circulars of E. Symons, 120, Gloucester Road, Camberwell, an envelope with the same address, and a book containing payments to Salisbury, Haydon and Symons—on August 31st I obtained a warrant for Symons' arrest, but could not find him at 120, Gloucester Road; I found his wife and family—I went there several times—his wife said he had gone to Australia—towards the end of December I found he was in custody at Peckham Police-station—the inspector read the warrant to him for conspiring with divers other persons, and obtaining goods—he made no reply—he had been arrested at Brixton by another officer.</p>
