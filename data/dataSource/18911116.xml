I carry on business at 131, Finsbury Pavement—I am proprietor of the <hi rend="italic">lndiarubber and Gutta Percha Traces Journal</hi>—I have other journals—in 1887 I became acquainted with the prisoner—I heard of him through my brother, a dresser in the hospital, where the prisoner was a patient suffering from some disease; I think it was more than accident—at my brother's instance I employed him, as a clerk, at 18s. a week—at first he had a definite salary; afterwards I allowed him a commission on canvassing for advertisements—I have some house property at New South<lb/>gate, and in March, 1889, I allowed the prisoner to live in one of the houses at a nominal salary of 7s. 6d. a week; practically he lived rent free—he collected the rents of the other houses, accounting to me for it—from time to time I had to find fault with him in regard to the business he did, also he got into little difficulties that I tad to help him out of—in consequence of that I had to stop his salary, and arranged to pay him only by commission on the work which he actually did—that was at the end of last year—I still allowed him to live in the house at Southgate and collect the rents—from something that came to my knowledge with regard to the Southgate property I communicated with him by letter on 17th September, and in answer I got this telegram, refusing to see me—I had not told him what I wanted to see him about—on the following day I received this letter; it is in his handwriting—in this letter he describes himself as my agent, and gives me a month's notice. (<hi rend="italic">The letter was put in and ready in it he stated that if the prosecutor attempted to take proceedings against him he would expose him</hi>)—I took that letter to my solicitors and showed it to them; I did not communicate with the prisoner by letter after that—this</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 4, King Street, Cheap<lb/>side—about 7th July the prisoner came to me and made representations with regard to some estate at Greenhithe; he proposed a mortgage of £5,000—on 16th July, after a report had come, the prisoner called at the office and proposed a loan of £60 to pay a pressing printer's account—I asked him if he had any judgment or anything else registered against him, or any action pending—he said, "No"—prior to that he had said that he was one of the six surveyors of the London School Board, appointed for the Lewisham district—I have ascertained that statement is not true—I would not have lent him any money if I had known there was any judgment against him, or any proceedings pending—it was on the faith of such answers that I drew a cheque for £60—the loan was to be for three or four days—he gave me a cheque, and said he had a bill or cheque that he was going to pay in to his bankers on Saturday morning, but it was not to be entered till Monday—I afterwards had some telegrams and letters asking me to hold it back—the cheque was paid in on the 20th July, and returned on the 21st—my clerk, on my behalf, made inquiries as to whether any judgments were entered against him—I myself searched and found that some were registered against him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the prisoner.</hi> I believe it was on the 2nd July that you called on me in reference to the loan on the Greenhthe property—I had the estate surveyed on 15th July—I wrote you a letter; this is a copy by one of my clerks. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Dear Sir,—Greenhithe—Referring to your application for a loan, our agent reports £3,000 might be advanced,</p>

               <p>subject to inquiries proving satisfactory")—it was on the 16th July that you suggested a loan of £60—for the purposes of that loan we should not make inquiries till a few hours before completing the mortgage—I said I should have to consult my partners—no one was present at our conversation on the next day when I handed you the cheque—I did not say anything about bankruptcy—I asked if any judgments were registered against you, or any proceedings; that is my usual question—when you came next day about eleven I gave you the cheque—I said, "You must give me yours in exchange"—there was no in<lb/>terest charged—there had been attendances between 7th and 16th—I did not regard it in the light of interest—you sent me your cheque for £62 two days afterwards—the day before my cheque was to have been paid I received a telegram from you, asking me to withhold it for a day or two, as you had been disappointed—I did not withhold it; the cheque was returned, and I immediately issued a warrant for the amount; I filed a petition against you—civil proceedings were commenced on 25th July; on 16th September I determined to take criminal proceedings—it was somewhere about 25th August that I found out the judgments against you—I said at the Mansion House that I thought it was just after I lent you the money, but I was mistaken; it was not so, because I was away for my vacation at that time—in the civil proceedings execution was issued on 30th July—one petition in bankruptcy was filed against you on 25th August; that was heard on September 12th—I did not know your true character, but on 15th September Mr. Cawthorn was good enough to give me that information—it was two clear days after the petition that I commenced these criminal proceedings; the petition was heard on the 12th, and I commenced criminal proceedings on the 16th—I applied at the Mansion House for a warrant; they did not grant it, the Lord Mayor thought it should be a summons; after the summons was issued I did not try to settle the matter civilly, friends of yours came to me and asked me if I would settle it—I sent a bill of exchange at Mr. Rees' desire, but I did not offer to withdraw from the prosecution, except on leave of the Court—when I lent you the £60 I did not think it important to have it put in writing, I trust people; you had a very good introduction to me; I have no recollection of your mentioning that you had good security to give—you did not say that you had valued for the School Board, you said you were one of the six surveyors for the Lewisham district.</p>

               <p>my mother is landlady of the house—the two Davises lodged there, and at our previous house, 17, Auckland Street, in the name of Burns, for eighteen months—they occupied the first-floor front together, at 3s. 6d. a week—the payments have been kept up—Cook came there to visit them every morning at 9.30—he was pretty regular in his hour of coming, and stayed till 6.30 or 6.45, and Davis always left with him when I was at home—I never knew him to go out without Davis—I never went into their room—it was both a living room and a sleeping room—both the Davises were out at times; they had a key, and always locked the door when they went out—I saw Davis and Cook go out together on the night of the 13th; they were a little late that night—I never heard Cook addressed by any other name by the Davises in his presence.</p>

I am a bootmaker, and live at 24, St. John's Terrace, Hackney Road—I let two rooms on the first floor to the prisoner and his wife; the front room was occupied by the children, of whom there were three, the little baby was in the back room, which was occupied by the prisoner and his wife; they were not quiet people, they were rather quarrelsome, I mean they quarrelled between themselves—they were both addicted to drink—on a Saturday night, about three weeks before the 23rd October, I came home about twelve at night, my wife told me something about a disturbance upstairs; she went upstairs, and I went up shortly afterwards—I kept outside the door for some little time; when I went in I saw my wife holding the prisoner by the hand; he had a knife in his hand, something similar to this; I cannot recognise it, I noticed the blade—he called his wife a f----wh----, and said he would kill her—he said several times he would murder her—he used very bad expressions—Mrs. Harvey was very drunk—the prisoner was not drunk; he might have had a drop of drink, but not what I should call drunk—shortly after that I went into the room, and the prisoner cried out to my wife to let him go, because the knife was cutting his hand—she held him very tight—she said she would not let him go unless he would put the knife in his pocket—he seemed to become pacified a little, and he promised he would do so, and he did so, he shut up the knife and put it in his pocket—he said that his wife had a knife too, she was sitting in a chair against the wall—my wife was standing between him and the wife, or rather between the prisoner and me, his wife was next to me—I looked to see whether there was a knife, I could not see one at first, he said she had one; I looked again and there was one, a table knife under her arm, on what I should call a tie—I took it away—after that the prisoner went out—he came in shortly afterwards and was going to bed—I begged him to have no more disturbance, he said he would not, and I heard nothing more that night—on 24th October I came home about twenty minutes past twelve at night—(I don't know whether I saw him during the clay) I went into the kitchen and had supper with my wife and my two boys—shortly after that there was some little dis<lb/>turbance overhead, which was the prisoner's bedroom—it was very slight, as if they were scuffling about, or something of that, they seemed to be going from one room to the other—shortly after the noise became louder, and all of a sudden there was a scream—I got up with the intention of running upstairs; as I was about to do so the prisoner came running down the stairs—he said, "Mr. Hester, I have done it; I have stabbed her"—I do not remember whether he said anything else at that time, or whether he showed me the knife then, or whether it was when I came downstairs—I ran upstairs, I stopped about three or four stairs from the top, the poor woman was on the landing—she only had on her chemise—she was streaming all over with blood—the landing</p>

                  </hi>. I am a divisional surgeon of police—on the early morning of 25th October, about twenty minutes past one, I was called to 24, St. John's Terrace—I there saw the deceased woman—my assistant had preceded me; I found him there—the deceased was lying on her back on the ground, with her head towards the ante-room, and her feet towards the door—she was faint and collapsed, and suffering severely from loss of blood—there was a wound in the upper part of the left breast, from which blood had flown very freely—she was lying in a largo pool of blood—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189111160016"/>
               <p>there was another pool of blood near the door, and a third smaller pool of blood near the table in the centre of the room—we did all we could for her in the way of treatment, and when she had sufficiently rallied my assistant accompanied her to the infirmary on the ambulance—before she was removed to the infirmary she made a statement to me, which I took down from her lips in writing—before I did so she said, "Doctor, am I dying?"—I replied, "You are in a very critical condition"—she then said, "Doctor, I know I am dying"—I then said, "How did it happen?"—she was faint, but conscious—she was not rambling in her mind at all. <hi rend="italic">By the</hi>

I could not say positively that she was dying at the time—I thought most likely she would die—I thought if she died at all it would probably be within a few hours—I thought it was just possible she might live, but very improbable—I had not spoken to her before she put the question, "Am I dying?"—I had been with her about ten minutes—she uttered those words in a some<lb/>what feeble tone; she appeared to realise her serious condition—I should not like to say that she really thought she was at the point of death.</p>

I am medical superintendent of the Shore<lb/>ditch Infirmary—on 25th October, about three in the morning, the deceased was admitted into the infirmary, suffering from a punctured wound in the left side of the breast; there had been considerable hemorrhage, but it had stopped for the time—about one in the afternoon it broke out again, and she died at twenty minutes past three on the Sunday afternoon—when I first saw her there was a very remote chance for her, the only chance was if the bleeding did not recur, that is a very critical matter, depending on the least movements of the patient—the hemorrhage was the direct cause of death—I made a post-mortem ex<lb/>amination—the direction of the wound was slightly upwards, backwards and outwards, a little over two inches deep; there were recent bruises on the outside of the right arm, and on the inside there was an abrasion on the right knuckle, outside—on the corner of the upper lip on the right side of the face there was a recent bruise—she was about four months' pregnant.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Stauffer, Sons and Co., watch manufacturers, of 15, Charterhouse Street—I know a man named Broske—I saw him first in June; he came alone, and wanted to see some watches—I showed him some, he took a note of the price, and asked what terms I would give him—I said that depended on the references, but generally we preferred cash—he said he would call again—he came again, not alone, but I do not know who was with him—he gave me as references Messrs. Venables Brothers, and Hudson and Towell—he came again alone, and we told him we had taken the inquiries of his references and would give him some credit—he showed me invoices to show that he was dealing in watches—he called again, still in June, to select the watches, and the prisoner was with him—he said, "This is a friend who comes with me to help me select the goods"—I showed them some watches; they said that the price was too high—Broski asked whether we had any job lots; I showed him some, and he gave an order for about £350 worth—we agreed to take one-third in cash, one-sixth in thirty days, a fourth in ninety days, and a fourth in four months—the prisoner was present during the whole of the interview—I after<lb/>wards went with the goods, and was paid one third by a cheque for £97 10s. by some man at Broski's address—I took £2 10s. dis<lb/>count off, and received these bills (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) dated June 19th—the cheque was paid into the bank next day and came back the same day—on Monday, the 22nd, I was on my way to Broski's place and met him—I asked him why the cheque had not been paid—he said it was owing to some mistake in the signature, and gave me a £100 note, which I handed over the counter to the bank manager, and he gave me the change and the cheque—Broski frequently called afterwards for watches, but I put him off, and did not give him any more—the first bill was for £76, and came due on 22nd July—it was presented and met; and on the same day Broski and the prisoner called</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189111160019"/>
               <p>again and wanted more goods on credit—I said, "There is still £175 coming due, and I do not think we should like to increase the credit"—they said that a bill had just been met—Broski afterwards showed me the contract (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with the Waterbury Watch Co., but the prisoner was not present then—I asked Broski where the goods went—he said part of them he sold on weekly instalments, and others he had shipped to Roumania—we agreed to let him have a little more credit, not over £200; one-third in cash, one-third at one month, and the rest at two months—the goods were delivered—on 27th July I received this cheque for £53 4s.; he asked me not to present it that day—we presented it next day, and it was returned unpaid—we then went to his place, but did not see him—I did not see him again, and did not see the prisoner again till he was in custody—I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on 30th July; it is from Broski, asking for a lady's gold watch—I did not supply it—altogether the amount of goods obtained by Broski is about £550, of which £174 has been paid—there is a further bill for goods obtained between the two transactions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> They came once or twice together before we decided to let Broski have the watches—I looked to Broski for payment—I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> understand what he said; I spoke English to him—I understood that the prisoner was there to help him select the watches, because Broski did not know about watches, and not to help him in his English—I took the first lot of watches, and Solomon Levy, a witness for the prosecution, gave me the cheque—he did not say that he was Broski's son; but I asked for Mr. Broski, and he said, "My father is out, but he left me to settle everything"—the prisoner was not there when Broski showed me the contract of the Waterbury Company, and I agreed to let him have the two lots of goods—after the last cheque was returned I went to Broski's place in the Commercial Road, and there saw Levy, who I had seen before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Broski was a tailor, and we could not make out how he should have anything to do with watches to such an extent—I did not take any notice of the references, but the invoices from other watch-makers gave me confidence; it proved that he had a market for witches—the prisoner was there then; but I don't believe he came after he selected the second lot; that was a few days before the production of the contract, within a week.</p>

I am clerk to Wheeler Brothers, clock merchants, ✗Tudor Street, Blackfriars—about July 10th or 11th I first saw Broski with a man named Palmer—he wanted to do business with me, and gave me as references Venables and Hudson and Towell—he bought woollen goods on the 11th to the amount of £188—he was to pay half cash and the balance in one or two months—they were to be sent to 231, Com<lb/>mercial Road; I went there on the 13th, and later in the day I saw Levy, I think it was—he gave me this cheque for £91 10s., and some bills which Broski accepted; he was there—I paid the cheque into the bank,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189111160020"/>
               <p>and it was returned dishonoured on 14th July—I went to see Broski that day—he said that the cheque had been presented at the bankers too soon, and it must be re-presented; it was presented again and returned on 16th July—I went with it that day to the Commercial Road, and saw the prisoner behind the counter in his shirt sleeves—Broski was not there—I paid I had called respecting a cheque for £91 10s. which was dishonoured—he said, "Oh, I know all about that; Broski has been out all day trying to collect money, and has been unsuccessful; there is nothing to fear; he is perfectly safe, and you are sure to receive your money in a day or two"—I said, "That will not satisfy me, I must see Broski; I am instructed not to leave without the money"—the prisoner went into a side room, and Broski came out and said something to the prisoner in a foreign language; he then went into the back room again, and came out with a letter and handed it to the prisoner, who read it and gave it to me—this is it: "231, Commercial Road. I am very much engaged to-day; will see you without fail to-morrow at 9.30, and arrange matters.—Per L. <hi rend="smallCaps">BROSKI</hi>, L. B."—next day Broski and the prisoner called at my place—the prisoner said, "Broski is an ignorant man, and I have come to explain the matter; I am a friend of hi*, and have known him a number pf years; I know him to be a straightforward man and perfectly safe; the money for your cheque will be paid in a day or two"—they left a bill for £148 18s. as security for the cheque, but they both said that they wanted the balance between the cheque and the bill, in goods—I told them I did not see my way to doing that under the circumstances, and they left—I wrote and telegraphed to Broski after that, and received in reply a telegram and this letter, in the same hand as the last: "Gentlemen,—I promised to call on you yesterday, but was not successful in receiving the money, and must ask you to give me a further extension of time till Monday next"—I have never received a farthing—on 29th July I went again, but did not see Broski; I never saw him again, nor did I see the prisoner till he was in custody—Broski showed me some money when I went to get the cheque.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I cannot say how much he showed me; there were notes—when I went on 29th July I saw Solomon Levy—it was Broski who paid the bill for £148 18s. as security for the cheque—we trusted Broski, the transactions were with him from beginning to end—the prisoner acted more as interpreter than anything else—Broski spoke English imperfectly, but he could be understood—Palmer did not come to interpret on the first occasion, he introduced Broski—I have called on Palmer in Aldgate—he has never been arrested.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I went there I saw the prisoner in his shirt sleeves, and he gave me this assurance about Broski; I believed him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am secretary to the Waterbury Watch Company, Snow Hill—on 10th July the prisoner and Broski called to inquire our export terms for watches; the prisoner spoke, and explained that he came to interpret for Broski, as he spoke English very badly—I did not have his name, but I had Broski's card—Broski understood all that was said, and if he wanted to say anything he did so—the prisoner asked if we would give him credit; I said that our terms were cash; they said if we gave them good references would we give them Some credit; I said if the references were satisfactory we might, but we</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189111160021"/>
               <p>could only supply goods to those parts of the world where we had as agents—they mentioned Roumania, Bulgaria and Servia, and said they were going to export there—I said we were open for those countries—the prisoner said that Broski was a man of considerable means, and had property in Odessa, and was doing a considerable business in watches a large export trade, and produced a number of invoices up to £600 or £700—they gave the names of Venables Brothers, and Hudson and Towell, as references—I said I would make inquiries, and if the references were satisfactory I would write further, and they left—I wrote a letter the same night, in consequence of which they called next day, July 11th, and I introduced them to Mr. Rankin, the manager of the company, who showed them samples of watches—I said that if they were supplied with watches they must sign a contract to ship to those countries; but it was understood that Broski was the man who was buying—our offer was accepted on those terms, and the prisoner selected the watches—they were delivered at 231, Commercial Road, the address given by Broski—I was cognisant of the subsequent proceedings, but the negotia<lb/>tions were conducted by Mr. Palmer—after parting with the goods on July 5th I had no notion of their being sold outright to the prisoner in England, it was directly contrary to the agreement—that applies to all the parcels—I had no notion that the consignment I sold was sold within a quarter of its value within forty-eight hours, but I discovered it through Mr. Freeman, who purchased some of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My contract was with Broski exclusively; I did not know the prisoner's name or address; I considered that he was acting as Broski'8 mouthpiece or interpreter—I had sent somebody to see the refer<lb/>ences—about July 28th I found out that the goods were sold in Hatton Garden, and issued a writ against Broski for damages, for the breach of his agreement not to sell the watches in this country, but found that Broski had disappeared—I afterwards applied before Mr. Dickenson for a warrant against the prisoner, but it was held over, and subsequently Mr. Montagu Williams granted a warrant—Mr. Gill was present, but he left the Court, I believe, thinking the case was not coming on, and the solicitor asked that it might be allowed to stand over, which was allowed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> In the first instance I was inclined to treat the matter as a breach of contract, we had no suspicion that there was any fraud—Broski has absconded—I believed the prisoner's statement, or Broski would not have had the goods.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Hudson and Towell—I was in Messrs. Venables' employ two years, when I became acquainted with Broski—when he left he owed my present firm £600 of a debt of £1,600; he had paid off £1,000—I received cheques and bills of Broski's; they were returned if notice was given that he could not meet a cheque;—he may have given us such notice twelve times in twelve months—the £600 represents bills, not cheques.</p>

I keep the Coach and Horses, Minories—in July the prisoner, Broski, and Levy came there together—they went upstairs on two or three occasions; and while upstairs I heard high words between the prisoner and Broski, and stood on the staircase and called out, "I won't allow any words in my place"; they did not desist, and I went into the room and told them I would not allow it—there were pens and ink on the mantelpiece, but they were not writing—Levy was not with them, but he afterwards came to the bar and I served him—that officer (Pearce) afterwards came to me but I made no statement to him—he asked me whether they were writing, and I said that they might have been—I did not say that I saw them writing, but I did not know what—</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cashier in the London and Suburban Bank, Leadenhall Street—Mr. Broski opened an account there on, I believe, 22nd May, 1891—there was a payment of £37 to credit, and payments continued to be made into the account down to July 31st—on 10th July the credit balance was £2 3s. 4d.—on 18th July £79 15s. was paid in, which assisted to meet a bill of Stafford's of £76, and on 22nd July the credit balance was £6 1s. 3d., which was reduced on the 24th by £2 1s. 3d., and on the 31st it was reduced to 1s. 3d., and the account was closed—the total amount of credit from the opening was £1,250 roughly—on June 9th I find a bill dishonoured, Nodman £41 15s., and on 10th June, Mr. Venables £20—three bills of Nodman were dishonoured on June 10th for about £200, and Mr. Stauffer's bill £79 10s.; then Nodman again, and then Venables £20; Wheeler Brothers, 14th July, cheque dishonoured for £19 10s.; 15th July Venables £27, 16th July Wheeler cheque, re-presented, and so on—on 28th July Broski called at the bank about a cheque in favour of the Waterbury Watch Company, which was returned marked "Refer to drawer"—I believe the Waterbury Watch Company sent to ask whether it was met; I do not know what happened to it, we have no further record than the first occasion, and I presume it was not presented a second time—I do not know how it was taken up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Cheques were presented when there was not sufficient to meet them, but very often Mr. Broski would come and say, "Is such and such a cheque in?" and we said, "No, we have returned it," and he would say, "I will go and pick it up"—that might have happened with most of these cheques—a number of cheques were paid to Nodman, 23rd May, £100; 3rd June, £28 11s.; 16th June, £66 10s.; 22nd June, £66 0s. 6d.; 26th June, £40; 10th July, £48 14s.—on 22nd May, £37 was paid in in cash, on 28th May, £30 in cash and notes; on 11th June, £123 10s. in cash; on 22nd June, £67 in cash, and on 30th June, £70 in cash.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the manager of the Blue lion public-house, Gray's Inn Road—on the evening of 11th October I was serving, when the prisoners came in with two other men—Wright called for a pot of stout and mild, price sixpence; he gave me half-a-crown—I gave him two shillings change, and put the half-crown in the till; I said not detect it was counterfeit—at that time Miss Brasure came into the bar—she called me; I was then serving at the other end—she made a, statement to me and showed me a florin which I saw her break in the tester on the counter—I spoke to the landlord's brother, Mr. Davis—previous to doing so I looked into the till and saw there two half-crowns and some other silver; one of the half-crowns was bad, and was the one I had received, and the other, a good one, had been given in payment for cigars after the florin was detected to be bad—the prisoners left the house, and Davis and another followed them—I had cleared the till about an hour before—the good coin was given by Wright to Miss Brasure after this coin was returned—Wright took no part in the conversation.</p>

On the evening of 11th October, in con<lb/>sequence of a communication, I went into the Norwich Castle with Edbrook—to Wright, who was pointed out to me, I said, "You will have to come over to the Blue Lion public-house with me, as I have received in<lb/>formation</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189111160028"/>
               <p>that you tendered counterfeit coin there"—both prisoners heard it; they said together, "Lot us drink our beer first, and we will come over with you"—they did that, and I took Wright, and Edbrook took McClinchy into custody—immediately we got outside the public-house McClinchy struck Edbrook on the side of the head with his fist—the inspector threw him to the ground—while down ho threw two handfuls of money from his trousers pockets into the road—I pulled Wright over to where the money fell, and scrambled some of it up out of the gutter, and some more was handed to me by a woman; I saw her pick it up—there was no paper round the coins, they were loose in his pockets—there were fifteen florins, four half-crowns, all counterfeit, and one shilling good money—on Wright I found, at the station, part of a counterfeit florin, in his top waistcoatpocket; it matches the two pieces afterwards produced by Mr. Davis at the station—I also found on. him 16s. silver, 1s. 9d. bronze, all good—I searched McClinchy, but found nothing on him—the coin from the Norwich Castle was handed to me; that from the Blue Lion was brought to mo by Davis.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 78, Kenton Street, Brunswick Square—I am now a clerk at the Polytechnic, in Regent Street—I know the prisoner; he informed me that he was a Dane—I was formerly in his employment as clerk, from October, 1888, to June, 1889—he was a private inquiry agent in the Strand; I forget the number—during the time I was with him I had frequent opportunities of seeing him write, so as to become acquainted with his handwriting; to the best of my belief this letter (A) is his handwriting, the envelope is different; I don't know anything about the envelope—this letter (B) is also in his handwriting—I think this post-card (C) is in the same writing; I would not Be confident as to that; this document (H. C.) is also his writing; also this (E. T.)—he was not in the habit of writing in any particular ink—I have seen him write printing letters—this document (S. J.) is of a similar character to those which ho was in the habit of using from time to time; both the envelope and the letter—when I say printing, I mean writing as though printing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first met the prisoner in the Strand; I was in want—I did not meet him in the street, I went to his office—I was very much down in the world and hungry—I did not ask him for food and money; he gave me money to get food, for which I was very thankful—he gave me employment; that was principally at his private house, where I cleaned knives and so forth—when my duties were over there my employ<lb/>ment</p>

               <p>I won't say positively, or something similar to that; I saw him do some<lb/>thing on this document S.

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The letters A and B are in the prisoner's ordinary hand<lb/>writing—I never had any charge made against me during the time I was in his service—when I was given into custody the inspector refused to take the charge, and said the prosecutor must take out a warrant, which he never did—no proceedings nave ever been taken against me upon it. <hi rend="italic">Letter A wan read at follow</hi>:—"Madam,—Take notice that if you do not pay me the sum of £500, I dash your brains out as soon as you read this note, by a dynamite explosion. I stand in want of the said sum, and I must have it, or perish in the attempt. Remember, madam, that desperate men, or rather a man brought to despair by the villainy of a woman, will do desperate things, and indeed a woman shall pay for it. Be careful how you proceed in this case. You may be advised to apply to the police for protection, but if you do you will find that their pro<lb/>tection is not much better than that of your lap-dog; if the English detectives cannot even apprehend the man who killed on the open streets in Whitechapel seven or eight women, then indeed their detective qualities must be limited; in fact, skill should not protect you from my hand. If I do not get the sum I have demanded, understand, I am firmly determined to have it or have your life as the value for it. If you estimate your life so low that you would not nay £600 for, then I must leave you to your own reflections. Do not believe that it is my intention to dash your brains out with a revolver, that, indeed, would be a mad<lb/>man's work. No, madam; a thin cake of dynamite placed between some mounted fulminate of silver, and the whole placed between the door and mat on the floor upon which you have to pass, or under your seat in the church, or even under the cushion of your carriage, will immediately ex<lb/>plode the moment the weight of your body comes upon it, and dash you to pieces. I intend to do what I say; I have been ruined by a woman, and a woman shall pay for it. I have sent a letter like this to nine other ladies for the purpose, that if you do not pay I will dash your brains out, and you will then serve to others of us an example of what they have to expect if they do not pay up If you feel disposed to comply with my request, please then to insert in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> the following advertisement: 'A. M. M. will comply,' and an address will be forwarded to you for where to address the money, or it may be that it may be called for, only mark well that treachery on your part will be punished with instant death, as I am well prepared for such an emergency. I am sorry to trouble you in this way, but I must have the money. Hoping you will be sensible enough to give the required reply, I remain, Madam, yours truly, a.m. M. Your last day for payment the 24th July. Mrs. B----, 8, Grosyenor Place. Madam, if you have not the sum I demand at hand, then inform me when you can pay it. I know that you are not poor, and you cannot miss a paltry sum. please insert the above number in your advertisement, No. 5." <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>.

I could see you yesterday, although your detective Smart could commit perjury when well bribed; you dog, you could not see me. Bo careful, and do not come in my way; for, sure as this is written by me, the man whom you have injured by your crime of perjury, I dash your brains out the moment you come near me. I will see your heart blood before they get me again by your perjury. My hand is used to firearms, and by heaven I shall not miss you when I get you in my sight"; addressed Police Sergeant James, Tottenham Court Road Station—I was attached to the Tottenham Court Road station at that time, and I am stationed there now—on 26th September I went to Maiden Railway Station with Detective Holder, and there saw the prisoner—I caught him in the roar, and said, "Grande, consider yourself in custody"—he said, "What for?"—I said, "For sending letters to ladies demanding money and threatening to murder thorn"—on the way to the station he said, "You dirty scoundrel! this is your</p>

I shall soon be out of this, and then look out; I will not shoot you, I will put about six inches of steel into your back"—at the station he did not give his address—he was not asked his address at Maiden Station—after I left him there I went to No. 1, The Oaklands, Acacia Road, Maiden, and there searched the two front rooms on the ground floor—I there found, amongst other things, this cigar-box, tied with a strong string, fitted with two springs, one on each side, with a patch of gunpowder; two bottles of acid, and several other articles—I afterwards took the prisoner by train to London—I had handcuffed the prisoner at Maiden Police-station.—as we were on the platform, the train was coming in; I was holding the prisoner's right hand with my left, and as we were getting into the train the prisoner pushed me very hard towards it, and on getting into the train he said, "You scoundrel! it was my intention to push you under the train; I would not mind doing it"—he continued the whole of the way from Maiden to Waterloo making use of threats of violence towards me—he said, "You, as a clever detective, could not catch me; I have seen you many a time—when I sent a boy from the Messenger Company to the bank in Victoria Street, I saw you, I was in the churchyard; and you. the gentleman detective, you b—fool, you could have seen me; I saw you in Hyde Park following the poor little boy, you b----fool, and you could not see me"—I said, "Yes; that is what you said in the letter you sent me"—he said, "Me send you a letter?"—I said, "Yes"—he then said, "Ah, yes; that will be my line of defence; if any letters have been sent, it was you, you dirty dog, who have sent it; I will settle with you when I get through this; and it is a good job you have got me now, as I was off to New York on Monday"—and then, shaking his handcuffs, he said, "If I could only take these cuffs off I would take my hands round your neck and strangle you, you dog, I would."</p>

Whatever shall I do, after what she has said? But I shall stand a good chance to get out of it if the lady does not come; and the man Hall, of course, swears to my writing, because I once charged him; that is a very serious thing for me; but never mind, I have got the best man in London to defend me; he is up to all the tricks of the trade"—Mr. Arthur Newton, of Marlborough Street, was appearing for him at that time.</p>

I am the prisoner's wife—we have been married about 32 years—in this year we were living at the Yorkshire Hotel, Euston Road—on 25th September, this year, there was a quarrel between us, and the police were called in—the prisoner had threatened to stab me with a carving knife, and to hang for me; he was bound over to keep the peace—lately we have occupied separate bedrooms, for two nights only—early on the morning of 20th October he followed me into my room and began to use vile language—we were then sleeping in the same bed-room—I said I would not have it—he said, "If you won't have that, you shall have this," and he took a razor from the top of the cupboard and cut my throat—I was sitting on a chair, not undressed—I put up my hand to prevent him, and the razor cut my thumb—I struggled with him—he then left me—I saw him go out at the door—I was taken to the hospital, and remained there some time—I have not quite recovered yet—I am still an out-patient.</p>

I know nothing about it"—I took him to the station and searched him, and found this revolver, perfectly new, loaded in six chambers, also forty-four cart<lb/>ridges—he said he intended blowing out his own brains that night—he said, "If there is anything the matter with my wife, it is the bullies and prostitutes in the house that have done it."</p>

On 27th October I was with Cox and saw the prisoner in Pimlico Road, and said we were officers, and should arrest him for forging and uttering a Bank of England note—he said, "I know nothing about it"—he was taken to the station and charged; he made no reply—we went to his address and found this box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I told him he had cashed a note at Mr. Bromwich's shop, and given the name of Captain Thurston—we took the box to the station, and he said, "That belongs to my friend"—I said, "We cannot find the key, and your friend says it is yours"—I found a key on him which fitted the lock, and found in the box a card<lb/>case with the name of "A. B. Thurston, Esq., Naval and Military Club," a book of cheques, and a number of letters—I was afterwards informed that he wished to see me in the cell; he said that he cashed the note—I asked from whom he received it; he said, "From a man outside Tattersall's "; I said, "Can you give me his name and address?"—he said, "No, I did not get much out of it, I only got a sovereign for cashing it"—he said his friend's name was Wilson.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an importer of fancy goods at 75, Wimpole Street—I engaged the prisoner as traveller about March, 1888, at £2 10s. a week salary and I per cent. commission and £1 1s. a week for expenses—it was his duty to account for money from customers the next day or on Saturday night—he had no authority to endorse cheques; it was his duty to send them up to me—at the end of each week he ren<lb/>dered</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189111160041"/>
               <p>me an account in this form, showing the amounts received on one side, and the disbursements on the other—he did not account for £8 13s. 3d. received from Mr. Maggs on 13th May, 1891, or for £4 12s. 3d. from Mr. Bradford on 14th May, or for £2 3s. 9d. from Mr. A. Moore on 29th July—these three receipts are in the prisoner's writing—I received this letter from him on May 14th, in which he says that he has received £8 13s. 3d. from Mr. Maggs, and he accounted for it; Mr. Maggs owed me £8 9s. 11d. in December, 1890—the prisoner did not account to me for £8 5s. 6d. received in settlement of that account—this is not my endorsement on Mr. Maggs' cheque for £8 5s. 6d., it is the prisoner's writing—I did not authorise him to endorse it—my accounts are sent out in January, April, July, and October—this account of Mr. Maggs', of £8 9s. 11d. would be sent to him in April as not being paid—the account for £8 13s. 3d. would not go in till July—I discharged the prisoner in July, 1891; end when my accounts were sent in in September I received a great many of them back as having been paid—I caused inquiries to be made, and the prisoner was taken in custody—when he left in July, only his commission account was made out—he saw it before he left—he asked me what the balance due to me was; I told him about £5, without taking into account the embezzlements.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was a good traveller; the business increased while he was in my employ—I gave him a character afterwards—he was in employment at the time of his arrest—my clerk keeps my books—I have examined them and give evidence from them—if the prisoner was in town the clerk had to enter any money received; if he was in the country the clerk received the money and entered it in the books—he has not complained that the guinea a week for travelling expenses was insufficient—he complained two years ago that he found it difficult to travel on the expenses—he has been three years in my employ—he had to carry parcels round, big boxes; he charged me with that as excess luggage—at one time he deducted eleven shillings for excess luggage when there was none—I do not suggest that that was a fraud—I did not send him on a three days' tour and give him only £2 for expanses; he was sent for one day and stayed out three days, and wrote that he had cashed several small amounts at Brighton,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Mr. Maggs lives at Eastbourne—December 10th was the day the £8 5s. 6d. was received; I do not think he started till the morning of the 10th; ho had £2 with him for expenses—he came home the third clay, and accounted for the £2 17s. 6d., £2 11s. 5d., and £1 5s. 10d., all received in cash according to his statement—he was actually paid £8 14s. 9d. while he was those two days at Eastbourne—this is the account he rendered for the week—he accounts for his expenses on the other side—if he spent more there was no reason why he should not put it down; there was no arrangement that he was not to spend more than a guinea a week; I allowed him more at Christmas because ho had more luggage—if ho showed me that his railway fare cost £2 4s. 4d. it would have been allowed, but he never suggested it—I did not give him an unblemished character when he left, but I knew nothing of this embezzlement at that time—I discharged him for irregularities.</p>

I am a money-lender, and carry on business as Walter Wood, and as Clay—I have known the defendant about five years—on July 16th he owed me £14—he called and asked me to lend him £5, as he had an opportunity of buying a parcel of goods which, he would be able to make £10 or £14 of—I said, "You owe me £14, I had rather not increase it;" he pressed me very much, and said, "I will give you 32s. for the use of it for a month"—I was very reluctant—he pressed me again—I said, "Very well; show me the receipt for your rent up to the present time, and I will let you have the money"—he said, "My rent is paid"—I said, "Show me the receipt"—he said, "The receipt is locked up in my desk at home"—this was between twelve and one o'clock—he lives at Clapham, about three miles and a half off—I said, "Go home and fetch it; I shall be here till six o'clock"—he said, "I have no time to do that"—he said, "I will write you a letter to satisfy you that my rent is paid"; and wrote this letter: "For your satisfaction in making me the above advance, I state that my rent for the above house is paid up to June 24th, 1891. A. Shillinglaw"—I gave him £5 in cash, and he gave me this promissory note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I next saw him on August 11th, when ho came to my office and said,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189111160043"/>
               <p>"I find the goods I wanted to buy cost a little more money, I want. £3 10s."—I gave it to him at once, believing that his rent was paid—when the bills came due they were dishonoured, and my solicitor took proceedings in the Mayor's Court, and obtained judgment, but recovered nothing; he set up a bogus claim, the Sheriff had to withdraw, and I have lost the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have carried on business for seven years—my dealings with the defendant began about five years ago, when I lent him cash at about the same rate of interest, but in this case he offered it; I did not charge him—I do not know that I charged him about 270 per cent.—I look upon it as accommodation, not as interest—in the other case it was £3 10s. for a week; I have not taken the trouble to calculate whether that was about 700 per cent.—I trade as Wood in Furnival's Inn, and as Josolyne at 70, Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury—I have traded as Johnson in London Wall, and as Clay in Cheapside, but I have given that office up—I did not lend him £3 10s. on August 8th—I keep no books at all; my bills are my books, and my banker's pass-book; I have no memorandum from which I can say how many transactions I have had with the defendant during the last six years—I have a cheque-book, but I paid the £3 10s. by cash; I generally give cash under £10, and for all transactions under £10 I have no record. (<hi rend="italic">A letter was here put in from the defendant to the witness enclosing</hi> 22s. 6d. <hi rend="italic">for interest, and asking him to renew the bill</hi>)—I believe I sued him in the Mayor's Court for £10 2s. and get judgment—I believe I taxed my costs on the ordinary £10 scale; if I had given him credit for the 22s. it would have been under the £10 scale—I gave the same evidence at the Police-court, I believe, as I have given here; and the Alderman dismissed the charge with the remark that the rate of interest was ex<lb/>orbitant—he did not say that no Jury would convict—I was bound over to prosecute.</p>

I live at 63, Kimberley Road, Clapham, and am landlord of the defendant's house—on 16th July this year he owed two quarters' rent; it was not paid till I put a broker in at the end of August—as soon as I knew the Sheriff was in I gave notice to him—the broker sold the goods; they are not removed from the premises.</p>

I live at 53, Bygrove Street, Poplar, and am a boiler maker—the prisoner lodged at the same house and slept in the same bed with me—on a Sunday morning, about seven a.m., I was in bed undressed, when the prisoner, who had been sleeping in the kitchen, came in with a walking-stick in his hand and said, "I have a good</p>

I am landlord of 53, Bygrove Street, Poplar, and am a riveter—about seven a.m. on this Sunday morning my attention was attracted by a noise in the room occupied by the prisoner and prosecutor—I came outside in my night-clothes and stopped a short time; and thon I hoard a scuffle, having previously heard heavy threats—I tried to put my trousers on—I found the prosecutor on the floor, and the prisoner kneeling by the side of him, with one arm round him, and punching him with the other—I saw two blows given with his fist—my trousers were loose, and I could not lend a helping hand—I saw the prisoner with this hatchet measuring his distance;. the prosecutor was rather out of his reach; he turned the hatchet round, measured his distance, and made a blow; but the hatchet came in contact with the mantelpiece, which broke the blow, and I clutched the hatchet and dragged the prisoner, who got his arm round my neck, from his knees—I got a slight scratch in so doing—I went and tried to find a policeman, and was not present when the prisoner was arrested—there was a good deal of blood, blood on the brick fender and floor—the prosecutor's face was cut, and had scars, and was terribly bruised all over.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Gaze and Sons, tourist agents, Piccadilly Circus—I recognise this note by the word Blackburn on the back of it; a man came in and asked me to change it one Thursday about 5.45p m.; I did so, and he left; I paid it into the chief office the following day—the man was in the office three minutes, he was in a great hurry; he jumped out of a cab, and said, "Can you change a country note for me?"—I said, "Yes; we usually charge 1d. in the pound"—he said, "I usually pay sixpence"—I said, "Make it sixpence"—nearly a fortnight afterwards Mr. Lawley fetched me to the Blue Posts; he kept me outside a little while, and then said, "Now come in, there's a lot: of people there, and the man you think is the robber is among them; I want you to look at them, and «ay if you see the man who tendered the note"—I picked out the prisoner—Mr. Lawley did not point him out in any way.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The man who came to my place was an entire stranger to me—there was nothing remarkable in the transaction—an entry of sixpence was put into the book next morning—there is a screen to prevent people from putting their hands over the counter—I described the man as dressed in a dark coat with a tall hat—that is my belief—I said at the Police-court that I did not know what to say, and I would not swear to the prisoner—the man who changed the note was about the prisoner's height; a dark man, about 5 feet 7 inches high, with a dark moustache, and shaved at the sides—when he was arrested he had the slightest possible growth, two or three days' beard—he had no imperial on his chin when he was arrested—I do not think he had any hair except a dark moustache.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed at Messrs. Gaze's office, 4, Northum<lb/>berland Avenue—on 15th October, about 6.20 p.m., a man brought in a £5 Bank of Lancaster note and asked for change—I said there was a charge of sixpence for cashing it—he said, "That is all right, the usual charge"; I got the money from Mr. Graves, the head cashier, and gave it to him—the conversation lasted about three minutes—there is no screen in my office; I have a clear look across the counter—about 28th October I was taken to Bow Street, and picked the prisoner out from about a dozen men—I have not altered my opinion since—he has changed, but my opinion is unchanged.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The man was a complete stranger to me—during part of the time I was taking the note to Mr. Graves—the man had a hard felt hat, not a tall silk one, and a fawn-coloured covert coat—he</p>

               <p>was dark, with a black moustache, and about the same height as the prisoner—I have talked this matter over with Mr. Graves, and we both agreed that the man had a hard felt hat and a covert coat—I agree with the description Mr. Graves gave—we were just closing at the time, I was locking up the safe—the man had no hair on his under lip—the prisoner was in the middle of the men I saw at Bow Street, he was not looking particularly nervous—there were some men there not nervous—I saw a paralysed man, with a boy, charged with begging; two or three men looked as if they had been brought in for begging, and one who looked drunk and disorderly, and one who looked like a stevedore—those people were not a bit like the man I have described—I went along all the people, and came back along the line, and stopped opposite this man, who was in the middle—there were some dark mea there, and some near his height, but no man like him—when I went to the Police-court I did not know that there was a man under remand—I knew that a man had been locked up the week before, who was supposed to have changed some of the notes—I had not talked it over with Mr. Graves; we talked about his dress directly he had gone, and again next day, when I heard that the man I saw had been changing stolen notes; but we did not talk it over during the next fortnight—we were not too busy—I know nothing about £60 reward if the man was identified.</p>

I am a clerk in the confidential department, General Post Office—this matter was placed in my hands on October 16th—I examined the counter at Lombard Street, and it was some time before I could discover how the robbery took place—on 29th August I went to the Blue Posts on Inspector Lawley's information; Mr. Baum went with me—Lawley and Brooks were present—I first went in with Mr. Baum, and saw the prisoner standing at the bar, quite close to where we entered—after some moments I said, "I belong to the Post Office, and am making investigations into the theft of a registered letter containing 165 notes; you have been identified as cashing some of them; what do you say about it?"—he said, "You make a great mistake"—I gave him into Lawley's custody.</p>

I am entitled to £150 if defendant's statements are correct"; and, "If he had paid me that amount I should not have prosecuted him"—that is true; I should not have troubled, but the others might—he would have to stand the racket with the rest—I dropped my claim to £130 and costs—I have not seen Ann since the criminal proceedings.</p>

I wetted some paper with paraffin, and placed it on the mantelpiece in front parlour; also put some paper saturated with paraffin on the mantelpiece in back parlour. I then went up into front room with a box of matches, and set light to the cloths. I then took up the child, Sophia Barnard, who was in bed, threw a coat around her, and took her downstairs, and threw the lamp and matches into the fire<lb/>grate in back parlour, and sat on the corner of a sofa for about half-an-hour in the dark; the child then commenced crying. I told her to call</p>

               <p>her sister to take her to bed again. I then put her down in the room, and believe the youngest daughter fetched her. I then went out and waited outside the gate."—I read the statement to her; she said it was quite correct—I formally charged her.</p>

I am the prisoner's daughter—I live at 7, Ann Street, Limehouse—there was some dispute on this evening—at two o'clock on the Sunday morning I woke up and saw some cloths on fire in the room—they were saturated with paraffin, and were by the side of the fireplace in the upstairs front room—I got out of bed and put a piece of carpet over it and tried to put it out—then I went downstairs—all the doors were open—I saw a cloth saturated with paraffin in the front parlour, and paper saturated with paraffin in the back parlour, and a cloth in the kitchen—I saw my mother sitting on the sofa in the back parlour; she had the youngest child—a paraffin bottle was on the table in the corner—she told me to take the light out of the room, or else she would set fire to the lot—I don't know what she meant by the lot, unless it was the other cloths that were saturated—I went out of the room then—she said she would go and lock herself up—the cupboard upstairs was just scorched—my two sisters, brother, and father were asleep in bed in the house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I don't know what the cloth on fire was; it was doubled up, and I cannot say how large it was—I raked it under the grate and saw it there—I hit my mother in the face that night, when she threw china ornaments at my sister—I did not punch her more than once—I have been at home and done no work for five months—my mother has continually wanted me to go out and work—we were not both rather angry this night—I am not good-tempered when I am put out—I was not going to see her throw things at my sister—my mother did not say, "If you don't take the light out it will set fire to the lot, as the place is saturated with paraffin—she did not call me out and ask me to put the fire out—I woke up myself, and afterwards woke my sister—this was not the first time that there was a dispute between me and mother—there might have been faults on both sides.</p>

               <p>Curtis-Bennett, in consequence of which I went to Holloway Prison, and the prisoner was handed over to my custody about ten minutes to nine—in the cab I told him that his wife was dangerously ill, and that I was taking him to St. Mary's Hospital; that the Magistrate would be there, and that her statement would be taken, and he would have the opportunity of saying anything to her—he said he was very sorry to hear it—I said I hoped she would be alive when he got there; when we arrived there, and the Magistrate had come, the woman being in bed and the prisoner standing at the foot, the deceased was sworn, and the Magistrate took down her statement; I do not recollect what she said; she was very feeble—she died on 7th October; the prisoner was then charged with manslaughter; he said nothing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. Mary's Hospital; the deceased was brought there about one on the morn<lb/>ing of 1st October—I examined her—she had on the head a lacerated wound about 4 1/2 inches long, concentric in shape, reaching down to the membrane covering the bone—there was a lacerated wound on the left hand, and also on the right buttock, the edges of that wound were lacerated, it was between three and four inches deep, and the bone at the bottom of it was broken—one of the small bones in the leg was broken, and the knuckles and back were very much bruised—there was a plaister on the right side of the chest—I did not notice any reason for that at the time—there were appearances of a black eye—the bruises were all recent, except the black eye—on 6th October she was in a critical condition, and I sent a message to the police—she died on the evening of the 7th—the cause of death was lockjaw, brought on by these wounds; I cannot say for certain which wound it was; there was a post-mortem examination—the spine was fractured; that might have been sufficient to cause the lockjaw—the wound on the head could not—a fall on some projecting ledge would have done it all the injuries might have been caused by that fall.</p>

Ashburnham, Subscription Rooms, Tattersall's, Knights-bridge; a letter directed Mrs. Frayer, Temperance Hotel, 41, Blackfriars Road, purporting to be signed by W. Ashburnham; two letters to Mr. James Webster, dated 4th and 11th September, purporting to be signed W. Ashburnham; three bank notes for £50 each, bearing on the back the signature, Deveroux, Langham Hotel, and a number of documents, some portions of which are in shorthand—I have examined all these, together with a memorandum book containing writing—I know the prisoner's writing—to the best of my belief this bundle of longhand writing is his; it is the same writing as that of the memorandum book—the agreement for tenancy, the letters and the bodies of the cheques and the signatures W. Ashburnham on these blank forms, are all in Everard Smith's writing—the writing is disguised from Smith's writing.</p>

               <p>name of Lefevre, standing at the door, and some furniture taken out and into the house—on the morning of the 10th July I went to The Rocks in consequence of what I heard—I saw Leach—I believe that was the only time I had been in the house after they moved in—I did not then notice the furniture particularly—I noticed it was not arranged very nicely about the rooms, I thought—it looked like ordinary furniture for a cottage, not very costly—I did not see the family leave on that day, but during that afternoon I went to the house in consequence of seeing the windows left open, and found that the family had left—two or three days after they had gone I saw Leach and gave him the key of the gate, he did not return it to me—I did not see whether he went into the house—two or three days after that, on the day the fire took place, about five p.m., I knocked at the door of The Rocks; Leach opened it; his coat was off, he was in his shirt sleeves—I handed him some parcels which had come for him—he made no remarks about them; he said his friend Cove was driving down from London, and asked me whether I would go for a drive with him to Staines, as they were going there to see a friend; I declined, and went back to my own house, leaving him inside The Rocks—I did not see anything of him before the explosion, nor did I see anyone else arrive at the house—about eight, or a few minutes past eight, I was sitting in my front parlour (the room with the bow window, marked sitting-room on the plan, it is not the room next to The Rocks) when I heard a dull, heavy sound which seemed to shake the place, and seemed to come from somewhere near me, I could not say where—I jumped up and went to the passage and saw that my dining-room, between The Rocks and the room I had been sitting in, was full of fire, and that the floor of the bedroom over it had come down into the room and was on fire, and that the party wall between my house and The Rocks was down, and the flame coming through into my room; that it had knocked down part of the ceiling of the room I had been in, and shaken the ornaments and some pictures from the wall; they came down while I was in the room—I immediately went outside and saw that the walls of The Rocks were partly blown down, and that it was on fire all over the ground floor and the upper part, and the roof had all fallen in—it was not above two or three minutes after the explosion that I saw the roof and the upper part had fallen in—I should think the first time I saw Leach after the fire was about ten o'clock—he was outside in the road—he said, "It is a bad job, Mr. Penn," or something like that, and I said, "Yes, it is a very bad job"—I think that was all that passed—I saw him between two and three in the morning; I asked him if he was insured, and he said, "Yes," but he did not know whether the policy would hold good or not, as he had given them notice of his removal of the goods, but he had had no answer—Cove was present, he said nothing—my house burnt for a good while after the explosion, it was burnt down—when I went outside after the explosion I noticed that my dining-room, nearest The Rocks, and the kitchen and the back premises were on fire, and the fire soon came into the hall and the upstairs rooms—I was present about a month afterwards when the workmen were clearing away the rubbish from The Rocks, and one of the workmen called my attention to the strong smell of paraffin in the earth; I did not smell it till I got some of the sand in my hand, and</p>

When I first saw Leach he said he had been to see a house called The Lindens, and that he had noticed a placard "To let" at The Rocks and had come to look at it—I gave him permission to come in at midsummer if the references were all right—I had an interest for a long term in The Rosary and The Rocks—I had been living at The Rosary for about five years, I think—The Rocks had been vacant from Christmas—I don't think the walls were slight; I don't know that they were half the thickness required by the Building Act—I never inquired how long the houses had been up; they were not a hundred years old; my brother built The Rocks twenty or thirty years ago I think, not over thirty years ago—I succeeded to my interest in them about five years ago, when I went to live there—not more wood-work was used in them than is usual, I think—on this day, when I sat in my sitting room, there was light enough for me to read; I was reading by the window; it was quite daylight—we lighted the lamp before nine the night before—I burn paraffin; I have in half a gallon at a time, and keep it in my back scullery—I only use one lamp; I carry a candle upstairs when we go to bed—at the very same time that I heard this explosion down came the pictures from the walls—the explosion was on, my right—I instantly jumped to my feet to see what was the matter—I had to pass the dining-room door to go out at the hall-door—the hall-door was not open; the dining-room door was partly open, because I could see the flames in that room at that time, immediately after the explosion; the roof was in then—it was all at one and the same moment, the pictures falling from the wall, my going out of the room and seeing flames in the dining-room and my going out into the open air, and before I got to the open air, down had come the roof; it all occurred in a minute, or less—I came out of my hall-door and round to the front—when I looked, the roof and top part were down, and the wall of my dining-room had fallen in, and flames were burning my place—three or four fire-engines came—I did not see them arrive; they were more than four minutes coming—I saw nothing done with water before they came—at that time the floor dividing my ground floor from the upper room had fallen in; that part of the roof that covered the room I was sitting in had not fallen in, but that part that covered my dining-room had—the two houses were pretty well burnt down before the engines got any water—I cannot say whether the roof over my sitting-room fell in afterwards or was knocked down—the two houses were insured in the County Fire Office for £800; my furniture was not insured—the things in my scullery were burnt, and the wall from The Rocks was knocked into it—I saw the flames in my kitchen, all the wood-work was burnt that was not knocked down—the kitchen, breakfast-room, passage, hall, and dining-room of The Rocks were burnt; the roof covered all these rooms, and when it fell there was no fire above it that I saw; there was some fire over the back part, over the kitchen—the roof and wood-work and all came down together—the coach-house of The Rocks was not burnt, part of the pantry was; the scullery was partly burnt, the roof was burnt off—my second scullery where the sink and copper are was not burnt; nor my coal-shed; there was about a ton of coal there that I</p>

               <p>had had in a few days before—Leach's coalshed, stable, and coach-house were not burnt—the pony trap was in the coach-house; I had seen Mrs. Leach drive it—I heard that when she went away the pony was put out to grass—before 16th July, and before Mrs. Leach went to the seaside, my going out for a drive with them had been talked about, two or three times it might have been; I had not been asked to go—Mr. Leach said he was going to have a pony and trap, and when he had it he would take us out for a drive—I cannot say when the pony and trap came; it was there about a week before the fire, I should think—I did not see Mrs. Leach and the children go away to the seaside—before they went Mrs. Leach said they were going to South end, she would send me the address, and she would be glad if I would send on anything that came by post—I saw a cart standing at the door with furniture in it, I did not actually see it carried in, that was before Mrs. Leach went to the sea<lb/>side—I saw the van that brought the piano, and I was told it had brought a piano, but I did not see the piano—there was the furniture they brought when they came in, and then that from Lefevre's, and then the van that I was told the piano came in; that all came before Mrs. Leach went to the seaside—the fire brigade and salvage corps took. possession of the two places—I was claimant for £800 from the County Insurance Office, and they took possession of the two houses; I got possession of mine a short time after, but I was some six weeks or two months before I got possession of what had been The Rocks—they might have had possession of The Rosary for more than a week, I cannot say—during that week the firemen were about the ruins of The Rocks and Rosary—I saw no soil dug up from The Rosary to smell—I could tell the smell of paraffin from gas in soil saturated with it—I could not smell the paraffin till I had the soil partly up to my nose; it came from the hand of one of the labourers—I never saw the people in the possession of the débris using lamps after dark—after The Rosary was down I went to sleep in an empty house I had in the New Road, two hundred or three hundred yards away, perhaps, not more—although The Rosary came to my possession in a week, the fire brigade were in possession of The Rocks night and day—they occupied part of the coach-house—I don't know if they used a paraffin lamp to undress by; I was not there after dark—I saved a little of my furniture out of my sitting-room and the bedroom above it, while the fire was going on and before the brigade came; I threw some articles out of the window, and some people who came by took things out; the sitting-room and bedroom above it had not caught fire then—I saved a table and a few chairs and bedding, but no bed-steads—the other furniture was too cumbersome to move, and was all burnt—I don't think it burnt pretty quickly; it was not all over in a very short time; a good deal of it was over before water was applied—Leach told me he was an architect and surveyor, and that his offices were at Joint Stock Bank Chambers, Smithfield—Leach had the front door key—I put a padlock on the gate and took away the key, and that key I afterwards gave to Leach—there were no other keys but those two.</p>

                  </hi>. I am thirteen; I live at home at 4, Edith Cottages, New Road, Bedfont, four or five miles from Staines—in the beginning of last June Mrs. Leach came and engaged me as a domestic servant, at 2s. 6d. a week—I was to go and live at The Rocks when they came into occupation there—I went there on the day the furniture arrived—The Bocks was a seven-roomed house, with four bedrooms upstairs, a dining, sitting room and kitchen on the ground floor, a scullery attached to the kitchen, and some outbuildings—I remained in service there about a month or five weeks—on a Friday, I think it was, in July, the family left for the seaside for a fort<lb/>night; I was to go home; Mrs. Leach left some directions with me before she went—she said she was going to Brighton; Mr. Leach was not there at any time when she said that—Cove left with them when they went—he had stayed at The Bocks a whole week, which was up the day they went—they drove away in a brake, taking with them two boxes—Mr. Joseph Adams used to visit the house—I don't think he came there during the time that Cove was there, I do not remember; he came more than once—one of the boxes they took to the seaside was mine—I was not present when it was packed, and cannot say what it contained—I know what was on the premises in the way of furniture and so on pretty well—the gas stove stood in the kitchen behind the door, when I left on the Friday it stood there; it was put in about a week after they came to the house, I think—there was no easy-chair in the dressing-room—I never saw any table or toilet set in young Master Leach's bedroom—there was a broken clock, the pieces of which had been thrown into the loft—there were strips of carpet, but no regular carpet in one room—in my bed-room there were no chairs, towel-horse, or ornaments on the mantelshelf—I saw no walnut folding-table in the dining-room, or music cabinet; there was an iron inkstand there—I think there were only two trays in the kitchen, as far as I saw—I would not be sure there was no easy-chair—in the breakfast-room there was one easy-chair—I do not re<lb/>member seeing any dinner-mats or a bookcase; there was a bookcase in the dining-room—in the hall and passage there was one old easy wooden chair. (<hi rend="italic">Further evidence of the articles in the house was postponed until after the production of the claim</hi>)—I did not hear from Mrs. Leach or the family while they were away—when the fire occurred I was at home—I afterwards went out and saw the fire was at my master's house—I was running along the Staines Road, when I saw a pony and trap, with the prisoners in it, driving from the direction of Staines towards the fire—it was between eight and nine; I was not far from The Bocks—the fire was in sight—I was in the Staines Road just beyond the New Road—I said, "Mr. Leach, your house is on fire"—he said, "Oh, don't say so!" and then he said he felt faint—when I spoke they stopped the trap; they left it where they spoke to me, and went on foot in the direction of the fire—about ten minutes after they came back, and got</p>

I was present when Mrs. Leach and the children arrived at The Bocks; I saw a one-horse and a two-horse van full of furniture come—I did not make or see any list of the furniture that came from those vans—two or three days after the fire Inspector Dinney came to my mother's house, he had no paper with him that day—on two occasions before the gas-fittings were put in paraffin was bought, and it was all used up but one quart, I think, before the gas was put on—the gas was put on in one or other of the upper rooms—Mrs. Leach, when going to the seaside, said she might write for me to send some raspberries down; she said she would send the address—I was to go back to my mother's for the fortnight—the paraffin was kept in a stone jar in the scullery—I fetched a gallon at a time—one lamp was burned in the house before Mrs. Leach went; it was of an ordinary size; it was not moved about—the inspector saw me first at Mr. Penn's; he put questions to me—I heard no suggestions that dynamite had been used—afterwards the inspector saw me again at our house, when he had a list of furniture, which he read to me, and asked if I remembered every article—I don't remember Dinney at the Police-court complaining that the Magistrates' clerk was not writing what he ought to he did not interfere with me nor speak to me while I was in the witness-box—the Chairman spoke to him—I heard a complaint made of Dinney's interfering with me; I burst out crying twice before the Magistrates—I was asked, "Is it possible there were articles of furniture you did not take notice of?" and I said "Yes, there might have been"—I was asked whether I knew Leach had put in a claim against the insurance company, and I said, "Yes"—do not know what a music cabinet is—I told the Magistrates that Dinney told me it was a cabinet—I did not know what he was speaking about; it was explained to me at the Court that it was a thing to put music into—the Chairman asked me if there was a considerable quantity of furniture that I might have forgotten and I said yes, possibly—I said Cove was very fond of the children; that the gas stove was a large one with three, taps, and that Mrs. Leach had told me to be careful of the taps—the taps were loose and easily turned on, and she warned me to be very careful to see that they were always properly turned—I said I did not know the difference between walnut and mahogany; so that when Dinney read out from the list of things "walnut" and "mahogany" I did not know what he meant—he made a great point about Mrs. Leach's blue serge dress; it came out that I neither saw it, packed it, nor knew whether she took it with her or not—a large and unwieldy tin box was left behind—Mrs. Leach packed one box, and then said she had not put in her blue serge dress, and so I told her she could have my box—I was not present when she afterwards packed things in my box, and I do not know whether she took away the serge dress or not—I lent her my hat-box, a very small one—Dinney was a long time going through the list with me; he called my attention to a great many articles—I told him I did not remember—I made a statement before the Magis<lb/>trates before Leach was in custody; I think Sergeant Bush went with me to swear that information—the piano was brought to the house about a week after the general furniture came—the children were a girl and boy, one was eight and the other ten, I think—the girl played the piano.</p>

               <p>my front garden—I could not see the bay-window of The Books from there, nor the front window of The Rosary, because there was a hedge and fence before—I described the explosion as a very dull one, like the falling of a house—I did not allow a moment to elapse before jumping over the fence and going to The Bocks—all I saw of the lamp was the receptacle and the burner, the burner was just on the top—I have not seen them since—the firemen had charge of The Bocks night and day, and slept in the coach-house, and of The Rosary as well—I did not see the fire brigade men using paraffin lamps—they lit themselves to bed with their own lamps; they burn colza oil—I could distinguish between that and paraffin—the labourers did not dig up any of The Rosary's ground, only The Bocks'; before they began digging they sifted the débris of The Bocks—the sifting went on for two days—I should say it would be about the 15th October when I smelt the handful of earth, I cannot say the actual date—it was eight or ten days after—the workmen were present—it was not eight or ten days after the fire, I got mistaken in the time; it was not as long as three months, it was not a wet season.</p>

I am chief officer of the Hounslow Fire Brigade—on 16th July I received a call at 8.45, and went with my men to The Rocks and The Rosary, Bedfont—we arrived at 9.8; the buildings were well alight, there was a mass of flames from top to bottom; a portion of the roof, I believe, was in—the two houses were alight all over—there was about forty minutes' delay in getting water, but we managed to get buckets of water to save the surrounding property—I came to the opinion, a day or two afterwards, that the fire was caused by an explosion—some portions of a curtain were hanging on a tree in front of the house, immediately in front of the dining-room window, and a small window-frame was lying under the front wall of the house on a heap of bricks, on the right of the tree when facing the house—I saw the sash and two sash weights, they were in a line with the dining-room—Police-constable Petty showed me the well next morning—when Mr. Rees came down we cleared the débris, and I formed the opinion that the explosion occurred in the fireplace in the front room; the hearth stone was shattered—the only indication was in the fireplace; the room was full of débris, bricks and slates, and I ordered the fireplace to be uncovered—the rest of the débris was cleared away by a gang of men, by order of the insurance company—I went over what remained of the house: the ground floor alone remained—the kitchen walls on the right were between 6 and 7 ft. high, and on the left between 3 and 4 feet—the dining-room wail on your left, with your back to the room, was completelyd own, and on your right was a chimney-stack, which I had taken down as being unsafe—the wall on the right was completely down—the fireplace was the only place that seemed to bear marks of an explosion; of course all the internal fittings were destroyed—early on the morning of the 17th I saw Leach on the premises, and asked him whether he was insured—he said, "I believe so"—I asked what he meant by "believe"—he said he had renewed his policy, paid the money, and received a receipt, but had not received the policy—I asked him the name of the office—he said, "The Liverpool and London and Globe, for £500, and £50 for pony and trap"—I asked him if he had any idea how the fire occurred; he said he thought it was a gas explosion; he and his friend Cove had come home and made tea on the gas stove, and he believed he had turned all the</p>

                  </hi>. I am surveyor and assessor to the Liverpool and London and Globe Insurance Company, Cornhill—on the day after the fire my attention was called to Leach's proposal for increased insurance, and a letter from Mr. Leach came very shortly after the fire (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. EDWARD DORMER</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">here stated that this letter and three others were in Leach's writing</hi>)—I received it on July 18th, it is undated. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that The Rosary, Bedfont, was totally destroyed by fire yesterday, and the Inspector would make his report. Signed, "A. M. Leach</hi>")—a form of claim was sent in answer to that, which came back on 23rd July with this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This enclosed a list of articles destroyed by fire, and stated that for<lb/>tunately the pony was away. Signed, "Arthur M. Leach."</hi>)—that was accompanied by this claim, amounting to £790 1s. 9d., which was afterwards reduced to £786 13s. 9d.—on 25th July, in consequence of an appoint<lb/>ment with Mr. Leach, I went to The Rocks and met him and Mr. Dormer—I had this claim in my hand, and questioned him as to the articles in it—I asked him if there was any fire or light in the place; he said all he could remember was that he had turned down the kitchen gas to a blue flame, and he had not been using any fire except the gas-stove—I asked him if he could account for the explosion; he said no, the only thing he could possibly suggest was gas; I said I hardly thought it was gas; he said he could not account for it in any way—I had previously asked him if he had turned the taps off carefully; he said, "Yes, except the one blue light"—he said he and his friend Cove had indulged in a little sparring after they had their tea, and probably they might have knocked on one of the taps—he drew my attention to a fender, which was a very good one—there was water just in front of the fireplace which I had cleared, and found the fender—the hearth stone was driven in the floor in the form of a wedge, and smashed in pieces; the mantelpiece was down, and we found pieces of it among the bricks—we walked over the ruins and found traces of iron bedsteads, and I suggested that we should sift the ruins, and employed the fire brigade to do it—nearly three weeks afterwards I went to see what had been discovered—I went through Leach's claim and put a price against each article, and the value amounted to £388—I. visited The Rocks twice, once when I met Mr. Leach and once when I met Mr. Lewis—it was before August 19th when Mr. Lewis, Mr. Cove, and Mr. Adams came to the office—I have had thirty years' experience as assessor of this company of fires, incendiary and accidental—I had formed no opinion of the cause of the fire, beyond the fact that there had been an explosion which was not brought about by ordinary coal gas—on August 19th Leach came to the office with Mr. James Lewis, his assessor—while Mr. Lewis was present each made a statement which I took down in writing—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is my writing; Leach signed it in my presence—it was read over to him before he signed it. (<hi rend="italic">The statement was to the effect that on the day of the fire he and Cove were out driving, and calling at different places, and that on returning in the evening he found the place had been burned to the ground</hi>)—after that statement had</p>

               <p>been made Cove came into the office—Leach was still there, and Mr. Lewis; this was between 11 and 12 in the morning—they were there two or three hours—I have my notes of what occurred—I had said I should like to see Cove, and he was brought there by Mr. Lewis—he said he was a coffee-house keeper by trade. (<hi rend="italic">In substance this gave a similar account of the proceedings on the day of the fire to that of Leach</hi>)—later on the same day Adams came to the office; he made a statement in the presence of Leach. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he knew the furniture in the house occupied by Leach, and that, in his opinion, the statement of claim was a fair one</hi>)—after that the matter was left in my hands to place before the directors—the next I saw of Leach was when he called with Mr. Lewis on 31st August; I then said to him that the directors required a statutory declaration as to the truth of the claim—he made one; this is it, in his handwriting—I drew it up, he returned it to me, having sworn it. (<hi rend="italic">This was put in and read</hi>)—after that I offered £200 in settlement of the claim; that was not accepted—on 3rd September I received this letter from Mr. Lewis, who had acted on behalf of Leach (<hi rend="italic">This left the matter in the hands of the witness, but stated that in the opinion of the writer the company ought to give</hi> £300)—I did not accede to that—on 8th September I received this letter from Leach. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he was willing to accept</hi> £210)—I did not agree to those terms, and no money has been paid.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. The document put in yesterday was my estimate on the claim—the amount claimed on the first three items is £66 10s.; my estimate is £40. (<hi rend="italic">After going through a number of items in the claim, the result arrived at was that on a claim of</hi> £800 <hi rend="italic">there were deductions amounting to</hi> £300)—when the statutory declaration was made, Leach said that the claim of £2 10s. was on a building that was damaged in 1882, not occupied by himself, but by another person, a tenant, but that he had an interest in it—I went to the premises twice after the fire; on the Saturday week after the fire, and, I think, on 13th August—on the first occasion I met Leach, on the second he did not come, Mr. Lewis came—on neither of those occa<lb/>sions was the sifting of the débris going on—on the first occasion I ordered it to be done, and on the second it was completed; it was done between those dates—I was not informed by the Hounslow Fire Brigade that they had come to the conclusion that it was an explosion by gun<lb/>powder or dynamite; I did not hear that rumour from them—I have seen Sir Frederick Abel's report—the first time I heard of the earth being taken up was in this Court yesterday—the clearing away of the débris, to begin the building, was probably after the 10th September—I think the weather was tolerably fine; I have no particular recollection of that—I did not smell paraffin the first time; I did on the second visit, when the brigade man called my attention to some small articles he found that smelled of paraffin; and they certainly did—I did not say anything about that at the Police-court, because I was not asked—the majority of claims are settled by us without arbitration, and very often at a considerable reduction.</p>

               <p>£7 10s. would be ample for it; a thing of that sort would cost from £3 or £4 to £25—we found a collection of springs; it was impossible to say which bedstead they belonged to—mattresses vary very much in quality, from £2 perhaps to £10 or £12—we found no trace of horsehair, not likely—feather beds range from £2 to £12; pillows and bolsters also vary very much—I took off £5 from the things in the garret, I did not see them; I am compelled to estimate the value of things I do not see—I found no trace of a mahogany wardrobe; I reduced that item from £28 to £15, because I had a description of it from witnesses—the double wash<lb/>stand I reduced from £15 10s. to £7 10s.; I saw some marble on the top of it—that is exactly the way in which it has been done.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the distributing engineer of the Gas Light and Coke Company, and chief of the outdoor department of that company—I hare had thirty years' experience in all matters relating to the distribution and consumption of gas—I have attentively read the depositions in this case, and have been present for the most part during the examination of the witnesses—I have formed the opinion that the explosion occurred in the front room downstairs—the explosion was decidedly not due to an escape or explosion of coal-gas—in my opinion the explosion was not caused by a gas explosion, because there is no smoke whatever emitted in an explosion by coal-gas; I may say that is the only reason—I heard the witnesses describe that flame was in both floors at once, and that a considerable fire was seen on the premises immediately after the explosion was heard—that is not compatible with an explosion by coal-gas—coal-gas, unmixed with atmospheric air, is not explosive; when mixed in certain proportions it is the most explosive mixture; in 90 parts of air and 10 parts of gas, if a light was applied to a room containing that admixture, a very violent explosion would occur, there would be a mere flash as regards flame; it would be so instan<lb/>taneous that it would not set light to the lightest materials, such as blinds and curtains, if the mixture were not at such an explosive point as I name; but if there was a larger proportion of gas to air, the explo<lb/>sion itself would be less severe, and the flame would last for a longer period, burning with a blue flame; that would very quickly burn itself out, but would have time to fire light articles such as blinds and curtains; it would not consume the heavier furniture or the fabric of the building; that could only be brought about by the articles which had caught, com<lb/>municating the fire to the bigger ones—that would not be an instan<lb/>taneous effect, it would be rather a lengthy process; smoke would not accompany an escape of gas itself under any circumstances; if mixed with atmospheric air it would be—each gas-burner is supposed to con<lb/>sume some thirty feet of cubic gas an hour—I heard that the prisoner left the house at something before seven, and that the explosion took place at half-past eight—he passage of fifty cubic feet of gas into the kitchen in that time would not render the room explosive, assuming that the whole of the capacity of the meter was escaping into that room; and the same thing would apply to the dining-room; if that quantity were distributed from the kitchen, through the passage into the dining-room, going up the staircase, it would not arrive at any<lb/>thing like explosive point—I heard that the meter registered 1,400 ft. on 25th August, that would only be about 4s. worth of gas altogether; that would be a small consumption—I have a knowledge of paraffin; it is highly explosive—I should expect smoke to follow the ignition; by this plan I see there was a gas bracket in the hall, just at the angle—that would not be seen, if lighted, from the front—I can't say that it would be seen from the kitchen, it is quite possible that it would—no doubt if vapour caught at that point it would run back very much in the same way as a train of gunpowder would; I should say if it ran back to the dining-room an explosion would be unquestionable, the gas being turned</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189111160105"/>
               <p>down to a blue light; the smallest particle of flame would do it—assum<lb/>ing the same condition of things, the same consequences would ensue if the bracket in the passage had been turned down to a blue light—I have heard Constable Petty say that when he arrived both the ground and top floors were alight; that being so, I am of opinion that the top room must have had some oil, or something been prepared there; if articles were thrown 50 ft. or 60 ft., that would indicate the violence of the explosion—the curtains being found 14 ft. from the window, and the walls being blown out, would be a likely result of an explosion from gas; there would be a like result from paraffin—I am of opinion that this explosion could have occurred by the distribution of some inflammable oil, plus the leaving alight the gas pendant or the gas in the passage or kitchen; an escape of gas would assist the oil and make the explosion more dangerous—the two things combined would make a more violent and dangerous explosion than the gas alone—sup<lb/>posing there was not sufficient vapour generated from the oil, the esoaping gas would make up such deficiency to bring it to an explosive point; it would be brought up to the explosive point by the joint agency of gas and vapour—then there would be smoke in proportion to the amount of vapour; the black of the smoke would be caused by the addition of the remaining quantity of oil which had not evaporated.</p>

I form my opinion mainly on the evi<lb/>dence of there being black smoke, not entirely; I also alluded to the firing in both rooms, up and down; I mean the simultaneous firing—I think it was Constable Petty who stated that there was simultaneous firing, I won't be certain—I think either rapidity or smoke would be sufficient, without the other; they are both sufficient reasons to show that it was not a coal-gas explosion—I heard two or three witnesses depose to black smoke immediately on the explosion—I heard that the roof had fallen in when those people saw it; there would be smoke from the roof—I have seen a roof fall in; there would be a large volume of smoke and dust—the house was poorly built—if the explosion took place in the lower room it would not be long before there was a hole in the ceiling, and the falling house would soon be in flames—paraffin would evaporate quicker in warm weather than cold—paraffin would evaporate in the temperature where we are now—if there were a pailful of paraffin shut up in this Court it would not be danger<lb/>ous, you would not have the evaporating surface which you would have if you watered it on the floor of the Court with a watering pot, you get a larger surface by sprinkling—there would be evaporation at 65 degrees from a pail—if you threw paraffin into a fire you would set the chimney on fire—if you threw a cupful on a fire it would assist to damp it—I have made experiments with paraffin—if you sprinkle a room with paraffin and then turn the gas on, the evaporation would be danger<lb/>ous; evaporation would take place at any temperature, but much quicker as the temperature rises—whether paraffin leaves black traces behind after it has exploded depends entirely on the amount of vapour; you might just get to the explosive point, and the combustion would be absolutely perfect, and there would be nothing left; if you get the most explosive point, you get what I might term a very clean ex<lb/>plosion; it always depends upon the temperature; if there is a perfect explosion there would be a clean sweep of it, and you would not find a</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chemist, having many learned grees and great experience as a chemist, and as to the properties of hydro<lb/>carbon oils—such oils are now very cheap—in proportion as they are cheap they contain a greater amount of the more volatile oils or spirit, and in proportion as they contain that greater amount of spirit they are more highly evaporated and are consequently more dangerous—they are evaporated at a comparatively low temperature—I have read the deposi<lb/>tions in this case, and have been present for the most part during the examination of the witnesses, and, so far as I can form an opinion from what I have so heard and read, I believe that the starting-point of the explosion must have been in the ground floor front room, the dining room; that it could not, by any possibility, have been solely caused by coal-gas; but that, with or without the co-operation of coal-gas, volatile hydro-carbon oil, such as paraffin, petroleum, kerosene or benzoline, was instrumental in bringing about the explosion—the odour of petroleum, benzoline, kerosene, and paraffin is so similar that it re<lb/>quires a highly-educated nose to distinguish between them, and they are all, in popular parlance, known under the general name paraffin—it would be a mixture of air and the vapour proceeding from the liquid which would cause the explosion, and it would spread from the starting point throughout the mixture with a rapidity determined in degree by the amount of vapour contained in the mixture—the results would be the same in my opinion if the starting-point were in the kitchen or in the passage, at the gas bracket in the hall, however low turned down—the starting-point would be where the vapour and air met the flame—I know of no condition of things in the case of a gas explosion where the explosion would be accom<lb/>panied by smoke, but on the other hand, unless the proportion of a volatile hydro-carbon oil distributed through the air be very small indeed, the explosion is invariably accompanied by the development of black smoke—the smell, as described by several witnesses, would be a natural consequence of the employment of such an agent—smell would appreciably remain for three or four hours afterwards; the smell of these hydro-carbon oils is one of the most persistent smells, and one of the smells most difficult to get rid of, and one of the most distinguishable—it does not appear to be possible, although an explosion occurring in the ground floor might extend to the first floor and cause the roof and walls to fall almost instantaneously, that the fire could so rapidly spread throughout and into both floors unless some special preparation had been made for the catching flame by the use of some volatile inflammable liquid—explosion caused by gas may be followed by flame which lives for a time, if the gas be present in large proportion, but ordinarily it produces a flash of flame which does not linger sufficiently long to set fire to even somewhat inflammable objects;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189111160107"/>
               <p>it is the same with a mixture of air and an inflammable vapour, but if an inflammable vapour exists under such conditions as we have been discussing, that is, if it has been given off from an exposed surface of oil, the flame, however brief in duration, will ignite that exposed surface and the oil wherever it may have been scattered about—it is not easy to keep down the temperature of a room, after a July day, to below seventy degrees, and at that temperature vapour would be readily given off—from its effects the explosion must have been of a very violent character—an escape of forty-five to fifty feet of gas within an hour and a half or an hour and three-quarters in this kitchen would not bring it to explosive point, it would have required at least double the amount of gas which could have escaped within the period indicated by the evidence to have produced a feebly explosive mixture in the area pre<lb/>sented by the kitchen, and equally so in the dining-room, which is larger—if the gas had to be distributed over the house and make its way into the dining-room, it would make the explosion much less likely, since the mixture would be feebler—I cannot give a decided opinion as to whether the explosion was brought about by a hydro-carbon oil alone, or by a hydrocarbon oil plus gas; but I should be inclined to believe that the escape of gas, although it might be altogether insufficient to approach those condi<lb/>tions necessary for an explosion, would facilitate the action of the vapour of such a highly inflammable liquid as that indicated—I am clear that it was not due to the agency of coal-gas alone, but that it might have been due to the inflammable vapour, or to that plus coal-gas.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HARRIS</hi>. I formed my opinion as to the quantity of coal-gas that may have escaped upon the assumption that it must have gone through the meter; I have known gas escape in other ways than through the meter—it might escape through a crack in the main, and follow the main into the house; it would not lie there accumulating; as gas escapes it begins to diffuse into the air, even if buried in the ground; you cannot have an escape of gas collected under pressure where there is a chance (however difficult the chance may be) of access to the air—there may come a time when the house, or rooms, or a room would be full of it—the moment it got into any room it would make its presence known most unmistakably—if it got from the main under floors it would immediately begin to diffuse into the air through the floor; it would then come into the room above—it would depend on the amount escaping, how long it would be before it made its presence known in the other rooms—there is nothing to be gathered from the sound made by the explosion; the impressions produced upon different persons, under different conditions and at different distances, are very variable—smoke is of various colours—I attach importance to the fact that some witnesses have said it was dense black smoke—I think nothing is easier to distinguish than black smoke—it would depend somewhat on the atmospheric conditions as to whether it was light or dark brown, but not as to whether it was black; I am certain this was black smoke—if this charge depended on the colour of the smoke, and if it had not been quite black, it would have altered my opinion—it was scarcely dusk when the explosion took place—I had no opportunity of cross-examining the witnesses as to whether the smoke was perfectly black; I should have done so if I had had the oppor<lb/>tunity, in order to confirm my opinion—it was a confirmatory reason for</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189111160108"/>
               <p>my saying that this was not a gas explosion: the blackness of the cloud of smoke, when taken together with the condition of things such as the volume of gas which could have existed in the house, and which I put at about fifty or sixty feet, assuming there was no other inlet than through the meter—another thing leading me to my conclusion was the evidence as to the odour of paraffin—benzoline and kerosene begin to evaporate even at freezing temperature, paraffin begins to evaporate at about 40 degrees, and evaporation continues, but does not become very considerable, till you reach 90 or 100 degrees—the evaporation that would take place at 40 or 80 degrees would not be dangerous, but it would begin to be so at 90 degrees—if you wanted to set fire to a place with paraffin oil you could put it in a saucepan or kettle or something, and put it any where where it could be heated—how much you would require to blow up this Court would depend on the temperature to which it could be raised, and that would depend on whether it was allowed to evaporate freely, or confined—paraffin would be the last oil I should buy for such a purpose—you would have to heat it in a vessel up to the point at which it gives off vapour very readily, some<lb/>where up to boiling-point—you could do it over a fire or a gas flame—it would take a good deal of paraffin to produce evaporation to cause an explosion such as this was—I could not say how much, whether one or three gallons; it would require special arrangements to carry it out—you could boil it in a basin, but before it reached ebullition from heating it over a gas-flame it would ignite; I cannot say if it would not explode.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Paraffin oil is rarely used now; it is used in certain superior lamps, but the oil ordinarily sold as and called paraffin is petroleum oil, and that would produce none of the difficulties as to which I have been cross-examined—it has been found necessary to introduce legislation to fix the temperature at which oil sold as paraffin evaporates, because of the danger arising from oil evaporating from the receptacle in which it is kept—substitute petroleum for paraffin, and you get the opinion I gave first intact.</p>

I merely made notes on this claim of the articles I examined—I knew Leach had made a claim of between £700 and £800, and I had the claim with me—with that information, and upon what I saw, I came to the conclusion that it was a correct claim in its integrity for £800, assuming the information I had got was correct—if I had gone down and simply looked at the débris, I should not have been able to have told the character of one-fiftieth part of the articles which were in the débris; so that my estimate of £500 to £600 is not an estimate made by me upon what I saw, but upon the information given to me by the claim, coupled with what I saw—the débris had the appearance of pro<lb/>perty of the value previous to the fire of £500 or £600; I had the remains of all the metal-work, the bedsteads—I did not put those items down and make an independent valuation; I did not distribute the £500 or £600 among the various items of the claim, but simply looked at the thing as a whole—Lefevre's invoice was never in my possession; I did not go to the débris after I had heard of it—I never asked to be allowed to look and see if I could identify the things in Lefevre's invoice; no one pointed out to me what items in the claim Lefevre's invoice represented; I did not inquire; I have nothing to do with figures, the objects of my visits were to endeavour to identify the items themselves—I heard the suggestion yesterday that some of Lefevre's articles were doubled in the claim—I knew practically nothing of the invoice—I knew nothing of the prior insurance, or of what was in the house at Norwood—I thought it was immaterial to make that inquiry—I made no inquiry as to whether new items had been brought in; I did not know where the furniture had come from—I adopted Mr. Rees's suggestion to bring down anybody who could throw light on the claim—if anybody comes to me directly we go down on the premises and make out the claim, and we take the statements of the assured, and we guide his views by what we see on the premises—I did not make out this claim, and all I could do was to assist Mr. Rees in his inquiries by taking down people who had removed the furniture—I did not get information as to the age, quality or character of the furniture, or where it came from; I spent four or five hours on the premises in going through the débris, and picking things up and arrang<lb/>ing them on the lawn for Mr. Rees's inspection, so that he could see how far the remains tallied with the items in the claim.</p>

               <p>Leach and his wife—the furniture that I removed was the same in every respect on each occasion; I could not swear to the number of articles, but there was a dining-table, a music cabinet, a mahogany wardrobe with a glass door, eight or nine leather chairs and various other chairs, two bookcases, a lady's easy-chair and a gentleman's easy-chair—I am accustomed to removing furniture—the furniture I removed to Bedfont was in excellent condition and of good quality—there were books and pictures—I should think the furniture would be between £500 and £600 in value—I should think the house at Bedfont was very old, because it was worm-eaten up the stairs—I removed this stone jar—Leach paid me £3 for going to Bed<lb/>font; there was a two-horse van and a one-horse van—I have had no other transactions with Leach.</p>

I am a commercial clerk, of 11, Bedford Road, Clapham—I have known Leach about two years, and have done work for him as a clerk—I have visited his house at Bedfont—I accompanied the furniture from Norwood to Staines when he removed—when Viger was there loading-up I helped, and saw the articles—I could identify the large wardrobe, of mahogany, I think it was, with a large looking-glass in the centre, and two plain doors; it divided into three parts—I saw a bookcase hanging on the right-hand side, and another bookcase was subsequently sent from the office in Charterhouse Street to Bedfont—I saw a music cabinet with a glass door and three shelves with "Miscellaneous," "Dance," and "Sacred" on them—I should imagine it was walnut</p>

I live at 58, Hazletree Grove, Clapham, and am an architect and surveyor of thirty-five years' experience; I have been for some years assistant to and in partnership with my father, the district surveyor of Wandsworth—I have known Leach since 1885—I have met him professionally, as an architect and surveyor, and have been opposed to him and with him in different cases, and I have met him privately; he has always been a straightforward, outspoken, honest man—I first saw him at Rossiter Road, Balham, in 1887, and visited him there on two or three occasions—I should think I stayed for two or three hours in the house—I had an opportunity of seeing that the furniture was first-class, heavy, massive, made of the best seasoned woods, and of first-class workmanship—it was good furniture—the house was very well furnished indeed—I was surprised to see such fine large furniture in the house—I also saw the same furniture at High Street, Norwood, when I went to see him on a matter of business—I should say the same as to the furniture there as I have said before—I went to Bedfont on Saturday, 4th July, and remained there till Monday, the 6th; I went down to look at some land, but I remained as a guest—I went into all the rooms on the ground floor and three rooms on the first floor—there was precisely the same furniture in the house—I noticed a piano and a bookcase which I had not noticed before in the other house—it was a light-coloured mahogany cottage piano; I played on it for an hour, and it had a very good tone indeed—</p>

               <p>I should say it was worth between £30 and £40—I was asked to make a plan of the furniture, first from memory and then from Inspector Bush's plan; this is my recollection of the furniture I saw there in July, and of the manner in which it was placed; this is my original plan of the furniture I remembered in the house in July; I was asked by Mr. Rockingham Gill, going down in the train, to make him a plan, and I made this sketch plan—I made this plan months before I saw the de<lb/>tective's plan—I have the second floor plan here—I am not professing to remember every article of furniture in that house from the observation I made during that three days' visit; I am professing to know certain rooms, all the rooms on the ground floor, and three on the first floor; there were only seven rooms in the house; there were only two I did not go into—I am able to recall the position of the articles in the rooms, with the exception of the first floor front—in the ground floor front room there was a pedestal desk in the bay window, a large table in the centre of the room, a leather-covered sofa, a small round table, a music cabinet inlaid, with four divisions; I went to get some music, but found it empty—I am refreshing my memory from the plan I made on October 22nd; I have been down to the place since—[<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at No. 7, High Street, Plumstead—I had known Mrs. Caroline Wood for about a year and a half; she came to my house about a year and a half ago, and stayed with me two or three months—on 24th September last she came to my house about seven in the morning; she knocked me up; she was very drunk—after some entreaty I took her in—she remained with me till 2nd October; during that time she was sometimes in bed, sometimes up—she had a deal of stout during that time; she was drinking most of the time—she was about thirty-nine, as near as I could judge—she only ate one meal; that was on the Sunday after she came; I offered her food, but she refused—she was not always drunk; she had drink every day; she did not go out to get it; my daughter and a young man got it for her—I knew it sometimes, but I have to get my living at the laundry at the back of the house, so I did not know exactly what she did have—the prisoner is her husband; I saw him when he came there on 30th September—he asked me if his wife was there—I said she was not—she had begged and entreated me if he came to say she was not there, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189111160118"/>
               <p>he went away without seeing her—on the following Friday even<lb/>ing, 2nd October, he came again, between eight and nine—his wife was then in the back parlour in bed—the prisoner pushed the door open, and walked right in—my daughter ad just been for some stout; Mrs. Wood asked me to pour out a glass, which I did, and I was just handing it to her when he came in; he knocked the stout out of my hand, and called me some very offensive names—he said to his wife, "I want my money and my keys"—she said, "I have none"—I went to the mantelpiece and took two keys, and gave them to him—(she had had two pots of stout that day, this was the second pot that was sent for; she was not drunk, I don't think she was sober)—he then took her clothes off the table, put his hand in her pocket and took something out, I don't know what it was; he then took up the remainder of her clothes, hung them on his left arm, and pulled her out of bed, and dragged her violently across the passage; she only had on her chemise and a flannel petticoat—as he dragged her along he struck her head violently against the wall of the passage; she did not want to go with him; he had his two hands underneath her arms, pulling her along and dragging the mats after her; he deliberately knocked her head against the wall, and then against the street door; then he opened the street door and pulled her out, and she fell down between the gate and the door, and struck the back of her head on the stone step by the door; it appeared to me that he let her fall—he picked her up and stood her up again, and then he told the people that crowded round the door that I had robbed her of her money and turned her out of doors, and the crowd became so violent that I ordered the door to be shut—she had a very nice wedding-ring on her finger, and a keeper with a clasp to it, and he took them off at the door—she said, "Don't hurt my hand so; don't hurt my arm"—then there was a knocking at the door, and I told my daughter to open it, and they asked for her boots, and they were handed out, or rather her shoes—that was all I saw of her—at the time she left my house, she only had a small bruise on her left arm; it looked like an old-standing mark; right on the bone of the arm.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have young men lodgers, and I keep a laundry—William Groom is not a lodger—William Holland is the only lodger I have now—the last solid food deceased had in my house was on Sunday, the 27th; I gave her beef-tea; she dined with me on that day; she only ate very little; before that she only had some beef-tea; no solid food, only stout and spirits—she paid me 12s.; 9s. she paid for attendance, the rest she had borrowed of me; she gave me that on Thursday, the 25th—I saw no gold in her possession, only the half-sovereign she paid me, with the 2s.—I did not tell the prisoner when he was there that his wife was covered with bruises—my daughter and my daughter-in law were in the passage when he took her out—they were trying to put her clothes on, and the prisoner said, "I will take her out and expose her"—I did not threaten to split his head open with a poker, or use any language to him—I had given her beef-tea twice, a breakfast-cup each time—I did not give her whisky; she was very troublesome for stout; she had four or five pots during the day—I think she was the worse for drink during the nine days she was with me—the prisoner handled her very roughly at the door; I could not positively swear that he knocked her out—I did not push her out—she ad been stopping at my house once before this, from May to July—her</p>

I am a builder, in Ripples ton Road, Plumstead—on 2nd October, about half-past eight in the evening, I was passing 7, High Street, and saw a crowd at Eldred's gate—I was quite a stranger to everyone concerned in this case—as I came up I saw the front door was open—I saw the prisoner and Mrs. Wood standing in the passage—</p>

               <p>as far as I could see she only had on a petticoat and chemise—he was holding her up by her shoulders against the passage wall, continually shaking her against the wall; then he pushed her outside on the flag-stones; she fell straight down, all of a heap; he lifted her up, and held her against the side of the front door—seeing that she had on only the petticoat and chemise, I asked him if he could not manage to get her away—he said he had a horse and cart outside, but it was loaded with potatoes—and then he said someone had gone for a cab—he was swearing at her a great deal, calling her a drunken beast; and he said, "Here's a pretty mother of six children"—her boots and jacket were thrown out of the house, and I helped to put on the jacket; when the cab came I helped the prisoner to get her in—she was partially helpless; she was able to stand—the prisoner asked me to assist him in getting her into the cab, and I did so; I got in also, and we all three drove to 11, High Street, Woolwich, the prisoner's residence—he had a second<lb/>hand wardrobe shop there—on her way there Mrs. Wood leaned forward out of the cab window, and the prisoner pushed her back; that was done repeatedly as we went along—when we reached the corner of Eyre Street she leaned out again, and the prisoner caught hold of her by the neck and thrust and pushed her head right out of the window and said, "Let the people see what a b----drunken beast you are"—on arriving at his house he immediately jumped out of the cab, caught hold of her legs and commenced pulling her out; I caught hold of her arms to prevent her head falling on the pavement; he had not asked me to do so; her head would certainly have fallen on the pavement if I had not done that—in that way we carried her through the shop into the passage—she said nothing in going there; but when we got to the passage she called out, "Not there, not there,!" as it was dark—I asked the prisoner where we were going—he said, "Lay her down here a moment, I will get a light"—we did so, and then he took her into the back room—she asked me if I would assist her to get up—I got her up on her feet, and she said, "As soon as you are gone he will beat me unmercifully"—he was not there then, he had gone for a light—another person came in, and between us we assisted her on to a couch—she got upon her feet and walked to a little table or piece of furniture in the corner, and just then the prisoner came in, and immediately went up to her, put his hand on her throat, and threw her down with all his force on the couch, her head striking against the window-sill—she was about three feet from the couch—it was a violent push—he then went out of the room, and the female prisoner came in—had not seen her before—she called her mother a drunken beast, and said, "I wish you had drowned yourself in the ferry, as you said you would"—the deceased then got up off the couch and walked to the fire-place, and said, "Amy, I am your mother"—she said, "I suppose you are," and with that she went up to her and threw her back on the couch, just as her father had done, and her head struck violently on the window, as it had done before—she did not complain of being hurt—she did not speak at all afterwards while I was there—I said to the female prisoner, "You have no right to do that to your mother"—she said, "Oh, she makes me so wild"—she said that just as the male prisoner came in—he had a piece of rope in his hand, about three or four feet long, like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and he said, "Call and see me another time, will you?"—I said, "Yes," wished him good night, and left—I left the</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Gaston, a coachbuilder at Woolwich—I have known the deceased some years—on 2nd October I was in the prisoner's shop, 11, High Street, when she was brought in—she appeared to be very weak and ill—I assisted to get her into the parlour, and remained there with her some little time—she only had on a jacket put over her chemise—I saw her neck, and right down below her waist—there were no marks of violence upon her—I heard the prisoner call her a drunken beast—I left the parlour, leaving the witness Groom there; she was partly lying on the couch as we put her—I saw the female prisoner there; she called her mother a drunken beast, very much the same as her father did.</p>

I am a registered medical practitioner, of 144, High Street, Woolwich—the deceased had been a patient of mine before the 3rd of October—I attended her for the results of drunkenness—on the morning of 3rd October, about 8.40, I was called by the prisoner to his house—I got there about 8.50—I found the deceased in the back kitchen lying on her back on the floor with a pillow under her head—she had on a petticoat and a chemise, which was open down the front—she had been dead I should say about ten or twenty minutes in all probability—she would cool more quickly from want of clothing—I noticed a bruise on the right temple; one eye was considerably blackened, the other slightly so, and there was some dried blood on the entrance of the nose, partially hang<lb/>ing from the nose—the upper lip was bruised and lacerated, the right chin bruised, a large bruise extending across the base of the neck, anteriorly, and a slight bruise, not recent, on the left side of the chin—that was all I noticed just then—next day I made a post-mortem in con<lb/>nection with Dr. Logie—externally we found bruises on the neck, shoulder, upper and lower left arm; the left hand—upper and lower</p>

               <p>right arm, left hip, thigh, and lower limbs, and semi-oval marks—internally, on removing the skull cap, I found slight extravasa<lb/>tion of blood corresponding with the bruise on the right temple, with some slight extravasation behind, about the size of the palm of the hand, and oval markings, the dura mater and other membranes congested, the brain itself softened, the right lung healthy, the left had marks of old adhesions—the heart fairly healthy—the cause of death was ex<lb/>haustion, the result of chronic alcoholism and want of food, death being accelerated by shock from recent violence—all the injuries of any im<lb/>portance had, undoubtedly, been caused within twenty-four Hours—this piece of cord may possibly have caused some of the bruising, but not the oval markings—I don't think the bruising might have been caused by the woman falling, in a state of intoxication—some of them might—un<lb/>doubtedly death was accelerated by the bruises which could not have occurred accidentally.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the New Cross Branch of the London and South-Western Bank, Lewisham High Road—the prisoner opened an account there in June this year in his own name—on 30th July I had written authority from him only to accept cheques counter<lb/>signed by his wife—I have not got a copy of the account—on the 10th November the account was overdrawn, and on that night I went to the prisoner's house with reference to it; I cannot swear as to whether I saw him; if I did not see him I left an over-draft notice—afterwards I saw him and spoke to him about the over-draft—he had no authority to over<lb/>draw his account—on 3rd December, 1890, this cheque marked "C" for £5 10s., payable to self and dated 28th November, signed George Mason and not countersigned, was presented for payment—we had no funds at the time with which to pay it, and it was returned marked "Requires another signature"—another cheque on the same account was presented for payment and returned on the same day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner's account was opened by a payment of £50—in the course of a day or so he received a book of cneques con<lb/>taining twenty-five or fifty cheques—he may have increased his credit to £66 10s. that month; I cannot say; he paid in about £400 altogether—to the best of my memory there was a balance of £31 15s. to his credit at the end of June—I believe on 30th September the accounts showed that his credits had amounted to upwards of £300; I cannot say if there was a balance to his credit then; I should not like to say there was not—from 30th September to 3rd November there might have been pay<lb/>ments of £57 13s. to his credit—if there are two answers that can be put on a cheque when it is returned you can put which you like; if a cheque that requires two signatures is presented with only one signature and there is no money to meet it, you can say another signature is re<lb/>quired—both cheques that were not paid were of the same date, and were presented for payment on 3rd December; the second one came through one of the London banks—I did not see the prisoner on the</p>

I am manager of the London and Provincial Bank, Bermondsey branch, Old Kent Road—on 8th July the prisoner came and mentioned the name of a customer, and said he wished to open an account; he said he had no business; that he was expecting money from a mortgage which he was trying to effect, and he would pay in several hundreds—he called on the 9th, and on the 10th he came pro<lb/>fessedly to complete opening the account, and to pay in—I took a copy of his signature, and I called to my clerk for a cheque-book and a paying-in book; in the course of conversation the prisoner took up the cheque-book and slipped it into his pocket, and then after a few more remarks he made some excuse about not having the money with him, or something to that effect, but that he would be back in half an hour to pay in the money, and he went out with the cheque-book—I did not like to question his <hi rend="italic">bona fides</hi> by demanding it back, as I thought it was a genuine transaction—he came the next day, and I asked for the cheque-book—he said he had not got it with him—I went to his house on three occasions, but did not see him—he never paid any money in—four or five cheques out of that book</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 94, Faraday Street, Camberwell—on Saturday night, October 17th, about 11.45, I was at Cherry Garden Pier, Rotherhithe—I was sober enough to know I was on the pier—I met the two prisoners—they asked my business; I said, "I want a boat to go to my ship"—they agreed to row me there, and after walking a few yards they separated, allowing me to go before them, and when I was in front received two blows, which were not heavy—one of the prisoners must have given me the blows, because there was nobody else there—I as seized by the throat, and one of them, I think West, searched my right trousers pocket, and took out 9 1/2 d. in bronze—I said, "You have taken all I have got; let me go"—West said, "The b----has got it here," pointing to my left breast pocket—and then Roach put his hand in my breast pocket, and took out four separate shillings—when I left home I had five shillings, one of which was a Jubilee shilling of 1888: that was taken from me, and I have not seen it since—I was thrown to the ground on my back, and they knelt on me and put their hands on my throat and searched my trousers—I tried to gain my feet, and struggled with one of them, but found them too strong for me—I missed my bag from my shoulder containing provisions and clothing—they ran away, and I called "Police!" and got up, and, looking to the right, I saw the two prisoners hastening away as fast as possible—I pointed them out to the police, who ran after them, and I saw them in custody the same night—they were taken about forty yards from the spot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not sitting on Cherry Garden Pier with my legs dangling over the water; nor did one of the men come up and shake me, and say that I should get drowned there; nor did I say, "I am on my ship"—one man did not tell me that I was not sober—I had left my house in Faraday Street, Walworth, between nine and ten o'clock, after taking my supper with my wife and family—it takes me an hour and a half to walk to Cherry Garden Pier—I had some ale in the Duncan,</p>

               <p>and got change to pay the boatman—I had half a pint of ale for my supper, but nothing after I left the Duncan—I was perfectly sober when I was on the pier—a man named Telford did not, to my knowledge, come up while these men were holding me on the ground—my bag has been found—both the prisoners said before the Magistrate that they found me on the pier in danger of going over.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 64, Cherry Garden Street—on this Sunday morning I was near Cherry Garden Pier with two other men, and heard a cry of "Police!"—I went towards the place, and saw the prisoners kneeling on Kinder, who was on the ground on his back—West got up, and said, "All right, you are not in a hurry, Jack"—I went for the police—two policemen ran after them and brought them back—Roach said, "Again for nothing."</p>

I am a carman, of 7, Searl's Alley, King Street, Rotherhithe—on 17th October, a little after twelve o'clock, I was near Cherry Garden Pier, and saw the prisoners kneeling on the old man—there were about six of us together—West said, "Hold on, you are not in a hurry, are you?" and got up off the prosecutor, and we went and told the police—Roach did not get off the prosecutor—the police came up, and the prisoners ran—there were no lights; it was quite dark—I saw the prisoners at the station.</p>

West stated that he heard a man snoring, and found the Prosecutor with his legs hanging over a wall, and told him he would be drowned, and he asked for his bag, and said he had thrown it into a barge, and as he was going away the witnesses came up.</hi>

On 15th October I was keeping watch on 63, Bird-in-Bush Road, Peckham—I saw Sarah Bishop, whom I knew as Mrs. Worms, come out—I followed and arrested her, out of sight of the house, and sent her to the Police-station, and then I immediately went into 63, Bird-in-Bush Road—I pulled a string in the centre of the door, it opened, and I entered without making any noise—I went into a room on the right-hand of the ground-floor, where I found Williams holding this shilling in one hand and filing it with a file which he held in his right—I and Dove seized him; he dropped the file, and shut his left hand—I took the shilling from him—I found in two handkerchiefs-open on the table, 70 base florins, 121 base shillings, and 7 base sixt-pences—in the bag, which was" fastened, not locked, was this mould; ie was by the side of the table in the centre of the room, close to whers Williams was sitting—behind a chest of drawers I found two clamp, and two ladles—in the room was a tin box; I got the key of it from Bishop, and found in it 22 base shillings, wrapped in strips of news<lb/>paper—I sent Williams away to the Police-station in a cab at once—not long after Davis was brought into the station by Dove, who handed me packets containing in all 38 counterfeit shillings and 38 counterfeit florins—he said he had found them on Davis—I said to Davis, "I have got Mrs. Worms and Williams here, and all the moulds and coining implements, as well as a lot of base money. You will be charged with being concerned with them in possessing the moulds, with manufacturing base coin, and with possessing these 176 base coins"—he made no answer—I said, "What is your name?"—he said, "William Davis"—I said, "I know you as <hi rend="italic">Billycock Charley</hi>; will you tell me where you</p>

               <p>live?"—he said, "No"—half an hour later I saw him; he gave me another name and address—Dove wont there—Davis said, "My wife has nothing to do with it; don't upset her, but break it to her gently; you will find nothing there"—I took possession of two bags at the house—Davis was detained at the station, but when I returned I was informed that he had gone—subsequently I received information—I communicated with the Chatham Police, and then I went to Chatham and found the prisoner in the police-station there, and arrested him—I said, "Well, Charley, we have met again"—he said, "You cannot blame me, Mr. Fox; I saw the oppor-tunity and I got away"—I brought him to London—on the way he said he wanted to know what I was going to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> him for—I repeated the charge—he said, "How can you <hi rend="italic">do</hi> me for making?"—I said, "You have been seen by my officers to visit the house, 63, Bird-in-Bush Road, several times, and you have been seen in company with the man Williams"—he said, "I was in the house the day before, when he was making, but I did not take any part in it; I have been in the habit of visiting the old woman for a long time, but you can only <hi rend="italic">do</hi> me for what is found on me"—I was present when all these things were found; molten metal, pieces of glass, copper wire, silver sand, plaster of Paris, antimony, and other things; they were all on or about the table, with the exception of the two ladles and the clamps, which were behind the chest of drawers.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PURCELL</hi>. The officer who had charge of Davis has told me that he went outside the room, and when he returned Davis was gone—I do not blame him for going—yesterday morning this bill was found with other bills, and then about two o'clock another bill was preferred before the Grand Jury, for possessing 176 coins—I did not hear it suggested that this case would not be tried yesterday because there was another bill going before the Grand Jury—you made some application about it, and Mr. Wilkinson did not quite agree as to adjourning it for that purpose.</p>

I was watching this house, 63, Bird-in-Bush Road, on 13th October, and I saw Davis go in there about three o'clock—he appeared to let himself in—he remained there about twenty minutes, and then went to the public-house by himself—on 14th another officer watched—on 15th I was there, and about 1.30 I saw him go into the house; he was just on the top of the steps going into the door when I caught hold of him—I said, "Do you live here?"—he said, "No, I have been led away"—I said, "I shall take you into custody for being concerned with a man who was making bad money here this morning"—I told him I had seen him there before—he said, "You will find what you want in my coat pocket"—I found in his right-hand coat pocket this rag, which contained eight little parcels containing these thirty-eight bad florins and thirty-eight bad shillings, separately wrapped up, with paper between each—I said, "These are all bad"—he said, "Yes, I had them from the man here yesterday, and I was bringing them back"—I took him to the Police station—I handed the coins to Fox.</p>

                  </hi>. I used to rent some rooms at 63, Bird-in-Bush Road, Peckham, from Mrs. Bishop, who occupied the right-hand room on the ground floor from 22nd May, when I went there, till she was arrested—I have seen Williams come to the house, not very often—he was not a lodger there—he went to Mrs. Bishop's room when he came—I know Davis by his coming to the house—I first saw him about a month before his arrest or longer, and sometimes I saw him two or three time a week, and sometimes I did not hear him come at all—he went to Mrs. Bishop's room—he used to come about ten or eleven in the morning, or in the afternoon—I cannot say who was in the room besides Davis when he came on those visits; I never went into Mrs. Bishop's room only when she was there by herself—I do not know if Davis and Williams were ever in the room together; I always shut my door when I was in my room on the opposite side—Davis was the first to come there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I knew nothing of the house before 22nd May—Davis might have been coming to the house for two months; I did not notice the time—I had no more reason for noticing Mrs. Bishop's visitors than other lodgers—I think I had two or three conversations with Fox before I gave evidence at the Police-court—I have seen Davis come with a little girl, and go with her into Mrs. Bishop's room—the little girl was his daughter, I believe—I cannot say if she was in the room when Williams and Bishop were there—I have been in Bishop's room when she was alone; I saw nothing suspicious or startling there—on one occasion Bishop gave him some wood to take to his wife—no one stopped in her room all night—I don't know how long ho stopped in the room—the only other lodger in the house was Mrs. Reece—Fox saw her—I am a widow—Davis frequented the house before Williams.</p>

I lived at 63, Bird-in-Bush Road till 26th October, occupying the kitchen downstairs and a room on the second floor—I have seen Davis at that house three or four times, I think; he went into the room on the right-hand ground floor when he came—I have seen him there twice or three times a week—I have never seen him in the room; I have never been in the room when he has been there—I have seen him at the door of the room—I saw him with Williams at Bishop's door about a month before the police searched the place.</p>

I am the wife of William Pitman, 11, Upper George Row—I am a charwoman—I can see into Chapel Court from my kitchen window—on this morning I heard a horrible noise up the court, looked out of the window and saw Collins holding the urinal door; as I screamed he left hold of the door, and Baker and Williams came out, struggled, and fell to the ground; Williams' arms were round Baker's neck—when Baker was on the ground Collins had hold of his right arm, and had one hand on his chest—about that time a constable came up, and I was called away to get my dinner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Williams</hi>. Your arms were round Baker's neck, and you were kneeling on him afterwards, when Collins was holding him down.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Collins.</hi> When they came out of the urinal you followed after, and helped to throw Baker down with your right hand, and held him down—I could not see if you used violence when he was. on the ground—I saw you for about five minutes—I could not call any<lb/>one's attention, to it, there was no one else there then—I did not go to the Police-court till I was fetched—it did not seem as if you were assisting Baker.</p>

I am a carman at 59, Snow's Fields—at 10.15 on this morning I was passing down the High Street, and I heard a scream up Chapel Court, and went to look, and I saw Baker on the ground; Collins was holding him, with one hand on his arm and the other on his chest, and Williams was on the other side of him—other people came up, and a constable came and took Williams—I lost sight of Collins till I saw him against the church; I saw the piece of chain thrown away, and heard him say to Archer that he would nit him in the b----g eye—Archer picked up the chain, and gave it to the constable.</p>

I have been on duty in Tabard Street—I know the prisoner by sight; I have seen him four or five times altogether between August and October this year—he has always been drunk—about three months before the child's death I saw him once with his wife—lie was drunk—she said, "Why don't you give me some money to got some food for the children?"—he swore at her and told her to go away—I saw him two or three days before the Sunday on which the child died; he was drunk—the woman was always perfectly sober when I saw her—I never saw her drunk yet.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Manchester Tavern, Tabard Street—I know the prisoner and his wife—he has been in the habit of attending my house at times during the last two or three months—he and his wife were there on the Saturday night before the Sunday of the child's death—the prisoner was drunk; his wife was sober and crying—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189111160138"/>
               <p>she came in first, and the prisoner came in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards and made a blow at her—I could not say whether he struck her or the child, but the child dropped on the floor, undoubtedly through the blow—I did not hear anything particular said by either, there was a general scrimmage between them, and I had to get out and eject them—I stopped them from going further—there were one or two more women in the side box, and they began halloaing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife, and lived with him at 250, Tabard Street—we have two children, one not quite nine and the other not quite three, and a third was born on 7th August last—she was not named—she died on Sunday, 4th October, when seven weeks old—during that time she did not have enough food; I did not have enough food. for two or three months before she was born, nor after she was born until she died, because my husband was out of work for a week before Whitsuntide, and I only had what I earned myself for the other two children and myself—after the birth of the child I could not get any work myself; I could not go out, and they would not give me work to do at home—my husband was still out of work; he lived at home with me from the time of the birth till the death, except two nights and a day when he was away in the country looking for work—he knew before he went out that I had no food—when I took my baby to the parish doctor the relieving officer would not give me an order till my husband went up; he refused to give me a doctor's order for the baby which I had with me—my baby had been under the hospital before that—when I was told my husband must go up he was in the country, and did not return till the Tuesday; then I told him—I had got a half-pint bottle of diarrhoea medicine from Mr. Reed, which Mr. Smith had written me out a paper for—he opened my baby's eyes, but he did not tell me what to do, or say that I wanted nourishment, or anything—they told me if I came again to get relief my husband must come—I told my husband, and he said it was too late that night to go; if the child was no better on the Wednesday morning he would go and see if he could get an order—I do not know whether he went—I cud not go into Mr. Bryant's house, the Manchester Tavern, the night before the child died; it was about a fortnight before the child died; my hus<lb/>band hit me in the mouth, and that knocked the child out of my arms—I had just gone in for half a pint, and my husband, who was inside the house, rushed at me without saying anything.</p>

I am a doctor, living at 304, Walworth Road—on 29th September Eliza Broomfield came through an order given by the relieving officer to me, bringing a child about two months old, very delicate-looking and much emaciated—the woman told me the symptoms—I gave her some medicine—on the 5th October she came for a certificate of death—I refused it, and on the 9th made a post-mortem examination by order of the Coroner—the cause of the child's death was starvation—a mother cannot feed a child at the breast if she has insufficient nourish<lb/>ment herself.</p>
