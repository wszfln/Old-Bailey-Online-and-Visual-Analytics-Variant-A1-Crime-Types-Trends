                  </hi> (336 <hi rend="italic">E</hi>). On 5th June, about, twenty minutes past twelve, I was on duty in Seven Dials—I heard a report of firearms, and saw the prisoner running away, and a crowd of people pursuing him shouting "Stop him, he has shot some man"—I ran after him, and took him into custody—he had this revolver in his waistcoat pocket—I examined it at the station; it is a six-chambered revolver, two chambers were loaded; there was a spent cartridge in one barrel—he had on him a box containing forty-seven cartridges, a pawn-ticket for a watch for 12s., a card-case, two knives, a bunch of keys, and a pair of sleeve-links—the revolver is a new one, the cartridges fit it—the prisoner said he had pawned his watch that morning to buy the revolver—he seemed sober.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner showed me a cut behind his ear; it was a small cut, recent; it was not actually bleeding.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Charing Cross Hospital—I examined the prosecutor when brought there—I found a contusion on the left side of the abdomen just below the last rib—his coat and waistcoat were shot through, and his corduroy trousers were indented—I saw him two or three times afterwards—he is well now—the contusion may have been caused by a bullet; if the abdomen had been penetrated it would have been very dangerous—the thickness of the corduroy stopped the bullet.</p>

I live at 12, Upper Porchester Street—I had a gold watch which I left at Sir John Bennett's in May, I think, to be repaired—it was to be sent to me, but I did not receive it—the prisoner was managing a temperance restaurant for me—I asked him if he had received the watch, or seen any packet; he said, "No"—I went to Sir John Bennett's, after which I spoke to the prisoner again—he said he had had it three weeks and forgot it—I told him I had asked him for it; he said I had not—he produced it; it is worth £50—assuming that the parcel was directed to me he had no right to open it—I had six tablespoons, six dessert-spoons, six tea-spoons, and six forks, which had never been used—I did not miss them till I saw them at the pawnbroker's after the prisoner was in custody—this is my watch and my silver, and has my initials on it.</p>

I live at 9, Tramway Avenue—I was outside these premises against the lamp-post—we heard the row and heard Mrs. Haylop swearing in the parlour, and after that the prisoner looked out at the front bedroom window and said, "Charlie, fetch a policeman"—he said, "Shan't"—that was quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before the Hay lops had gone into the house—it is not true that before the Haylops were in the house the prisoner called out, "Go and fetch a policeman."</p>

I am a tram-driver, of 20, Hilda Terrace—about 11. 15 something was said to me, and I ran up to where I saw a disturbance, and saw the prosecutor and prisoner in the room—the prisoner had a child about twelve months old in his arms, and the prosecutor was about to strike him with, a file—I said, "Don't hit him," and I caught him by his trousers and shook him, and made a grab at the file, but did not get it—he went in and came out again, and I said, "Will you go back, and let the constable come and settle it?" and we put the prosecutor in the room, and he sat at the right-hand corner of the mantelpiece—he had had some drink—the prisoner was as sober as I am now.</p>

Pattison and Co. 's, Australian Avenue—as I was going there I met a man at the door coming down the stairs—he asked me for the delivery-sheet; I had it in my hand; this is it—he took it from me and said, "I will go"—he brought it back signed, and directed me to take the goods to Milton Street, where I unloaded them under a shed near a warehouse—he helped me; we put them where he told me—he was neither of the prisoners—I have not seen the cases since—I believed him to be in the employment of Messrs. Pattison, or I should not have delivered up the sheet or the goods.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 13, Selborne Road, Wood Green—I am book-keeper in the employment of the District Messenger Service and News Company (Limited)—I have known Walker for four or five years—I also know Murray, who was formerly in the employment of the District Messenger Company as a cashier—he was discharged from the service—about the end of April I met Walker on my way home from Broad Street Station, and when we got to Wood Green I went with him to the Alexandra Palace Hotel—he asked me what I was doing, and I told him I was employed at the District Messenger Service Company in the City—he said, "Oh, that company! Is it going to be amalgamated with the Boy Messenger Company?"—I said, "Yes," the amalgamation was about to take place—he asked me if I was satisfied; if they paid me well—I said, "No"—he said, "Do they pay you well?"—I said, "No"—he said, "Could not you give me some information to put into the paper?"—I then asked him what paper it was—he said, "I am the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Beacon</hi>"—I told him I had not heard of it—he said he thought that if I could put some particulars in his paper, ask some questions of a test</p>

               <p>nature, that in all probability the management of the District Messenger Company would be glad to shut us up for money—I said I was only on one side of the business, that I was not in a position to give him the evidence that would be of any service to him, "But I can get you the evidence you require"—he said I might put some test questions in the paper—I said I could not give him the information personally, "But I can get you the information from Mr. Murray"—directly I mentioned Murray's name he said, "I know Murray; I think I know Murray"—I told him on that occasion that Murray had been connected with the District Messenger Company as cashier since its formation, or nearly so, but that he had been dismissed—I did not say what he was doing at that time, whether he was then in employment—it was arranged that I should write to Murray, and that we should go to the <hi rend="italic">Beacon</hi> office together to see Walker—I wrote to Murray, and we met and went together to the <hi rend="italic">Beacon</hi> office in New Broad Street; it was on the 6th of May I believe—I saw Walker there, and the three of us were together in a private room—I said, "This is Mr. Murray"—Walker did not appear to know him, although he said he had known him on the previous occasion—we sat down and got into conversation about the District Messenger Company, its origin and capital, and all the rest of it, and during the conversation there were several suggestions made for matters to appear in the <hi rend="italic">Beacon</hi>—Walker said, "I am prepared to print some articles about the District Messenger Company, if either of you could give the information"—I had previously told Mr. Walker, at Wood Green, that there had been an extraordinary meeting of the directors to arrange about the Paris capital, and that £75,000 additional capital was required for amalgamating with the Boy Messenger Company; I afterwards learnt that to be incorrect—I said the Paris company was ripe for floating—that subject was referred to at this interview, which was very short—Walker asked me what the takings of the company were, and I said they had grown considerably and were now between £60 and £70 a-day—when Walker said he was prepared to print articles about the company if we could give information, I had no information to give; Murray said he would give information—they were in conversation, and I don't know what he said—Walker asked questions and Murray answered them; I don't know what the questions or answers were—Walker took notes on some paper on the pad on his desk—Walker asked me what the company's takings were at present, as I was in the company—I said between £60 and £70 per day, and I also added that the expenses were very heavy—I had told Murray I wanted him to go and see Walker at the <hi rend="italic">Beacon</hi> office, and give him as much information as he could about the District Messenger Company, with a view to print articles about the company—the purpose was arranged at the office afterwards—I believe I asked the question at the office, "What are we to get out of this?"—Walker said, "You must wait and see what we can get out of Russell, or the company," and that after a few of the articles had appeared Mr. Russell would be very glad to pay to stop them—I think the arrangement as to what was to be done with the money in the event of Russell paying was at the next interview—we had no other interview before the publication of the paper on May 10th—I think we saw him on the next Saturday—the <hi rend="italic">Beacon</hi> was published on Wednesday—this is a copy of May 10th.

                  <hi rend="italic">Messenger and News Company," was read. It referred to the proposed amalgamation with the Boy Messenger Company, asked whether, before the proposed</hi> £75,000 <hi rend="italic">additional capital was subscribed, it would not be well for shareholders to find out where the previously subscribed capital had gone, why the business was carried on at a loss, and oilier questions concerning the company, and stated that they should have something to say about these points and about the Paris Company shortly</hi>)—after that issue I saw Murray and Walker together at the <hi rend="italic">Beacon</hi> office; on the following Saturday, I think, I could not say positively, it was the 13th—general conversation took place on matters relating to the District Messenger Company, and it was arranged, after various suggestions had been made by one and another, that a letter should be written—I took notes of what was said, and took the notes home and wrote a letter, and sent it by post, and I afterwards saw that letter signed "Veritas" in print in the <hi rend="italic">Beacon</hi> of 31st May—I saw a copy of the <hi rend="italic">Beacon</hi> every week—before that letter appeared I saw this paragraph in the issue of 24th May. (<hi rend="italic">This paragraph stated that the paper would shortly show why the money increasing the capital of the District Messenger Company was required, and criticise the last balance-sheet; and that the Russell group of companies would also occupy their space. The letter signed "Veritas" was then read. It stated that in view of the fact that no dividend had ever been declared by either the District Messenger or the Boy Messenger Company, and the great doubt that existed as to whether the additional capital in consequence of the amalgamation would be subscribed, it was incumbent upon the shareholders of the District Messenger Company to insist upon a thorough investigation of affairs to find out where the bulk of the original capital went, and by what hands the company was run. The letter concluded:</hi>—"Why has the managing director delegated his authority and position as general manager to a subordinate, who is both ignorant and incompetent? Is this worthy director aware that while he is occupying his time with flying visits to Paris and Brussels in the fond hope that his pockets will be filled by Continental dupes, a question must arise, apart from any patent rights, that he will be held responsible for the maladministration of this company? There are other companies in which this man is interested, which equally require invest at ion, but the shareholders of the District Messenger Company should shake off their apathy and insist upon an immediate inquiry with a view of ascertaining the whole truth. Your obedient servant, <hi rend="smallCaps">VERITAS</hi>.")—on the Saturday before, the 31st, I asked again what remuneration we were to have for the letters; I spoke for myself and Murray—Walker said, "I have got nothing yet, but you and Murray will have half between you, and the other half will go to myself and partner—Murray was with me then—Walker said he hoped to get £100 from Russell—a few days afterwards, Walker said, "I have sent a man to Mr. Russell, but he seems very difficult to deal with," or something to that effect; that he had got nothing out of him—on 24th June, Murray and I visited the <hi rend="italic">Beacon</hi> office for the last time, and during the conversation we had with Walker it was arranged that I should write a letter, and that Murray should write another letter, and for that purpose we were each handed a stamped envelope directed to the <hi rend="italic">Beacon</hi> office, New Broad Street House—the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189307240025"/>
               <p>letters were to be as from members of the public, one slating the company and the other asking a lot of questions—this is the envelope I received; I saw Walker direct it, and put a stamp on it—I saw this issue of the <hi rend="italic">Beacon</hi> of 14th June, 1893; I used to go to the office and get the papers as they appeared. (<hi rend="italic">A paragraph concerning the District Messenger Company in the</hi> Beacon <hi rend="italic">for June</hi> 14<hi rend="italic">th, was read. It gave estimates of probable receipts and expenses of the company, and stated that the figures were conclusivs that the company could not pay its way, and every day got deeper into trouble; that if these facts had been placed before them the shareholders would never have consented to the issue of</hi> £75,000 <hi rend="italic">preference stock; that the</hi> Beacon <hi rend="italic">could not see how anyone would be My enough to take any of it up; that the balance-sheet for</hi> 1892 <hi rend="italic">had not yet appeared, and the statement for</hi> 1891 <hi rend="italic">showed debts owing to the amount of nearly</hi> £10,000; <hi rend="italic">that there was plenty of opportunity for the extension of the business, which was a profitable one, but that there would have to be a change in its affairs before it could be made to pay; and that the</hi> Beacon <hi rend="italic">intended to enter into further details, more especially with reference to the incep<lb/>tion of the company, the manner in which the shares were distributed, etc.</hi>)—I received this letter from Murray, in his writing, after sending in the "Veritas" letter. (<hi rend="italic">This, dated June</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">nd, stated tint the</hi> "<hi rend="italic">Veritas</hi>" <hi rend="italic">letter was a regular stinger, and rigid up to the point; that he would meet him in Newgate Street on Saturday or Monday; and that he wanted to see and talk over matters with him, as he thought the time was now fast approaching when a collapse must take place</hi>)—when this matter was going on I received both these letters from Walker—they are in his writing—they are undated—I have noted on the second one, "June 26th, 1893." (<hi rend="italic">These letters were read. The first stated that six o'clock was too late, but named Saturday before eleven, or at one, two, or three. The second was:</hi> "Heard from neither of you this morning. I have been to Somerset House. You both give me a lot of trouble. Shall be here up to 5. 30, very possibly at Manor House at nine to 9. 30")—Walker said he had investigated the register at Somerset House as far as he could, and had brought some particulars away, which he should put into print—he said he had sent the <hi rend="italic">Beacon</hi> to the directors and secretary, and as many shareholders as he had the addresses of—"You both give me a lot of trouble" I take to refer to his not receiving the two letters we had promised him on the previous Saturday for publication on the Wednesday—on 24th June, after leaving Walker's office, Murray and I agreed not to have anything more to do with the <hi rend="italic">Beacon</hi> office, and we did not, because we were not paid—Noah's name was mentioned once; it was when I kept the appointment, in reply to Walker's letter, at the Manor House, a public-house in Wood Green, on 26th June, from nine to 9. 30—I saw Walker in the bar there after I had been there some half-hour, and he said, "By-the-bye, do you know Noah?" or "Major Noah?"—I said, "O, I do not"—I asked two or three times about the money—he said he had got nothing—on this occasion I did not ask who Noah was, and he did not tell me; we had no further conversation on the subject—on 27th June Mr. Russell made a statement to me, and I found he knew what had been going on, and then I made a statement to him in reply to his charge against me—Mr. Russell took me round directly to Mr. Wontner's office, and I repeated what I had said—I was at the Mansion</p>

               <p>House on Saturday, July 1st, when warrants were granted against Walker and Noah—that evening, about six o'clock, I got home to Wood Green—my wife made me a communication, in consequence of which I went to see the secretary of the company, and afterwards to the Police-station—I subsequently got home between eleven and half-past eleven—I then saw Walker sitting on the iron rail which divided the forecourts—he said, "At last, eh! I should have waited here all night; what have you been saying about me?"—I asked him what he meant, what he was alluding to—he said, "Oh! you know all about it; you know there is a warrant out against me"—I said I was not supposed to know that—he said, "Has Out ram got it?"—I said I believed he had—he said, "Do you think it is likely he will execute it to-morrow?" (that was Sunday)—he asked me that twice, and I replied each time that I had no idea what the warrant officer would do—he asked if Messrs. Wontner were the solicitors—I said, "Yes, they are"—he said, "Is the charge one of libel?"—I said, "No, it is not"—he said, "Oh, frightful, I shall get five years for this"—I did not tell what it was; he knew the alternative, I presume—he then left, and I went indoors—I next saw him at the Mansion House in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COCK</hi>. I am fifty-six—during part of that time I have been in business in the City—I was employed by this company at £2 10s. a week, and that is the whole of my income—I have ten children—the District Messenger Company has been before the public about three years, I believe; it was said that £200,000 capital was subscribed, but I don't know how much—there was a proposal to amalgamate it with another company, and it was about that that Walker first spoke to me—he desired, as far as I could see, to have some information about the nature of the company—I should have given him correct information if I had been able to do so—the £75,000 was an erroneous statement altogether by me, I made a mistake; I thought £75,000 was required for the purpose of buying up the Boy Messenger Company, but it was a mistake—that was what I communicated to Walker—there was the question at the same time of promoting a company in Paris; it was to be part in Paris and part in London—Walker told me that the <hi rend="italic">Beacon</hi> was a financial paper, and I understood that it was—I was prepared to give him such information as was in my power for a consideration—Murray had been in the employment of the company from the very beginning, a long time before I was there, and had been for a long time their cashier, and no doubt he knew a great deal more about the company than I did—I knew that Murray was not very friendly towards the company—I knew that he would be a likely kind of person both to possess knowledge and to give it to Walker—Walker said he thought he knew him; but afterwards when he came there, so far as I could see, he did not know him—I introduced him—I would not be certain whether anything was said about remuneration at the first meeting; I could not say whether it was the first or second occasion—I don't remember what I said before—I believe something was said about remuneration on the first occasion, I won't swear it; I cannot remember everything—I had given information to Walter before about a certain company as to which I had means of information—I was in the service of that company—on that occasion I got 10s. and a drink for a letter written about the previous company—I swore</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189307240027"/>
               <p>on the last occasion (and it would be my present impression), "No Arrangement as to pay was made with Walker; I based my calculations as to the reward on previous experience. I expected about 10s. an article and drinks"—that does not say anything about the arrangement that was made—I should have been satisfied with that which I was paid when I contributed to the <hi rend="italic">Observer</hi>—Mr. Russell had got all the information for this prosecution before I said a word—I was aware before I made my statement to Russell that he had discovered my communication with Walker—at that time my only means of livelihood was the £2 10s. I was receiving from the company—I am with the company still—I and Murray went to the <hi rend="italic">Beacon</hi> office, so far as I know, to give the editor of that paper accurate information to the best of our power, and, so far as I know, we both did that—it was a very small room in which the conversation between Walker, Murray, and me took place—we sat at a small table in the room, and I heard every word—I could not say whether the business was being carried on at a loss—I should say that for some time it had been—I told Walker that the expenses were very large—I believe that ever since the formation of the company the expenses have been much greater than the revenue—I don't know if the shareholders had received any dividend or not; that was not my suggestion—I believe Walker was informed that they had not—the terms Arranged with the Boy Messenger Company, and the commission to be paid by the American people who supplied the call-boxes was the subject of conversation at this time—I believe Walker was informed that it was the custom for officials to pass tickets for amounts advanced to them out of the till until they accumulated to several hundred pounds, but not by me; probably Murray informed him of that—no doubt Walker had all that information given to him, and he was not able to say whether it was true or not—I think the balance-sheet had not been published by 24th May—I don't think any balance-sheet had been published; I had not seen it—the District and Boy Messenger Companies were amalgamated on 6th May and Mr. Bush is chairman now of the amalgamated companies—I believed that the statements I wrote in the letter of 31st May were true; the letter was not entirely my composition—I never mentioned to anybody, before I knew that Mr. Russell had found out my communications with this paper, the story about dividing what was to be got—I mentioned it first after Mr. Russell pulled the letters out of the safe showing I had had communications—I never saw Noah in my life to my knowledge, and I never heard his name till Walker asked me at the Manor House if I knew him.</p>

Mr. Henry Osborne was the first chairman of the company, I believe; he was not chairman when I went into the employment—Sir John Heron Maxwell was chairman when I went there; he resigned—I don't know who was chairman of the District Messenger Company in May last—I have nothing to do with that side of the business—Murray took very great interest in the company and worked very hard for it, and I think he thought it had a future before it—it was said he was discharged because he was incompetent and could not keep the accounts—he was angry with the officials, and Russell, and Lord, the secretary—he has great heart-burning, I believe—I know he thought the company could not go on in the way it was managed—he had</p>

               <p>told me so; we have had many conversations—Murray introduced me to the company, and we have been friends for a number of years—he was very anxious about the company when I went there two and a half years ago; but he was not allowed to have his own way, and he was dissatisfied with the way the company was conducted—a few days before 6th May, I wrote to Murray to meet me—I think it was in May—immediately after Walker asked me to take Murray to him I wrote to Murray, and then we had the first meeting with Walker early in May, the first week, I think—I did not know that before that Murray was writing to the shareholders of the company, or that he had consulted solicitors about it—I had not seen him for some time before that—when I asked what we were to get out of it, I meant myself and Murray—I am certain that Murray assented to the proposition that he was to get some money—it was thoroughly understood in the first interview that he and I were to get something from Walker—"On taking Murray to the <hi rend="italic">Beacon</hi> office, it was to get further information of a reliable character, to the best of our ability," is not correctly rendered—I don't think the question of money occurred at the first interview; the amount was not mentioned then—I expected we should both be paid; Murray was willing to be paid—we had made no arrangement—no doubt Murray was anxious to give information to the paper, so that the present system of things might be shown up, as he was dissatisfied with the management and complained of his treatment, but he was to be paid for his work—when I swore, "It was not mentioned the first time that Murray was to participate in our arrangement for payment," that was as to the mode of payment—until this matter, I don't think I had spoken twenty words to Russell in two years; he is a stranger to me—I have no reason to be hostile or antagonistic to him—I had no feeling in the matter—Walker was the first person who tempted me to violate my duty to the company—I know Glbson well; he was an advertising agent, who sold his business to Mr. Russell, and I don't know what he is now—he was plaintiff' in a matter in which Mr. Russell, who was my employer, was defendant—I wrote to Glbson the two letters which Russell afterwards showed me—they were not written for revenge, but to assist Glbson—Glbson had promised me a lot of particulars as to the advertising company with which Russell was connected, and he did not send them, and I wrote and asked him to hurry up; that was all in the first letter—Glbson brought the letters to Russell and sold them to him—I don't think they were harmless letters—the second was a little stronger than the first—when Russell got those letters he put a watch on me and Murray, and had us tracked all over London, and we were seen to go to the <hi rend="italic">Beacon</hi> office—I did not say at the Police-court, "I did suggest to Glbson that he should use the columns of a paper for sweet revenge"—my letter to Glbson said, "Now is your time for sweet revenge"—I did not mention the columns of a paper—I told Russell I was very sorry for what I had done—I gave information about Russell which resulted in my being tracked, and then it was found out incidentally that I was going to the <hi rend="italic">Beacon</hi> office—Mr. Lord, the secretary of the company, was present at the interview of 27th in Russell's room—Russell asked whether I had any fault to find with him, or any grievance against him—I said I had not, and I said "You are a stranger to me, Mr. Russell"—he asked me if I had any fault to find with my wages; I said, "No"—he said, "If you</p>

I am general manager and director of the District Messenger Service and News Company, limited—the head office is at 50, Lime Street, and we have branch establishments in different parts of the metropolis—the company has only come into existence within the last two and a-half years—in December last there was a proposal for amalgamating the company with the Boy Messenger Company—in April this year we were taking steps with regard to a Paris company, which has since been brought out—it was an English company for working in Paris—four or five directors were directors of both companies—up to April, or the beginning of May this year, I had never heard of Walker or the <hi rend="italic">Beacon</hi>—on either the 6th or 7th May, when I was coming out of the smoking room of the Victoria Hotel, Noah, whom I never saw before, was introduced to me—I had no conversation with him—the next I heard of him was when I received this letter of 10th May from him, enclosing a cutting from the <hi rend="italic">Beacon</hi> of that date. (<hi rend="italic">This was written on paper with the printed heading, of the Hotel Victoria, addressed from</hi> 7, <hi rend="italic">King Street, Cheapside, and stating that enclosed was a cutting from the</hi> "Beacon," <hi rend="italic">the editor of which was Walker, who had read to him</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Noah</hi>) <hi rend="italic">a long article which lead been prepared for that week's issue, but had not been inserted, cud was talked about for the future, and that perhaps it would be well to send somebody to see what Walker was driving at; that he</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Noah</hi>) <hi rend="italic">had told Walker he was interested in the company's and Russell's success, and that he had called on Friday at Lime Street to see Russell, but as Russell was absent he had mentioned it to Captain Stead</hi>)—I answered that letter to 7, King Street—on 11th May Noah came to see me at 50, Lime Street, the office of the company—I said to him, "Where is Mr. Walker?"—he said, "I represent Mr. Walker; Mr. Walker is very busy, and he cannot come on here"—he said he had called last week to tell me about the article that had been prepared for the <hi rend="italic">Beacon</hi>, but he had persuaded Walker to hold it over till he 'could see me—he said, "Walker has a mass of matter about the District Company and yourself that you would not like to see in print.

                  </hi>. I live at Took's Court, Cursitor Street—I am a bootmaker—on 24th June, about a quarter to seven, I was in Portugal Street with my wife—I saw a man and woman there, walking along, having an altercation—she was abusing him, and using very filthy, disgusting language—he was abusing her in a similar manner, though not to the extent—she was putting herself in a fighting attitude, and fighting also; using her arms in a fighting manner, striking at him and hitting him—he was doing his best with his left hand to keep her off—his right hand was down towards his hip, beneath the flap of his coat—then he struck her in the chest, and she was down in the gutter; he was on the pavement—she screamed, "Oh, Jack!" I think, but I know she said, "Oh, oh!" and put her hand to her breast—he put his arms beneath hers, and walked across the road, as if to support her—I heard him say, "Now you have got it"—he went away towards Clare Market—I advised the women to take her to the hospital, but she said, "No, I don't want to go to the hospital, I will go upstairs"—she walked back to almost the same spot where the blow was struck, and then went back to her residence forty or fifty yards off, the women assisting her—just before the blow was struck they were in close contact, really fronting each other—I did not see the man take two or three steps forward before the blow was struck.</p>

On April 27th I received from the Police-court summonses against the prisoner and two other persons for fraud—on April 29th I went to New Inn Chambers and saw the prisoner—we had met before, and I said, "How do you do, Mr. Binet. I have come to serve summonses on you for fraud and conspiracy—they have been issued at the instance of Mrs. Annabella Jones, from whom you obtained 10s. 6d.—he said, "This is all Mr. Labouchere's showing me up in <hi rend="italic">Truth</hi>"—I said "I have some for your chief inspector, Mr. Godfrey; is he here?"—he said, "No; I think he is in South Africa"—I said, "I have a summons for Mrs. Gray, the celebrated lady detective; where is she?"—he said, "She is in some gentleman's service as housemaid in the name of Thompson"—I said, "If I cannot find them I shall leave the summonses with you"—I explained that it was necessary for him to appear—I said, "We have had complaints at Scotland Yard of your defrauding and attempting to defraud people who have called there"—he said he never intended to defraud anyone—I said I knew he had been shown up in <hi rend="italic">Truth</hi>, and I knew Mr. Newnes had exposed him in <hi rend="italic">Tit Bits</hi>—the summonses were returnable on May 4th—he did not appear, or either of the others, and this warrant was granted—I found he had gone—we followed up various clues, and Serjeant Barton captured him—I have never been able to find Mrs. Gray—after Binet was arrested Godfrey surrendered to me by the advice of his solicitor, Mr. Wontner—he was discharged by the Magistrate, as it was proved that he was simply a clerk—on the last remand but one I received some account-books from the prisoner, who was acting for someone; he had been served with a subpoena to produce them; they are here—one is a letter-book; the first letter in it is dated October, 1890, but I find some letters in it before 1890—here are three letter-books and a case-book which contain cases which are numbered, and also expenses; it is a kind of diary—the last entry in it is May 5th, 1892—there is no book showing any traces of detective work or cases investigated prior to May, 1893—I find in the letter-book a letter in Binet's writing to Mr. Blandfield, of February 5th, 1892—I have heard of the National Detective Office for two years—I find in the prisoner's first letter-book marked A, at page 678, a letter dated August 31st, 1891, suggesting that he should be an agent for some butter company at Jersey; and at page 741 I find that he was proposing to let the office on December 12th, 1891; and by book B, page 673, I find that he was still arranging to let the office—at page 745 of book A, he writes about an agent for London toddy—at page 747 he is endeavouring to get occupation as a house agent—and at page 78, of book A, I find him trying to get a clerkship in Jersey, and afterwards an agency—at page 825 he is writing to a friend at Sheffield, endeavouring to get customers for the sale</p>

               <p>of bird-traps—at page 834 he writes, on April 12th, 1892, to a man who asked for employment, saying that he was not increasing his staff, and has nothing for him to do—it appears that he was first giving instructions for advertisements to be put in the papers about detectives at the end of 1891—on May 2nd, 1892, a letter appears referring to advertisements respecting his business; and there is another on May 5th—the entries in the case-book end on December 3rd, 1891—when I arrested him I found on him an application for an omnibus conductor's license in the name of Marshall—nine hundred and ninety-one letters have been delivered at New Inn Chambers since I arrested the prisoner—many of them were from newspaper proprietors asking for their accounts for advertisements; some letters had 10s., 10s. 6d., or 15s. in them, and one had a stamped envelope—a great number of them were from Scotland and Ireland—Binet has no connection with the Metropolitan Police—the word "Private "was on the other door—the word "Electric" was there some time ago, and the name of Godfrey appears.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Godfrey surrendered—I heard that he was a Lieutenant in the Jersey Militia—he said he knew Binet some years ago, and afterwards he met him in London, and became his clerk—I believe Mrs. Gray and Mrs. Atkinson to be the same—I do not know whether Mrs. Atkinson was a regular clerk, or whether she wrote some of the letters—I think Godfrey pointed to one of the letters, and said that it was written by Mrs. Atkinson—he said that he knew her as Gray—I never heard that she had any detective experiences—the Mayor of Jersey has sent a wire to say that he cannot be here till Monday morning—I think it is very likely that during the absence of the Mayor the prisoner acted as chief of the police in 1888 and 1889—the Mayor is chief of the police—I got these books from Mr. Kent, a solicitor, who was acting for a Mrs. Masters, who Binet was living with—he is not acting in this case—the case-book here ends July 24th, 1891—that is Binet's writing—it begins in October, 1890, and goes on to April, 1893—the case-book goes up to December 3rd, 1891—the journal begins September 20th, 1890, and the last entry is March 11th, 1893—it does not look as if the others were the rough books which were copied into this—each case is numbered—this ledger begins in October, 1890, and terminates on November 24th, 1892—not more than half-a-dozen of the 991 letters had postal orders in them; the others were asking the terms of the employment—I have made inquiries as to the prisoner's employment before and after he went into the Jersey police—after he left there he was in Mr. Moser's Detective Agency for a short time—I do not know when he left—he was a coal merchant and corn dealer some years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I only know what Mr. Moser told me about his eaving—the Mayor of Jersey is, <hi rend="italic">ex-officio</hi>, chief of police—he had no connection with the police in any other sense—one of these letters contains an application for enrolment, and there are 100 odd complaining of being defrauded out of half a guinea—the journal appears to be in the same writing from December, 1890, with the same pen and the same ink—it is done in regular form, and all in Binet's writing—this book was never given up to me; I was never able to find it—Mr. Kent did not give it up when he gave up the other books under subpoena, nor this case-book—the</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk in the conveyancing department of Messrs. Kaye and Guedalla, 21, Essex Street, Strand—I had the general conduct of the sale of some land at Surbiton; Mr. Hunt had the legal estate, and Mr. Guedalla had an interest in the matter—the prisoner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189307240050"/>
               <p>several times from 1889 to last year put that land up for sale; I can give the remuneration he received for that—I had several interviews with him prior to 27th October last, and after an arrangement between him and Mr. Guedalla the land was advertised for sale on 27th October—I told the prisoner I understood it had been arranged that he was to put up the land again for sale—he was to extensively advertise it, and if it was not sold he was to have £25 to cover all disbursements, and if it was sold he was to have 21/2 per cent, commission on the purchase-money—that was repeating to the prisoner what Mr. Guedalla had told me—this cheque of October 7th for £15 was given to the prisoner, and this is his receipt, dated October 8th, for £15 on account—just prior to 27th October we received a telegram, and the next morning we received this letter confirming the telegram. (<hi rend="italic">This letter stated that he had disposed of the Surbiton land for</hi> £1,650 <hi rend="italic">to Mr. Pocklington, and was signed, "M. Tattersall and Co.</hi>")—this is Mr. Pocklington's signature to the conditions of sale, and this is a document signed by the prisoner acknowledging the receipt of £165 by him as agent for the vendor—afterwards Mr. Pocklington took legal proceedings to set aside the contract—on 15th May, 1893, I took these two documents, or copies, and presented them to the prisoner—one is an authority signed by Mr. Hunt, addressed to the prisoner, and dated 8th March, 1893, authorising the prisoner to pay to Messrs. Kaye and Guedalla the £165 received by him on the alleged contract of October 26th, for the Surbiton land; and the other is practically in the same terms, signed by Mr. Pocklington, who states he has no claim to the £165—I told the prisoner I now had to ask him to hand over to us the deposit of £165, in accordance with those authorities—he said, "But there are my charges"—I told him it was in consequence of his negligence that the contract was not a valid one, and in my opinion he was not entitled to any charges whatever; and I told him that from inquiries I had made I had reason to believe that he had not got the deposit money intact—he admitted that he had not, and he asked me if he brought £20 or £30, would Mr. Guedalla take that?—I believe he said he had had some trouble, his wife had been ill—I said, "No," he had better bring up the whole £165, and then, if his allegations were true that he had some charges, Mr. Guedalla would no doubt consider them—he did not bring or send the £165—after the interview a letter was written to him on 11th May embodying very much what I have said—the letter was addressed to 149, Hammersmith Road, where I had seen him—he had changed his office to there from Twickenham, I believe—I did not see him after that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The arrangement the prisoner made was with Mr. Guedalla personally—Mr. Guedalla has been in the doctor's hands for the last eighteen months, and I think his state of health would not permit him to come here; I have had conduct of the case all through—the £25, if the prisoner did not sell, was not for his trouble merely, and he was not to receive beyond that, whatever he had expended; he was to pay for advertising out of the £25—the £15 he received was on account generally of the £25; he put it in his letter as received on account of advertisements—we wrote to him about a key plan; that would be expensive if prepared, but, as a matter of fact, I gave the prisoner an old plan with particulars and conditions of sale of this property that had been prepared previously, and this plan is a copy of that—it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189307240051"/>
               <p>would be some expense to make a new plan; it was to come out of the £25—Mr. Guedalla told me we were to put £1,650 as the reserve price, but that any offers the prisoner got he was to submit to us—he arranged the sale with Pocklington no doubt—we gave him authority to sell by auction—he wrote and said he had sold it by private contract, because he thought there would be no bid next day if he set it up by auction—my experience is that the commission of an estate agent, who sells by private contract, is not 5 per cent.—I should say 21/2 per cent, was a very fair figure—he arranged 21/2 per cent, at previous sales, and writes it as being the usual commission—Pocklington afterwards objected to complete the sale, first on the ground that there was a misrepresentation, and so far as that was concerned, we insisted up to the time of the action being brought that he ought to complete—when he wrote a second letter, we thought he was not bound to do so—he brought an action against Hunt and Tattersall, and wrote for the return of the £165, the amount paid as deposit—before they went under Order 14 my idea is that the prisoner put in a defence so that he might not make an affidavit—Pocklington applied for judgment under Order 14, but the prisoner put in a defence before-hand—we, for Hunt, took out a summons that the prisoner should bring £165 into Court—the Master would not make the order—subsequently Pocklington gave notice of discontinuing his action—when we asked the prisoner for the £165, he said he had charges against us in respect of it—our view was we would not discuss that matter till he had paid us the £165—the answer to that was this letter from Mr. Sismey. (<hi rend="italic">This took exception to the tone of Kay and Guedalla's letter, and stated that the prisoner having earned his commission did not feel inclined to hand over the deposit till he had been satisfied</hi>)—afterwards we went to the Police-court and made a criminal charge against him.</p>

               <p>Pocklington's cheque—the prisoner then took out a fresh blank cheque book—the account was closed on 30th March, 1893—beyond this £165 nothing had been paid in beyond two or three small items of £1 and £5—on 30th March, 1893, his balance was 2s. 6d., and then the bank closed the account, for reasons which I can give.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, of 39, Raynor Terrace, Leyton—in the first week in February the prisoner came to my shop as a traveller and I bought some things of him; and on March 17th he proposed marriage to me, saying that he was a bachelor—I believed him—I showed him some coins, and told him I was very hard up for money—he said if I would let him take them to London he would find a customer for them—I valued them at ten shillings—I let him take them away—I also gave him a tobacco-jar, value 5s. 6d., to sell for me, and have not,</p>

               <p>seen it again, or had the money for it or the coins—I lent him four shillings, because he said he had to go to London in a hurry, and he would give it me back next day—I gave him a cigar-case and a Malacca cane because I was engaged to him, and I lent him fourpence to go to London, because he said he had lost his portmanteau with £72 in it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not quite believe about the £72—at the time I gave him the fourpence I did not believe he was going to marry me—there were about sixty copper coins and two silver ones, a halfpenny, farthing, and a brass token of George I.—there were some very old copper coins of different reigns, and a Victoria live-shilling piece.</p>
