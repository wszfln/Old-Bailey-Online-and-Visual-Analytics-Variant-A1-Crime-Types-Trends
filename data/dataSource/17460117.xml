               <p>Drummond. As I was going home to my Family I met three Women; I pass'd two of them, and this Woman, the Prisoner, stuck by me; I found her Hand in my Pocket.</p>

               <p>Drummond. Fifteen Shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was she?</p>
               <p>Burt. She came from her own Apartment, and said, for God's Sake let me lay with your Daughter; for he, the Prisoner, would murder her.</p>
               <p>Q. But what do you know of this Murder?</p>
               <p>Burt. On Monday the 16th of December the Prisoner came home between Nine and Ten o'Clock at Night, and made a great Disturbance. I desir'd him to go up Stairs and take his Tools away, and I would forgive him what he ow'd me. When my Wife and the Deceas'd came up the Stairs to him, he endeavour'd to strike them; but, by pulling off his Coat, he put out the Candle.</p>
               <p>Q. What Business is this Webb of?</p>
               <p>Burt. A Shoemaker. Then my Wife and the Deceas'd went down Stairs and left him by himself alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Dock, the Deceas'd, go down with you and your Wife?</p>
               <p>Burt. Yes, we all went down to be quiet.</p>
               <p>Q. What happen'd after that?</p>
               <p>Burt. When we came down, in about half an Hour he made such a Noise as disturb'd the Lodgers.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do, upon his making that Noise?</p>

I was in the one Pair of Stairs Room; the Prisoner lodg'd up three Pair of Stairs. While I was talking with an Officer, that came to my House, I heard the Cry, Murder, Murder. I saw the Deceas'd lie near the Window of my Room, with his Guts hanging out.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you heard the Cry, Murder, after you was got down the Stairs?</p>
               <p>Burt. About two or three Minutes.</p>

               <p>Burt. A little above a Quarter of an Hour.</p>

            . On Monday Night the 16th of December, Mrs. Bart cry'd out, for God's Sake come, there is a Man murder'd. When I came, I found that the Wound was below the Navel, the Guts and Caul hanging out at it: I was in Hopes that the Wound was not mortal; because the Guts seem'd not to be broke: I found by the great Effusion of Blood, there was some other Part wounded within: The Mortification encreas'd every Minute: I gave Information of the Affair to Sir Thomas: At the Coroner's Request I open'd the Body of the Deceas'd, and found the Guts cut thro' and thro', so that the Wound must have reach'd quite to the Back-Bone.</p>

            (to Mr. Dennis.) Do you think this was the only Cause of Dock's Death?</p>
               <p>Dennis. I am convinced of it, and being persuaded that the Wound would prove mortal, I gave the Deceas'd very little Hopes: I had done what Art could do for him: Upon asking the Deceas'd how it happen'd; he said he went up Stairs at the Desire of the People of the House; upon which the Prisoner immediately fell upon him: That the Deceas'd did return the Blow, or struggle with him, or something to that Purpose, and that afterwards the Prisoner took up the Knife and gave him the Wound.</p>

I went into the Magpye Alehouse, just by, and calling for a Pint of Ale and Gin, I filled my Pipe and smoked, and pulled my Snuff-Box out of my Pocket. Said I to my Landlady, I believe you are a Welsh-woman. This Woman, (the Prisoner) sat by me, I gave her my Box to take a Pinch of Snuff, she return'd it, and I put it up in my Breeches Pocket; when I had paid my Reckoning I went out to the Door, and the Prisoner at the Bar came to me and took me by the Arm, and walked with me over Clerkenwell-Green towards St. John's Wall. I put my Left Hand about her Neck, and gave her a Kiss; while my Left Hand was round her Neck, her Right Hand was in my Pocket; I presently missed my Box, but away she ran, and I said give me my Box. She d - n'd me and said, touch<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174601170006"/> me if you dare; which I was afraid to do, as she might have some Accomplices. I said, I will never leave you till I bring you to Justice. When I got her into St. John's-Street, there I was inform'd of an Officer. It wanted but a Quarter of an Hour of Nine o'Clock before I could get it settled. After she had been charged about an Hour, she walked out under a Pretence to find my Box; she sent a Watchman to fetch her Landlady; who answer'd, what is the Matter? I'll be hang'd if she has not picked the Gentleman's Pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. So, you lost your Box?</p>
               <p>Rutter. Yes, she did her Work very quick.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not find her Hand in your Pocket?</p>
               <p>Rutter. I felt her Hand, and then follow'd her, and said, I would not leave her till I had my Box again.</p>

I found out her Mistress's House, and knocking at the Door, the Prisoner came out; I challeng'd her with the Box; she said, she knew nothing of it. I asked her Mistress; she said, she hoped she had not been guilty of such a Thing; upon searching, we found the Box broke<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174601170007"/> open in the Cellar, with the Things in it as they are now.</p>

I asked them no Questions how they came by this Harness. Eyres (the Prisoner) had a Pair of Harness belonging to the King upon the Horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when you saw Eyres?</p>
               <p>Roberts. I saw him come out of Paulin-Yard, where he put his Harness at Night.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any Thing more?</p>
               <p>Roberts. Says Eyres, you cannot take off the Harness of the Horse, as you did out of the Brewhouse Yesterday. So, says I, is not your Horse blind? So I went and told my Master, for I was afraid of my Life: But as I was going down, I saw the very same Horse with this Harness.</p>

I went to look and I miss'd two Rings: He own'd before the Serjeant that he had sold one of them in King's-Street, Westminster, to one Mr. Williams. The Serjeant went along with him there and found that Ring.</p>

               <p>Hunt. The 2d of this Month, between the Hours of five and six, I was going cross my Yard, and I saw the Prisoner at the Bar (the Woman, not the Boy) and being very much surpriz'd, I asked her what Business she had there. She told me that having came out of Kent she came into the Yard to sleep. I told her, I had been robb'd before, and she should not go out of the Yard till I had search'd her. Then she wanted to come by me, and as soon as she did so, the Goods were under her.</p>
               <p>Q. You know nothing then of Galder (the Boy?)</p>
               <p>Hunt. No. I was the Evening the Robbery was committed, drinking a Dish of Tea with Mrs. Hughes, and I asked the Prisoner what she did there, and said, that she had committed a Robbery, and that we would have her before the Justice; she said, she came from Kent, and that a Boy, that had got in at the Window, and thrown the Goods into the Yard, was then in the Fields to receive them, when she got out.</p>

And going along Leicester-Fields we met the Boy, Roger. The Girl (the Prisoner) saw the Entry-Door open of this Gentlewoman's House, the Stocking-Shop: And the Girl and Boy went into the Yard, and so they got up the Ladder; I follow'd them to the Door to see which Way they went.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see them when they were in the Yard?</p>
               <p>Gough. They got up the Ladder, and got over some Leads.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see them?</p>
               <p>Gough. No. But I heard the Girl say so. She said she got into the Gentlewoman's Window. And so the Boy had got something up in a Bundle.</p>

               <p>Gough. I was the outside of the Yard.</p>

I thought she might take it away from her Lodging. I reckon'd upon her coming in the Morning as usual. There were three Boxes of my Grand Mother's, which she had left in my Care, when my Mother died. When I got up in the Morning, and came to go down Stairs, one of these Boxes was like to fall down: They were up two Pair of Stairs, between two Rooms. One of the Boxes I found uncorded and open'd; then I mistrusted this

             had robb'd me. I went to her Lodgings after her, early next Morning, but she had discharged her Lodgings and had not been home all Night. About the 3d of January I found her in Bunnel-Row. So I asked her how the Pillow came upon my Bed, and why she did not come as usual. My Dear Mistress, she answer'd, I knew I had wrong'd you and I was asham'd to see you. I told her of the Boxes: Indeed, my dear Mistress, says she, I was in Liquor and I uncorded them; but I will tell you what I have done with the Things, And she said, she would go with me to the Pawn-broker and fetch them out, if I would not let the Pawn-broker give her Trouble. So I went the next Morning to one Mr. Kiese's, Pawn-broker in Cheek-Lane. I went with her to another Pawnbroker, and she called for two Parcels more, at one Sharp's on Saffron-Hill. Then she said, she had given me all. I told her I could not release her 'till I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174601170014"/> had seen whether these were all the Things. Then I sent for my Mother; when she came there was nor half the Things. Then I went with her to the Alderman, and she sent to Kiese's for a Holland Apron, the same Pawn-broker she was at before. Then says she, my dear Mistress, I can tell you of more, but you cannot have them, for I have sold them out-right to a Pawn-broker in the Strand. She often used to say to me, she question'd not, but there were a great many good Things in these Boxes.</p>

               <p>Q. As to the other Goods, a Long-Lawn Apron, two pair of Women's Pumps, one pair of Silver Buttons, did you find these?</p>
               <p>Cromarty. No. I said to her, how can you serve me so? She told me she desir'd to be banish'd, she was weary of living here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord. These People are very notorious, they keep a notorious Bawdy-House. Neither did I ever wrong them of any Thing. Mistress, did you not tell me, that you took two Creatures into your House that run away with your Goods. My Lord, I serv'd my Mistress two Years ago and I went to her again: She was making Complaint that she had lost several Things, and she said her Husband had got a Writ against me. My Lord I don't chuse to be arrested in a wrong Cause. My Mistress said to me, my Dear, pray don't get yourself into a Jail.</p>

               <p>Freeman. I live in Dudley-Court. I took the Room of one Ruth Burne. I lost there a Flock Bed, a Feather Bolster, a pair of Sheets, two Quilts, and a pair of Blankets.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you furnish the Room yourself? How long have you been in this Room?</p>
               <p>Freeman. I took it six Weeks before Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave your Lodgings; how came it that your Bed was gone.</p>
               <p>Freeman. I was oblig'd to go out to daily Labour, as Washing and Ironing, and whilst I was out, my Bed was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go out in the Morning?</p>
               <p>Freeman. Yes. About Six o'Clock and return'd about Seven in the Evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any Thing else gone?</p>
               <p>Freeman. I did not miss any Things besides what has been mention'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the Prisoner at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Freeman. Yes. I saw him three Days before he took my Bed and Bedding away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know what Relation he was to your Landlady?</p>
               <p>Freeman. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came home at Night, was you not much surpriz'd to find your Bed gone; did you not ask your Landlady about it?</p>
               <p>Freeman. Yes. And she told me he (the Prisoner) took it away.</p>
               <p>Q. And pray did not she tell you the Reason why he took it away?</p>
               <p>Freeman. She said he had been stripping and robbing of her likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this Burne and your Landlady appear to be Man and Wife?</p>
               <p>Freeman. No. For they were always jarring together.</p>

               <p>Underwood. I lost it on Thursday the 16th Instant about Four o'Clock in the Afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this Watch?</p>
               <p>Underwood. It hung upon a Nail in the Chimney-Corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>

               <p>Underwood. I never saw him in my Life before he came to my House along with one Singleton.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they come for?</p>
               <p>Underwood. I was particularly acquainted with Singleton, who was going down with this Man to Blackwall.</p>
               <p>Q. Singleton then you knew, and he brought this Prisoner with him?</p>
               <p>Underwood. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me what you know further of the Matter?</p>
               <p>Underwood. Having Occasion to go up Stairs, I left the Prisoner and Singleton in the lower Room. There was a Screen that parted the Fire-Place and the Window. Upon my coming down again, this

             was talking with me about his Business at Blackwall, and in the mean while this other Fellow (the Prisoner) went out. I said to Singleton, why your Friend is gone, he never took his Leave of me? As we both sat down by the Fire, I clapp'd my Eyes to the corner Place, and missing the Watch, I said, you have play'd the Rogue with my Watch; I said, I can take my Oath I had it when you came into the House. I sent for my Husband and Brother to pursue after the Prisoner, and they found the Watch upon him.</p>

               <p>Morris. I was trucking of Sugars at the Keys: There were several at Work with me at Bear-Key, and one of them a Soldier; and this Man (the Prisoner) came to see the Soldier, and fetch'd a Quartern of Gin: It was almost dark when he came the second Time: My Partner saw him go into the Warehouse where the Sugar was, but he (the Prisoner) did not perceive it. My Partner said, have an Eye to the Place, there is a Man gone into the Building. As I was going down towards it, when I was come opposite to the Door, the Prisoner came out of the Warehouse; upon that I stopp'd him. I told him, I believ'd he had something there he should not have. I catch'd hold of him, and he had about 14 lb. of Sugar, the same as in the Warehouse. Some of it was thrown down, and about a Pound I found in his Pocket, of the same Sort.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you carry him before a Justice?</p>
               <p>Morris. Before an Alderman.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you satisfy'd there was no Sugar in the Cloth in the Warehouse?</p>
               <p>Morris. None.</p>
               <p>James - . My Lord, on the 15th of January, between four and five, the Prisoner came upon the Keys and he fetch'd a Quartern of Gin, to drink with his Acquaintance that was at work there. He return'd with the Pot and Glass out of the Yard; I believe he was gone four or five Minutes; I saw a Person go into the Warehouse, and I met the Prisoner coming out, and found 14 lb. of Sugar upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the Sugar upon him?</p>
               <p>James - . It was in his Pockets, but he went up to the Warehouse and emptied his Pockets, but he still had a Pound in his Pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure there was no loose Sugar? Were these Sugars the same, as what you were packing up? Do you apprehend there was so much taken out of the Hogshead as that?</p>

               <p>The Prisoner gave an Account how he came to go into the Warehouse; and being asked how he came to go in twice, he answer'd, it was for the same Purpose.

               <p>Smith. About five Weeks ago. I ask'd her what she would take for two Pair. She ask'd me 8 d. I gave her 7 d. I ask'd her whether she came honestly by them. She said, she did. She ask'd me if she should call again the latter End of the Week. I said she might. I never saw her 'till Thursday last; she came again, and ask'd me, do you want any more Leather. I answer'd I could not tell, it was so cold; but I carry'd one of these Soles to a Leather-Cutter's; and he told me, he was sure it was stolen; and desir'd me, when she came again, I would stop her: Accordingly, she came; but I said, go into the publick House and I will come to you. She went in and I bought a Pair of her mark'd 7 d. for a Groat: When I carry'd them to the Leather-Cutter, he bid me pay for them and he would come immediately: And when he came, he look'd upon the two Pair she had in her Hand, and ask'd her what she would have for them; 1 s. She ask'd, and he bid her 8d. With that, he just touch'd her by the Hand and said, How come you by these Goods: He insisted to know where she bought them : She said, she bought them of Mr. Jarvis's Maid on Snow-Hill.</p>

               <p>May. On Thursday last I gave him a Caution several Times. I saw him take a Handful more out of a single Hand of Tobacco; and then I run by and laid hold of him, but he would not give it me: And I said, if he did not, I would cary him to the Landwaiter. The Landwaiter laid hold of him, and pull'd about 2 lb. of Tobacco out of his Pockets.</p>

               <p>Q. How long after did you find them at Stephen's ?</p>
               <p>Skelton. On Christmas Day in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mr. Stephens?</p>
               <p>Skelton. He buys Rags.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they were the same you lost?</p>
               <p>Skelton. Please you my Lord as near as I can guess they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon finding them there what did you say to Mr. Stephens?</p>
               <p>Skelton. I let him know I believ'd they were mine. But Mr. Stephens said, you need not look over them, for I have bought them. Wherefore the Prisoners were taken up on this Occasion.

               <p>Stephens. The Prisoner, Bullock, and another Woman brought the Rags to me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did they bring them?</p>
               <p>Stephens. On a Monday Morning, between Eight and Nine o'Clock. By Report it was the same Day the Robbery was committed, about a Month ago.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say, when they came?</p>

               <p>Stephens. The Woman said, she had got some Rags; I said, where do you use to sell them? and they said they sold them where they could have ready Money. They were half a Hundred and 12 lb. neat Weight. While I was gone up Stairs the Woman the Prisoner went out, as she said, to speak to her Master, to know whether he would take the Money.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say?</p>
               <p>Stephens. They took the Money and went away, and I thought no more of it. But on Christmas Day Mr. Skelton came to my House with a Search-Warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that was the Woman?</p>
               <p>Stephens. I am sure it was, there being only that Woman and one more.</p>

At Six o'Clock I set out from my own Room and went down into the Coal-Yard, to my Mother's Room, and I desir'd my Wife and my own Sister to go with the Rags: My Wife took the Rags in my Apron herself: I put the Bag full upon Mayson's Head and the Remainder in my Apron my Wife took.</p>

I gave the Word, they should bring me so and so: With that they brought me 12 s. and 6 d. And as my poor Mother was in Want I gave her the odd 6 d.</p>

               <p>Q. In what Manner was it broke open?</p>
               <p>Wilson. There was a Quarel of Glass taken out of the Casement of the Window of my lower Room.</p>

             the 19th of December, the Day after the Fast, lent me a broken-pointed Pen-knife. I got upon this Gentleman's Bulk, the Prosecutor, at the Black-Horse; with that I took the Knife and open'd the Lead, and took out a Pain of Glass; and then I put in my Hand and open'd the Casement: I took out a Pewter Plate, a Pewter Dish and a Drinking Glass, a China Cup and Saucer, and a half Pint-Pot, a Pewter Pot and Earthen Dish :] The Pewter Plate and Pewter Dish I took myself, and Joel held the Candle, while I open'd the Window and took the Pewter Plate and Pewter Dish out: Then Joel got up himself and took out the Glass and China Cup and Saucer, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Mayson, did he do any Thing?</p>
               <p>Bullock. Mayson receiv'd some of these Things. The Man facing the Black Horse saw us, and follow'd us: Then I call'd Joel, and he laid with me 'till next Morning. Mayson said, he was going to the other Side of the Water to his Sister; and that she had sold the Things for half a Crown.</p>
               <p>Tellinson Torvey. The Fast Day at Night we went over the Water and we stay'd playing at Cards 'till between One and Two in the Morning. I live opposite to Mr. Wilson's, by the May-Pole: Before we could put the Fire out, I heard one call thro' the Window to light a Candle; I said my Mistress and I had been out late. It was Bullock that spoke, I could swear to him among a Thousand. I seeing a Light at my Neighbours Door, look'd out and said, the Black-Horse is broke open. They would not stir 'till I open'd the Door; then they all run away, and Joel was upon the Bulk handing down the Dish. Mayson confess'd the Fact before me in Mr. Wilson's House. Joel did not speak in my hearing. <rs id="t17460117-31-verdict126" type="verdictDescription">

            .) Pray what have you seen the Prisoner at the Bar do at any Time?</p>
               <p>Addison. I have seen him act with Crucifixes. It was done in Ratcliff-Highway in a Room of his own House in Penitent-Street. I have never seen him act any Thing abroad any where. I have seen a Parcel of People come in of a Sunday Morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? What was you formerly?</p>
               <p>Addison. I was a Protestant from my Cradle.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you fix the Time when you saw this.</p>
               <p>Addison. It was about two Years ago, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Now tell me what you have seen him do, when these People came to his House?</p>
               <p>Addison. There has been a Bason of Water, and as they came in, they dipp'd their Hands in this Water, and after that I have seen them kneel down, and they have taken Beads out of their Pockets, and there was a Parcel of Images, and they seem'd to me to be made of Wax. Their Beads hung upon their Arms.</p>
               <p>Q. What then?</p>
               <p>Addison. I have seen them reckon their Beads.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the Images placed?</p>
               <p>Addison. Upon a pretty long Table he had.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there of those Images.</p>
               <p>Addison. I believe there were about seven, and I believe they were made of Wax.</p>
               <p>Q. When this Preparation was made, what did you observe of this Prisoner at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Addison. I have seen him walk backwards and forwards with a Crucifix in his Hand. He read in an unknown Tongue, that I could not understand a Word that he spoke. It seem'd to me as if it was all Latin.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he hold the Crucifix in his Hand?</p>
               <p>Addison. In his Hand, please you my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't understand Latin yourself?</p>
               <p>Addison. No, my Lord. Then they all kneel'd down and went to Prayer.</p>
               <p>Q. In what Language did he read Prayers.</p>
               <p>Addison. In an unknown Tongue.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he kneel down as well as the People?</p>
               <p>Addison. Yes. My Lord. From the Posture they were in, I judg'd it was Prayer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he hold the Crucifix in his Hand when he read Prayers ?</p>
               <p>Addison. He held it down, please you my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any other Persons to hold a Crucifix in their Hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174601170028"/>Addison. No. Only that Man, the Prisoner, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray did you know any of this Congregation?</p>
               <p>Addison. Yes. There were three that lodg'd in the same House; a Man and his Wife and a single Woman.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know how you knew these People?</p>
               <p>Addison. I lodg'd in the House, please you my Lord. He wanted to turn my Wife and I to his Way of Thinking, from a Protestant to a Roman; And told me that was the best Way to save my Soul and go to Heaven. And told me, that if I continu'd in the Protestant Way, I should be d - n'd to Eternity: But if I would be of his Opinion I should have the Holy Ghost come down upon me, and I should be as wide awak'd as could be, and that the Holy Ghost should breathe three Times in my Mouth, and rest for the Space of a Minute or two, and then the same again; and I should be in a great Agony of Pain, my Lord: And the Prisoner said, he acted in Lincoln's-Inn-Chapel, when the Priests have been taken ill, and at Spitalfields, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he say this to you?</p>
               <p>Addison. At the same Time, please you my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any Thing farther?</p>
               <p>Addison. He told me, he acted at several Places in the Country; while he went in the Way of buying of Hair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he acquaint you what he was doing when he was in his Room?</p>
               <p>Addison. He told me, he was brought up a Romish Priest ever since he was 10 Years of Age.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any Thing more?</p>
               <p>Addison. There was a Male Child brought in to be christen'd.</p>
               <p>Q. What, the same Day?</p>
               <p>Addison. No. Of another Day, please you my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that?</p>
               <p>Addison. I take it to be Sunday following, to the best of my Memory.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the Male Child was brought in to be christen'd, what did he do?</p>
               <p>Addison. He took the Child into his Arms naked, and there was a little Gallypot that stood upon the Table, and he cross'd the Child several Times, and said some Expressions in an unknown Tongue.</p>
               <p>Q. What was there in the Gallypot.</p>
               <p>Addison. Whether it was Water or Oil I cannot sell.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did it stand?</p>
               <p>Addison. The Gallypot stood upon the Table.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any Sponsors there, or any Thing of that Kind?</p>
               <p>Addison. No, my Lord. Then they kneel'd down and went to Prayer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe no Godfathers, nor nothing of that?</p>
               <p>Addison. No, my Lord. But they continu'd in their Way of Praying, about 13 or 14 Minutes, to the best of my Knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray did you give him any Reason to imagine that he would convert you?</p>
               <p>Addison. Yes, an't please you my Lord. I told him I would consider of it. No further Satisf action I ever gave him. But as I was brought up a Protestant, I design'd to die in it. When he got up from Prayer, he said a few Words in an unknown Tongue. And the Women that were there, curtsy'd to him, and one of the Men on going away gave him a Crown or half a Crown, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any Thing farther?</p>

            (to Addison) You was present at this Christning, and present there before the People begun. How many were there?</p>
               <p>Addison. Thirteen or fourteen.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Child brought in naked?</p>
               <p>Addison. Brought in in Flannel; And was given to him naked. He held it upon his Right Arm and put his Finger in the little Gallypot.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any of the Persons that were present there?</p>
               <p>Addison. No.</p>
               <p>Q. So you don't know whether they were Romans or not?</p>
               <p>Addison. That I cannot say or swear.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other Witnesses?</p>
               <p>Addison. My Wife, the Witness, is dead and buried.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was bred an Irishman; served my Time at Newcastle upon Tyne. After I came up to London, I follow'd my Business, and kept four or five Journeymen; but met with many Losses. When I took in the Prosecutor, I took him in upon Charity : His Wife was an aged Woman. He pretended to go into Business as a Painter, and I never receiv'd but 18 d. of him. When he went away, I took Pity on him, and I gave him a little Gin. At the other Lodgings they went to, I heard his Wife died for Want Please you, my Lord, I got<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174601170029"/> a Lodger of mine to help him to carry a Linnen Bundle of Rags and Things they had to carry, and I said, Mr. Addison I hope you will make me Amends when it is in your Power. Upon this, I went once or twice to the other Lodgings. He had not got into Business, and there was no Relief from me. My Lord, the Time he absconded from the other Lodgings, he took something more than he should have done, but I cannot testify it: His Landlord is here, he can: But one Time I met him in Rag-Fair, I said, Mr. Addison, I hear you have got into Business, and he and went away from me. I never saw him since, which is near a Year and a half ago; but last Friday was a Month he came down to my House, and went to a Friend of mine; he told my Friend he was come to pay me my Money, which was 3l. 10s. Upon this, my Friend sent his Boy with him to my House; he told my Wife a fine Story, that he had married a Wife, and that he had got 300l. with her, and he would make me a Recompence to the last Halfpenny: My Wife desired him to stay longer; but he desired I might come up to him to the Sign of the Boat; so I sent my Wife to this House, and they sent to the Place where he order'd them, and he came to my Wife, and she call'd for a Pint of Beer, and she would have him drink. She said, I have brought you a Receipt; says he, I never pay Money to a Wife. So when he came himself, he told me he would go and fetch my Money; I went out of Doors to make Water; he brought three Men and seiz'd me, and would not let my Wife nor any Person know where they were going; and they carried me before Justice Burdus. Says the Justice, he has sworn so hard against you, that I must commit you. I will commit you to New-Prison, that is the easiest Place I can commit you to.</p>

            (to Clement North) How long have you known the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>North. About 10 Years.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a Protestant or a Papist?</p>
               <p>North. A Protestant.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been pretty conversant with his Family?</p>
               <p>North. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him officiate as a Romish Priest? Ever see any Crucifixes or Images? Did he ever make an Attempt to convert you to the Roman Catholick Faith?</p>
               <p>North. I never heard him speak of any Thing of Religion in my Life.</p>
               <p>After his Lordship had summ'd up the particular Evidences, he concluded thus; Gentlemen, you are to consider whether the Prisoner at the Bar be guilty of this Fact or not: The Punishment is a very severe one, 'tis perpetual Imprisonment without Bail or Mainprise. Before you convict the Prisoner of this, you ought to have full Evidence, and consider how this Fact appears. Addison, the Prosecutor, had known of these Things for a considerable Time: Makes no Discovery of it, 'till the Proclamation is publish'd, of 100l. Reward, which is dated the 6th of November, 1745, at St. James's. In the next Place, Gentlemen, you'll observe, the Man by his Appearance, does not seem to be a Man of Learning at all: It appears he has got his Livelihood, and a very mean one too, by dealing in Hair. A Number of Protestants have had Dealings with him. Some of them have lodg'd in his House: They swear, they never saw any Appearance of his performing Mass or having any Images, nor of making any Attempts to convert them: And Persons of that Character are very apt to make Converts. Tho' 'tis true, where they endeavour to make Converts they ought to be punish'd; yet, Gentlemen, before they are punish'd, there must Satisfaction be given to the Country, that they are guilty. In the present Case, it does appear, there is a Demand the Prisoner has on the Prosecutor: It is a considerable Circumstance in this Cafe, whether the Reward of 100l. is not to pay this poor Man the Prisoner, as appears by the Prosecutor's needy Circumstances. <rs id="t17460117-40-verdict159" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. Was that near you?</p>
               <p>Eastland. Yes, my Lord. And the Child stood between him and me. The Child was about 13 Years of Age.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was it from you? And how far from the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Eastland. About half a Rod. The Prisoner turn'd round all of a sudden, and pointed his Gun, as I thought, to shoot at me. But whether or no, I cannot say. He went to discharge his Gun and it would not go off.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he try'd to let it go off?</p>
               <p>Eastland. He levell'd it, and it would not go off. He pull'd Powder out of his Pocket and discharg'd the Gun immediately. I clapp'd up at the End of the Tavern, the Child was nearest, about half a Rod, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Child and you in the same Position?</p>
               <p>Eastland. I was in the Street, and the Child on the Cellar-Steps. The Cellar-Steps come into the Street. He discharg'd his Gun and the Child fell off the Steps direct ly. I saw him level his Piece, pointing it, as I thought, towards me.</p>
               <p>Q. So you thought the Gun was pointed at you?</p>
               <p>Eastland. He discharg'd the Gun and hit the Child, and the Deceas'd fell down the Cellar-Steps.</p>
               <p>Q. What follow'd after this?</p>
               <p>Eastland. I heard a great Outcry in the Cellar, and there were several there, and a great deal of Blood issued out of the Child's Breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he die directly?</p>
               <p>Eastland. No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the Prisoner do after he had done the Mischief?</p>
               <p>Eastland. He put the Gun upon his Shoulder, and went up the Street as fast as he could.</p>

               <p>Interpreter. No. But it went off immediately as he saw him. He was firing into the Cellar.</p>

               <p>Interpreter. Not quite so far as the Door of the Court. After the Gun was fired, he went to the Cellar and heard the Outcries.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the Soldier?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. After One o'Clock they brought the Soldier to the Publick House. And the People that brought him advised him, the Prisoner, to tell the Justice that the Affair happen'd by Accident.</p>

               <p>Carter. Yes, he lodg'd in my Mother's House. He laid his Hand upon my Head, and said, he loved me, but hated my Brother, that he was a sulky old Dog, and he would shoot him directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was a sulky old Dog?</p>
               <p>Carter. My Brother. They us'd to call him the old Man. Then he put his Hand in his Pouch and took a Cartridge of Powder out and prim'd his Piece and fir'd it directly.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was you from your Mother's House?</p>
               <p>Carter. My Mother lives the next door to the Cellar.</p>

               <p>Carter. After he had done, he levell'd it at my Brother and then put it upon his Shoulder and went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say nothing to him, when he talk'd so about your Brother?</p>

               <p>Q. And what happen'd after this ?</p>
               <p>Carter. Then, my Lord, I run to the Cellar and my Brother was full of Blood, and I dragg'd him to the middle of the Cellar.</p>

               <p>Q. What became of your Brother?</p>
               <p>Carter. He was carry'd to the Infirmary. And beliv'd 10 Days.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had this Soldier lodg'd at your Mother's?</p>
               <p>Carter. He lodg'd about a twelve Month, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not surpris'd to hear him talk thus about your Brother?</p>
               <p>Carter. No, my Lord. I thought he had been about to flash his Gun, I did not think he was about to shoot.</p>
               <p>Council. While he lodg'd at your House, was he not frequently familiar with your Brother, playing with him. Do you remember at any Time, he made him a Present of a little Ivory-headed walking Stick.</p>
               <p>Carter. He gave it between us both, said, we were to toss up for it.</p>
               <p>Council. Pray did you not that Day beg some Powder yourself.</p>
               <p>Carter. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask the Boy, whether he did not ask me for a Cartridge of Powder as I was going in at the Door the same Day. The Question was put to the Boy, but he deny'd it.</p>
               <p>Susanah Hatton. My Lord, the Child stood up on my Cellar-Stairs. I had his little Sister in my Lap below. He, the Deceas'd, came down for his Sister, to come up to Dinner, and the Child would not come up with him, but the Deceas'd said, Day Day, upon the Stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any Body in the Street see the Child? Did you see the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Hatton. No. I never saw him. When the Gun went off, the Child was frighten'd, and said, Dixon had done it; I fell into, that is all I know of it.</p>

               <p>Jeffery. I was going the 30th of December over London-Bridge; opposite to the new Building upon the Bridge, I was forced to put up in a Door Way, to get out of the Way of the Coaches: I had no sooner got up in the Door-way, but a couple of Fellows rush'd, the one behind and the other to one Side of me; I striv'd to get into the House, the Prisoner kept me from going back, and the other from going forward. They took an Opportunity, one of them, to pick my Pocket of 20 l. When the Coach was gone they went off. I had the Presence of Mind to clap my Hand to my Pocket, and I found my Money was gone. I cried out Stop Thief. In running I fell down, but got up again. This Williamson, the Prisoner, makes into a Pinmaker's Shop at some Distance; as soon as I cry'd out Stop Thief, I saw a couple run; and one, that is the Prisoner, went into the Pinmaker's Shop. He endeavour'd there to pull his Coat off, I suppose to disguise him-self: He ask'd to buy some Pins. Asking to buy some Pins, the little Boy calls to the young Man: But he did not want any: But the young Man seiz'd him: And when I came up, I said, you Rogue, you have robb'd me, where is my Money? Says he, I have not robb'd you, but you have, says I: Look down there says he, there is your Money. One of my Witnesses pick'd it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your Money, in a Bag or Purse?</p>
               <p>Jeffery. It was in this Bag. The Bag was produced in Court.</p>
               <p>Q. And the Money that lay at his Feet in the Bag, was the Money you lost out of your Pocket?</p>
               <p>Jeffery. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any Thing more?</p>
               <p>Jeffery. We carry'd him into the Haberdasher's House, and we charg'd a Constable with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any Talk with him afterwards about it.</p>
               <p>Jeffery. He sent People to get me to be favourable to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it taken by Slight or by Force?</p>
               <p>Jeffery. By Slight.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see me about your Pocket?</p>

            . Please you, my Lord, I live with Mess. Hood and Dale on London-Bridge. On the 30th of December, about Five in the Afternoon, all of a Sudden, I heard a Noise of Stop Thief; upon hearing which I run out of our Warehouse: I catch'd the Prisoner at the Bar by the Collar, and turn'd him on one Side of the Door Post; I held him a few Minutes before the Gentleman that lost his Money came up. You Rogue, says he, you have robb'd me of 20 l. I look'd very sharp at him, but had not the Wit to search him. The Prisoner said he had not got the Money; but before these Words were out of his Mouth I catch'd the Bag between the Spar of the Post and my Foot; upon which I directly call'd to Mr. Jefferies, and said, here is your Money, and gave it into both his Hands and bid him hold it fast. I held the Prisoner still fast by the Collar; and Mess. Hood and Dale were both at Home, and I call'd my Master out of the Compting-House into the Shop. My Master came up; I bid Mr. Jeffery take the Money, and they told it over and it was exactly 20 l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner (to Payne.) Did you see me drop the Purse?</p>
               <p>Payne. Before the Words you express'd to Mr. Jeffery, There is your Money, were out of your Mouth, I catch'd it between the Spar of the Post and my Foot.</p>

            . Please you, my Lord, I was at Newgate-Market buying some Fowls, on the 7th of December last, of a Saturday Morning, before it was well light. There were two Dozen and eight Fowls, and six Ducks. Whilst I was bargaining I felt something justle against me, and immediately I miss'd this Box, where there was a Guinea and a Half in Gold, and a Nine-shilling Piece in Gold. Turning short round about me, when I miss'd them, I saw a young Lad stand, and the Prisoner at the Bar; I clapp'd hold of the young Lad, and said, I had my Pocket pick'd, and cry'd out, Give me my Money, give me my Box: And the Lad said, he had none of my Money, nor my Box. I cry'd out again, Give me my Money, &amp;c. With that, the Lad, in a little Time, gave me my empty Box; and this young Man, the Prisoner, stood by him. I did not see him take the Money out, or know how he came by it.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the Boy?</p>
               <p>Marriot. He run away.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you else to say?</p>
               <p>Marriot. Nothing else, but I saw this young Lad, the Prisoner, stand by him at the same Time.</p>

               <p>M' Adam. While this Woman was buying the Fowls I perceiv'd the Prisoner and another standing by me, near a Quarter of an Hour. When we had bargain'd, the Woman went to pay me; but she was in a very great Fright, and said, I am robb'd, I have lost my Money. I think they were then both standing by me; but when I look'd again they were both gone. Upon this I run five or six Yards through another Stall in Newgate-Market: I took the Prisoner in a Turning on the Right-Hand, while the other was running on the Left. I took him, and sat him down by me. I ask'd him several Questions; Who he was? and, Whence he came from? but he could give but a very indifferent Account. And in a Day or two he was had before an Alderman in Guildball; there he was question'd if he knew any thing of it? He denied it; he said he knew nothing of it. Afterwards, when we were coming out he said very wicked Words; that he would have an Eye upon our Blood, or Words to that Purpose.</p>

I said to the next Neighbour, Take Care of your Pocket. I fear'd these Fellows were upon an ill Design: Accordingly some Time after this Woman, the Prosecutrix, cries out, Pick-Pocket. I saw the other run away, and this one, the Prisoner, following of him.</p>

               <p>Q. How much did it come to?</p>
               <p>Ashley. Eight Pounds eight Shillings and Sixpence. Then he presented this Bill, and he desir'd the Change; for he was to buy other Things with the rest of the Money. And looking on the Bill, I found it was not accepted: Upon which I told him I would send my Clerk and get it accepted. He then told me that Mr. Jackson seldom underwrit his Bills. Upon which I told him, if Mr. Jackson, or any of his Clerks, would say they would pay it, when it was due, I would be very well contented, and give him the Change.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Mr. Jackson?</p>
               <p>Asbley. Yes, Sir, I know him by Character.</p>
               <p>Q. You would have taken the Bill if they had said they would pay it?</p>
               <p>Ashley. Yes. But the Prisoner said he would carry it, and get it accepted. Accordingly he went out and brought it, with what he said was an Acceptance. But Jackson was spell'd with an x, instead of ck; the Name stood Jaxson. I then suspected it, but did not tell him so. I told him, if he would come To-morrow Morning, about Nine o'Clock, then the Things would be ready, and I would give him the Change. He was very pressing to have the Change that Night, and he would come for the Goods the next Morning. He had several Excuses, but I put him off. In the mean Time I sent to Mr. Jackson; and the Answer my Clerk brought from Mr. Jackson, or some of Mr. Jackson's Servants, that he had accepted no such Bill that Day, and that it was a Forgery, and desir'd the Person and Bill might be stopp'd. In the Morning, at the Time appointed, he, the Prisoner, came; and at the same Time Jackson's Clerk was at my House. Then the Prisoner took the said Bill out of his Pocket, and wrote the Indorsement upon it, and gave it to me. When I had it in my Possesion I shew'd it to Mr. Jackson's Clerk; and he told me that was none of his Master's Acceptance; for it was neither like his Hand-writing, nor did he spell his Name so. Upon which he was charg'd with the Constable, and had before my Lord Mayor, where Mr. Jackson was present, who is now here.</p>

No body has prov'd that it was Mr. Warner's Bill of Exchange: So that it was a bare Forgery of Acceptance, but not of an Acceptance of a Bill of Exchange. <rs id="t17460117-46-verdict183" type="verdictDescription">

            (to Waldale) What have you to say against the Prisoner at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Waldale. I am a Porter at Serjeants-Inn. On Wednesday the 23d of October last about half an Hour after Ten, I open'd the Gate, for Mr. Halbert and his Lady to come into Serjeants-Inn; and I standing at the Gate, while the Coach was coming out, this Manning, the Prisoner, comes up to me and shak'd Hands, and tickled my Hands, and after that he come and ask'd, How do you do Neighbour?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Waldale. Never saw him with my Eyes before, as I know. He said, I knew him, but I said, I am sure I do not. But, says he, you do. So then he put his Hand on the Waistband of my Breeches, Said I, I know nothing at all of you, indeed Friend. So then he unbutton'd his Breeches and let them full half Way down his Thighs.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Waldale. In the Middle of the Gateway.</p>
               <p>Q. In the Coachway?</p>
               <p>Waldale. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Coach come out by this Time?</p>
               <p>Waldale. No. And I desir'd him to walk a little farther up in the Inn and not to stand there, when he had let his Breeches down; this I spoke to him that I might get the Gate shut. No, says he, I'll stand here. So I said, I'll secure you, and I call'd out to my Wife. Mr. Hulbert hearing the Noise came out. He said, Waldale, what's the Matter. I said, Sir, here is a Molly, a Sodomite, or a Devil, I know not what you call him, not I.</p>
               <p>So then Mr. Hulbert ask'd me whether the Gate were shut; I told him they were not. I call'd, and my Wife took the Key, and Dr. Hulbert's Man lock'd the Gate. Then I went and serch'd a File of Musqueteer's from the Church, from thence I went to Mr. Money's, the Constable and brought him; from thence I took the Prisoner to the Watch-House? from thence to Bridewell; so then to his Lordship the next Day.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he pretend to when he was taken Waldale. He said, that I knock'd him down.</p>
               <p>Q. But after you charg'd him as a Molly, did he make any Defence at that Time, after his Breeches were down. Pray did he do any Thing after that?</p>
               <p>Waldale. Only pull'd them up.</p>
