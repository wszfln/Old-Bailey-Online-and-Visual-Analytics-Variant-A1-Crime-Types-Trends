On the 3d of October, about a quarter past one o'clock in the morning I heard a call of watch four or five times, and ran into Westmorland-street.

            . I am a saddler, and live at No. 222, High Holborn. Messrs. Reid and Co's. shop is right opposite mine. On the 9th of October, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning. I was in my shop, and saw the prisoner with his hand through a pane of glass, and moving something in their window. I crossed the road, took hold of him, and took him to the door, which I found fast - one of the young men opened it. I asked the prisoner what he was about - he said he was doing nothing. I asked what he was doing with the piece of silk handkerchiefs which I saw him moving; he said I was mistaken; he was doing nothing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Where was you - A. Standing in my door-way, with the door open. I saw nobody else near him. He did not move from the spot till I took him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you crossed the road did not you look back to see if there were any carriages, for fear of being run over - A. No.</p>

I found a square of glass broken, a piece of handkerchiefs entirely gone, and another piece moved from its place. I had placed them in the window twenty minutes before - the glass was then safe. They are Bandana handkerchiefs - the piece which is gone cost me 65 s., and the other 38 s. I had put six pieces in the window; five were left - one of which was moved, and one was quite gone. The piece removed was tumbled about, and laid five or six inches from the broken pane. The hole was large enough to admit a man's arm. There were other persons in the house beside me; it is our joint dwelling-house.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am in the habit of going out every morning to look for work. I was coming by this shop, and saw a boy about my size going away - I had not been there half a minute before a gentleman came and took me. I hope you will consider that this is in a wide part of the street, where carriages are passing, which is very deceiving to the eye. If you consider that there is sufficient evidence to find me guilty, do so. No doubt the gentleman lost sight of the lad as he crossed.</p>

There is an area under this parlour window. I returned home about ten o'clock, when one of the servants directed my attention to the secretary: I found it had been wrenched open, apparently by a chisel; I immediately missed my tin cash-box, containing this property - also a bond for 3,400 l., and another bill of exchange for 580 l. also.</p>

            . I am cook to Mr. Holland. On Wednesday night, the 8th of September, between eight and nine o'clock, I was sitting in the kitchen with my fellow servant, and heard a noise, which appeared like somebody trying the area door; I spoke to my fellow servant about it, but we did not move - sometime afterwards there was a ring at the bell: I went to the door, thinking my fellow servant was up stairs, but I found she had answered the door. I had a candle, and the wind blowing very strong I took it into the parlour, and set it upon the secretary, and then went to the door, and upon returning saw that the secretary had been forced open - the bolts of the lock were standing out, and the top of the drawer splintered. I informed my master on his return. I had swept the area on the morning of the 8th, and on the morning of the 9th, between eight and nine o'clock, when I went to unlock the area gate I found the top of a button at the bottom of the area steps. I picked it up, and gave it to Cork, the housemaid.</p>

            . I am housemaid to Mr. Holland. I was in the kitchen with Weston, and heard a noise - it is my business to fasten the house: I shut the parlour shutters at nine o'clock that evening - after I had heard the noise - the sash was shut down all day, but not fastened with a catch. I did not notice the sash, but I shut the shutters. We found the secretary open about a quarter past nine - I then opened the shutters, and found the lower sash about an inch open. I have heard Weston's evidence; it is correct. I found dirt on the window cill, and on the wainscoat under the window, as if a person's heel had rubbed against it in getting in. Weston gave me a button, which I gave to my mistress.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could a person standing on the area steps jump up to the cill of the window - A. Yes, my Lord, by going up the steps; there is a short curtain to the window, which was drawn as usual.</p>

On the 8th of September, in the evening, about half-past eight o'clock, the prisoner came to the coach-house door, and asked me if the coachman was at home - I said No - he asked what time he would be at home; I said I did not expect him till twelve o'clock; which was true - he went away, but returned in five minutes, and asked if he would be at home by the time he went to Alpha-cottages and back - I said No, and asked his name; he said his name did not signify, for the coachman did not know his name.</p>

             - we live at No. 3, Little Chesterfield-street; the prisoner boarded, but did not lodge with me. On the morning of the 9th of September he came to me, about half-past nine o'clock. I said,</p>
               <p>"Henry, there has been a young woman after your mother;" he asked what clothes she was dressed in - I told him what I had heard, as I did not see her myself; he said directly that he had heard Mr. Holland's house had been robbed, and by the description I gave he supposed the woman who had called was one of Mr. Holland's servants. He did not say who had told him of the robbery - he said he had heard of it, and had seen the washerwoman's daughter also.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what had passed between the washerwoman's daughter and him - A. No; he said to me,</p>

               <p>"Then Henry you must be a fool, don't give yourself up - if Mr. Holland wants you he will send for you." He said he would shave himself, and then said,</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He said he had seen the washerwoman's daughter, and there had been a report that the house had been robbed - A. Not that the washerwoman's daughter had said so.</p>

I live in Warren-street, with my mother who washes for Mrs. Holland. On the morning after the robbery (Thursday) I met the prisoner about eight o'clock, at my mother's door - he desired me to remember him to my mother - I had not heard of the robbery then, and said nothing to him about it. I saw him on the Tuesday before that, and he asked if Mr. Holland had got a servant; I said Yes: he asked if he was dressed in black; I said Yes.

            . I am an officer. I received the top of a button from Mr. Holland, and in consequence of information about three o'clock in the afternoon of the 9th of September, I went to Mrs. Brown's; the prisoner stood at the looking glass, shaving, his coat was off - I asked if his name was Henry; he said Yes; I asked where his coat was; he said,</p>
               <p>"My coat?" and looked round as if surprised, and pointed to it: it hung over a chair; I asked if he had any other coat; he said No - I took it up, looked at it, and told him to put it on, and come with me (I observed the shank of the button on the left hip sticking up) he did so. Mrs. Brown said,</p>
               <p>"Are you going to be taken away" - I said Yes. Another female in the room said</p>
               <p>"What have you done" - he said nothing. One of them (the prisoner's mother I believe) said.</p>
               <p>"If you had kissed your mistress this would not have transpired." I took him to the office close by. I first asked where he was on the previous evening; he said that from six to eight o'clock he was at Mrs. Brown's, and from eight till nearly eleven he was in Hanover-street, Hanover-square - that he did not know what number, but that he went there to take home an umbrella to a young woman, or to fetch one. I then asked what he had done with the top of the button, which was off his coat; he said he had lost it at Tottenham-court Theatre the night before, in the pressure of the crowd; I said I had found it in the Regent's-park - he said that was devilish odd that I should find it such a long way off. I produce it; it fits the shank, and corresponds with the other buttons - the inscription in the inside is the same as on the others - it is not a livery button. About an hour or two after his apprehension I asked how he had heard of the robbery - he said he had heard it from Mrs. Hicks's girl, the washerwoman's daughter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He seemed surprised at your asking for his coat - there was only one coat there - A. No.</p>

            . I am a farmer's man. On the 8th of October I saw the prisoner standing by the Feathers, public-house, Kensington Gravel-pits, with a horse in his hand; a man on a pony came up to him, and asked the price of the horse - he asked 18 l.; the man offered 15 l.; he sold it to him for 16 l. 10 s.: 2 s. was paid as a deposit. The prisoner took the horse to the Coach and Horses stables. The man said he would go to Turnham Green for the rest of the money. I staid with the prisoner the while, as I thought the horse was sold under value: the man told the landlord that if he did not return by eight o'clock to let the prisoner have the horse and 2 s. I fetched Dawes, the constable, and gave the prisoner in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You staid with him because you thought it was sold under value - A. Yes. I heard the bargain made. I said nothing to the prisoner about it; it was all done publicly - he was detained before the man came back.</p>

            . On the 8th of October, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was going towards Turnham Green; the prisoner passed me with a horse; I asked if it was for sale - he said it was - I asked the price: he said it was worth a score. It had a cold, and was thin. I said it was not worth that, but I would give him 15 l., which he refused. I agreed to give him 16 l. 10 s.; we put it into the stables at the Coach and Horses, Notting-hill. I went to receive some money at Turnham-green, leaving 2 s. with the landlord, and said if he waited there till eight o'clock I would pay him, or he was to have the 2 s. and go away. When I returned he was detained. I have not seen the horse since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He did not attempt to escape - A. No. I would not give above 20 l. for it now.</p>

Naylor afterwards claimed them, the wife said they had bought them of a man named Morgan; the prisoner agreed with her, and said his wife had given a sovereign for them, and before she agreed to pay for them had called him down stairs to ask if they were worth the money, and they agreed to give the 1 l., and that it was on the Saturday night previous. I asked the prisoner if he had not given more, and who paid the money, the answer was that they gave 1 l. on Saturday night, and he himself gave the man 2 s. 6 d. more on the Sunday morning; we afterwards found Naylor who identified the things; they knew that I was acquainted with Morgan. I have since taken him, but they could not satisfy the Magistrate that they had them from him.</p>

I found two dark lanterns in the shop, one on the mantle piece - he keeps an old iron shop. I opened the bundle, and asked if any thing else was brought with it, she said a silver watch which she pulled out of her pocket and gave me, and said that was all, and they had given 1 l. 2 s. 6 d. for the whole - all this was in the prisoner's hearing; we took them into custody, and on making a second search half an hour after I found a shirt in the drawer answering the description of one lost. I went and shewed it to Mrs. Naylor with a cotton bed-gown - she claimed both. Morgan was taken that afternoon, and I think Mrs. Naylor said she had seen him about the neighbourhood.</p>

I said they could not do it; they came again next afternoon between three and four o'clock, and swept my back parlour chimney; there was White, the prisoner, and another. I am sure the prisoner was one of them - his face was black; the little boy went up the chimney, and while he was up, White the master came to me and said the soot was falling down another flue - I was in another room and told him it was no such thing, for I had lived in the house many years and it could not be. I went up stairs with him, leaving the prisoner sitting in the back parlour window - the watch laid on the drawers in the front parlour, and the door between the two parlours stood open. I did not miss the watch till half-past nine o'clock, when I went to wind it up. I am sure of the prisoner's person.</p>

            . I am husband of the last witness. I saw the boy go up the chimney and left the prisoner in the room. I am sure he is the boy. I went out of the room up stairs to work. I missed the watch about nine o'clock. I saw the seal on the following morning in the possession of Irving, and on the evening of the 21st, a woman came to me and asked if I had lost a watch, and if I had it back with the expences I had incurred, she hoped I should not proceed further. I said I could not promise any thing: she then gave the watch into my hand, and under it was 10 s. I have not seen her since.</p>

On Sunday, the 17th of October, about half-past one o'clock in the night, Baker, the watchman, rang the bell - I got up looked out of window, and saw him at the door with his assistant; we had all gone to bed. I ran down, and let two watchmen in; we went into the shop, and found the prisoner in the cellar, under the house, took him into custody, and searched him, but found nothing upon him. I found some picklock keys, and a crow-bar in that cellar, after he was gone to the watch-house. We tried the keys, and found they would open the street door, and every door in the house. I had seen the cellar shut up on the Saturday night - it is never opened on a Sunday: the outer iron grating is fixed into an oaken cill, with five iron spikes, and is never open - we found that wrenched open with a crow bar, and the cellar window was pushed down; this must have been the way he got in. The grating was safe on the Sunday night, about nine o'clock; if it had been wrenched open then, I must have seen it.</p>

On the 17th of October I was calling half-past 1 o'clock, and heard a noise at the corner of Skinner-street, against Mr. Stott's house, and on turning round saw a man on his hands and knees, against the cellar railing - I thought him drunk, and went to his assistance, but he got up, and ran off. I perceived the grating half way off. and saw the prisoner coming out of the cellar: I said,</p>

               <p>"What business have you here," and struck him two or times; he retreated into the cellar again - I closed the grating, and shut him in, and alarmed Mr. Stott, who came down. Field, I, and another watchman went in, and took him behind some casks, in the back part of the cellar.</p>

I paid the 2 s.; the prisoner afterwards said she would have something to drink, and the servant fetched some gin; we each had a glass - I paid for it, and we went to bed. I wound my watch up and put it into my fob - I then had four half crowns and a shilling in my pocket - I put my trowsers under my head. I awoke between three and four o'clock in the morning and she was gone. I felt and missed my watch and money - I could make nobody hear me. I went down stairs as soon as it was light; I knocked at the parlour door, a woman came out, who said she was mistress of the house, that the girls were not about, but if I called about twelve o'clock no doubt I could get my watch. I called at twelve o'clock and saw the prisoner, who said, if I would call at three o'clock I should have the watch without expence or trouble, if I would go no further in the business. I said I knew she had taken it, and expected that she would find it, and the money also. I left and called at three o'clock, and saw her - she called me aside and asked for 2 s. and said she would redeem the watch directly. I gave her 2 s., she went down, returned in a quarter of an hour, and said she had not got it, it would not be long, and I must give her 6 d. for something to drink - I did so; she went down, and in ten minutes brought me up the duplicate of the watch, pawned for 12 s. I said she must fetch it out, or I would trouble her about it; she said she would not and abused me - I left her, keeping the duplicate; she had put 4 d. in copper into my purse on the night of the robbery in the room of the silver. I had her taken next night - I was perfectly sober, I never gave her the watch. I had given her 3 s. 6 d., besides 2 s. for the room.</p>

            . I am Mr. Luckin's son. While he was trying on the shoes his back was turned. I saw the prisoner put his hand into the glass case, take a pair of shoes, and put them under his jacket; he said he would call for the shoes next day, and walked backwards to the door. I went up and laid hold of him - he ran across the close, and I saw the shoes fall from him - he was secured.</p>

On the 16th of September, about ten o'clock in the morning I met the prisoners together at the corner of St. Paul's Church-yard; they saw me looking at them, and seperated.

On the 16th of September, about ten o'clock, Jessup came into my shop, and asked to see a small telescope, which I reached him from the glass case, where these spectacle hand frames were, and in the mean time Dewell came in, and wanted to see a measuring tape - I turned my back to them both to reach a telescope for Jessup. Dewell said he thought the tape too dear, but would tell his friend, and away he went. Jessup had not enough money to pay for a telescope which he fixed upon, and said he would call again for it, but never did. In about ten minutes I missed two hand frames, and a telescope. The officer produced the frames.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How do you know them - A. By their appearance. One has glasses and the other not: there is something about them by which I know them, but which I cannot describe. I have no doubt of their being mine. The prisoners appeared not to know each other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Will you swear to Dewell - A. I certainly will not swear positively to either of them, but have no doubt of them.</p>

             in the City-road, near Wesley's Tabernacle. I was examined on his trial in this place, when he was convicted - he had a parcel under his arm. I followed him to the corner of Chiswell-street, where he met the prisoner; they walked together down Finsbury-street, and Hooper gave the prisoner the parcel at the corner of Chiswell-street - they separated in Finsbury-street: Hooper went away. I followed the prisoner - I saw him put the parcel into a bag; I followed him till he got to White-street, and then said,</p>
               <p>"What have you got there; he said, paper to make a book of, which he had received from a man, a friend of his, but he did not know that he should know him again. The parcel had not been opened. I took him to the Mansion House - he there said he was going to take the paper to be ruled, but I cannot tell who he said he was going to take it to.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you been at the prisoner's house - A. Yes; it is about half a mile from where this transaction took place, and about three quarters of a mile from Messrs. Keys. I examined the prisoner's house, and saw book-binding implements there. He has been at large since last Session - I met him in Little Moorfields; I did not take him up. When he took the parcel from Hooper he walked with it on his arm, in the public street.</p>

            . I saw this paper - it is our manufacture. Hooper was in our employ as porter for many years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you not sold a considerable quantity of this paper before this transaction - A. Yes; I cannot tell in what direction it went - it might be sent out in town or country after it left our premises; it is made for printing on - it is not fit for books: it might be made into a book, but would not answer the purpose. The prisoner was discharged two Sessions ago, and has had an opportunity since of making his escape.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I received the paper to make a book of from a man whom I had seen before, at the Crown public-house, Chiswell-street; he called me to him at the corner of Chiswell-street, and walked with me - we were going to a man who was to rule it, when the officer saw us, and took me into custody. I was taken to the Mansion House; the officer went to my house - he saw bookbinding tools, and nothing else: I was taken at my own house. I have lived fifteen years in the parish. I was drinking in the public-house with a gentleman, who is here and heard the order given to me to make the book. I have ever since worked for Mr. Lee, in the City-road.</p>

About half-past nine o'clock on Saturday evening, the 17th of July, the prisoner came into the bakehouse, where I was, and said she came for a cake belonging to her pie; she looked at the cakes, and took one from the board, which she put on a pie, and took away - the cake belonged to Mr. Sergeant, and the pie to Mr. Rutland. I have paid 1 s. 6 d. for them; I did not know her before. I saw her at the office about a month afterwards, and am certain of her person.</p>

I left London with Mrs. Tatham the latter end of August last, for Wales, and left her with a female servant, who is rather deaf, and a confidential clerk in the house. The clerk did not sleep there; his chief business was to take charge of the papers. I ordered the prisoner not to leave the house on any account. I have three cellars of Foreign<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182410280012"/>and British wines. I had some Madeira, Port and Sherry, besides liquors. I locked the wine-cellar door myself, and put the key into my writing desk, in the office, with some money and other things of value. The desk was locked, and I took the key of it with me. I returned on the 30th of September. I found the key of the cellar in my desk, and when I looked into my cellar, I found a bottle of Madeira, with a glass by the side of it, which I never put there. The prisoner had been in the cellar with me, but never had been trusted by himself. I am positive the glass was not there when I left London. The number of bottles were evidently diminished, and I taxed him with taking it. When the officer came on the 6th of October, I said to the prisoner,</p>

               <p>"You have used me ill, you have been to my cellars," he said voluntarily that he had, and had taken two or three bottles. He had taken the key out of my desk, with an iron hook, which is used for taking the heater from the fire. There is a slit in the side of the desk, out of which he had got the key. The officer and the clerk were there at that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you a dealer in wine - A. No. I had other servants in my house. I had left a few shillings in a purse, in my desk. I had spoken to the prisoner before the officer came, about the cellar being opened; I said he must explain it to his mistress. I said, on the following Sunday after I came home.</p>
               <p>"I am afraid you have been doing something very wrong, I wonder you are not ashamed to look me in the face, I did not say he should be punished for it, or any thing of the kind.</p>

The prisoner was in my employ; I had some suspicion that he had robbed me, and on the 23d of July, I put forty shillings in the till, which I had marked about five o'clock in the afternoon, he was not in the habit of going to the till, it was kept locked. I left home between five and six in the evening. I have a lad in the shop also. I returned between nine and ten and gave my horse to the prisoner and went into the shop. I opened the till, and missed four of the marked shillings; they were all marked with a small cross on the check of the head. I went for a constable; the prisoner was then in the house; I called him, and said, I had a suspicion of his robbing the till, he denied it. I then told the constable to search him - he found 1 s., and a few half pence, but it was not my shilling. I asked him what he had done with the money I had paid him on that afternoon; he said, he had bought some clothes of a neighbour, of the name of Pooley, to the amount of 10 s. 6 d. I went there and we found 3 s., marked as those were in my till.</p>

On the 23d of September, I got into the hay-loft and removed some boards, suspecting that the plumbers had stolen lead - I placed myself in the loft at a quarter past six o'clock in the evening, and on looking through a hole I had made in the lath and plaster, I saw Franks with his waistcoat partly unbuttoned, and a piece of lead in his hand, which he concealed between his waistcoat and breeches, he then buttoned his waistcoat over it; I then saw Bowdley do the same; Connell, another man, was treading on a piece of lead to bring it into a small compass. I went down and called Mr. Osborne - he went with me to the shop, and there we found the two prisoners. Connell was at that time shut in a cupboard; I shut the room door, and said, I suspected they had lead about them, and insisted upon searching them before they left the room - they denied it; I then went up to Franks and unbuttoned his waistcoat, and found this piece of lead in his possession - I put my hand to it, and then he took hold of it and pulled it out. I then went to Bowdley and said, I insisted upon searching him; he opened his waistcoat, and gave me out his piece of lead. I then went to the cupboard, and found Connell - I said,</p>
               <p>"Have you got yours about you;" he said No - but I found a piece on the floor in the corner. Mr. Osborne and I took the lead into my room, and kept it there till the Tuesday following, and then took it to Bow-street. I discharged the men, and told them that was all I could do, but should inform Lord Egremont of it, and he might do as he pleased.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there a house adjoining belonging to Lady Marsham - A. Yes, the workmen were stripping that house as well; the old lead from the two houses was mixed together in the work shop - we had no private mark on the lead which came from one or the other house - I could not tell which they came from; Lord Egremout paid for the repairs; he is the proprietor of both houses. Lady Marsham is his tenant; the lead had been brought from her house, No. 3, on that day.</p>

On the morning of the 21st of September I opened the windows of the chamber, and saw the desk in its usual place - I went into the ajoining room, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I looked out of the window, and saw a crowd of people running; I then went into the square, and saw the people at No. 6 - they came on to our chambers, and asked if I had lost anything: I said No; they said I had better go in and see. I went in, and missed the desk. The window had been pulled down so low that I could not pull it up again; it pulls down, but will not go up; there were footmarks upon it.</p>

            . I was at the door of the fruit shop in Lincoln's Inn-passage, and saw the prisoner with a desk under his arm - I followed him, and saw him put it into the passage: I went after him - a man came up and collared him; they scuffled, and I believe the prisoner struck him - he then ran away, and was caught by another person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This occurence did not take up more than a moment - A. No; he stopped in an instant to put down the desk, and I lost sight of him while he turned the corner of Serle-street.</p>

            . I am the patrol. I stopped the prisoner about ten o'clock on the evening of the 9th of October, with this copper on his shoulder. I asked him where he was going; he said to Paddington, that he had moved all his things but this copper, and he was carrying it himself, as it was expensive to hire a person to carry it; a woman was with him, carrying his hat - she went away. I took him at the end of Charlton-street; two or three hundred yards from the prosecutor's house.</p>

I saw the plated harness shining through a hole in the bag, and said I thought it was not his, and took him to the watch-house. I found the harness in it.</p>

            . I am a chairman; I have a sedan chair and two poles: I missed the poles on Thursday, the 16th of September, about eleven o'clock; I had seen them about four days before. They have a mark on them, by which I know them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Do you know a person of the name of Munro - A. Yes; the prisoner had been a partner with him, and was forced to give up in consequence of a sprained leg. My poles were at the Albany; there was another old chair by the side of mine, which had not been used for some time. I do not know that it belonged to Munro; it had been standing there ever since I knew the place. I have been working with Munro within the last twelve months.</p>

            . I live at New Brompton; my chair stands at the Duggin Arms, public-house. I bought these poles of the prisoner, for 7 s., one Thursday, about six weeks ago; he said they were his own, but did not say who he bought them of.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know the prisoner as working a sedan chair for some years - A. Yes. I saw him first on this business one Monday; he asked me to buy a pair of poles - I said I had no money. He came a few days afterwards, and left them at my house, and then he came to me at the Duggin Arms: we walked together to my house, and I said to him,</p>
               <p>"These poles are marked, are they your own;" he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, they are" - they were cracked, and I gave him 7 s. for them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Munro and I are still partners in some poles; I did not know the difference between these and my own; we have two pairs of poles, which stand just behind the prosecutor's. My partner changed a pair of poles of ours with one King, and I did not know but these were them.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On Friday, the 1st of October, I was coming out of a house in Jerusalem-court, Clerkenwell, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, and saw the prisoner and another man coming along as fast as they could walk; their shoes were very muddy, it was a wet day; they were going towards Sutton-street: I was about one hundred and fifty yards off at one time, but got closer. I saw the prisoner look round after me; I went up to him, he had a blue apron round him; I laid hold of him, and the other immediately ran through Cross-street, into Wilderness-row. I found this silver tea pot in the prisoner's apron, wrapped in a handkerchief; there were tea leaves in it, and it appeared warm. I said,</p>
               <p>"You have been a good way to get this, have not you?" he said it had been given to him, but did not say by whom; I said it was given you by your pall I suppose. I asked him a second time where he got it; he said he had picked it up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was passing down London-street, he laid hold of me, and said,</p>
               <p>"What have you got?" I said I do not know, I picked it up; he took me into a public-house, and took me to Clerkenwell, by the Sessions-house, gave me a glass of gin, and said, if I would give him the property he would let me go - Witness. As we crossed Clerkenwell-green, a man asked me to go and have something to drink; I said</p>
               <p>"No, I want nothing - but give it to this man," and he gave him some gin. I said nothing what ever about his giving me the tea pot.</p>

On Monday, the 27th of September, his house was robbed, and on that day I saw a person come into the entrance of the door, before the robbery. I communicated this to the police officers; and Hanley directed me to go after the man, wherever I should see him. I accompanied Hanley and Attfield two days after the robbery, (on the 29th of October,) to a ground where there were a great many men, tossing half-pence. I saw one of the officers there put his hand on the shoulders of the prisoner at the bar, and say something to him, which I did not hear; my attention was directed to the prisoner. In consequence of that, I looked at him, and observed him particularly, and afterwards had some conversation with the officers about him. I did not know him before. I told the officers that he was not the person I had seen in my master's house; I saw him again half an hour afterwards in the same ground; the officer had taken me somewhere else in the interval; we returned again and saw the same man there; I observed him again as the other officer was talking to him then; and I think he said</p>
               <p>"Kiddy, how came you here?" I was still of the same opinion that he was not the person I had seen at my master's house. On the Sunday afternoon following (the 3d of October) I went to Shoreditch-church to hear a charity sermon. I had a five shilling piece, two half crowns, eight shillings and a sixpence in my purse. I left the church soon after five o'clock, and gave one shilling to the charity, leaving seventeen shillings and sixpence in my purse. I had my umbrella and a shawl when; I came out of the Church, I saw the man whom I had seen in the entry of my master's house on the day it was robbed; he was outside the church-rails, holding the rails with both hands; the officer had desired me to follow him if I should see him; (he had not said so on the ground.) I followed the man a little way down Hackney-road, and then up a turning over into a field, over the canal, and then down a turning, and over the canal again, and up a turning which took me into the * <placeName id="t18241028-58-crimeloc317">London fields</placeName>

               <p>"I do not know you Sir." I did know him very well, but said so from fear; I knew him from seeing him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182410280022"/>in the ground; he then beckoned to another man who instantly came up to me, and instantly took hold of my other arm. I still saw the man going down the path of the field - the prisoner told the other man to put his hand over my mouth, that I should not halloo; he put it over my mouth, and held it tight - he had nothing in his hand, but when we got a yard or two further, the prisoner crammed some bay into my mouth, and said to the other man,</p>
               <p>"Now hold your hand over this;" he did so, and the man whom I had been following, when he saw the other two holding me, crossed over and said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, d - n her, make her take off her pattens, that she may go on faster." I put them off with my feet, each man holding me by the arm, and left them there - they walked me along as fast as they could to the end of the field, still holding me all the time, and when we came to the end of the field, they took me down a lane, with a hedge on each side; it leads down to a pond: as we went along the lane, the man who I had been following said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! d - n her drag her down faster" - and when I came to the pond the prisoner at the bar took the umbrella out of my hand and my shawl off; he pulled out a rope about a yard and a half long from his pocket, and said</p>
               <p>"I will hang her and she cannot swear against us then" - (the prisoner said so,) the man who held my other arm, told the prisoner to search me, to see what I had - he said</p>
               <p>"Search her and see what she has" - the prisoner searched my pockets and took out my purse, which had the money I have mentioned in it, and I saw him put it into his left hand waistcoat pocket - and said</p>
               <p>"D - n the b - g - rs they cannot swear to money" - then he (the prisoner) took hold of my shoulders, and the other man who held my arm, held my feet and they threw me over a rail; I rolled down into the pond; there was a great deal of water in the pond; every part of me except my head was in the pond; the man who I had been following, then said</p>

               <p>"D - n her, poke her down under the water" - the prisoner said</p>
               <p>"Oh! she won't rise any more."</p>
               <p>* The witness often mentioned Hackney-fields, it is London-fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you were thrown into the pond, did the man you had followed say anything - A. He came up to me and gave me a blow in the breast, and I fell back against the rail of the pond - I was thrown over the rails with force: when I was in the water, I heard one of them ask if my shawl was all silk; another said it was all silk; it was made with hard silk; another said</p>
               <p>"We won't have anything that belongs to her, because there may be a mark on it, which the b - g - s can swear to" - the prisoner came to the edge of the rails and said</p>
               <p>"Here goes," and threw the umbrella and shawl into the pond.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the hay - A. I pulled it out of my mouth in the pond. I heard one ask the other how much he had; another said 17 s. 6 d., and they said</p>

               <p>"Now she is gone, we will go to the White Horse at Hackney and regale ourselves</p>
               <p>"they went away. I remained in this situation for a minute or two after I heard their voices, fearing that if I came out too soon they would poke me into the water again, and then I crept out of the pond and sat by the edge of it. I heard two men talking, I peeped up to see who they were, and asked them to help me; they helped me over the rails - I was all wet up to my neck, and muddy. I asked them to take me home to my father - they said I had better go to an alehouse at the end of the field. I walked behind them to the Cat and Shoulder of Mutton public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What prevented your hallooing as you went along the field - A. The man held my mouth all the way with the hay in it. The landlord got me a coach, and I went to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner attentively, and state whether you only believe, or whether you have any doubt of his person - A. No; I am positively sure of him - I described him to the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity as you went along the field of seeing his features - A. I had. I saw him all the way along for twenty minutes I dare say. I was face to face to him when he 
               <persName id="t18241028-58-person576">drew</persName>
             the rope from his pocket. I have not the slightest doubt of his being the person. I afterwards saw the officers who had accompanied me to the ground, and communicated it to them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. What time of day was it when you saw the man at your master's house - A. About eleven o'clock in the day - it was not the prisoner. I was not alarmed then; it was about four o'clock in the afternoon when the officers took me to the skettle ground; there were a good many men there. I always go to Shoreditch church. I did not see the prisoner when I came out of church - my way home was towards Bishopsgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the person, did it not occur to you that it would be wise to take somebody with you - A. No, there was nobody there who knew the man but me. I knew none of the people about and said nothing to them; people were passing in the road - I did not ask for assistance there - the man walked as any one else would. I noticed his dress. I do not know the name of the lane which he turned down - it is a public lane and persons were passing. I was never there before - there was not a soul passing in the field at the time the two men had hold of my arm. I did not see any one pass me in the field where they took hold of me. I was in the pathway of the field when they took hold of me, but nobody was passing. I could not call out because I was alarmed, and the prisoner beckoned to the other, who instantly came up. I had not time to cry out. I had not presence of mind to call out, I was so alarmed. I pulled my arms to get from them, but they held me so fast I could not, and as soon as the other man came up, he put his hand over my mouth, and the hay was put in.</p>
               <p>Q. Now mind what I ask you, did you not in your way to the pond pass several persons - A. No, I did not, not one. I have never said that I did pass persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say at another place, when giving this account that if you had seen persons you would not have mentioned it, for they might have noticed you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say that if persons had passed they might have supposed you were walking arm-in-arm with the men - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the Magistrate that persons did pass you after the three men were in your view - A. No. I passed some houses - I could not call for help; the man's hand was over my mouth, and the hay in it. I must have seen persons if they had passed. I was alarmed when they caught me by the arm, but I should have seen if any person passed in the pathway; nobody did. My alarm continued<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182410280023"/>till I got to the pond. One side of the pond is open to a field - one side has a fence, and the other a hedge. I was thrown over the rails; it has rails along; I could have got under them. When the man said he would hang me I thought I should have died.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the alarm increased I suppose - A. Yes. I did not lose my senses at all. I laid in the pond, and heard their conversation. I was holding by a piece of wood in the pond, to keep my head up.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a part of the pond where they might have put you in without throwing you over the rails - A. No; the part that was open is in a field, not where we were; they could not put me in where we were without throwing me over. I have been to the pond since. I heard and remembered all they said. I have told this story at the office, and at Hick's-hall. I have not talked to my friends about it, for every time I think of it, it hurts my mind. I have not described the pond as 680 yards from the Cat and Shoulder of Mutton.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. You have an impediment in your speech - A. I have.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have been asked why you did not communicate to people that you were going after the man; you was told if you saw him to watch where he went to - A. Yes; not to have him taken, I was to watch where he went, and the officer would make enquiry. The man saw me when I saw him in my master's entry.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Can you state where you last saw anybody walking too and fro - A. By the Cat and Shoulder of Mutton; that is a great way from the pond.</p>

            . I am a labourer in the East India Company's service. On Sunday afternoon, the 3d of October, about ten or twenty minutes after six o'clock, I was crossing the London-field, with Field; it was just getting dusk, and after we got across the field, and were right opposite the pond, I heard the call of a female in distress; she said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake gentlemen give me assistance, for I have been robbed by two men, and thrown into this pond;" Field jumped over the rails, assisted her up, and I helped her over into the pathway; it was the prosecutrix - she was in a dreadful state; the lower part of her was all covered with mud, and she was wet up to the breast; she was close to the edge of the pond, not in it. We took her to the Cat and Shoulder of Mutton, which I should think is nearly half a mile from the pond.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. I suppose she was agitated and alarmed - A. Yes. The fields are much frequented on a Sunday, but we had particularly remarked as we came along that we did not meet a single person, except two men, whom we met coming in a direction from the pond, towards the Cat and Shoulder of Mutton.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you make any observation of these two men - A. Not at all; they were about a hundred yards from the pond. I should not know them again.</p>

            . I was in company with Bradshaw, crossing London-fields, and met two men within about seventy yards of the pond, coming towards the Cat and Shoulder of Mutton, in a direction from the pond.

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On the 29th of September I accompanied the prosecutrix with Hanley, to a ground behind the Princess of Wales, public-house, in Wentworth-street, to see if she could identify any person who she had seen about her master's premises on the day they were robbed; there were thirty or forty persons there; she looked about, and I saw a person there whom I knew very well; and while she was looking I went up to the prisoner, whom I knew - I put my hand on his shoulder, and said,</p>
               <p>"Ah! Kiddy, what brings you here?" the prosecutrix could hear that. I told him I understood he was in constant employ now; he turned on his heels, and made some observation, which I did not hear. The prosecutrix recognized nobody there. We came out of the ground, and went to the City of Norwich, public-house, Wentworth-street, for the same purpose, and in consequence of somebody I saw there we returned with the prosecutrix to this ground again - we had been absent three or four minutes. I did not myself observe the prisoner there when we returned: we remained there two or three minutes; this was on Wednesday. I saw her again on Sunday night, the 3d of October, at Garton's house, about half-past seven o'clock - she complained of being robbed by three persons, and gave me information, which led us to apprehend the prisoner - Hanley took him at the Princess of Wales, (behind which is the ground we took the prosecutrix to) on Monday, the 4th of October.

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. I went with Attfield and the prosecutrix to the ground behind the Princess of Wales, public-house, on the 29th of September - I saw the prisoner there and spoke to him, and called the prosecutrix's attention to his person; were-turned to the ground in a quarter of an hour, and I again called her attention to him. I was in conversation with him, and am certain that she saw him - she did not know him. We were in search of a person suspected of robbing her master. We directed her in case she saw the man suspected to watch his motions to see where he went to, and to come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182410280024"/>to the office and give information. On Monday morning, the 4th of October, about eleven o'clock, four officers besides myself went to this gambling ground. I saw a woman run out of a house in a direction towards the Princess of Wales - I ran after her; she ran in at the corner door of the public-house; I went in at another door in Wentworth-street; one man ran out past me, and the prisoner followed him. I said,</p>
               <p>"Stop Harris, I want to speak to you;" I laid hold him, and sat him down on a bench, and in two or three minutes Gleed and Attfield, the other officers came to my assistance. I told the prisoner I apprehended him on suspicion of robbing and ill-treating a woman in London fields, the evening before; he said,</p>
               <p>"It is very hard, let what will be done amiss, I am sure to be charged with it;" I took him away; he went very quietly. On Saturday, the 9th of October, I accompanied the prosecutrix to the London-fields; I measured the distance of the pond from the Cat and Shoulder of Mutton - it is three furlongs and six yards.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. When you took him and he complained to you, did he not add</p>
               <p>"I was at home all yesterday afternoon" - A. He did say so in the course of the day, but not at that time; he mentioned it at the office.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he not mention it as he went along - A. We had another prisoner to take, and he said nothing to me going along. Vann and Armstrong had him; to the best of my recollection the first time I heard him say he was at home was at the office, in the course of the same day. I searched his house next day; he lived in Carter's-rents I think - George-street is just by the Princess of Wales; his house is a quarter of a mile or more from there; I know of no other George-street. I cannot exactly recollect the name of the place he lives in - I should think it is half a mile from Shoreditch church, &amp; from there to the pond is one mile, four furlongs, and two hundred and nine yards. I think it is above two miles from where he lives to the pond. The prosecutrix gave me the shawl and the umbrella.</p>

I received a rope from Stretton, and took it to the prosecutrix; I desired her to describe it before she saw it, which she did - her description agreed with it all but one end - she said it was unplatted at one end, and it was unplatted at both ends; she said she thought it was only unplatted at one end.</p>

            . I am a cow keeper, and live at Dalston. On Sunday night, the 3d of October, about twenty-five minutes after six o'clock, I was in London-fields, and picked up a pair of pattens by the side of the footpath, leading from Dalston to the Cat and Shoulder of Mutton, about two hundred and forty yards from the pond - I took them home. I went to the pond when it was being emptied, and from what the officers said I went home for the pattens, and gave them to them.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's daughter; he lived in George-street, by Hanbury's brewhouse. I have a mother, a brother, and a sister - my sister does not live at home. I live with Mrs. Walker, in Carter's-rents. I heard of my father being taken up on the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Now on the Sunday before that did you go to buy any apples - A. Yes; it was within five minutes of six o'clock - I had been taking a walk, and went to Mr. Marshall's in George-street to buy the apples; he lives three or four doors from my father, on the other side of the way, nearly opposite. I saw my father as I passed his (my father's) window; I saw him at the window in his shirt sleeves, with his hands leaning on something, taking something out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. He was taking something out of the window - A. Yes; his hand was on the rail; the window was open. I came Brick-lane way, and looked at Hanbury's clock, and it wanted five minutes to six.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. How long had you been out walking - A. Ever since half-past two o'clock; I was alone all the time; I started from Mrs. Walker's, and went to Spitalfields Church, and stopped there about an hour and half, and walked round Shoreditch, up Bethnal-green road and down Whitechapel, and did not go home, but went by my father's window to buy the apples; my father's is about three doors from Marshall's, on the other side of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not passed any other apple shop in your walk - A. I do not know, I generally buy my apples there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182410280025"/>I only bought one penny worth, Mr. Marshall served me. Mrs. Walker was at home; she lives not many minutes walk from my father's.</p>

               <p>Q. When you came from Spitalfields Church and along Whitechapel, would it be the nearest way home to go by your father's - A. No, it was out of my way; I went for the apples; I did not call at my father's; I had seen none of my father's family that day; I saw them two or three days before; I did not call to know how they did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see your brother - A. I did not see any of them; my sister lived with me at Mrs. Walker's, but she had dined at my father's that day; they dine about one o'clock; I did not call for her; I do not know at what time she came home; Walker is a weaveress; I work and lodge there.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you took your walk, did you see your sister - A. She came up at half-past three o'clock in the afternoon - I met her in Brick-lane by accident; I was then going to Spitalfields Church.</p>
               <p>Q. How much of the service was over when you got there - A. I cannot tell; I did not take notice whether the sermon had began or not - when I met my sister I said I was going there - she did not say where she was going: I did not see her after that, till she came to bed at ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get home to Walker's - A. I was up there two or three times after I bought the apples: I went and sat on the steps of Walker's door till near nine o'clock - I got there just after six - I went straight back from Marshall's, and sat on the steps for three hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see your sister come in during that time - A. No; my brother lives at home.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You said you went up to Walker's two or three times; and now you say you sat on the steps three hours - A. I got up, but was not off the steps two minutes; I only went up stairs - I continued on the steps from six o'clock till I went to bed. Spitalfields Church is not far from Walker's; Brick-lane is just at the end of the street.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you doing from two o'clock till half-past three - A. Walking up and down Brick-lane. I think church was over about half-past four; there was a sermon I am sure.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Did Mrs. Walker go with you - A. No, she was at home all the evening, up stairs from six o'clock to nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you left the steps when your sister came home - A. I was up stairs then, and in my own room I believe; she slept in the same bed as me. I went up for good to bed, at ten o'clock; I do not know at what time she came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get to church at prayer time, or sermon time - A. They were not at prayers, they were preaching all the time.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. What garment did the clergyman wear, black or white - A. White; I do not know whether he changed it while I was there, for I sat behind in the gallery, and could scarcely see it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You can read I suppose - A. No. I can tell the time, it is now not quite twenty minutes to four. I cannot tell what the clergyman talked about, I cannot tell what he said at all; they sang once, as we came away, after sermon. My father generally goes to bed on Sunday afternoons - he was up at five minutes to six.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he his waistcoat on - A. I could see nothing but his shirt; he was not very well. I do not know what had been the matter with him; he is a last and patten maker.</p>

               <p>MR. LAW. Q. How did you know the time - A.

            , JUN. I am turned eleven years old, and work at winding silk. I cannot read or write. I go to Spitalfields church, and I can say my prayers - persons who speak false go to the wicked man - (sworn.) I remember my father being taken up on the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he on the Sunday afternoon - A. Why, my father was taken very bad, and obliged to lay down, and my mother told me to go to chapel after dinner; we dined a little after one o'clock; my father was taken bad about two. I went to chapel alone - it is at the corner of Wood-street; the service had began when I got there - the minister had a black gown on. I came out of chapel between five and six o'clock, and went straight home; my father was then at tea with my mother - nobody else was there; my father sat by the fire after tea till 8 o'clock and then told me to go to bed; we have got no clock, we go by Mr. Hanbury's clock - I heard it strike eight when I went to bed - my father was then in the room, and had been so from tea time. I suppose it was half-past five when we had tea.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that from the time you had tea till you went to bed your father was never out of the room - A. Yes. He had only his breeches, shirt, and waistcoat on at tea time.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. He had got a violent cold - A. Yes; he sat in his shirt till I went to bed, without coat or waistcoat. It was Spitalfields church that I went to that afternoon. I did not see either of my sisters there. My sister Ann dined at my father's that day; I do not know what became of her - I went to church alone at two o'clock, and got there about ten minutes after two. The gentleman was in a black gown; church lasted till a little after five.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is the chapel in Wood-street what you call Spitalfields church - A. Yes; it is a chapel at the corner of Wood-street.</p>
               <p>Q. There are no prayers there as there are at Spitalfields church - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Spitalfields church also - A. No; it is at the corner of Wood-street.</p>

I went to the chapel at the corner of Wood-street; it is near Hanbury's brewhouse; I do not know the name of the other street at which it is at the corner of. There is a chapel near there which has been shut up, but this is another.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you go to more than one church or chapel that afternoon - A. No; they call it Spitalfields church - it is not very large; I staid till service was over, and then went home.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Can you from the chapel see a very large building - A. Yes, some large houses.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Your father was taken ill unexpectedly; it is not usual for him to be ill of a Sunday - A. No. He does not go to church or chapel; he breakfasts in bed, and gets up about ten o'clock on Sundays, and dines with us.</p>

               <p>Q. Then takes a walk and come homes to tea does he - A. Yes. I never knew him go to bed before on a Sunday afternoon. The bed is in the same room as we sit in. I saw my sister Ann after dinner, about eight o'clock, when I was going to bed, but not before.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's daughter. On the Sunday before he was taken up, I dined with him about one o'clock - my mother and brother dined with us; I staid there till three o'clock, and then went home to clean myself at Walker's, and then returned to my father's - my brother was told to go to chapel - I believe it was to Spitalfields chapel; when I returned from Walker's about half-past four o'clock, my father was asleep in bed, in the sitting room; he had his breeches on, but his coat and waistcoat were off - I then went to take a walk; I did not meet any of the family in my walk; I walked round Bethnal-green-road, and then back to Mrs. Walker's - I got there between nine and ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you walk from the time you left your father's till between nine and ten o'clock - A. Yes; I was out three or four hours; and when I got back to Walker's, my sister was sitting on the step of the door - I went to bed about half-past ten. Spitalfields chapel is at the corner of Wood-street; I was never there - there is a chapel by the brew-house, which is shut up; it is in St. John-street - there is a chapel besides that, which is called Spitalfields chapel, you can see the church from it.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Had your father a violent cold that day - A. I think he had; he was very ill I know - I left his house about half-past four o'clock, and walked till half-past nine o'clock - I went up Bethnal-green-road, round Hackney; by the Jews chapel in Hackney-fields; down Hackney-road, and Shoreditch, towards home.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you always spend your Sundays with your father - A. Not always - he often laid down after dinner - my brother lived at home, and was there more than me.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You left your father's at half-past three o'clock, and returned at half-past four - now recollect well: during that time did you meet your sister - A.

            . I know the prisoner by sight - but am not intimate with him. I live at No. 1, George-street, and he lives right opposite - I can see his house from mine - I heard of his being taken up on the Friday; on the Sunday before that Friday I was at home all the afternoon, and went to my window about five o'clock or a quarter past, and saw Harris - I suppose it was him, but do not swear it; I saw a man who appeared as if he had just come off the bed, as his waistcoat and coat were off; he was in Harris's room; I believe him to be the man - I called my wife, and Norwood, my apprentice to the window.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you call them to the window - A He being a notorious character, a fighting man. I called my wife and apprentice to the window, for the express purpose of seeing him - there had been something between him and my brother; I knew his person. I afterwards went to Newgate of my own accord, to see if I could identify him as the man I had seen at the window.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. As you were not acquainted, what induced you to go to Newgate to look after the man - A. I mentioned it at the public-house; and hearing the case was a bad one, I thought I had better go. My house is about three quarters of a mile from Shoreditch church; I went to live there on the Sunday before. I had seen him before, but never in that house till the Sunday. I have heard people in the parish say that he was a noted boxer - I should not have known him if I had met him in the street; I will not swear that he is the man.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Do you believe him to be the man you saw at the window - A. Yes; I heard he was charged with committing a robbery about six o'clock, and believing I had seen him at that time, I went to Newgate to ascertain whether he was the man or not.</p>

               <p>- YARDLEY. I am the wife of the last witness. I heard of Harris being taken up on the Monday - I had seen him on the Sunday about half-past five o'clock or twenty minutes to six. I was at our window, and he was at his window, in his shirt sleeves; he is the man - Norwood was there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you known him long - A. I never knew him before - my husband pointed him out to me; he said that was Kiddy Harris, the man who his brother was going to fight some time ago; his window was open; it is on the first floor - not even with the street. Our window was also open - it is a narrow street; three carts could not pass in it - nobody was at the window with him; I had seen him before, but never knew him by name.</p>

            . I am a marshalman. Last Tuesday week I searched a box at Roberts's house; I broke it open, and found two melting pots, thirty-five ounces of silver wire points; a lump of silver, weighing ten ounces, and some scrapings - all wrapped in a parcel of brown paper.</p>
               <p>Mr. BROWN. These are our property. The melting pots we imported from Germany - we put them into the fire to kneel them, as we call it; and that turns them red; the silver is ours - we missed it all while the prisoner was with us - the wire tallies with the drawing machine - I had a very good opinion of him.</p>

            . I am a clerk to Messrs. Hall and Co., brewers. On the 16th of October, about six o'clock in the evening I was with their dray at the Red-Hart, <placeName id="t18241028-64-crimeloc342">Shoe-lane</placeName>

I told him repeatedly that there was not room, but he drove on until the waggon got entangled with our dray, and drew it backwards till it came near to a post at the <placeName id="t18241028-64-crimeloc343">corner of Stonecutter-street</placeName>

I had seen the deceased standing against that post just before; I stepped forward to take him out of the way, but before I could reach him the dray forced him against the post, and he fell backwards with his head towards Stonecutter-street - he was not in the road; I think it was impossible for the prisoner to have seen him before he was hurt - an alarm was given, and he stopped directly.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was your dray close to the curb - A. I cannot say; we cannot sometimes let beer down if it is - I told him he should pass in five minutes, as the barrel was then hanging by the rope.</p>

            . I am one of the draymen. We had two casks to deliver - I cannot say whether the dray was close to the pavement; I said I would make room as soon as I had put the beer down - but the prisoner drove on; there was hardly room, and his wheels caught the dray - he stopped, and did not know what to do; the waggon pushed the dray along about five or six yards. I did not see the man knocked down it was quite dark. I heard him complain of his being hurt, but had not seen him by the post.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you move to give him room - A. No; he could not see the man at the post.</p>

            . I am shopman to an oilman who lives in Shoe-lane. I saw the prisoner driving the waggon - he asked them to let him pass; he waited two or three minutes, then went on, and got entangled with the front of the dray - some one called out that there was not room; he drew on to about the centre of the dray and got entangled more, and pulled the dray back about thirty feet - a man stood at the post behind the dray, which struck him against the post and broke his ribs - he fell on his back, and was picked up: he said he was not hurt so much as I might think. I saw him after his death, and knew him to be the man; Mr. Ray saw him. I think the prisoner must have seen that there was not room - after the dray was pulled about thirty feet, the street is about three feet wider. He could not see the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are not used to drive - A. No. As soon as the man fell he came back, but understanding that he was not much hurt he went on.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. On the 16th I saw the deceased in bed, and found his side much injured, and several ribs broken; he lived till Monday evening. I opened him, and found several ribs broken, which caused his death.</p>

               <p>- LACY. I am an engine turner. I was in Shoe-lane, and saw the dray; it was about nine inches from the curb; if it had been close there would have been room to pass, for the fore wheels did get by, but the hind ones caught. I heard some one say,</p>
               <p>"You can pass," or</p>
               <p>"there is room now," and I thought that there was room. I believe it was pure accident; he did not appear at all in an ill-humour.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear persons say there was not room - A. Yes; but I thought the dray was moved a little for him to pass.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Shears, whom the prisoner drives for. I was passing Stonecutter-street at this time; he seemed drawing his horses on carefully to avoid the dray - the man fell and he stopped directly, and said he was extremely sorry - that the drayman would not move, and he was anxious to get on, and thought there was room. He had not whipped his horses - I saw him passing, and if I had thought there was danger I should have called to him.</p>

On the evening of the 25th of October I was up stairs: a little girl came into my shop, and called me, and as I came down I saw through a small window on the stairs a young man standing by the counter: he caught up a bundle of twelve pairs of stockings, and ran to the door, but, instantly returned, seeing Mr. Murray looking at him, through the window. I had got into the shop when he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182410280029"/>came back, and he asked me what I would make him some shirts for. Mr. Murray came in, and said he had taken some stockings out of the window; he then ran out, but was pursued and brought back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You do not know what had passed before you came down - A. No. I could not see who was outside the shop. I saw him take up the stockings and go out.</p>

            . I was in Rupert-street on the 25th of October, and saw the prisoner enter this shop, pass his hand round the window, and take the stockings - he came out, and I met him, and stared him full in the face: he returned into the shop, and laid them on the counter; I saw him turn up his coat sleeves and show his wrist-band, and ask Miss Agnew some question - I then went into the shop, and said he ought to be taken up; he pushed by me and knocked off my hat, which Miss Agnew picked up. I pursued him, but lost sight of him; he was soon afterward brought back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you passing the shop - A. Yes; it was seven o'clock in the evening; I did not see any other person there.</p>

I went to the shop to buy the book I asked for; the lad showed me one unbound; I walked round the shop, and looked at several books; he then asked me to wait while he went to his master's house - I said I had to fetch the money, as I had not enough about me, and I would call again; he came close to me. I did not strike him. I went up Holborn, and began to run, as I was in haste to send the book off to the country at two o'clock, and it was then past one.

The housemaid came to the door and called him, and I saw him no more till he passed the window with a bundle; I saw him again at Worship-street.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the evening of the 14th of October, about twenty minutes past eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner and another at the back of the London Hospital, about a quarter of a mile from Mr. Reyburn's house - the prisoner had a bundle; I stopped him, and asked him what he had got: he said he had met another man who said that he was very tired, and wished him to carry the bundle for him - that he had never seen the man before, and did not know where to take it to. I took him to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a watchman - my beat is behind Mr. Deacon's premises. I saw the prisoner about two o'clock on Monday morning, at the back of Mr. Deacon's; he then went towards Mile End-road; I saw him again at three o'clock, in Sidney-street, about fifty yards from Mr. Deacon's, and about five I saw him again, with a basket on his shoulder, going towards Mr. Deacon's. I watched him, and saw him go into a twine ground, next<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182410280034"/>to Mr. Deacon's premises, and saw him putting something into the basket; I went and asked him what he had got - there were six sheets, a shirt, and a pewter wash-hand basin, and in his pocket was a curtain.</p>

He said he had made some enquiries, and would meet me there at seven o'clock that evening - I met him, and he asked if I had the box with me, I said No; he said</p>
               <p>"Come to-morrow at eleven o'clock, and there will be the valet of a French nobleman here, to whom I have spoken about it, and no doubt he will buy it." I went next day at a eleven o'clock, and we waited till half-past twelve - the prisoner and a companion of his were there; as the valet did not come the prisoner said</p>
               <p>"Let us go to his house," and we all three went together - after passing several streets, we came to a street, the name of which I do not know, but the officers does. The prisoner said</p>
               <p>"This is the hotel," pointing to a large building about fifty paces off; a young man passed by well dressed, and without a hat - the prisoner and his companion called out</p>
               <p>"That is the servant" - the prisoner called him and spoke to him in English; the servant said</p>
               <p>"My master is at breakfast, but wait gentlemen in that public-house," pointing to one at the side of the hotel. After we had been in the public-house a few minutes the servant came to us, and after having something to drink and some cursory conversation; the servant asked to have the box to show to his master - I asked the prisoner whether he was a person who might be trusted; the prisoner assured me that he was. I told him I would not take less than 15 l. for it; I then gave the box to the servant, and thought he would return to tell us when his master had done breakfast; in a few minutes the prisoner's companion went out, and soon after the prisoner went away - saying that he had occasion to go out. I remained waiting for him an hour, walking about and looking for him in the street; I was engaged till seven in the evening, making enquiries for him, but he never returned to the public-house, nor his companion, nor the valet. I have seen the companion in the street since, but not the servant. I then went to Bow-street, and got an officer to apprehend the prisoner - he was taken at halt-past nine o'clock that night. I desired him to tell me where the snuff-box was, or to give me the money for it, and I would forgive him; I have not seen it since.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long have you been in London - A. About eight months. I now live at a wine vaults in Windmill-street; I lived in King-street, Leicester-square for five weeks. I never desired the prisoner to write to a lady of the name of Thorpe; I left that house in King-street because my wife did not wish me to stay there, that was the only reason; there were many young ladies there, but no daughter of the lady of the house that I know of. I do not know the name of the lady of that house; I had been three days at an hotel, and eight days at another house - but I do not know the name of that landlady. I went from King-street to where I now live. The prisoner has written many letters for me at different times, to different ladies and gentlemen. I was not turned out of the house at King-street, on a charge of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182410280035"/>seducing a young woman; there was never such a charge brought against me. I had asked him to sell a watch; the box was only in his possession a few moments - I would not have trusted the box with the prisoner - I gave it to the servant because I had no reason for distrusting him, but clearly on the representation of the prisoner. I have shown the hotel to the officer.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. The prosecutor has shown me a public-house, which is the tap of Molloy's hotel in Bond-street, which is the place where he understood the French gentleman lived. I took the prisoner the same evening at a public-house at the corner of Grafton-street, and found this direction on him:</p>
               <p>"John Somerset, valet to the Hon. Mr. Thompson, Molloy's hotel, Bond-street." I have made enquiries there and found it to be false.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have known the prosecutor seven or eight months, and he employed me to write some letters for him; one was to Mrs. Thorpe, and another to her son, to know the reason why he was desired not to visit that house - the answer was he had disturbed the peace of the family - he then walked with me to Mrs. Shorter, and made me tell her exultingly that he had seduced her daughter, and he had got a ring and a snuff-box in his possession, which she had given him, and he would keep them. I then went into the country, and when I returned, he employed me to sell a box; the people laughed at us, because he wanted too much for it - we met again in the evening accidentally, and conversed on the subject; we met again the next morning in Newman-street, near Bond-street, and I saw a person who appeared to be a valet, and he asked me if I had not been trying to sell a snuffbox, I said I had - he said perhaps his master would buy it, and next morning we went there; we saw the pretended valet coming across the road; he said to us,</p>
               <p>"My master is at breakfast, go into the tap and wait there" - we did so, and the prosecutor gave the valet the box to take to his master, and he went away with it.</p>

            . I live in Wellington-street, Kings-land-road. I was at the corner of Caroline-street, between seven or eight o'clock on the evening of the 12th of October, and saw the two male prisoners coming up the road. I knew them by sight before. I saw Briggs get into a waggon on the opposite side of the way, near the Cherry-Tree. I then saw Carter get in - there was another person with them, who had got into the waggon before them, three different times; they were not all in at once, but one got in after the other got out. I saw Carter pulling at the luggage near the back of the waggon - I then saw one man standing with his back to the end of the waggon, and Briggs put a parcel on his back; the man brought it on to the other side of the way and walked on to Hare-walk. Carter and Briggs came with him - Carter had been standing at the end of the waggon while the parcel was getting out. I followed them to Playhouse-yard, which is more than a quarter of a mile from the Cherry-Tree; they took the goods into a house there - they had divided them into a butter flat, and a bag, in Hare-walk. I saw the two prisoners and the other person, whose name is Blackford, go into the house in Playhouse-yard, while myself, Taylor, and Archer were watching the prisoners in Hare-walk; the prisoner Carter said that if we did not tell he would give us 5 s. I said I did not want the money - he then said if we did not go away he would punch our heads; the goods were left in the house in Playhouse-yard. I did not see anybody there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What are you - A. I am a muffin baker. I know the neighbourhood of Hare-walk - they went down Turner-square to the King of Prussia walk, and from there to Hare-walk; I kept them in view all the time - it was between seven and eight o'clock in the evening; the till of the waggon was open behind; but I cannot tell whether it was up or not.</p>

            . I was with the last witness - I saw Blackford get into the waggon twice - he brought out nothing, but when he got in the third time I saw Carter and Briggs at the end of it. I had known them by seeing them about the road. When Blackford came out the third time, he had a hat on his head, and a bundle under his arm. Carter took the bundle from Blackford. Carter and Briggs then got into the waggon, and then came out again - Carter then went in by himself, and then Briggs got in and lifted a pile on to a young man's shoulder - he took it into Hare-walk. Carter, Briggs, and Blackford went with him. I followed them while they took it into a house. Carter came out with a bag, and then Briggs came out with a butter flat, and he went to Turner-square, and put it on his head, and cried out</p>

               <p>WILLIAM TAYLOR. I was with Wells and Archer at the corner of Caroline-place, between seven and eight o'clock. I saw the waggon, and saw Blackford go into it twice - he then went into it again, and brought out a bundle; I saw Carter and Briggs walking about the house - I then saw Briggs get into the waggon and then come out and go round to the back part of it - he opened the flap of the waggon and took out a large square thing, which he put on the shoulders of another man. Carter, Briggs, and the man with the load then went down Hare-walk; I followed them, but did not see them go into any house; I stood at the corner of the walk, and they soon came out with the things in a butter flat and some bags; I do not know where they got the butter flat from; they came round to the corner where I was - Briggs had the butter-flat, and put it on his head, and cried</p>
               <p>"Muscles." Carter went up Hoxton; I then saw them go into the house in Playhouse-yard. I heard them say they would give us 5 s. a piece if we did not tell, but I do not know what else was said: I did not follow them any farther, but went home and told my father of it, and he told the hostler at the Cherry Tree.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What trade are you - A. I work with my father, who is a bricklayer. I have known the prisoners by seeing them about the road before. I had heard Blackford's name because he used to go to a chair maker's by us.</p>

Johnson called Watch! Patrol! I followed Brown - some sailors came up the street, and they caught Brown; Hawes could not stop himself soon enough, but ran by him. Brown had the watch in his hand while I held him by the shoulder. I said to Hawes,</p>
               <p>"Look out, he has thrown the watch away." Hawes took it up.</p>

               <p>Prisoner BROWN. Q. Did you see the watch in my hand - A. Yes, I did. There were some sailors coming up the street, but only one was round me when I took you - there were a good many persons in the street.</p>

            . I live at Chichester, and did so in 1815. Messrs. Marsh, Sibbald, and Co. were my bankers. I had 5450 l. 3 per cent. Consols at that time - they received my dividends for me. I bought 100 l. more not long ago; I have received the dividends on 5450 l. upto that time, and since that time upon 5550 l. from Messrs. Marsh and Co. I never authorized them or anybody to sell 5000 l. of that stock; I never executed this instrument - (examining it) - it is not my hand-writing. I was not in town in May, 1815, but at Chichester.</p>

            , re-examined. Mr. Marsh generally went to the Bank to receive the bulk of the dividends; it is usual before they are received for an alphabetical list to be made of the sums and the dividends to be received - I believe Mr. Fauntleroy generally made out that list.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this, is it a list of the dividends to be received in July, 1824, upon Consols - A. It is, and it is endorsed</p>
               <p>"Three per cent. Consols, July 1824, Marsh, Stracey, and Co." The endorsement, and the whole list appear to be in the hand-writing of Mr. Fauntleroy, except the figures in red ink, which are made by the clerks at the Bank - the columns of names and sums are in Mr. Fauntleroy's hand-writing. Miss Young's name is towards the end of it, and the sum of 550 l. is placed opposite to her name. When Mr. Marsh receives the dividend warrants, he brings them home, and gives them, I believe, to Mr. Fauntleroy.</p>
               <p>Q. Who made out the account of sums received at the Bank - A. Mr. Fauntleroy made out part of it, and the rest is made out by the clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the day-book for July, 1824 - A. I have; it contains an account of dividends received in July, 1824; the first twenty-four items are in Mr. Fauntleroy's handwriting, and the rest is entered by a clerk; the 23d entry which is in Mr. Fauntleroy's writing, is as follow: - (reads.)</p>
               <p>"F. Young 5550 l. Consols, 83 l. 5. s" which is the half-yearly dividend purporting to be received. I have the day-book for July 1815 - here is an entry of Miss Young's dividend on 5450 l. - 73 l. 11 s. 6 d. in Mr. Fauntleroy's writing, with several other entries. I believe the property-tax is deducted. Here is an entry of the dividends received in January, 1816: the three first items are in Mr. Fauntleroy's writing, and the rest are by the clerk. Miss Young's dividend is entered for 5450 l., but not in Mr. Fauntleroy's writing; here is an entry for the same amount of F. Young's stock in July 1816, in Mr. Fauntleroy's writing and in January, 1817; the same dividend is entered on 5450 l. - 81 l. 15 s. in Mr. Fauntleroy's writing. In January, 1818, the same amount is entered in Mr. Fauntleroy's writing, and in July, the same sums in his writing also. In January, 1819, the same sum and dividend are entered in Mr. Fauntleroy's writing also, and in July, 1819, and in his writing. In January, 1820, the same sum and dividend are entered in the same hand-writing; and in July, the same sum and hand-writing; in January, 1821, and July, here are the same sums in the same hand-writing. In January and July, 1822, the same sums are entered in the same hand-writing; and in January, 1823, there is the same sum entered, and in Mr. Fauntleroy's hand-writing. In July, 1823, the dividend is entered upon 5550 l. 83 l. 5 s. in Mr. Fauntleroy's hand-writing; and in January, 1824, the same, and in his writing also.</p>
               <p>Q. Turn to the day-book of the 1st of June, 1815 - A. There is a sum of 2953 l. 2 s. 6 d. carried to the account of 
               <persName id="t18241028-97-person963">H. F. </persName>
            - (which I presume to be Mr. Fauntleroy) - it is in the hand-writing of Watson.</p>
               <p>Q. Now turn to the partners' private ledger, and look at the dates of June the 1st and 6th, there is an entry of the 6th of June, of one of the partners of 40 l. - A. Yes; it is Mr. Graham's writing - (reading) -</p>
               <p>"Ryan 40 l. June the 6th;" there appears to have been an erasure at the extremity of the page, but the full amount is carried out in the next item - here is an entry of the 1st of June on the same line, but after the 6th of June,</p>
               <p>"Cash 2953 l. 2 s. 6 d." - and in the extended line is 2993 l. 2 s. 6 d. - being the two sums added together, all the entry except</p>
               <p>"June the 6th, Ryan 40 l.," is in Mr. Fauntleroy's writing.</p>
               <p>Q. To whose credit does the whole of that line stand - Ryan's amount, and the whole of the identical sum - A. It stands to the account of 
               <persName id="t18241028-97-person964">

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. GURNEY. This sum is placed to Mr. Fauntleroy's private account - A. Yes; the sums placed to that private account are very large.</p>
               <p>Q. They amount in two pages to 50,000 l. - A. They may.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not these sums finally find their way into the funds of the banking house - A. I do not know; that rests with themselves. I cannot tell that these sums were ever drawn out by Mr. Fauntleroy for his private account, for Messrs. Martin and Co. were our bankers in the City - there were large transactions with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not every shilling of these monies applied to the funds of the banking-house - A. I do not know; the partners themselves can tell - but the clerks never had access to these books - it was customary to enter considerable sums to the initials of the partners.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not many of the sums through Martin's house placed to initials, or called Exchequer-bills account - A. No, we were ordered to make sums received to the initials of the partner's names in the day-book; that is all we know.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. As far as these books go, this sum is carried to the private account of the prisoner - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a police-officer of Malborough-street. On the 10th of September I apprehended the prisoner at the banking-house in Berner-street - he locked a desk which was in the room where I apprehended him after he knew what I came for; he locked it with a key which was suspended to his watch - I took the key from his watch in Malborough-street; I believe this to be it - (looking at it;) I delivered it to Mr. Freshfield - and in consequence of a message from Mr. Freshfield, I attended him at the banking-house, and searched the desk with Mr. Freshfield; it was opened with this key - there was a private drawer in the desk in which were some keys and some papers - I marked the papers after I brought them away - the prisoner was examined on the day - I kept the keys until after the examination, and then went to the banking-house, and found Mr. Freshfield there - he had two tin boxes in his possession; the name of Fauntleroy was on one of them - I do not know whether it was on the other. I tried them with the keys which I had found in the desk, and opened them with those keys - I locked the boxes again, and delivered the keys to Mr. Freshfield, who took the boxes away in a coach.</p>
               <p>MR. FRESHFIELD re-examined. On the day the prisoner was apprehended I went to the banking-house of Messrs. Marsh and Co., and made a search - I received a key from Plank, which opened a private desk; and in that desk we found some other keys. I returned to the banking-house after the examination, and in a room at the back, of what I understood to be called the partner's room; I saw several tin boxes - one had the name of Fauntleroy on it, which I took possession of - there was another, either upon or under that box, without any name. I desired Plank to try the keys to it, that I might not remove a box belonging to any other person; he tried one key which opened it; and finding from the first paper that there was no doubt it must be Mr. Fauntleroy's, I locked it up and took possession of it with the keys - and in the course of that night I examined the whole of the box with the name on it; and about half of the other - that with the name contained deeds, probates of wills, letters of administration, and other official documents; the other was a great variety of memorandums, diaries, and stock receipts, among which was the sale note for the stock in question; also a paper which I now produce - I marked it.</p>
               <p>MR. TYSON re-examined, (looking at the paper.) The whole of this is in Mr. Fauntleroy's hand-writing. When there is a sale of stock as a regular transaction the sale note is put on a file, and copied into a book by one of the partners.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury. - Overwhelmed as I am by the situation in which I am placed, and being uninformed in what manner I should answer the charges which have been alleged against me, I will endeavour to explain, as well as the poignancy of my feelings will enable me, the embarrassments of the Banking house, in which I have been for many years the active and only responsible partner, and which have alone led to the present investigation, and although I am aware I cannot expect to free myself from the obloquy brought upon me by my anxiety to preserve the credit and respectability of the firm, still I trust that an impartial narrative of the occurrences will obtain for me the commiseration of the well-disposed part of the community. Anticipating that the Court will extend its indulgence to me, I will respectfully submit such observations as I think will tend to remove from influenced minds those impressions, which with sorrow I say must have been made upon them by the cruel and illiberal manner in which the public prints have untruly detailed an history of my life and conduct; hoping, therefrom, I may deserve your compassion, although I may be unable to justify my proceedings, and secure my liberation, by a verdict of the Jury, yet they may be considered, in the mercy of the Court and a discerning public, as some extenuation of the crimes with which I stand arraigned. With this object it is necessary that I should first state, shortly, the circumstances under which I have been placed during my connexion with Marsh and Co. My father established the Banking-house in 1792, in conjunction with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182410280042"/>Mr. Marsh, and other gentlemen. Some of the partners retired in 1794, about which time a loss of 20,000 l. was sustained. Here commenced the difficulties of the house. In 1796, Mr. Stracey and another gentleman came into the firm, with little or no augmentation of capital. In 1800 l became a clerk in the house, and continued so six years, and although during that time I received no salary, the firm were so well satisfied with my attention and zeal for the interest and welfare of the establishment, that I was handsomely rewarded by them. In 1807 my father died; I then succeeded him; at this time I was only twenty-two years of age, and the whole weight of an extensive but needy Banking establishment at once devolved upon me, and I found the concern deeply involved in advances to builders and others which had rendered a system of discounting necessary, and which we were obliged to continue in consequence of the scarcity of money at that time, and the necessity of making further advances to those persons to secure the sums in which they stood indebted. In this perplexed state the house continued until 1810, when its embarrassments were greatly increased, owing to the bankruptcies of Brickwood and others, which brought upon it a sudden demand for no less a sum than 170,000 l. the greater part being for the amount of bills which our house had accepted and discounted for these parties, since become bankrupts. About 1814, 1815, and 1816, from the speculations with builders and brickmakers, &amp; others, in which the house was engaged, it was called upon to provide funds to near 100,000 l., to avert the losses which would otherwise have visited it from these speculations. In 1819, the most responsible of our partners died, and we were called upon to pay over the amount of his capital, although the resources of the house were wholly inadequate to meet so large a payment. During these numerous and trying difficulties the house was nearly without resources, and the whole burthen of management falling upon me, I was driven to a state of distraction, in which I could meet with no relief from my partners, and, almost broken-hearted, I sought resources where I could, and so long as they were provided, and the credit of the house supported, no inquiries were made, either as to the manner in which they were procured, or as to the sources from whence they were derived. In the midst of these calamities, not unknown to Mr. Stracey, he quitted England, and continued in France, on his own private business, for two years, leaving me to struggle as well as I could with difficulties almost insurmountable. Having thus exposed all the necessities of the house, I declare that all the monies temporarily raised by me, were applied, not in one instance for my own separate purposes or expenses, but in every case they were immediately placed to the credit of the house in Berners-street, and applied to the payment of the pressing demands upon it. This fact does not rest on my assertion, as the transactions referred to are entered in the books now in the possession of the assignees, and to which I have had no access since my apprehension. These books, I understand, are now in Court, and will confirm the truth of my statement; and to whatever account all the sums may be entered, whether to that of Stock, of Exchequer Bills, or to my private account, the whole went to the general funds of the Banking-house. I alone have been doomed to suffer the stigma of all the transaction; but, tortured as I have been, it now becomes an imperative duty to explain to you, Gentlemen, and through you to the world at large, that the vile accusations heaped upon me, (known to be utterly false by all those who are best acquainted with my private life and habits,) have been so heaped upon me for the purpose of loading me with the whole of the obloquy of those transactions, from which, and from which alone my partners were preserved from bankruptcy. I have been accused of crimes I never even contemplated, and of acts of profligacy I never committed; and I appear at this Bar with every prejudice against me, and almost prejudged. To suit the purposes of the persons to whom I allude, I have been represented as a man of prodigal extravagance; prodigal indeed I must have been, had I expended those large sums which will hereafter be proved to have gone exclusively to support the credit of a tottering firm, the miseries of which were greatly accelerated by the drafts of two of its members to the amount of near 100,000 l. I maintained but two establishments, one at Brighton, where my mother and my sister resided in the season - the expenses of which to me, exclusive of wine, were within 400 l. per annum. One at Lambeth, where my two children lived, from its very nature, private and inexpensive, to which I resorted for retirement, after many a day passed in devising means to avert the embarrassments of the Banking-house. The dwelling-house in Berners-street belonged solely to my mother, with the exception of a library and a single bed-room. This was the extent of my expenditure, so far as domestic expenditure is concerned. I am next accused of being an habitual gambler, an accusation which, if true, might easily account for the diffusion of the property. I am indeed a member of two clubs, the Albion, and the Stratford, but never in my life did I play in either, at cards or dice, or any game of chance; this is well known to the gentlemen of these clubs - and my private friends with whom I more intimately associated, can equally assert my freedom from all habit or disposition to play. It has been as cruelly asserted that I fraudulently invested money in the funds to answer the payment of annuities, amounting to 2,200 l. settled upon females. I never did make any such investment; neither at home or abroad, in any funds whatever, have I any investment; nor is there one shilling secretly deposited by me in the hands of any human being. Equally ungenerous, and equally untrue it is, to charge me with having lent too loose and disorderly persons large sums which never have, and never will be repaid. I lent no sums, but to a very trifling amount, and those were advanced to valued friends. I can, therefore, at this solemn moment, declare most fervently, that I never had any advantage beyond that in which all my partners participated, in any of the transactions which are now questioned. They indeed have considered themselves as partners only in the profits, and I am to be burthened with the whole of the approbrium, that others may consider them as the victims of my extravagance. I make this statement, not with a view to criminate others, or to exculpate myself; but borne down as I am by calamity, I will not consent to be held out to the world as a cold blooded and abandoned profligate, ruining all around me for the selfish gratification of vice and sensuality, and involving even my confiding partners in the general destruction. Gentlemen, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182410280043"/>have frailties and errors enough to account for. I have sufferings enough past, present, and in prospect, and if my life were all that was required of me, I might endure in silence, though I will not endure the odium on my memory, of having sinned to pamper delinquencies to which I never was addicted. Thus much has been extorted from me by the fabrications which have been cruelly spread amongst the public; that very public, from whom the arbiters of my fate were to be selected. Perhaps, however, I ought to thank the enemy who besieged the prison with his slanders - that he did so whilst my life was spared to refute them, and that he waited not until the grave to which he would hurry me had closed at once on my answer and my forgiveness. There is one subject more connected with these charges to which I am compelled to advert, and I do so with great reluctance. It is added to the other charges made against me, lest the world should think there was any vice in which I was not an adept. I have been accused of acting treacherously towards the female who now bears my name, having refused to make reparation until threatened by her brother, and of having deserted her at a moment when she had the greatest claim on my protection. Delicacy forbids me entering into an explanation on this subject further than to declare, that the conduct I adopted on that occasion was uninfluenced by the interference of any individual, and arose, as I then considered, and do still consider, from a laudable and honourable feeling on my part; and the lady's brother, so far from coming forward at the time alluded to, was on his passage to the West Indies. Could all the circumstances be exposed, I feel convinced that every liberal-minded man would applaud my determination, and I feel satisfaction in stating, that the lady in question has always been, and still is actuated by the best of feelings towards me. I have now only to apologize to the Court for having entered so much at length into the statement of my unfortunate case, and in conclusion I have to express my perfect confidence, that it will receive every favourable consideration at your hands; and I fully rely that you, Gentlemen of the Jury, will give an impartial and merciful decision.</p>

On Sunday the 3d of October, he came about eight o'clock and breakfasted with me. I went out about a quarter to nine to get shaved, leaving him in the room, and my property all safe. I expected to find him still there, as he said he would wait; but on returning about ten I found him gone; my box was broken open and two coats, a pair of trowsers, a pair of shoes, stockings, a snuffbox, two shirts, two curtains, and a silver medal of King William gone. I found a knife of mine and a small bar close by the box - I had left it by the fire-side, as I use it for a poker. I found some of the property in pawn. I could not replace my property for 4 l. - it was well worth that.</p>

            . I live in Dyer's-buildings, Holborn. On the 2d of October, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, I met the prisoner at the bottom of Chancery-lane; she asked if I was going home; I said, Yes, and suffered her to have my arm as far as Castle-street. I refused to go home with her. She left me suddenly. I put my hand to my watch pocket, and found I was robbed of this money. I found her at the end of Barlett's-buildings - she wished to get away. I gave her in charge, and in her stocking the two sovereigns and a half were found - the half-sovereign was quite new, which I had observed before.</p>

On the 16th of October, at a quarter past three o'clock, I stopped the prisoner in Barbican, with this package on his shoulder - he said he had brought it from Newgate-market, and was taking it to Mr. Flax, of Whitecross-street - that a waggoner had employed him to carry it, and I might go and see if it was not right, but I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he not say that if you went he would shew you the man who sent him - A. Yes - Mr. Flax.</p>

            . I am a weaver. I live near Taylor, who lives at Bethnal-green. Nichols lives in George-street; I have known them ten years - I met Taylor by my own gate about eleven o'clock one morning last year - I cannot tell the month. - he said Nichols was coming with a seal, and they were going to Masters with it to sell. Nichols came up and produced a seal - they went together to Masters, who is a weaver, and called him out - I went with them; the seal had some letters on it; but I cannot tell what they were - I believe it was a gold seal - I believe they asked 25 s. for it. Masters said to me,</p>
               <p>"Do you think it worth the money" - I said</p>
               <p>"If it is a good one it is" - he did not buy it, and they went towards Brick-lane, to pawn it. I do not know whether they did or no. I was with Taylor about a week after in Bethnal-green road - a gentleman passed by, and Taylor said, that was the person they had flimped the other night; he did not say of what.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Have you had any quarrel with Nichols lately, and had him apprehended - A. Yes, about three weeks ago, for an assault - this conversation took place last year; I mentioned it at the office when he was taken up for the assault - I had mentioned it to Mr. Simmond the clerk, at the Thames Police-office, at the time of the robbery. I have myself been charged with a highway-robbery, in 1819, and acquitted.</p>

               <p>"Charles, do you want to buy a seal" I said why - he said, he had one to dispose of for a man in distress - he did not shew it to me; nor did I buy it. I went out after I had done my work, and Clayton came to me and said -</p>
               <p>"What a fool you was not to buy that seal." Clayton has since told me that these men were innocent, and wanted me to swear false - he said he was sorry for what he had done, and wished me to agree in the same story to save himself.</p>

I had a bad cold, and she asked me what was the matter, and said if I would go with her she would get me some stuff that would do me good in twenty-four hours - we went out to another public-house - I took out my purse, and it had a hole in it - she said</p>
               <p>"Give me your purse and I will stick a pin in it" - she took it, and I turned round and said</p>
               <p>"I have lost a bundle from my side" she then took up my money, and put two shillings and two sixpences into the purse - wrapped it up, and said</p>
               <p>"There is your purse, take care of it," we went out, and she said</p>
               <p>"We will find the bundle in two minutes;" I lost sight of her in about one minute.</p>

The prisoner was in my service about three months - in consequence of the disappearance of some articles about the 5th or 6th of October, I expressed my suspicions to her - she offered to have her box and drawers searched my sister searched them in my presence; I can positively state that some of the things found are mine; the handkerchief I had had in wear; the ring is one my wife had worn. This curtain and this handkerchief were taken from her box - and the other things from her person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. When did she come into your service - A. About July; my wife died on the 18th of last month. I cannot say at what time I had seen the things previous to their being found; she had the care of the things; I do not know that Mrs. Desermeaux did not give them to her; they are but of trifling value.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's sister. I missed a small parcel of linen, which I enquired about; the prisoner said she knew nothing of it, but owned that she had seen it in the room where I had placed it. The box which was searched was in the prisoner's own room. Mrs. Desermeaux had then been dead a week or ten days, and during her illness the prisoner had to go to every drawer and place in the house. She offered to shew me her box if I suspected her; I believe the box had been locked, but she opened it, and took up the things very quickly; I then put my hand into the box, and felt three bottles of wine, which she said her father had sent her - I left them in the box. I then found a towel with the mark cut out, and a pocket handkerchief marked D., which had not been used since it was washed - it was tumbled; I believe it to be Mr. Desemeaux's; and in her drawer I found a muslin curtain, quite clean, and upon looking over my brother's curtains I missed one. I found a pair of stockings with the mark D. picked out; an ear-ring, which was Mrs. Desermeax's - a garnet ring, and a necklace, which I believe were her's and a broach, but of that I cannot be certain; there was some money found. When the officer searched her he asked whose the garnet ring was; she said her master's, and so were the broach and necklace; the petticoat she said was her own, but in taking one of my sister's out of the drawer it was precisely like it, and very different to the way in which a servant would have them made; she gave no reason for keeping the things about her person, but appeared much confused.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you present when she said the things were her master's - A. Yes. I did not say I would not prosecute her if she told the truth.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner. I found the petticoat which Miss Desermeaux claimed in the box - the prisoner said nothing about that; I then searched her person, and found the ring, brooch, and necklace; the ear-ring had been found before I got there; these things were loose in her pocket. I asked the prisoner whose they were - she said her master's. They were all female ornaments - I found 23 s. on her person, which she said was her master's.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The linen I had had two years; it was given to me by a young woman whom I kept company with; the handkerchief my mother gave me. The broach and necklace were not in the box; the handkerchief and curtain were taken into my room, because they were wet. Miss Desermeaux told me she would forgive me if I told all - I said I never stole anything.</p>

On Sunday, the 17th of October, I opened the parlour windows; they were open till the afternoon - a shower came on about four o'clock, and I went and shut them; I then went down to the house keeper's room under the parlour, and while there I heard a noise in the parlour; the windows were closed, but not bolted; my brother was with me, and I said to him,</p>
               <p>"That sounds like somebody over our heads, we will go and see, and shut the shutters" - we went to the stairs, and I heard the street door slam, as if somebody was going out; I am sure the street door had been locked. When I got to the parlour the door was wide<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182410280048"/>open; I had shut it when I went down, about an hour before - I looked at the windows, the sash and the blinds were then open, and a chair stood under the window, with wet footmarks upon it; an oil painting had been taken from a little recess. A chair had been moved to the sideboard, to enable a person to get it down. I went all over the house, but found no person, nor anything more gone. I have seen the frame of the picture since, at our house, when it was brought by the officer - as soon as I saw the frame I thought it the frame of that picture. I have lived there five or six years, and have dusted the picture and looked at them very often.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Monday, the 18th of October, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I went to St. Giles's, after some persons, and on going up Bainbridge-street in a court on looking over a window shutter, the two prisoners, sitting in a room; I tried the door, and it was locked - I told them to open it, and they did so; there was no other person in the room. I observed this picture frame concealed under the bed: I questioned them concerning it, and they said they knew nothing about it. I asked if they lived there: they denied that at first, but Jones afterwards acknowledged that he lived there. Conley said he came in with a girl to drink tea with Jones; the tea things were set for two persons only. Jones was behind the door, and had got his coat off; he said he had been changing his shirt. I took them to the office, and took the frame to Mr. Sturt's house on the Friday following; I saw the mark where the frame had hung on the wall; it fitted exactly - I looked at it very attentively for ten minutes. The moment I took it to the house the last witness said that was the frame of her master's picture.</p>

I asked Conley what he knew about the pictures - he said nothing; I then desired him and Jones to pull off their shoes, which I took to Mr. Sturt's, and they exactly corresponded with the marks of feet in the house.

He was taken last Monday when I met him in the street; he had said he lived in White Horse-court, Chick-lane, but we could not find him there.</p>

            . I am a ham and tongue dealer, and live next door to Mr. Fenwick's. I saw the two prisoners near the door about a quarter before nine o'clock<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182410280049"/>that morning in company with two others. I watched them, and saw Murrell in the act of wrapping up the piece of print under his apron. I did not see Davis at that time, but I had seen him a quarter of an hour before. I let Murrell run about thirty yards, and then pursued - he dropped the print. I followed him and took him - there was another with him, but I could not identify him - he got away; a strange woman picked up the print.</p>

I saw Davis going along on the other side of the way, at a very quick pace, about three hundred yards from the shop - Murrell was then detained in the shop; we stopped Davis - he was very saucy, and said he would bring an action against my partner. Ranwell spoke to his having been at the shop.</p>

            . I live at Worthing, near Guildford, about thirteen miles from Sunbury, and am a poulterer. I have a turkey poult, which I bought on the 6th of October, in Chertsey-market; I bought seven chickens at the same time of the prisoner; I gave 7 s. for the chickens, and 1 s. 6 d. for the turkey - I thought he did not come honestly by them, and had him detained, but the Magistrates let him go, because there was no owner for them. I killed the chickens, and sent them to Leadenhall-market; the turkey I kept alive. He said be came from Ashford, but he could not tell the name of any person who lived there, nor the sign of the public-house where he had been.</p>

               <p>"I will tell you the truth," he then said that he had taken them from his maste, Messrs. Williams, at different times.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did he tell you who his masters were - A. Yes. He was not offering the nails for sale - there were three or four customers in the shop.</p>

The prisoners were not in the room when I went to bed; but I found them there in the morning - they had got locked up - I asked the watch-house keeper's wife whether I had left my money below or not - one of them is a hackney-coachman, and he was taken to the watch-house with his day's earnings as well as I with mine.</p>

            . I am the watch-house keeper. Morgan and the other man were brought in, charged by each other. Morgan was in liquor but not very drunk - he had a quantity of silver in his possession, and he offered to deposit to the amount of a guinea for his bail - the room he slept in was through my own bed-room. I saw him turn out his silver when he gave me the sixpence, I gave him back a 1 s. - he went to bed about twelve o'clock. The prisoners came in about a quarter past one o'clock, for furiously driving, and knocking a gentleman down - they wanted a bed; I said I could let them have half a bed, and they might accommodate each other - they then went into the room where the prosecutor was, and I locked them in. I did not hear of the loss of the money until about one o'clock, when my wife told me of it; the prosecutor had not then accused any person of it. The prisoners were charged with it about three o'clock, and denied it - when the prosecutor came out of his bed-room they came down with him; there were four or five other persons there; I was present when the prisoners were searched - there was 8 s. 6 d. found on each of them; one of them had two half-crowns, and the other shillings and sixpences.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your wife is not here - A. No. I am constantly at the watch-house; the constable of the night takes down the charges - I am his deputy.</p>

            . I was the constable of the night. I saw the prosecutor brought in with another man; they appeared to me to be both drunk; when he had been there an hour he said he would send for bail; I said</p>
               <p>"I dare say they are in bed" - he then offered a guinea for his bail; I said I could not take it - he then pulled out some money, and asked for a bed - I cannot say how much he had; I did not hear of the robbery till three or four o'clock in the afternoon. I think there were six males and three females in charge that night; they were in separate places, and did not mix at all. I went down and searched the two prisoners - I found 8 s. 6 d. on each of them; one of them had two half-crowns.</p>
               <p>EVANS'S Defence. The prosecutor about the middle of the day said he had left some money with the wife of the watch-house keeper; she said it was all safe if he had; that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>BERRY'S Defence. He had but half a bed, and I went into the room where the prosecutor was in bed, drunk and asleep; he said the next day that he had left his money with the watch-house keeper; I had taken a sovereign of my master, and it cannot be wondered at that I had 8 s. 6 d.</p>

On the 4th of October, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner in the shop with two others; they asked to look at a silk hat; I showed one to one of his companions - it did not fit him; I put that into the window, and went to the back of the shop for another; the hat was within reach of either of them - when I came back the prisoner was gone, and his two companions had removed from the window; they then bought a hat, and paid for it. I went to put away the hats afterwards and missed the one I had put into the window; there was no other person there at the time. I looked about, and saw an old hat at the end of the counter. I then went down White-cross-st. - and on coming back I looked up Playhouse-yard, and saw the two persons who had come with the prisoner, just turning into Golden-lane; I watched them into a court; and then lost sight of them. I got an officer, and saw the prisoner in about five minutes afterwards, in another court in Golden-lane, with the hat on his head; he said he had bought it of a Jew that morning, and had given his own in exchange, and 10 s. I am quite certain that it is mine; it has our private mark in it.</p>

I saw the prisoner in the passage of the house while the men were at dinner; he was coming out, but returned into the room, and stood close against the wall.

I know he is the same man. I had an umbrella, a cloak, and a parcel; the umbrella and cloak were taken out of the coach, but the parcel was left in - it contained the silk in question. I missed it in about five minutes after I got home. I went to the first coach-stand, and in a quarter of an hour, found the prisoner on the stand in Theobald's-road - he had just got on the stand. I asked if had put me down in Devonshire-street - he said Yes. I said</p>
               <p>"I left a parcel in your coach;" he said</p>
               <p>"If you did, it is there now, for I have not taken any one up since - you had better look into the coach;" he himself looked in and said</p>
               <p>"There is not parcel there;" a friend (who was with me) then got into the coach, but there was nothing there; the prisoner then said</p>
               <p>"You had better look into the pocket," which I did not, because I knew it was not there; he said</p>
               <p>"If it is not in the coach you must have dropt it on getting into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182410280053"/>the coach." I said I was confident I did not; the officer Thompson then came up and searched the inside of the coach, and said he did not see it, but he would look in another part of the coach.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know where these silks were got - A. No; they came from Exeter to me; upon my oath they are not French silks. I gave the parcel into the hands of my friend when I got into the coach.</p>

               <p>"Get me a light," and one of the watchmen got me one. I got up to the boot, and the prisoner got up on the opposite side, and attempted to cover the parcel which was in the boot with hay. I told Dodd to take him into custody - he did so.

               <p>"Have you got all;" he said Yes. I went to the stand, and then they came and asked me if there was a parcel inside the coach; I said, not that I knew of, but they might look into the coach and see, themselves; they got in, and when the lady got out, she said her father would be very angry if she did not find it; she described the parcel, and I went to get it from the boot, when the officer came and seized it out of my hand.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. I produce a watch which I received from a person answering the description of the prisoner. I firmly believe him to be the person - it was pawned on the 20th of October for 1 l., in the name of East; on the Tuesday following, the prisoner came and asked me if I had taken a watch in - I fetched it down, and said I had - he came the next day with an officer, and said his name was Stribling; he then denied<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182410280054"/>that he was the man who had pawned it. I have no doubt that he was the person.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL EAST. I keep the Green Man public-house. I saw this young man come in with two others, at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 17th of October; they called for a supper, and the prosecutor fell asleep; when he awoke he missed his watch; he was not sober; the prisoner appeared perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>J - OSBORN. Last Sunday week I went into the Green Man. I saw the prosecutor take the watch out of his pocket, and give it to the prisoner to see what it was o'clock - he fell asleep afterwards, and what became of the watch I do not know.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 28th of September I searched three boxes, which Mrs. Backler pointed out to me; the prisoner was present; and before I searched them, I asked her if she knew anything of a diamond pin, and a locket which were lost; she denied it at first, and then said she had found the pin, but knew nothing of the locket; she went up stairs with us, one of her trunks was open, and another locked; the third was a small tea chest. I found two stiffners in her pocket; in the open trunk was the trimming, and several things, and in the other trunk several caps and articles of linen; and in her tea chest, I found the diamond pin - she said she knew it was in some of her boxes, but could not tell which. I forget whether the tea chest was locked. I went to Murphy's house with a warrant, and found a waistcoat, a petticoat, and other things; she was not at home, but her husband was. I afterwards saw her, and she said she had bought them of different people in the street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You do not know that to be a diamond pin - A. I am told that it is.</p>

            . I lived at the prosecutor's house. This diamond pin and locket are mine, and the waistcoat. I missed the pin and locket on the 27th of September; I had seen them two or three days before, and had left them in a box unlocked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are there any children in the house - A. Yes, one of them is twelve years old. I had put the property among some fishing tackle.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long had you lived there - A. Three years. I wore the pin every day; the prisoner must have known it to be mine. I paid 13 l. for it about six months ago, to Mr. Fletcher, a lapidary, of Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>MRS. BACKLER. Two of the trunks belonged to her; some of the property was in them, and some in one which I had lent her, having had an accident with hers, and sent it to be repaired - the tea chest belonged to her, and was locked. and she produced the key of it after some hesitation.</p>
               <p>MR. PELLATT re-examined. I have tried the pin, and know it to be a diamond.</p>

            . I am a shopman to Mr. Aldridge, pawnbroker, Orange-street, Bloomsbury. On the 21st of October, about half-past six or seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner brought this cloak to our shop - ! asked where he got it, he said, from Mr. Jones, of No. 10, Lamb's Conduit-street. I am confident of his person - I communicated my suspicions privately to Mr. Aldridge, who came out and questioned him, and asked if he had any objection to his going with him, he said</p>
               <p>"Oh! it is all right." Mr. Aldridge said," I do not think it is, and you shall go;" he immediately darted out of the box and ran away. I pursued and overtook him at the corner of Theobalds-road; he said</p>
               <p>"There is no occasion to trouble you about this, let this lad (meaning my apprentice) go with me." I said</p>
               <p>"Very well let the boy go;" but I followed at a distance; he went in a contrary direction, and took him up a court; he then began to run - I followed; he went up a ladder, but finding himself closely pursued came down and ran into Holborn, where I collared him, and gave him in charge - I am certain he is the man. I only lost sight of him in turning the corner; he had asked for 1 l. on the cloak, and said</p>
               <p>"Is it worth that." I said Yes, more; he said</p>
               <p>"Well, give me 2 l." I thought it worth between 7 l. and 10 l., but understand it is only worth 6 l. I would have lent 4 l. on it.</p>

            . It is mine, and is quite new - it cost me five guineas - I should have asked 6 l. or six guineas for it. I have enquired about the prisoner, and believe he is rather weak in intellect. I know his father well, and have learned that when nine years old, a fall from a horse affected him very seriously, and he has been able to learn nothing. I understand he is the dupe of a gang of rogues who set him to plunder shops, while they share the profit of it. I believe he really is weak in intellect; his father who has seven children does not wish him to be at liberty.</p>

            . I am messenger at the War-office. I have seen the prisoner five or six times at the office; she came there respecting money, which she said was due to her at the decease of her father; she generally remained in the waiting room, and was there on the 21st of October; soon after one o'clock she came in, and asked if her business was likely to be settled - I said I would go and ask. I returned and told her she might call again in a few days, she cried, and wanted to call again the same day; she retired, and I thought she was gone, but one of the messengers came in afterwards, and I found she was not gone. I went into a room opposite to Mr. Feild's, and on coming out, I saw her standing against the door post of Mr. Feild's room, the door was partly open - this was ten minutes after I had given her an answer; I told her it was of no use to wait. I went away, and in about an hour heard of this watch being missed.</p>

I asked where she got it: she said a captain had given it to her - I asked what there was in her face to induce a captain to give it to her; she said she was an unfortunate girl.

I cannot say how the window was the night before. I lost a blue coat and a cambric handkerchief; the coat hung over a chair the night before.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Little Pulteney-street. On the 8th of October, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, I was at work (one Phillips rents my shop and parlour); I heard a knock, looked out of the garret window, and saw a person standing at the door with a bundle under his arm; I heard the knock again, and then heard a disturbance in my passage - I ran down, and saw Cook in the custody of Yates, who had two bundles. I never saw him before.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 8th of October, about twenty minutes past six o'clock in the morning, I was at the corner of Wardour-street, and saw Cook and another man, (whom I cannot swear to) coming up Little Pulteney-street; they each had a bundle. I crossed over to the corner of a court to watch them, and saw them go in at Frost's private door; I followed, and picked up a pen-knife which Cook dropped; I then shut the door, and collared him with a bundle in his hand; the other made his escape, leaving his bundle behind. I asked Phillips to assist me, but he would not. Cook said a man gave him 2 1/4 d. in the Haymarket to carry the bundle for him. In the pocket of one of the waistcoats I found some cards, by which I found out Mr. Hople.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Which of the two went in first - A. The other man; he did not say that was the man who had given him the 2 1/4 d.; he said he should know the man again.</p>

The man escaped.</p>

            . I live at Barton, near Manchester. On the 28th of October, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I met the prisoner and another girl in Fleet-street, and went with them to a house in <placeName id="t18241028-147-crimeloc787">Shire-lane</placeName>

I then locked the door, and remained all night with the prisoner. I put the key of the door into my trowsers pocket; at that time I had my watch safe; I put it into my trowsers pocket - my trowsers hung over a chair. I got up about nine o'clock, and found the door unlocked, but bolted inside. I went near the door, and the prisoner said the key was in the window, I replied</p>
               <p>"No, it is in my pocket, I put it there last night." I found one key in the window, and one still in my pocket. I missed my watch and handkerchief. I went to the bed and told the prisoner she had stolen my watch - she denied it, and said</p>
               <p>"I do not believe you had a watch," and insisted upon sending for the officers to search the house, and was very violent about it. I said if she would give it me back I did not mind giving her a few pounds; she said if I gave her one thousand pounds she had not got it;' and if I had lost it, the other girl must have taken it. I said as she knew the other girl, she had better look after her; she said she had never seen her before; but afterwards that she believed her name was Arnold, and that she lived in James-street, Blackfriars-road, but it was useless looking for her, for by that time she had either pawned or sold it. I said if it was pawned, she could get me the duplicate; she went out about ten o'clock with the landlady, to look for her, and about four o'clock brought me the duplicate of the watch, pawned at Wassell's, in Picket-street; the pawnbroker at first denied having it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were you perfectly sober - A. I dined out and was rather fresh, but certainly not tipsy; we had only drank two bottles of wine among four of us. I did not bolt the door myself.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you awoke at all by her getting out of bed - A. No; there is a key hole outside the door.</p>
               <p>STANDLEY CROWDER. I am an apprentice to Mr. Wassell, pawnbroker, Picket-street. On Friday last about two o'clock in the afternoon, I received a gold watch, two gold seals, a key, and a ring in pawn, from a man in the name of H. Palmer, No. 22, Lincoln's Inn; I did not see the prisoner.</p>

            , whose maiden name was Cooper. I first became acquainted with the defendant at Stowmarket fair, on the 12th of July, and saw him again on the 15th of August, but not between those times. I was often with my sister and never saw them together, except at those times. I never saw him at my mother's house. On Sunday afternoon, the 15th of August, I and my sister went to church; it was a rainy day; we were dressed in white muslin; we saw the defendant in the church-yard, while we were at church, and in a quarter of an hour we came out of church, we were walking in the fields, not going home; he came after us, and walked a little way in the fields, and it rained so fast that we turned back, and went into Mrs. Jarr's cottage; we had come out of church? between three and four o'clock - we sent for dry gowns to put on, and staid in the cottage, in the defendant's company, till about seven o'clock or later; it was getting dark. Before we left the cottage he went out, and returned in an hour: I do not know that he said anything to my sister, but she and him went out: I had heard no proposition made to her; we came out and walked a little way, and then saw a post chaise in the lane - I expected to see a pony and gig, not a post chaise. I saw my sister cry before she got into the chaise, but did not hear anything said to her.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she to get in - A. He helped her in; he took hold of her arm, and the post-boy took hold of her arm too; they were close to the chaise when they took hold of her arm, to help her in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she willing to go in with their help - A. No, I do not think that she was. I was in the chaise afterwards - it drove to Ipswich; there were four of us in the chaise; they told us that they would not take us any farther than Stowmarket; we had an elder sister living there. Catherine wanted them to stop to see her sister, but the post-boy was told to drive on faster, and he drove to Ipswich - we got there between nine and ten o'clock - the defendant had a pistol, and said if any one came to the chaise to stop the horses, or meddle with us he would shoot them - we did not stop at Ipswich longer than a quarter of an hour. A coach came up which was going to London, and we were put on the roof of it. I sat next to my sister, and the defendant sat on the opposite side. We had no clothes but what were on our backs. We had no idea of going to town when we got into the chaise. The defendant carried the pistol to London with him; it was loaded. We arrived at the White Horse, Fetter-lane, about nine o'clock in the morning, and then went to the Bell and Crown, Holborn; went to church next day, and my sister was married to the defendant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley addressed the Jury on behalf of the defendant; and called several witnesses who deposed to his good character.</p>

            . About two o'clock in the afternoon of the 12th of October, I was in my room at Temple-mills, Hackney-marsh, and saw the two prisoners and another boy (I am certain of the persons of the prisoners,) they were going along in the water - Over had a basket on his left shoulder. I went down, and called them; they then went on faster. I went to get my horse out of the shed, and on casting my eyes round I saw Over throw something out of the basket into the water. I pursued them on horse back; Over threw down the basket, and ran away with Taylor, and the other went in another direction. I followed then about two hundred yards further, and then they got into an old building; I got off my horse, and and found them concealed in the fire-place. Over said,</p>

               <p>"I have got nothing:" I said,</p>
               <p>"You must go and find what you threw into the water;" he said,</p>
               <p>"We will." - Taylor said nothing, but when we got to the water he asked me to let him go, and he would go quietly. When we got to the spot where the chains were, Over put his hand into the water, and drew out four chains. Taylor then said,</p>
               <p>"Here are some more chains," and drew out five chains, two bolts, and a nut. I know the property to be my master's; they had been left in a barn.</p>

               <p>TAYLOR'S Defence. We were going blackberrying, and met a boy with the basket - he said he would go with us; when we saw that the water was so high, we went back into a yard, and the lady said,</p>
               <p>"You had better go into the shed out of the rain." That boy put the chains into the basket, and gave it to Over. We went on together; he then said,</p>
               <p>"The man is coming, you had better throw them into the water."</p>

            . I am book carrier to Messrs. Pickford's. I drove the waggon on that evening to Iron-gate Wharf, in the City. I went down the Minories, and when I got to the wharf, I discovered that the bale had been cut; there appeared a large hole and something out of it. I brought it back and saw it weighed the next morning - it weighed 13 lbs. less. I saw one of the parcels weighed the next morning, which weighed 6 1/2 lbs.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police Surveyor; about seven o'clock on the evening of the 7th of October, I met the two prisoner on Tower-hill. I stopped Jones with a parcel of worsted yarn wrapped up in his apron. I asked him how he got it - Neal had a bundle likewise; they said they had brought it from over the water, from a person of the name of Watts. I asked if they had a bill of parcels; they said No. 4 said I should take them to the watch-house. I look Jones, and Fogg took Neal; they said they were going to take the yarn to Mr. Sims, Cow-lane, Mile-end. I went over the water, but could find no such person as Watts.</p>

               <p>"I have been here this hour, have not I maser;" Wolfe said</p>
               <p>"No, I know nothing at all about you;" I took the parcel which contained woollen cloth, and shawls, and found this invoice in the bale with the goods; they exactly corresponded with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Abrahams was the person with the package - A. Yes. Wolfe and Wheeler were not in the same room as he was. Wheeler had a white jacket on.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner on Monday morning, the 25th of October, in Brown's-lane, Spitalfields, about a mile and a half from the prosecutrix's shop; he had the desk on his shoulder - another boy was with him who made his escape; seeing the desk about an inch open, I asked where he brought it from - he said from his father, who was a little broker at Bethnal-green, and the desk had been left with him to sell it. I enquired, but could not find his father; he said it was to be taken into the City, and he was to wait in Spitalfields-market for his father, at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182410280062"/>steps of a door. I took him into a house, examined the desk, and found some papers which led to the discovery; when I read the papers he began to cry, and said he was to have two-pence for carrying it for the other boy, and what he had said about his father was false; there were four shillings in it.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met a young chap in Brick-lane, and he said if I would carry this box, he would give me a few halfpence; while we were going along the officer stopped us, and he ran away; and said if any body said anything, I was to tell them I carried it for my father.</p>

I saw the prisoner on the Friday morning at Mrs. Lloyd's; he was then shutting the back door of a room behind the shop - I looked round, but could not see anything except some horse-hair in the scale, where Mrs. Lloyd was standing - no other person was in the shop. I made an excuse and came out. I did not open the room door - in the evening I heard of Mr. Street's robbery. I went on the Saturday to Mary-le-bone office, and met the prisoner on the Kilburn-road. I said he must come with me, and asked him where the remainder of the horse-hair was; he said</p>

               <p>"I have sold all I had." I came on with him, and sent him on by Webster to the office. I went to the office and got a search warrant, and went with Stowel to Mrs. Lloyd's house and there we found some hair in a bag, which exactly corresponded with some that was given me as a pattern, which had been picked up; they appeared to be one and the same; the hair in the cushion cover was of the same colour as the bundle of hair.</p>

            . I live at No. 48, Lisson-street, Mary-le-bone, and deal in Marine-stores. I bought 1 1/2 lb. of old horse-hair of the prisoner for 9 d.; he said</p>
               <p>"I have picked up a bit of horse-hair, is it good for anything." I have seen him before, for my bricklayer had employed him to empty a well. I weighed the horse-hair, and the officer saw it in the scale; the prisoner never went into any room or cupboard; the officer is wrong about that - I think this is the same hair.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How can you swear that it is the same horsehair - A. I never did swear to it. I put the hair into a bag outside the door; I bought some more hair the same day; there came in a large chair-bottom of grey hair afterwards.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 14th of October, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I and Hesketh were in London-wall; I saw a confusion with some people, and a man crossing the road; I ran after him, and when I got hold of him, I saw the prisoner about thirty yards before me, walking with a kind of trunk under a gas light; I went and collared him, and asked what he had got there; he said nothing, and threw it down - I took him to the Mansion-house - Hesketh took another man, but he was discharged. I afterwards opened the box, it contained umbrellas, and a bill of parcels, which I have in my hand - in consequence of the direction on the case, I went to the White-Bear, Basinghall-street, and found that it had been lost from there; he was going in a direction from Fore-street.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 11th of October, about half-past ten o'clock, I was sent for to Mr. Williams's. I heard a great altercation between the prosecutor and the prisoner, about some duplicates. Mrs. Williams let down a bureau bedstead, and said she had lost two sheets and a pair of pillows; I then told the prisoner that I must search her; she said she would give up all the duplicates. I found the duplicates for the articles produced. She did not say that Mrs. Williams had given her them to pawn.</p>

            , glovers and leather sellers, Cheapside. I never saw the prisoner till the 28th of September, between four and five o'clock in the evening, when he came to the shop, and said he came from Messrs, Clementi's, for a sample of the buck skins that a person had been speaking about; he was without a coat or a hat, and had a clean apron on, like a mechanic - I counted twenty skins, and he put them on his shoulder and went away. I should not have trusted him with them, but I gave credit to his representation - it is usual for musical instrument makers to have such articles. He returned in five or six minutes, and said Messrs. Clementi very much approved of them, and desired him to fetch the remainder. I had no doubt but that it was all as it ought to be, and counted out twenty-three more, which were all I had of the kind. I should not have parted with them if I had not been convinced by his representation, that he came from there. I then walked out at the door after him, and watched him across the way; he went over, and went about half way down a court, which leads to Clementi's back premises - he then turned back again. I went over, and laid my hand on the skins, and asked him what he was going to do with them - he said he was going to their back premises - he then went up Old Change, and then to the Bull's Head, public-house, and laid them down on the tap-room table. I said,</p>
               <p>"Is this Clementi's;" he did not know what to say. I then said,</p>
               <p>"The best thing you can do is to tell me where the others are" - he said he would, and we set off down Old Change, and Watling-street; he said he was going to Fleet-lane; I said I should not go there - I took him back, and gave charge of him.</p>

The defendant had at the same time, and by the same means, decoyed Miss Johannah Cooper (aged 15 years) to town, in the same post chaise with her sister, and married her at the same church. The affidavit made to obtain the licence was that both parties were of age, and that the defendant had lived in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn, for fifteen days previous, which was contradicted by the like evidence as in the former case.</p>

On the 26th of October, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon; my little girl gave me information; I went over to the stable, and saw the prisoner, and told him to take the horse and cart at his peril; he said he was determined to take it by force, for he had been ill-used respecting it; he pretended to go with me to the office, but drove the cart and horse away. I have since heard that it has been his property.</p>

            . I am patrol of Acton. I stopped the prisoner on Wednesday morning, about three o'clock, at Clapton, and asked what he had got - he said he did not know, but that it was a parcel he was taking for his master, Mr. Chew, of Chingford-hall, to the Green Dragon, public-house. He had four fowls in a basket, just killed; they were quite warm; and two geese in a cloth - he said Mr. Chew was to meet him at eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>MR. CHEW. He was in my service, but left in May; I gave him no authority to take them - here are the wings. I am certain the fowls were mine.</p>
