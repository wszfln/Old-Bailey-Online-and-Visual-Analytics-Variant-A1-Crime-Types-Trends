                  </hi>. I am clerk in the house of Messrs. Bartley, Southwood, and Barclay, solicitor of Somerset-street, Portman-square; they have a client named Seth Smith. On Saturday, 20th April, when I arrived at the office, about ten o'clock in the morning, I found a person wait<lb/>ing at the office door—he was quite a stranger to me—he said something to me about meeting a person, in consequence of which I made an appointment—I said I should leave the office at six, and would see the person—when I left the office at six, I saw the prisoner and the young man I had before, standing at the bottom of Somerset-street, Duke-street—the young man introduced me to the prisoner, by saying, "This is Mr. Bartley's clerk"—we walked to Oxford-street, and when we got opposite the Noah's Ark public-house, the prisoner said "Here is a house we can go into"—we went into the parlour, sat down, and had a pint of ale—the prisoner said to me "You do a great deal of business for Mr. Smith"—I said "Yes, we do"—he said, "Well, what I want you to do for me is to get a counterpart lease away from your office; and if you will get it me, I will give you 10<hi rend="italic">l."</hi>—I said, "If I can get it, how shall 1 let you know?"—previous to that I said, "Give me the particulars of it," and the prisoner asked the young man for a piece of paper, and the prisoner took the paper and wrote on it—Hardwick, the officer, has that paper—I gave it to him—I have not seen it since.</p>

Smith to J.

               <p>the public-house, at half-past six o'clock this evening, punctually"—that was addressed to J. Lawrence, No. 2, Motcombe-street, Belgrave-square—I put it in the post myself, on Wednesday morning—I went to the place appointed on the Wednesday evening, at the time appointed, and found the prisoner outside the door—I said, "I must trouble you to come again to-morrow evening at six o'clock, and then I shall be able to let you have it"—we agreed to meet at six o'clock next evening, Thursday, 25th, at the Noah's Ark—I took the deed with me—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I believe it was injured at the Royal Exchange fire—it was in the state it is now when I took it, only wrapped in a piece of brown paper—I got it from the office—I found the prisoner in the parlour alone—I said to him "Are you as good as your word?"—he said, "Yes," at the same time pulling a bag out of his pocket—he handed me ten sovereigns, and I gave him the deed—the prisoner opened it, and looked at it, and said "Quite right," or something to that effect—he was satisfied it was the counterpart, seeing his signature I suppose—he said so—he looked all over the deed—after I had received the money, and he had the deed, I asked him his object in obtaining the counterpart lease—he said his object was to alter his own lease, which was for twenty-one years, into seventy-one years—I asked how that was to be done, and he said by taking the top off the "T," and carrying the line up would make an "S," and the "w" into "ev" would make "Seventy"—he also wrote the word "twenty" on a piece of paper, and showed me how it was done, but I do not know what has become of that piece of paper—I did not take it—he said he should destroy the counterpart as soon as he got home—Hardwick, the officer, was waiting in the room in plain clothes—he was there when I went in—the prisoner and I sat in a box by ourselves—he spoke to me in rather a low tone of voice.</p>

Caroline Periera's conduct, in making Mrs. Smith a present of an Indian chair during her passage home, and again taking it away from her, shows a great deal of the pariah breed. The Chinese sewing silk in question, with the greater part of the English silk, Mrs. Smith only took it when Caro<lb/>line Periera said she would throw it overboard. As to the ivory card-case, it happens to be made of wood. The fact is, Mrs. Smith cannot reconcile such mad, baby tricks, as forcing presents upon people and then sending for them again, to the great inconvenience of the parties to whom they were given. In conclusion; as Mrs. Smith is about to leave for Ireland to-morrow, Monday afternoon, she cannot think of upsetting her baggage to oblige Caroline Periera's mad whims. When Caroline Periera can write to Mrs. Smith on a more agreeable subject, her address is 32, William-street, Cork, Ireland.")</p>

I assist Mr. Phillips, who keeps the Jolly Farmer beer-shop, at Shadwell—the prisoner came there on 9th May, in company with another man, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon—he asked for a pint of beer, and gave me a half-crown—I put it in my pocket—I had no other there—I gave him change—about nine the same evening, the prisoner came again, alone, for a pint of porter, and gave me a second half-crown—I said to him, "You are all in the half-crown way; this is the second I have taken of you to-day"—he made no reply—I gave the half-crown to the little boy to get change, but before he returned I made up change and gave it to the prisoner, and he went—the little boy came back and said the half-crown was bad—I then looked at the first half-crown which was in my pocket, and found that was bad—I wrapped them both up in paper, put them in my dress-pocket, and kept them separate from other money—next day the prisoner came again, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, in company with the same man who came with him, at first—they asked for a pint of porter, and put down another half-crown—I had previously got a policeman, as I quite expected he would come again—I said, "I charge this man with passing two bad half-crowns yester<lb/>day, and I expect he has brought another," but that proved to be good—the prisoner said, "You make a mistake; I never was in your house before"—I am quite certain he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a market-gardener, and live at Enfield Highway. I occupy myself a good deal in inventing new varieties of rhubarb-roots—I have done so for many years, and my father before me—previous to Feb., 1849, I had been endeavouring to cultivate one particular species—I had 200 of them, and I lost about half of them either the latter end of Feb. or the beginning of March, 1849—I inquired for them in the neighbourhood directly, and offered a reward, but heard nothing of them—last month I went, from information, to the prisoner, who has a small garden at Enfield—I there found the roots that I had lost last year: they had been cut, and planted again, and were growing—I am able to swear that they were mine—I knew them by their peculiarity, by the leaf and stalk—I had some of them dug up—I believe the number I saw growing there would correspond with what I lost—they were raised from seed; I got the seedlings from one of my own—I asked the prisoner where he got them—he said he had raised them from sorts growing in his other garden—I went to his other garden, and found nothing but quite a common root—it is quite impossible that they could have been raised from any of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am President of the London District department of the General Post-office. On 8th May I caused a letter to be written and addressed to Miss Eliza Barnham, Erbistock, Wrexham, North Wales, and put in it half-a-sovereign and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., dated 1826, which I had previously marked in two places—I sealed the letter and gave it to Peak, the officer, in the presence of Mr. Cole, the inspector of letter-carriers—it was stamped about three o'clock in the afternoon—if it was posted at the Isling<lb/>ton Post-office between four and five, it would be forwarded in the five o'clock collection, and would reach the Post-office at half-past five—I was there when the bag arrived—it contained no such letter—I then went with Peak to the Islington receiving-house, kept by Mr. Braden—we arrived there a little after six, and found the prisoner behind the counter, and two other young men—I asked who made up the five o'clock collection; who counted the stamped letters—one of the men said, in the prisoner's presence, he had <hi rend="italic">told up</hi> the paid letters—I asked the prisoner whether he had assisted with the stamped letters—he said he had not; that Edwin, who was up-stairs, had counted them—Edwin came down and said, in the prisoner's hearing, that the prisoner had <hi rend="italic">faced</hi> the stamped letters; that is, turned the directions all one way—I do not recollect whether the prisoner said anything, but I told Peak to take him into a private room and search him—I had mentioned, in the presence of all three, that a letter which I had given to the officer to post had not reached the general office—Peak searched the prisoner in my presence, and took from him 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and this shilling (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I find my marks on it—I said, "This is my shilling"—he said, "No, it is mine; I brought it from home yesterday at one o'clock; I took it from the mantel-price with 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I have had ever since; I spent 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in tobacco"—he was taken away in custody—the letter and half-sovereign have not been found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. William Mardon—we are solicitors, in Newgate-street. The prisoner has been in our, service more than once—the last occasion was between Nov. and 13th April, when he left—his first duty was settling some accounts which were in arrear, and after that he was employed as out-of-door common-law clerk—he was to go to the public offices to issue writs and serve subpoenas, and do the me<lb/>chanical duty which was not done in chambers—we had a suit in which it was necessary to serve Mr. Glass with a subpoena—I have the prisoner's, day-book, in his own writing—I settled with him on Saturday his account for the week preceding—here is an entry, "Copy of subpoena served on Mr. Glass, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">d."</hi>—I settled this account with the prisoner on 22nd Dec—this guinea was included in that account—the balance of it was money due to us—he carried forward 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., hut on casting up the book I find it was only 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. due to us—that was carried on to the next week's account.</p>

               <p>subpoenaed Chapman, but I will not swear that Walker did not—there was a client named George Capstick—I do not know whether Walker did not serve him—Walker kept a book—I did not take it from him—he was discharged in April—I never discovered his irregularities till a day or two before he was discharged—I had required him to make up his book—his salary was three guineas a week, but we did not give it him towards the close, as he did not make up his account—he had no money furnished to him—he did no outdoor work—I cannot say that he did not issue a writ, but it would be contrary to his duty—I have never heard my partner come to the prisoner for money and give him the items, or any clerk in the office—I did not require from Walker the list of the irregularities—we found out a great number of irregularities—I do not know where Walker is—I have instructed the police to take him if they can find him—he always wore spectacles—there is in this book some marks of a W. against some items—here is "Bulpitt-court fees, Mr. W."—I don't know what it means—it is the prisoner's writing—it is an account I passed, but that was not there when I passed it, to the best of my belief—this balance of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is my writing, but the prisoner has put down his salary—he puts down the sums he receives and what he disburses, and at the close of the week he strikes the balance—his salary was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—if he put down his salary, the balances were sometimes in his favour, but his salary was not a payment—if he expended what money I gave him, he would apply to me for more—I discovered the irregularity about this guinea when the affidavits of increase were made—the prisoner had left four days before that—I had not consented that Walker should remain in our place after we discovered his irregularities—we dis<lb/>missed him directly—the prisoner said he had been the dupe of Walker; I said, "I am very sorry for you if it is so"—he said that, at the time Walker was discharged, on the 1st or 2nd of April—he was in our service a fortnight after Walker was gone—that was after we had discovered another irregularity with respect to the prisoner—he said he was the dupe of Walker, and we kept him on till we found something that he had robbed us of, with which Walker could have nothing to do—a week before Walker left I did not have him and the prisoner in my room and have some conversation about this account—the prisoner did not say, "Walker has had money of me, call him in"—if he had required it I should have had Walker in—the prisoner said that Walker had had money of him, but Walker was then gone—I never saw Walker after that expression of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>the sergeant assisted me—he is not here—the lock to the cell is a Chubb's patent lock—it was not at all damaged—I went to the cell again, at ten minutes or a quarter-past eleven—the door was then locked and bolted outside, top and bottom, and there were three prisoners remaining inside—they were put in at the same time as the prisoner—there were five altogether, and two had escaped—there are no windows in the cell where prisoners could get out; there are some small apertures in the door—the door shuts of itself, and it is bolted top and bottom afterwards—it double-locks of itself—I never tried to open it from the inside when it was shut—I have not tried since this occurred, nor has anybody in my presence—I have not the remotest idea how the prisoner got out—I am quite sure I did not leave the door open—I could not have left it open, because you cannot bolt it without shutting it—no one watches the outside of the cells—I bolted the door top and bottom when I put the five prisoners in.</p>

On Wednesday, 29th May, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, I was near Miles'-lane, Cannon-street, close by London-bridge, I saw some persons standing at one end of Miles'-lane—I heard them calling, "Stop thief!"—I saw the prisoner running down Miles'-lane, towards me—I made an attempt to stop him, but he held up a life-preserver, and endeavoured to strike me—I stepped aside, and allowed him to pass, and then turned round, as he was turning the corner into Thames-street, closed on him and seized him—we had a scuffle, and both fell—I placed my right knee on his neck or head, to hold him down—he made a scuffle to try to get up—he tried to lift up the life-preserver to strike me, and I stamped it down with my feet, and got it from him—I afterwards gave it to Storey when he came up—another policeman then came up, and he was taken to the station—on the way to the station I was kicked by the prisoner severely in the upper part of my body, and I have not been able to follow my labour since.</p>

On Wednesday, 29th May, Storey was brought to my house, in Bow-lane—I examined his head—it was covered with blood, and his hair was saturated with blood—on the upper part of the back part of his head I found a ragged, bruised wound, about an inch and a half or two inches long—the skin was completely separated, and it was bleeding very much—it had perhaps been bleeding more than when I saw it—I think such an instrument as this would produce such a wound—I did what was necessary at the time, and have not seen him professionally since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the City police. I visited Storey on the afternoon of 29th May, about four o'clock, at his home—he was in bed—I examined his bead, and found that he had received a contused wound, of more than an inch in extent, at the. upper and back-part of his head—he appeared to have lost a large quantity of blood, judging from his clothes—he complained of dimness of the sight, and noise in the ears, clearly indi<lb/>cating that the brain had sustained a very severe shock of some kind—he has remained under my care to this day, and still complains of those symptoms,</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother Matthew; we are linen drapers and carpet-warehousemen, at 83, Whitechapel-road. On 3rd June I was in the warehouse, about five in the afternoon, Myers and a policeman came to me, and I went with them to 32, Went worth-street, Whitechapel, to a bedroom on the second-floor—I found the prisoner Hartley there, and a man who is not here—there were two or three persons there—Clark showed me some carpet, which he took out of a bag—I believe it to be ours—there was about fifty or sixty yards, cut up in separate pieces—some was on the floor—it was all one pattern—there was eighty or a hundred yards in the morning, but it would be cut during the day—Hartley said, "We bought the carpet, and paid a good price for it"—she afterwards said, "We will pay for it"—I had claimed it then—I do not, of my own know<lb/>ledge, know of the loss of any carpet—Leatham, the warehouseman, does; he is not here—I have no doubt of this carpet having formed part of our stock—it was eighty or a hundred yards.</p>

On 22nd May, the evening the carpet was taken, I saw Morgan at Roach's house in White Bear-court—I knew Roach before, but Morgan had said nothing before that evening of getting Roach into it—he told Roach he knew of a house at Hackney that could be <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, and asked Roach to be a party with me, and that a considerable sum of money and plate was expected—he consented—it was then arranged that it was to be done on the following Sunday—we were to meet at Roach's, but it was not done then—I conversed with Morgan almost every day—he said he had only postponed it on account of his clothes being bad, that he should have no difficulty in getting in, but he was afraid the police would be suspicious when he came out of the house—on Sunday afternoon, the 2nd, he came to my lodging about five o'clock, and said he had made up his mind to have Roach, as he could not trust to me, he thought I should not do my part—he said, "Mind, I will speak plainly, if I see you do not do your duty when you get down there, I will stick a knife into you"—he said he would meet me at Roach's at half-past seven—I went—Roach was at home—Morgan came shortly afterwards—Roach gave me this iron bar—I asked him what it was for—(Morgan was not present then)—he said, "To use or break open, you can't tell what you may want it for"—we all left Roach's together about half-past eight to go to Hackney—going down the road, Morgan said, "I will go and knock at the door, you two must gradually work yourselves in while I am stand<lb/>ing talking to the servant"—he said the servants were to be bound, and a hand<lb/>kerchief was to be placed over their mouths, while he went up-stairs to secure the cash-box, and if they were not quiet by being bound, they were to be quieted by other means—that was agreed on in Roach's presence—we went to Mr. Hoggs'—Morgan knocked at the door, it was opened, and he went in—Roach and I waited outside—Morgan came outside—I saw the female servant in the passage with a candle in her hand—we went in—Roach made a rush at her, and I heard her scream—several policemen rushed out of the rooms into the passage—Roach was seized, and a blow or two was struck at me, but sergeant Brennan recognised me and interfered—I gave him the crow-bar I had, and went down to the station with them, and next day to the police-court—I was not charged; I was examined as a witness, but not till the Wednesday—I was there, but was not brought up—I was in custody at</p>

On Tuesday morning 21 st May, about a quarter or half-past twelve o'clock, I was at the corner of Panton-street, and Oxendon-street, Haymarket, and saw Dean talking to a gentle<lb/>man—the two male prisoners were on the other side of the way—Dean then went towards Leicester-square joined by the two males—I and another con<lb/>stable in plain clothes, who is not here, followed them along Leicester-square, to the corner of St. Martin's-lane—the two males then left Dean, and she went on a-head, and accosted a gentleman in Bear-street—the other prisoners were in sight at the time, five or ten yards off—she caught the gentleman by the left arm, walked with him a few yards, left him and went to the cor<lb/>ner of Leicester-square by the French Hotel, and she caught hold of another gentleman near Bear-street, at the corner of New Cranbourne-street—she went about three parts of the way with him down Bear-street, and then left him, and went with the two males into St. Martin's-lane, to Ben Caunt's, the pugilist's, public-house—they remained there drinking ten or twelve minutes—we watched them from the opposite side of the way—they all drank out of the same pot—they then went towards St. Martin's Church, and at the corner of Chandos-street there was a row with a drunken woman, they crossed over to it, and when they left there, a constable in uniform came up and they were given into custody—I searched Knight at the station, and found this gold watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his waistcoat pocket—I asked him whose it was; he said, his own, and it was given him by his father—the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chemist's assistant, and live in Bond-street. At the time this happened I lived at 2, Great Castle-street, Oxford-street—on the night of 20th May, about a quarter before eleven o'clock, I was in Picca-dilly—at twenty-five minutes or a quarter to twelve I saw the female prisoner in Bond-street—I accompanied her up Bond-street, to the corner of Oxford-street, where two men came up, and asked where a surgeon lived—I told them I did not know—I went with the prisoner to the eorner of Hanover-square, left her, and then missed my watch—I had it safe just before she accosted me—I was not near Bear-street at any time, Oxendon-street, or Leicester-square—the watch produced by Murrell is the one I lost.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Queen-street, Hackney-road. I keep tame pigeons in a pigeon-house at the back of my house—on 16th May, when I went to bed at ten o'clock, I had nineteen pigeons safe—at three in the morning, I was disturbed by a fluttering of pigeons, looked out of window, and saw two men in the yard close to the pigeon-house, and one went in—I undid my clock-weight, opened the window, alarmed them, and as they came out I threw the clock weight at them, and they went off, letting two or three pigeons fly—I called "Stop thief!" heard the policeman coming, and directly after, heard them going over the fence—the policeman brought back one man to the yard, and we found a bag which I saw opened at the station, and it contained four of my pigeons—one of those which was let fly is still missing—it is a young one, and I expect the cats got it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a basket-man, employed at the coal-whippers' office. The prisoner was in the same employment—I have known him twenty-four years—on Tuesday evening, 4th June, I went into the Cock, on Cock-hill, Ratcliff, about nine o'clock, and was talking to a man named Thomas Pluckrose, a person connected with our office—the prisoner was sitting in an opposite box, eating something—he had a knife and fork in his hand—he commenced giving me a tissue of abuse, without any provocation on my part—he came over to my seat—I told him to go and sit down, I wanted no more of his abuse—he made some sort of party remark, that I had called the potboy a Connaught something—I appealed to the potboy, and went over to where the prisoner was sitting, and the potboy denied it in toto—the prisoner then said to him, "You are a b—y liar"—that aggravated me, and I said, "Now you deserve a slap across the face"—he said, "You had better do it"—I said, "Put down your knife and fork, and stand up; put up your hands to defend yourself"—he laid the knife and fork down on the table—I thought he did not feel disposed to resent it, and more out of contempt than anger I gave him a slap with the back of my hand across the face, and told him if he pursued that line of conduct towards me, or offended me any more, it was more than likely that the next time I hit him I should strike him in earnest—I then turned round to go to my own company, thinking it was dropped, and I felt a cut in my cheek, which cut my lip—I did not see where the blow came from—my side was towards the prisoner—I had no idea he was going to strike me, or I would have got out of the way—I went to Mr. Cleland, the surgeon, and be dressed the wound.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Waters, and live at Twickenham. On Tuesday, 4th June, about half-past one o'clock, I was near Mr. Strachan's shrubbery, at Teddington, and saw the prisoner and Wilson coming out of the shrubbery struggling with one another—I saw the prisoner strike him in the face, and they both fell together, and I saw the prisoner put his hands round about the gentleman's trowsers pockets outside, as if feeling what was inside—I did not see his hand in his pockets—the prisoner then got up, and ran off in the direction of Teddington Church—Wilson got up about two minutes afterwards, ran a little way, and then fell—he got up again, and ran after the prisoner—he left his hat behind him, which I took up, and took home—I afterwards saw him, and gave it to him.</p>

On Tues<lb/>day, 4th June, I was near the Royal Oak, at Teddington, and saw the pri<lb/>soner and Wilson go in and come out again—they went away towards Ted<lb/>dington Church—Wilsonwas tipsy—the prisoner had been drinking, but was not so bad as Wilson—about half an hour afterwards Watson came back without his hat—he made some complaint of what had happened to him, in consequenee of which I went with two others to find out the prisoner—we found him crossing the fields to Teddington—I called to him and he stopped—I told him he was wanted back at the Oak by the gentleman he went away with—he came back, and Wilson accused him of robbing him—he made some remark, but I cannot recollect the words—he was given into custody—I afterwards drove Wilson to the Old Kent-road—he appeared to be very stupified then, but not so bad as he was in the morning—we got there about eight at night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watch and chronometer-maker, in Bishop's-row, Paddington. On 27th March I was in my shop—the prisoner Smith came in about half-past seven o'clock, he showed me a silver watch, and asked me what it wanted in the way of repairs—I looked at it, and gave it him back—he put it into his pocket—I said I thought he had made a mistake—he said no, he would send the boy with it—he then said his mamma wanted to buy a French clock—I handed him one, and he looked at it, and put it back—he then went to the flap of the counter, lifted it up, and pointed to one—he said, "Is that one gilt"—I said, "No"—I did not like his intruding into the inner part of the shop—at the same time I connived at it, and determined to watch him—there was a working board on which there was a gold watch—after a little time the prisoner went near to that board—I afterwards missed that gold watch—it belonged to Mr. Clark—while the prisoner was standing near that board he requested me to make out a list of the prices of the clocks to hand to his mamma, which I did—I was rather leaning over my counter to watch him, but I did not observe anything—I made out the list of prices, but he was not in a hurry to go, he stood some time talking about the clocks and watches—he then went away, and said he would bring the watch in the evening, or send it by the boy, or perhaps his mamma would call and look at the clocks—in the mean time I was making out a bill of this very watch on the board which was missed—I had seen this watch safe a very few minutes before he came—he was there altogether about ten minutes—I had an oppor<lb/>tunity of seeing his features perfectly—I have not the slightest doubt that he is the man—I saw the watch again at the police-court—this is it—I had re<lb/>paired it, and had some charge to make upon it.</p>

On Tuesday, 26th Feb., about two o'clock in the afternoon, I heard a knock at the door; I went and opened it; it was the middle door; the outer door is left open—I found the prisoner and another person—the prisoner asked if the doctor was at home—I told him he was not—he said he was not well, and he wanted some medicine; if I would allow him to write an address, the doctor would call on him—he also said that Mrs. Smith was not well, she had been lately confined—I agreed to his writing an address, and he and the other person went into the parlour—I supplied the prisoner with paper and pen and ink to write the address—he said to the youth who was with him, "George, will you write it? you</p>

               <p>see how ill I am," and his hand shook; but the prisoner did write a note, and left it on the table—he then asked me if I would oblige him with a glass of water—I took a tumbler from the sideboard, and went into the surgery to draw the water—I drew it, and was coining out, and the prisoner came and met me, and drank the water in the surgery—there was a basket of plate in the wing of the sideboard—I had been about a minute gone for the water when the prisoner came and met me—the lad who came with the prisoner had a blue bag with him, and he bad gone out when I came from the surgery—I then let the prisoner out of the door, and shut the door after him—I then missed a sovereign from the mantelpiece, and in about half an hour I missed the plate—it consisted of fourteen spoons and the other articles stated—the blue bag was large enough for it all to have been put in—I had seen the sovereign a minute or two before the prisoner came, and I saw the plate when I let him and the lad in.</p>

On 8th May I went to the prisoner's house with Mr. Botten, Underhay, and another gentleman—he was behind the counter—Underhay produced three or four castings, and asked him whether he knew anything of those castings—he said, "Certainly not"—Mr. Botten said, "Don't be in a hurry; have you sold any of those castings? have they gone through your hands?"—he said, no, he never saw any of them at all—I was in plain clothes—I said, "I am an officer; if any one has said they bought those castings of you, they are telling a falsehood?"—he said "Yes, I have been in the line myself, and would not buy such castings; I should know they were stolen"—at the station he said be bought them of a marine-store dealer named Pole, of White-hart-yard, near Drury-lane.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of White and Co., of Cheapside, warehousemen—there are three partners—on 30th April, I believe, 1849, the prisoner came to our premises, and selected some goods—he had previously opened an account with us, and given us references to houses in Manchester and Bradford, on the strength of which we bad agreed to trust him to the extent of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and had entrusted him with some portion—on 30th April he selected to the amount of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or thereabouts—we should not have allowed that amount of goods to leave our premises on the Manchester recommend<lb/>ation, but he made this statement, which I wrote down immediately he left the counting-house, that he belonged to the firm of Kealy and Co., of Galway; that there were three brothers in the firm; that they began business five years previously with 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that at that time they had a stock of</p>

               <p>2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., all paid for, within 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—upon that, I allowed the goods to be removed—they were 400 yards of silk, some yards of long cloth, and some yards of woollen cloth—I made an arrangement with him that he was not to have the usual term of credit (four months) because it was a larger parcel than usual for that term of credit—he was to pay it by instalments, and before the term of credit expired—he agreed to pay by instalments—in Nov., we received a communication from Manchester—we had then received 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him on account of that parcel—we had received money for the parcel which was purchased on the reference previously—I next saw him on the day before he was given in custody, about a fortnight ago, at Messrs. Spence, Baggallay, and Co.'s, silk warehousemen—he came again on 10th May this year—he was talking to my father, and when I went up, my father was saying to him, "How can you expect us to assist you, when you behaved to us in the way you have, in getting you a situation"—I said, "When you were here last, you made a statement that you began business with your two brothers with 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-piece," and I was about to recapitulate the whole statement, but he stopped me, and said, "I know I did"—I asked him if it was true—he said, "No, it is false; but it is no use kicking up a row about it"—I ordered him out—I afterwards saw him at Spence and Baggallay's, and gave him in custody—I can tell the amounts we actually received, by referring to this statement, which I have copied from our books—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) there are four payments of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each on account of the goods purchased on 30th April, and one pay<lb/>ment of 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account of the first purchase from the Watling-street warehouse, which is a branch of our establishment—it appears from this account that there was 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-worth more obtained from Watling-street on 3rd and 4th May, which have not been paid for at all, leaving a balance of 182<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. against him.</p>

Gibbs did not return this case, but said we might go before the Grand Jury—when the prisoner came on 3rd May, he sent back 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-worth which did not nit him, of the goods he had on the references, but not before he got the others away—all he obtained on the references has been balanced up—I was annoyed at the prisoner's conduct this May—I did not say 1 would ruin him in the London market—I said I should certainly stop his credit if I could, if I found he was trying to get it; we lost our money, and I should prevent other people losing theirs—I do not know that he offered to return the goods, if he did, It would be only a figure of speech with him—I swear he did not make me such an offer when I first pressed him for payment in May 1849.</p>

On the night in question I was talking to a man named Gabrix, within a door or two of the prosecutrix's house, and heard her <hi rend="italic">jawing</hi> and going on with a great noise—I walked down to the front door, and saw the prisoner and his wife looking at the staple that the prosecutrix had pulled out of his door, and his wife had a candle to show him where she had pulled it off—the prosecutrix was then down-stairs <hi rend="italic">jawing</hi> at her own kitchen door, and she said, "You b—b—if you put a staple on I will pull it off"—"My good woman," said the prisoner, "I have got nothing to do with you; if you have got anything to say to me, come up and tell me"—"No you b—b—," said she, "come and pay me the rent"—the prisoner's wife said, "He will pay you as soon at he can get it"—"Oh, you b—wh—;" said the prosecutrix, "he could pay me long ago if he liked"—"I am no wh—, thank God!" said the prisoner's wife "I will make you prove your words"—"Oh you b—<hi rend="italic">Madigan,</hi> you are a Frenchman's wh—," said she—with that the prisoner let go the door he was looking at, and went down-stairs—his wife said, "Where are you going to,<hi rend="italic">Mike?</hi> come back"—he made no answer, and she followed him</p>

               <p>down-stairs, and as soon as they entered the place below I heard a screaming and bawling, and down I went—the door was wide open, and they were all bawling together, mother, children, and all, and I saw the prosecutrix and her daughter having hold of the prisoner's wife by the hair of her head—the prisoner was pulling them to get her loose, and the more he pulled the more they pulled his wife, and sometimes he gave them a hit, but for all that they would not let go—with my assistance he at last got her away, and she went outside the door—I then got the prisoner out, and the prosecutrix and her daughter, and two little sons,<hi rend="italic">Johnny</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Jemmy,</hi> were hitting him—one is about eight years old, and the other about six—when I got the prisoner outside the kitchen door Gorman was there—we got him up-stairs, and then Gorman and I went into the kitchen again to Mrs. Egan, to make peace and quietness—Gorman went in first, and she up with a jug to hit him, thinking it was the prisoner—"Don't hit me, Mrs. Egan," said he, "I only come to make peace," and she drew back her hand—we were talking to her some time—when the prisoner came down stairs again, hearing her call him all the b—b——s she could, and his wife wh—s, and he said, "Mrs. Egan, can you prove my wife a wh—," and in he comes, "You b—b—," says she, "I will let you know," and she <hi rend="italic">pitches into</hi> him again, and her daugh<lb/>ter too, hitting and striking him—he had no candlestick in his hand, nor any knife—he hit her a blow somewhere on the head with his naked fist, and she fell and tumbled against the bedstead, and whether it was the blow or the fell that cut her I could not make out—as soon as she got up I taw that her lip was cut—he did not take up a knife, and make a blow at her—he then went up-stairs into his own, room—I and Gorman remained these till the policeman came.</p>

Pratt and Sewell, and by their instructions I took Dunn about half-past seven that morning—I said, "I want you for throwing that half sack of corn this morning into Sircutt's cart"—he said, "So help me God, he did not have any corn of me to-day"—in going to the station I said, "I think there was a bushel of corn in the sack"—he said, "Oh, faith, there was not half a bushel"—I have a sample of the mixture which I got of the horse-keeper at the prosecutor's.</p>

Emanuel, knowing them to be stolen—he said he was packing some rags, and he asked me to allow him five minutes to go down stairs to finish his job—I said, "No," he must consider himself my prisoner, and go the station—he then sat down on a bed in the parlour, and began crying—he said, "Now I am <hi rend="italic">done!"</hi>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Frank Sandon Thomas, the manager of Iron-gate Wharf. The property on that wharf is in his care—the prisoner was in the employ of Mr. Neal, a town-carman, who has dealings at the wharf—on the Saturday before, 27th May, between eight and nine o'clock, the prisoner and his cart came for a load of paper—it was given him, and he took it away—he afterwards returned for the remainder—I then heard some<lb/>thing, in consequence of which I went to where his wagon was, and saw a bag lying on the shaft, and the prisoner's arms folded over it, partly conceal<lb/>ing it—I asked what he had got there—he said if I could not load him he had other orders, and must go to another wharf—I said I must see what he had got—I saw some paper, and knowing we had such paper I went to the pile, and found a bundle of double post missing—his order was for a soft sort of paper, not writing-paper—I know it to be from our wharf by the num<lb/>ber on it, which number was missing—there were three reams in the bag.</p>

Loosey was in my employ three or four years, up to 21st May—Willock was in the habit of coming to the shop for waste-paper—I have a loft in Sutton-place, where I had waste-paper in bags—on 21st May the two keys of the warehouse were hanging in their usual place—Loosey's time for coming to the shop was seven o'clock—on 21st May I was told something, and went to the warehouse at five or ten minutes past six in the morning, but found no one there; they had gone then—I believe this half-hundred weight of paper to be mine—it must have come from my ware-house—it is the same kind—I contract with the Post-office for it—they are advices from one postmaster to the other—it is worth 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Brooks. On 21st May, a little after six in the morning, I went round the back way to the shop—the loft is behind the shop—I saw Loosey in the loft, putting up waste-paper by the pulley and bag—he had no business there at that time that I am aware of—a cart was under the loft window, and Willock was standing receiving the paper—I saw one bag come down; it fell on the pavement instead of going into the cart—at the moment of Loosey seeing me he seemed confused—I know he saw me; he looked at me—there were six or seven bags in the cart—I said to Loosey, in Willock's hearing, "Is Mr. Brooks there?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Have you seen him?"—he said, "No"—I said, "How did you get the keys?"—he said, "I got them last night"—I then left, be<lb/>lieving everything was right—Willock called me back, and said he wanted to speak to me—Loosey was near enough to hear—he was exactly in the same position—I asked Willock if he wanted me—he said, "No, the boy wants you," pointing to Loosey—I asked Loosey what he wanted—he said, "Oh, Mr. Dicker, we are here an hour too early"—I said, "Mr. Brooks will be rather pleased than otherwise at your being here early"—I then went into the shop, and told Mr. Brooks what I had seen, and when I came back both prisoners had gone—there were thirty tons of paper in the loft—a small quan<lb/>tity would not be missed—I have not the least doubt about this being the paper.</p>

Willock was in the habit of buying waste-paper of my master—he used to bring a cart with him—I saw him at times at the waste-paper warehouse—about three weeks before I was taken, I met him accidentally in Oxford-street—he asked if I could do him a favour by letting him have about a cwt. of paper, as he had customers waiting for it—I told him to come to Mr. Brooks' and get it—he said he could not, because of owing Mr. Brooks 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for paper before, and he was afraid he would not let him have it—he said, "Can't you get it?"—I said, "No, I can't"—he said, "Can't you bring the keys of the warehouse when you come out to dinner, or some mealtime?"—I told him no—he said I could if I liked, and it would much oblige him if I would let him have it—that was at a public-house at the corner of Chapel-street, Oxford-street—about a week afterwards I met him accidentally as I was going to dinner, and he began to ask me again if I could not let him have a cwt. or a couple of cwt. of paper cut—I told him no, the same as before—he said I could if I liked, by bringing the keys out—he asked me what sort of keys they were—I described them, and he said, "I think I have got a key at home just like the little one—a day or two afterwards I met him again in Broad-street, very near teatime—he showed me a key, and asked me if it would open the door—I looked at it, and said I thought it would, and it was used afterwards—he said, "Now, you can let me have it, can't you, by leaving the large key unlocked"—he wanted me to let him have it that evening—I said 1 could not—he said, "Will you next looming?"—I said, "No"—he said, "Do;" and he came down to my place 12, King-street, Long-acre, next morning at six o'clock, and wanted me to let him have it then—I said I would not, and he went away, and I went to bed again—in a day or two I saw him again in Broad-street, as I was going home to my meals—he asked me about it again, and I promised to go up to him on Saturday evening—I went, and he gave me the key, and I promised that he could come on the following Tuesday morning—he came—I got the warehouse open with the key he gave me—I was there two or three minutes, when he came with a cart, and I gave him four bags of waste-paper from the warehouse—I let them down the stair by the cart, and removed them, we were then interrupted by Dicker coming.</p>

                  </hi>. I am steward of a steam vessel, and live in Cornwall-road, Lambeth; I know all the prisoners. On 1st Feb. I saw an advertise<lb/>ment in the paper—on the 13th I became acquainted with Wright—I had been previously in his father's service, who was then in Whitecross-street—I went to 16, Upper Wellington-street, Strand, where there was up over the door, "E. Wright and Co., auctioneers and emigration-office"—I saw Stanley there, and said I had come from Mrs. Wright to see Mr. Wright—he said he believed he was gone to New Oxford-street; that is where old Wright used to live—I afterwards saw Wright, the son, in New Oxford-street, and he asked me to go with him to Whitecross-street, as his father was in trouble—as we went, we called at 3, Kingsgate-street, and saw Sparks there—as we came back we called again, and saw Stanley, Sparks, and Campbell, and we all went to the public-house next door but one—I asked Wright what we went to Kingsgate-street for, and he said about getting his father out of prison—I have frequently conversed with him about an office—he wanted me to get an office and become his partner, and carry on the same business, to advertise for young men, and get the money to share it between us; he said he would be the responsible person, and sign everything—I did not agree, and he said I seemed to be afraid—I said, "No," I was not afraid particularly, but it was not a game that would suit me; I would become partner in anything where there was a chance of getting an honest living—he said there was an office in Manchester-square we could have, and would I go and put down 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I went and looked at it, but put no money down—he said they could not do anything; there was no fear; if one place got too hot, we could move about and get another—I saw Stanley on 19th April, and he engaged me to mind his office, 3, Kingsgate-street, on the Saturday, for which I was to have 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I only got 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went next day and minded it—he told me there would be several young men come, and I was to give them some slips of paper which he wrote, and which I believe were to go to some distance, and when they came back in the after<lb/>noon I was to tell them he had gone to Southampton—Loten, George, and Nelson, came—I gave them the message in the morning—Stanley came to the office the very same day, between twelve and one o'clock, while the young men were out—I saw Stanley on the Monday, at a coffee-shop in Great Queen-street, where there is "E. Nixon and Co., auctioneers and estate-agents," over the door—Stanley was then going by the name of Nixon—he</p>

I would take that—he did not say I had disgraced myself by my violent conduct, and I had better leave at once—an appointment was made to meet Campbell at his solicitors that evening—I afterwards went to the office with Loten, my cousin—there was a woman there; we did not insult her—we put placards all about the place; we did not paint out the writing—the placards did not hide the name of the office—we did not take away any papers—I did not take a lot of memorandums, and say I would have them, they belonged as much to me as them—once when I went to the office, I was told Campbell had gone to Brighton—I did not receive any money from persons who came to the office—the only business I did was to date a few letters signed by Campbell, and the only money I received was 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a prospectus.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and know all the prisoners. About 24th March I fitted up an office for Wright, at 17, Adam-street, Adelphi—he was to pay me 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was there on 8th April, and recollect Topp coming to see Wright, who then whispered to me, asked me to leave the office a few moments, said he was going to <hi rend="italic">nail</hi> him, and then he would pay me—I left, went again, and asked for my money—he said he had not received it yet, he was going to take him on trial, he would have it in the course of a week—on 22nd April I was introduced to Stanley by young Wright, who said, "This is Mr. Saunders; I think he is a person who can do your business for you"—Stanley said he had an office in Great Queen-street, and he had seen a young man, an auctioneer, from the country, and had received a sovereign from him, and was going to receive 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the following morning—</p>

I have received of Davies; that will be your share"—James took it, and they went away together—I have seen James and Wright, and applied to them for my money—I have not been able to get it.</p>

On a Thursday evening in May, the prisoners came there and asked for a pint of potter—I served them, and they took it to Mr. Colson's, the fishmongers—about a minute or two after, I heard a noise, went into the bar-parlour, and saw Hill on his hands and knees just coming away from the till, and Kimpton standing outside the bar—they both ran away—I saw some farthings lying about the bar which were not there when I left two or three minutes before—the silver bowl in the till was gone—I think there were two shillings, six or seven fourpenny-pieces, and two or three sixpences in it, and there were some farthings gone from another bowl—I called my mother.</p>

               <p>my master locks the gate, if he sees any persons about likely to get in—on 27th April he told me he locked the gate, because there were so many rough-looking men about, he thought they meant to come into his place, he did not know what they meant by coming down there, and said to me, "For the future you get over"—we unlocked the gate to get the horses out—my master did not say he expected the broker to come and seize for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. rent—I never heard him say Thomas Sabin was tried for the property—I have often heard him say it was freehold—I have not heard him say he paid no rent.</p>

I work for Mr. Stephen Sabin—I have known him to be in possession of the property nine or ten years—I went on Tuesday morning, 7 th May, at six o'clock—the gate was locked, and I got over—I went into the stable—Reeves, Fetherston, jun., Gould, Toms, Tubby, and Pearson, then came, and Reeves took out this distress-warrant (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw Sabin a few minutes after, coming towards the stable—Gould went out and met him—my master shortly afterwards came—Featherston, jun., Reeves, Gould, Tubby, and Pearson, remained there all day—about eight in the evening I went with my master to the stable—he took hold of young Fetherston's collar, told him he had no business there, and must go off the premises—one of them knocked master's hat off, and Tubby held up a stick—they surrounded young Fetherston, and drove master away—I left with my master—I said they were too strong for us to get them out—next morning I went to the stable at six, and found Tubby, Gould, Pearson, and Reeves, there—about half-past six I saw Fetherston and his son come into the yard—I saw Reeves take a crow bar towards the house, and heard blows on the door—the two Fetherstons and Gould were with him—they said before that that they intended to go round to the house, as there was not enough on the premises to pay—the crow-bar was about four feet and a half long, and as thick as my wrist—my master asked me if there was anything left in the stable—I found that paper hung up, and gave it him (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Stephen Sabin, the prosecutor; I know Thomas Sabin, and all the rest. On Tuesday night, 7th May, about eleven o'clock, I saw Thomas Sabin and the elder Fetherston at my master's gate, with a light, and heard one of them say they would be in the house in the morning—the next morning I saw Reeves break the lock of the gate—the two Fetherstons were waiting outside, and came in—Fetherston then came to the front door, which was locked, and demanded admittance—I was inside—he said unless the door was opened he would break it open in less than ten minutes—they then went round to the side-door, and broke it open with a crow-bar—I cannot tell who broke it open—the two Fether<lb/>stons, Reeves, Tubby, and Gould, then came in—an inner door, leading from the wash-house into the kitchen, was also broken with violence—I had fastened the doors the night before, and they had not been undone that morning—Fetherston ordered the men to open the front-door and the front-parlour shutters, which was done, and some of them went up-stairs—my mistress went into hysterics—my master was not at home.</p>

A man named Brown was in the habit of using my house—I had a copper pump in my stable, worth 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had not seen it for some time when Gladwin came, and in consequence of what he said I found it was not there—Brown was apprehended by my direction, and I went on 17th May with him and Gladwin to the prisoner's shop—Gladwin asked Bryant if he had brought any copper or pump—he said he had brought some copper—Gladwin asked how much—he said, "2lbs. or 31bs."—he produced this, and said, "That is it" (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—that has nothing to do with my pump—this metal is much thinner—my pump weighed 6lbs. or 7lbs., and had a sort of cylinder, or basin, at the top.</p>

On Sunday, 11th May, about 10 minutes past six o'clock, I heard a noise, got up and opened my window, and saw Royal standing outside the window in the court with a young man—I asked what they wanted, and at that moment Roach stepped out of the parlour window into the court—I had bolted that window when I went to bed, about half-past eleven the night before, and the shutters were bolted—I slipped on my trowsers, ran down-stairs, and followed them—the young man dropped a loaf at the top of the court—I did not meet a policeman till I got into Mint-street; I then gave Royal into custody—they had all three gone away toge<lb/>ther—I am certain the prisoners are the parties, for they looked up at me when I was at the window—the loaf was mine, and I also missed the other things stated—they had been just inside the window.</p>

About three o'clock in the morning of 18th April, I was on duty in Southampton-street, Lambeth, and heard some one walking in the yard at the back of the Southampton Arms public-house—I pulled myself up to the top of a side gate, looked over, and saw the prisoner coming down the stone-steps leading from the house into the yard—I could see him plainly; I have no doubt about him—I have known him for years, he is the son of the person who used to keep the house—I got down from the gate and went back for three or four yards, and he came and put his hands on the top of the gate, and his feet on the top of the bar, and got up—I asked what he did there—he said he was waiting for some Norman cows that were coming up by the railroad—I told him he had no business there, and he instantly went back—I went and spoke to Howard, another constable, and in two or three minutes I went in by ano<lb/>ther gate, leaving Howard there—I found the door at the top of the steps where I had seen the prisoner, wide open—I went in and called up the land<lb/>lord, and we searched the place all over, but could not find the prisoner.</p>

I was ordered to deliver them here by my employer"—the sack of oats was brought down shortly by Rayment, and Romain followed him down—I eventually took care of the cart, and Ward and Rayment were taken by Romain—I and Romain went with the cart afterwards to the barracks, and Romain took a sample of the oats—I after<lb/>wards went to the Belvedere Wharf, and saw Skelton—the foreman asked him, in my presence, how many oats he had put on Ward's cart that morning—he said, "Twelve quarters, I think," and after hesitating a little he said, "After I had given him twelve quarters, as I thought, he said he had not enough by one sack, and I took a sack and filled it and gave it him"—I then asked him whether they used sacks with different names on them—he said, "Yes, we do use odd sacks sometimes"—I said, "Did you have a sack with the name of Anderson on it?"—he said, "We had a sack with that name"—I then took him into custody—I kept sight of the cart all the time—I did not see Rayment in St. Giles's, or anywhere else, put a sack of oats on the cart.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Brandram and others, as foreman to the colour-works—they have a white-lead manu<lb/>factory at Rotherhithe—I have been in their employ thirteen years—the prisoner has been in their employ nearly nine years. On 5th Feb. he was loading his van under the crane at the mill-room door—he stood there to take his turn, and was loaded—he might have waited there ten minutes—near to where his van was there was behind the door a pile of twenty kegs of white lead placed one on the other in four rows, of five in each—they were of a particular size and quality, and a particular mark on them—I know what the prisoner had to take; it was four casks of 12cwt each, and two from 4cwt. to 4 1/2 cwt.—the small kegs were gallon kegs—this is one from the pile—after the prisoner had got the six casks that I saw loaded I had a com<lb/>munication from Murphy, and during the temporary absence of the prisoner I got into the van—I saw a slight aperture under the tarpauling—I opened it and I saw this keg there—I got down, and went to the place where the twenty kegs had been, and found only nineteen kegs, and each contained 28lbs. of superior quality—the prisoner was not to take any of this kind—he returned, and went on his journey to deliver his goods—I went to the superintendent, communicated what I had seen, and we followed the van together—the prisoner proceeded into the Deptford-road—I met a man, told him to stop Moss's van, and I went up to it with Mr. Villmowath—I said to the prisoner, "I want that keg you have got"—he appeared a little</p>

               <p>surprised—I said, "Come, let us have it"—he got up and got it down—I still remained with the van, and Mr. Villmowath and the prisoner went into the public-house—I still remained by the van till Mr. Villmowath said, "He is off"—Mr. Villmowath had said at first, "This is a bad job," and the prisoner said, "It is"—I left the keg till the policeman came and took possession of it—this is it—these sized kegs are not so much in use in our manufactory as others are.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Mr. William Boucher and two others. On Monday, 31st Dec, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to their warehouse at Bermondsey—he asked to see some low-priced butts of leather—I showed him two parcels—he selected some, which amounted to 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—he said, "You will send them in to-morrow morning, and send the invoice with them"—I said, "Yes, but I am not the master; I must have the cash for them on delivery of the goods"—he said, "Well, send them before nine o'clock in the morning; I shall be sure to be at home, and I will give the man the money"—I had sold him a small parcel of goods on the Friday before—that was for cash—it was the first time I had sold to him—after he was gone, I had the leather weighed—next morning I saw the leather loaded, and gave the invoice to Saxby—I told him to be sure to bring back the goods or the money—he left the yard with the goods at a little before eight o'clock, and returned a little after nine without the goods—(I suppose the distance from our place was about a mile and a half)—in consequence of what I heard from him, and by the direction of Mr. Vicary, I went with Saxby and the horse and cart, about eleven o'clock the same morning, to the prisoner's house—I knocked at the front-door, and spoke to a female—in consequence of what she said, I went round to the yard-door, knocked, but no one came—I waited about five minutes—I left Saxby there, and I went round again to the house-door—I knocked twice, and the door was opened by a female—I went in and went through the house into the warehouse—I saw the leather there—one of the parcels contained thirteen bales, of five butts each—I took up one of the bales, and opened the back-gate, and gave the bale to Saxby, who put it into the cart—I went back and attempted to get another bale, but the men in the yard locked the yard-gates; locked the warehouse-door, and locked me in and leather and all—I called to Saxby, who was outside, to come round to the house-door—he came into the house, and I came out and left him in charge—I went back to my employer, and communicated what had happened to Mr. Vicary—it was then about half-past eleven o'clock—I went back to the prisoner's house, and was let in at the front-door by the same female—I waited from half-past four till five—I then saw the prisoner—I asked him why he did not give the man the money as he promised—he said he had been disappointed of some money, and he could not—I said, "Well, then, I must have the goods"—he said that I should neither have goods nor money—I then sent Saxby to my employers, and after some more conversation with the prisoner, on the return of Saxby I sent for a policeman—the policeman said he did not know what it was, whether it was false pretences or a debt, and he could not detain the prisoner—at last, when I found I could not get the policeman to take him, I left—the prisoner told me I might stop as long as I liked, he should neither give me goods nor</p>

                  </hi>. On Monday, 31st Dec, I assisted Mr. Wilks in weigh<lb/>ing the bales of leather—there were thirteen bales of light butts, and three bales of heavy butts—Mr. Wilks took the weights down—these are the cor<lb/>rect weights he took down—next morning I went with my master's cart to the prisoner's house in Ann's-place, about eight o'clock—I knocked at the door—a man opened it—I told him I had brought the bales of leather from Boutcher and Co.—he told me to drive round to the back gates—I drove round, and the gates were open—I stopped my cart outside the gates, and two men who were there told me to bring the goods in—I said I could not bring them in till I saw Mr. Tucker—the cart was outside, and I waited in<lb/>side—Mr Tucker came in a little while—I showed him the invoice, and told him I had brought the goods, and 1 was to have the money for them; I could not leave them without—I put the invoice into his hand—I never received it back again—he said, "Very well, that is all right, put them down here"—that was inside the gates—I put the goods down, and he said, "They must be weighed"—I assisted in weighing them—he put down the weights on a slate—he did not let me see it, he took it in-doorts, and told me to drive round to the front—I drove round to the front, and the prisoner came to the front and asked me if I should like to have a pint of beer, or a glass of gin, it being a cold morning—I said yes, and he gave me sixpence—that had not the effect of getting me away from the door—I was at the door outside—he shut the door, and said he should be ready for me in a minute or two—in two or three minutes he opened the door, and said there was 21bs. short weight—I believe that would make a difference of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I told him I knew nothing about the weight, my orders were to bring the money back, and I must have it or the goods—I said our scales were very correct, and his might make that dif<lb/>ference—he said, "Oh, my good man, don't be alarmed, I will go with you in the cart and settle with Mr. Wilks"—that threw me off my guard—he went and got his hat, and got in the cart, and went with me—when we got to the Swan, the prisoner said, "Which way are you going? I am going this way," pointing down Swan-street, which leads to the Grange-road—as soon as he said that he jumped out of the cart over the front—I asked him why he did not come to settle with my master, and I whipped the horse to prevent his getting out, but he got out and went down Swan-street—I went after him, and overtook him about 200 yards off—I asked him why he did not come with me and settle with Mr. Wilks—he turned round and told me not to insult him—I told him I did not insult him, all I wanted was for him to come and settle with Mr. Wilks as he promised—I followed him down as far as the Grange-road, and then be said he would come and settle with Mr. Wilks in an hour—he went on, and I went and told Mr. Wilks—it was then a little past nine—I went to ray breakfast, and on my return, by direction of one of the partners, Mr. Wilks and I took the horse and cart and went to the pri<lb/>soner's—we tried to get the leather—we got one bundle, containing five butts, and then were told we should neither have money nor leather, and we came home without money or goods.</p>
