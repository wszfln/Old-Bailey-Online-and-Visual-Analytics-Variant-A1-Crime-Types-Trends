I am nine years old, and live with my parents at 19, Packington Street, Islington—on the evening of March 8th I saw the prisoner in Church Street, Islington—he asked me to go and get him a pint of beer in a can over the road—he gave me something in paper, I do not know what, and said, "Mind you don't lose your change"—I went across to a public-house and asked for the beer, and took a piece of money out of the paper—the landlord gave me the beer and the change—I went out and found the prisoner by the hoarding—he came forward to meet me—the landlord was behind me—the prisoner turned round and walked sharp—Mr. Cousens caught him, and brought him to me—I gave Mr. Cousens the beer and the change.</p>

I keep the King's Head, Upper Street, Islington—about half-past eight on this night Witz asked the barmaid for a can of beer, and gave her a coin, which she showed me—I saw that it was bad, but gave him the change, and followed him towards the hoarding—the prisoner came to meet him, and as he was handing the can and the money to the prisoner I rushed at him; he ran, but I never lost sight of him—I caught him and brought him back, took him to the station, and handed the coin to a policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, carrying on business at 52, Chrisp Street, Poplar, and 75, High Street, Whitechapel—on 9th January there was a fire at 75, High Street—I rented the whole house, but only occupied the shop, the rest of the house was let out in tenements to four families—about three or four weeks after the fire, Mr. Silverstein, living next door, told me something, and after that, on the 28th February, the prisoner spoke to me—he was one of the lodgers in the second floor—he called me, and said, "I want to speak to you, something private—I said, "What about?"—he said, "About the fire that occurred, I must have some money out of that job"—I said, "What do you mean?"—he said, "I must get £10 for myself, and £5 for my friend; I want £15, and unless you give me the £15, I correspond with Mr. King, the surveyor to the company," holding up a letter, "and I shall say that you authorised your brother-in-law to set fire to your premises—I said, "Unless you withdraw those words, I shall have to communicate with my solicitor at once"—I then left him—he called again on the 1st March, and called me out, and again asked for the same amount of money, and he said, "If you have not got all the money I shall take £5 in cash and a bill or an I O U to satisfy myself, or £10 in cash down, and I shall be satisfied"—I said, "You had better leave my premises at once"—he went away and called again next day, Sunday—he then said, "What are you going to do? are you going to give me the money? or shall I go to the company and make everything open, and show everything that happened?"—I said he must withdraw his words, or I should have to communicate with my solicitor—he called again on the 7th he called me out from my shop in Chrisp Street—he then said, "Now just look here, now is the time, this is the last time I call here, and unless you give me the £15," and he showed me a letter—I told him to go about his business, and slightly pushed him—at this time Mr. Marks was present, he stood outside and listened to the conversation—on Saturday, the 8th, I called on my solicitor, and on the 11th I received this letter; I then went to the Police-court and swore an information, and a warrant was granted—it is not true that I ever offered £10, £15, or £30 to the prisoner, or that I promised him any money at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner did not on the 28th say, "Mr. Moses, it you knew such a thing was going to be done, why did you not give us an notice to clear out of the place?"—I asked him to speak plainly what he meant—I did not drink with him afterwards—he never told me that he had to drag his wife down several flights of stairs, and that they were nearly burnt—I never offered him money—he asked me for it—I did not give him an I O U—I did not say to him, "Meet me at a public house, and I will give you an I O U"—it was on 7th March that Mr. Marks was present—the statement which the prisoner made at the Police-court is entirely untrue—I never mentioned the subject of the letter to Mr. Silverstein—the fire at my place was quite accidental—I was insured for £1,000, and I received £450 and the salvage, which was worth £200—I have known the prisoner sixteen or seventeen months—we never had any quarrel.</p>

I am a shoemaker, and live at 160, Cannon Street, Middlesbrough, Yorkshire—on 5th March I was in a public-house in the Waterloo Road, about six o'clock—I had a glass or two of beer and bread and cheese; I paid for it out of 18s. which I had (as near as I could guess) loose in my right-hand trousers pocket—as I stood at the bar the prisoner threw the door open three times in the course of ten minutes, and asked me out—I said, "What do you want me for? I am a stranger to you, and you to me; go about your business"—I never saw him before, and did not like his actions—I left the public house, and had walked about one-third of the way over Waterloo Bridge (that was ten minutes, I daresay, after the prisoner accosted me, and half an hour after I went into the public-house) when the prisoner and another man started to talk to me—they were both round me together—the prisoner rifled this pocket where the money was—I tried to extricate myself from him, and the prisoner hit me on the side of my ear, and I was knocked down—I lost sight of him—I made my way to the Strand, and there laid hold of the prisoner, who was walking along—I told him he had robbed me of my money, and I should give him into charge—he wrenched himself away, and tore his coat in so doing; then I lost sight of him for a few seconds—a boy made a communication to me, and I saw the prisoner again in a public-house—I laid hold of him again, and he wrenched himself away again—I next saw him at the Police-station, and recognised and charged him.</p>

"I have done nothing; I am no thief; let me go"—I took him to Bow Street; the prosecutor came on with another officer—I afterwards took the prisoner to Bridewell Place Police-station—I found on him a pawn-ticket for a coat and vest—I made inquiries about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Lieutenant-Commander in the Argentine Navy, and am living with my family at 5, Clarence Terrace, Regent's Park—my brother, Raffael Garcia, occupied a bedroom on the top floor; the prisoner was his valet, and occupied a bed in a recess in his room, and was separated by a lath-and-plaster partition from the female servants' bedroom—on 4th February, in consequence of some complaint made to me by Mary Fitzgerald, I sent for the prisoner and told him I had good reason for being discontented with him; I had not scolded him before, because he was my brother's servant; but I said, "I have heard that you have made a hole in the wall between the servants' room and your own room; I have had reason to complain very often of your conduct, and the next time you misbehave yourself I will give you a good thrashing, and send you on board the <hi rend="italic">Brown</hi>"—he did not say a word—later, the same day, I handed to Miss Bathgate, my cook and housekeeper, £80 in notes, and 10s. 6d.; there were three £10 notes, which I had obtained from the London Joint Stock Bank, and three of the £5 notes from Baring Brothers—my brother was out that evening—I and my family went to bed about ten o'clock; there were two young children with us—before going to bed I had been making some photographic enlargements, using a kerosene lamp, in a room behind the library—I am perfectly certain that I put out the lamp before going to bed—about twenty minutes past two I was</p>

               <p>aroused by an alarm of fire—I tried to get downstairs, but could not for the smoke, which was very dense indeed; afterwards we all got out by the fire-escape from the second floor window; my brother and the prisoner as well—shortly afterwards, about a quarter to six, I came back to the house and spoke to the prisoner—I told him that he had disobeyed my orders, which I had given him that very day, not to quarrel with the female servants, and I then remonstrated with him for not taking care of the house, because he was the last person to go upstairs, and then I sent him away at a moment's notice, and told him to go—he took his clothes with him; he never sent for them afterwards—I was present the same morning when the salvage man made a search in the kitchen, and I saw him find some gold and silver coins—later the same afternoon I went up to my brother's room and saw this rope (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) hanging to the ventilating pipe which runs down the side of the house, by the window; it was fastened by a reef knot and put on to a bite—that would be strong enough to hold a man, particularly if he was a sailor, which the prisoner is, and if he helped himself down the ventilator—I recognised the rope as one that had been on a trunk of my brother's, which he brought over from Paris; I had last seen it some months before—I am certain it was not hanging on the ventilator the night before.</p>

I am cook and housekeeperinthe service of Captain Garcia, at 5, Clarence Terrace—I found some holes in the wall in the prisoner's room—the prisoner said that Captain Manuel had scolded him, and we had to look out—that occurred after one on the 14th—between four and five in the afternoon I received some bank-notes from my master, three £10 and ten £5 notes—I paid away some of that money—at nine that evening I was in the front kitchen with the prisoner and the kitchenmaid Julia Pettit—I then sealed one £10 note and nine £5 notes in an envelope, and £5 10s. in gold and 10s. in silver in my purse, and I put the purse and notes into a small moveable desk, and put the desk into a drawer in the dresser—I did not lock the drawer or desk; Lieut. Garcia was out that evening—Captain Garcia and the family went to bed before me and the servants, I went to bed at eleven—Pettit and Fitzgerald went at the same time—I put out the gas in the kitchen, I saw that the fire was out, and that everything was safe—I left the prisoner in the hall; it was his duty to wait up for the Lieutenant—a little after two I heard the alarm of fire—I escaped down the fire escape—I was afterwards present when the £5 10s. was found by the salvage man—in the afternoon I saw the prisoner and Fitzgerald filling a lamp from a large paraffin-can, holding about three gallons, it was nearly full—the lamp was brought down from the photographic room, it was filled in the pantry at the back, and the can was put out in the back yard—I saw that can about six next morning in the same place, it was then nearly empty.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Lieutenant in the Argentine Navy, and am brother of Captain Garcia—on the night of 4th February I returned home about twenty-five minutes to one; the prisoner let me in—I noticed a strange smell as I came in—I attributed it to kerosene—I said to the prisoner, "There is a strange smell in the house"—he said, "It is not astonishing, for your brother, the Captain, has been making enlargements with a photographic lantern"—I went to the library and saw some photographs which my brother had been doing—I said no more about it; I considered the explanation sufficient—there was no smoke—I went up to bed immediately, the prisoner followed me up; after putting out the gas he lighted a candle and lighted me up after we had got up to the bedroom the prisoner went down again to fetch a letter for me—he brought it up; he was gone not more than three minutes—before going to bed he asked me whether I believed what had been said against him in the day—I answered that I had nothing to say; I would have no conversation with him—before going to sleep I looked at my watch, and it was five minutes to one—I was awoke by the ringing of the door bell—I did not look at my watch then, but I appreciated the time afterwards as something after two—I got up on hearing my brother calling me from downstairs—I could not see the I prisoner at that time, the room was dark, and a curtain separated the recess from where I was—I called him; he did not answer the first time, I had to call him two or three times—I saw him get out of bed, he was undressed—I immediately went down to my brother's room; the smoke was too dense to allow me to get down lower—I came up again to my own room, and told the prisoner to take a sheet, and put into it whatever he could of my clothing out of the wardrobe—he immediately executed my order—I then left the room, leaving him doing that—I returned to the room in three or four minutes with a ladder, which I took into the next room, called the spare room—I went to the window, and saw the prisoner on the roof of the bath-room, which was more than four feet below—he said, "If we only had a rope we could get out that way and save the babies"—I did not see any rope—hearing that the fire escape was coming, I told him to come up to me, and we could get down by that—after the fire was out I returned to the house; I was present when my brother sent the prisoner away—I sent him away at the same time—I did not hear him say that he had some things in his pocket belonging to me; he might have had, because I had told him to gather all the things he could—I myself took some of the jewels—I told him to put in his pocket what he could; I did not mention jewels or anything specially—afterwards, some time the same day, I saw the rope hanging from the ventilating pipe—the detective afterwards showed me a</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hay merchant, of Molesham, near Chelmsford—on 17th May last I was passing down Brecknock Road, and my attention was attracted to No. 225, "Brecknock Farm Dairy, established 1837"—I went in and saw Scotchford—Plenty was there, doing something to some milk-churns, washing them out and putting milk into them—I asked Scotchford if he was a buyer of good hay—he said, "Have you a sample?"—I said, "Yes," and showed it to him; he asked what I wanted for it—I said six guineas a load, cash in a month—it was old hay—he said he could take one load, and he would take two if I would give him a month—I told him it was lying at Tufnell Park Station, and gave him a written order <hi rend="italic">to</hi> receive the two loads there—on 29th May I called again with a sample of chaff—Scotchford examined it and said he would consider and let me know—I think he told me, the following week when I called, that he would take a truck-load of it—the price was six guineas a load, there are three loads in a truck, that would be £18 18s.—the bags were to be returned and paid for—I consigned the chaff to Tufnell Park Station, and sent him the railway order to clear—I then received this letter, which is in his writing. (<hi rend="italic">From Scotchford, stating that he would remove the chaff from the railway station that day</hi>)—after that I took him some samples of potatoes, I asked him £4 a ton for them, he said it was too much, and I took £3 12s. a ton—he ordered a truck-load, and I sold him 4 tons 16 cwt. at £3 12s., which he was to let me have when I called round—I then received this letter, dated June 14th. (<hi rend="italic">From Scotchford, saying that he had disposed of the potatoes and had cleared the cheque</hi>)—on June 25th he gave me an order for potatoes £3 12s. 6d., and hay £16 168., cash in a month—on June 24th I called on him for payment for the first lot; I told him the amount was getting rather large, and I should not deliver any more till I had the money for what</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189003240023"/>
               <p>I had delivered—he said that lately he had been laying out a great deal of money, and I saw some things there—he said if I would take a bill he would pay me ready money for the order, and that he had five horses—I said that if he got the bill backed by some responsible man I would not object to it—he said, "Well, I am known about here; everybody knows me; it will be right enough if you take the bill"—I asked him if the things in the yard belonged to him, or if anybody had a lien on them—he said no, they belonged to him—I believed that, and believed him to have been established in 1837—this is the bill for the total amount, £48, up to that time—having taken the bill, which was payable in two months, I sent him some more goods on June 24th, four tons of potatoes and a truck-load of hay—a truck-load is two loads—a correction in the bill is initialled by him—my bankers said it was not secure as it was—I also sent 3 tons 9 cwt. of potatoes, at his request, to Carpenters Road, Stratford; also two loads of hay to Tufnell Park Station—he sent me eight ragged bags, but my bags were not returned—on 7th July I received this letter from him.(<hi rend="italic">Stating that he would forward the bags that day, and inquiring for oats and good hay</hi>)—I did not send him any hay, as the only money I had was eighteenpence, the difference on one bill—the bill was dishonoured, and nothing I sent was paid for—I instructed my solicitor to take proceedings against him—I once saw a van there with what looked like packages of eggs, aerated water cases, and butter firkins; it was pretty full—Plenty was driving it, and a man was beside him—he drove down Holloway Road—the total value of the goods included in the bill was between" £70 and £80—I believed it was a genuine business—I saw horses in the stable.</p>

               <p>London and County Bank—Scotchford opened an account there on 13th July, 1889, with £49 5s. 3d., which included two cheques; one was for £20 5s. 3d., signed E. Plenty, on the Central Bank of London, which was returned dishonoured—after that several cheques presented were returned, there not being sufficient funds to meet them—on August 8th I wrote to say that we could not continue to carry on the account; but it was not formally closed till the end of September—no payments were received after August 8th, when the balance was 18s. 7d.—between August 8th and 24th twelve cheques were presented, amounting to over £100, and returned dishonoured.</p>

"Then your name is Joseph Scotchford?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I am a police officer, and I hold a warrant for your arrest"—he said, "Very well"—I took him to the station—I then went to the house I saw him come out of, and found a number of books and documents relating to the business at Brecknock Road, and some milk-cans with the name of Scotchford engraved on them, and a piece of paper pasted over it, also pass-books and cheque-books of both banks, and these two cheques (<hi rend="italic">To Webb and Andsell</hi>) and this rent-book, headed, "Mr. Williams to E.

On 24th January I was with Sergeant Richards about five o'clock in Swan Place, Old Kent Road, and arrested Plenty on a warrant for conspiring with F. Scotchford and others, in obtaining goods from Waldemar, Peterson, and others, which I road to him—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I took him to Scotland Yard, searched him, and found a number of cards of E. Plenty, Dairy Furnisher, Swan Place, Old Kent Road, and a cheque-book on the Central Bank of London, Mile End Branch—four of the cheques are signed "Emma Plenty"—on the same day I took him to Marylebone Lane Police-station, where he said, "Who am I charged with conspiracy with?"—I said, "With a man named J. Scotchford"—he said, "I don't know him"—ho gave his address 92, Godliman Road, Forest Gate—I went there, and found a number of cards of "E. Plenty, contractor to supply dairymen with all kinds of utensils to carry out dairy business, 45, Tredegar Road, Bow," and "E. Plenty, Swan Place, Old Kent Road"; also an undated letter, signed "L. Williams," from 2, Hilary Road, Walworth—that is Scotchford's address—I did not find the envelope—I also found a number</p>

I am a dairyman, at 26, Marlborough Road, Hornsey—on Saturday, the 8th March, between half-past eight and nine at night, I was in the Prince Arthur public-house in the Caledonian Road—I saw the prisoners there—I took out my canvas bag to pay for what I had; it contained between £5 and £6—I could not say to a fewshillings—anyone standing round could see me take it out—I put it back in my pocket and then left, and went round the corner to a urinal—as I came out of it three or four assaulted me—I received a blow at the side of my ears, and then I received one at the other side of my head—Bartlett struck the first blow, and Wheeler the second—they were not very violent blows—one caught hold of me by my arms, and the other put his hand over my mouth—I could not call out or do anything—Wheeler took the money out of my left trousers pocket, and then they both ran away—I got a policeman, and wont in search of them—I found Wheeler in the Offord Arms about half an hour afterwards; I charged him with having committed this assault and robbery—he made no remark in my presence—at the Police-court Wheeler asked me whether I had not asked Bartlett to drink with me—I have not the slightest doubt as to the identity of the two prisoners.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector S</hi>). On 24th February I went with Sergeant White to 5, Took's Court, Chancery Lane, where the prisoner rents an office in the front parlour, as a law-writer—three or four men were working there in his employment—I reed the warrant to him—he said, "I know nothing about it; how did I forge it?"—I said, "The allegation is that you obtained a cheque from Mr. Newport, and said you wanted to send it into the country, and this cheque was not sent into the country; you are accused of tracing the signature, and thereby forging the bill"—he said, "I did not say I wanted to send the cheque into the country; I sent it to a girl at Vigo Street"—I said, "If you wish me to make inquiries of her I will do so, if you will give me her name, etc. "'—he said, "I cannot, I have not seen her since; she was a girl off Piccadilly"—I said, "I shall have to search your place'—he said, "You can, search my place and me too"—on the way to the station, in a cab, I searched his pockets, and came across the letter which Sergeant White wrote to him—I handed it to Sergeant White, and the prisoner said, "You smile; I had no idea who it came from, but I wrote a reply to it"—I also found two pawn-tickets on him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The £300 was obtained on 17th December—one pawn ticket was dated January 28, for a gold albert £7, and the other on February 5, for a pin £1—he was pawning those things within three months of his getting this £300—this letter was written by Sergeant White, to get a specimen of his writing—he wrote a letter to me from prison, when he knew he would be charged with forgery—I have not got it with me—as far as I could see, there was not the slightest attempt to disguise his writing—Took's Court is let out in a number of offices—I</p>

                  </hi>. I have had a great many years' experience in the study of handwriting—in February last I received from the solicitor to the bank, the bill of exchange, the letter of authority to the bank, the cheque for £2 10s., and the letter and envelope written by the prisoner, and the bank notes with the endorsements—I studied them—I have compared the writing in the prisoner's letter with the bill of exchange, and say that it is his disguised writing, and also the acceptance on the bill, and the endorsement, and the receipt for the money and the letter of authority to the manager, which is an imitation of a woman's hand—Mr. Newport's signatures have been traced from the signature to the cheque; they fit exactly—it is utterly impossible that any man can write his name exactly the same three times, or even twice—the figures on the bill and on the letter of authority have been traced from the signature to the cheque; that has been the model—I believe the endorsements on both notes are the prisoner's disguised writing, written very rapidly—this letter of advice to the manager is in an imitated woman's writing, and the person who wrote it knew that Mr. Newport had a woman to do his writing for him—the "L "standing for "pounds" is written with a very fine pen, in imitation of a woman's writing, and it is written rapidly—I recognise the prisoner's writing through all these documents, and am quite prepared to give the particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> All the writing is disguised except the genuine letter, by which I mean that there are more dissimilarities than similaritiesthe most characteristic thing about the forgery is a dot under the "th"; that runs through every document—I was not asked to examine any documents in Pullen's case—in the document signed Morris Harris, October 1st, there is a dot under the "st," but not like this—I have not read an anecdote about myself in Mr. Montagu Williams' book, and if I had I should not attach importance to it—he was very angry with me for beating him—the Jury thought I was wrong in the matter of the Lord Mayor of London—this is not a cross between a Greek "d" and a German "d"—the "d "in the cheque signed "Ridgway and Co. "in Pullen's case is a common sort of "d, I mean the "d "in Saunders—the best test of handwriting is not the slope of the letters, if a man disguises it he then does <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi> and writes upright.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 270, Cornwall Road, Notting Hill—in 1886 I owned 268, Cornwall Road—in April that year Fraser called on me with reference to that house—he asked me if the house was mine—I said not quite; I had not quite completed the purchase—he asked me if I should want to let it; I said, "Certainly"—he said he thought he should be able to find me a desirable tenant—in June, 1886, when the house became mine, Fraser called on me, and brought mo a sort of document to sign, to the effect that if he found me a tenant I would pay him the usual 5 per cent, commission on the first year's rent—I have not got it—two or three days after that he brought Scorey as the tenant—I saw Fraser afterwards, and he gave, as references for Scorey, A. Denning, 14, Corinne Road, Holloway; and W. Scott, Westow Hill, Sydenham—I wrote to both addresses, and had favourable replies that Scorey would be a most desirable tenant in every way—I signed this agreement, which Fraser drew up and charged half a guinea for. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 22nd June,</hi> 1886, <hi rend="italic">between Miss Hamilton and Scorey, for the letting of the house for three years, at a yearly rent of</hi> £45)—I gave Scorey the key; he did not enter into possession for ten weeks—he paid no rent—I cannot say I tried to enforce the covenant for the payment of rent—I tried on 30th September, 1886, to take possession—I had a key, and I went in and had possession for two days; it was empty as far as I know—I locked it up—Denning broke in at the dining-room window in the middle of the night, and gave Scorey possession again—Scorey remained in possession till 7th January, 1887, when he wrote a document, cancelling the agreement, after I had employed the broker who tried to get into the house, and negotiated with Scorey—a man giving the name of Gurling, who is like Gurling, but whom I cannot identify, came about Christmas, 1886, and said he could gain possession for me if I paid him £6, and I agreed to do so if he gave me possession by the date he named—he did not get possession, but Scorey came, and I got the agreement back on 7th January, and got possession about 10th February—as Gurling had tried, I paid £3 to Denning, to be shared between Gurling and Denning, as they said they were in partnership as brokers—they came together to me the first time I saw them—</p>

               <p>Brown was a lodger at 268, Cornwall Road—I paid him 10s. after he had gone out and his things had been removed, as compensation for disturbance—Gurling promised to eject him for me, but did not succeed—Score'came one night and said for £5 consideration he would cancel the agreement—I paid it, and got this document, cancelling the agreement—Scorey said it was as good as getting the agreement back—in it he agreed to bring no action against me in respect to the levy, and I to bring no action against him to recover rent—I had to pay Denning and Gurling £3 for trying to get rid of Brown, as well as the £3 for getting rid of Scorey, and Denning would not go out till I paid him £3 or £4—I paid three sums, one for Scorey, one for Brown, and one for Denning; but Gurling had nothing to do with the third £3—Denning and Mrs. Turton were living in the house—I paid £14 10s. altogether for getting rid of them, £2 5s. for getting the tenants, and 10s. 6d. for the agreement—I am very nearly sure Mrs. Turton is the person; she gave the name of Mrs. Denning—she lived some considerable time at 286, with Denning, as Mr. and Mrs. Denning—I tried to put a distress in, but the broker did not succeed—the only distress levied was that effected by Gurling—I recovered nothing, but lost something by it—Scorey was absent then—these people were in from July till February—the house was left in such a bad state that I gladly took £100 less for it than I had given six months before—I sold it while they were in it, in January, 1887, as it stood, at a loss of £100.</p>

I have independent means—I am thirty-seven years of age—I was anxious to let the house—I thought if I had an agreement I was safe to get my money—Scorey went in on 20th July—I agreed to let him have it from the half-quarter—the half quarter's rent, £5 12s. 6d., was due in September—I got into the house between 7 and 8 p.m. on 30th September—I knew I was doing wrong by going in, but I was advised to do it as a last resource—I had not asked for the rent before I broke in; it was the day after it was due—I was told it was his business to bring it to me—I did not stop in the house for two days, but I kept possession of it—I knew Scorey was away when I went in—I kept him out for two days—I heard Mr?. Scorey come back the same night, but not Scorey—he had no lodgers there then, as far as I know—he had had some before; as far as I know they were respectable—I was at my window, and saw them all go away—I only stopped in the house long enough to bolt the front door and go out at 4he back—the rest of the house appeared to me to be empty—Scorey was in possession till 10th January, but I could not get in till February, because of the lodgers who remained, Gurling and Denning, and Mr. and Mrs. Brown—I don't remember ever asking Scorey for any rent—he only complained of the way I had treated him, by letter—an action might have been brought against me for going into the house illegally—Scorey gave me possession of the house at last, Gurling did not—Gurling said he had taken an inventory of the furniture—I did not see it—on the Wednesday before 10th January I signed for them to make an inventory to make a distress—I did not demand rent.</p>

               <p>payable to E. Scorey, and was for 5s.—you told me he had a banking account—I did not know he had £60 at the London and South-Western Bank when he took the house—you said you would do the agreement for half a guinea less than an ordinary solicitor's charges—I was satisfied with the references—after Scorey took possession I had no transactions with you—when I had paid your commission I had finished with you—I should say you were not responsible for what occurred afterwards—if any other house-agent had introduced Scorey and given a reference I should have paid him commission.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Gurling.</hi> You called on me about the distress, and I said, "Use any means you like"—I signed a warrant at the second or third interview; Dr. Nott, a gentleman living in my house, persuaded me to sign it—he said, "Get a strong gang, and throw the people and furniture out"—you got a strong lot—Scorey gave you instructions to withdraw—you brokered on your own account—I paid Denning everything; not you—you brought the agreement to me—I asked you to get; Brown out, and I signed a warrant on his goods when I found I could not eject him by force—you got him out; I paid the costs of moving and the expenses on the warrant.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Brown.</hi> I cannot say if you ever received the money, except that I had your signature on a receipt; I paid it to Denning to give to you—you showed me your lodger's book—I don't know if you were connected with Denning, Gurling, and the others—I employed them to eject you illegally.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 46, Maryland Road, Paddington, and I am a builder—I know Scorey and Gurling—I first saw Scorey about the middle or end of September, 1888; he called on me at my address—he gave the name of Scorey, and said he saw I had the letting of a shop, 196, Cambridge Road, which he had seen, and said he thought it would suit him, and he wanted it for the business of a furniture shop—I said the rent was £50 a year, I could lot him have it, provided his references were satisfactory—he agreed to the rent, and gave me as two references, C. Brown, 58, Netherwood Road, West Kensington, and Truson, 42, Gillet Road, Thornton Heath—I wrote to those addresses and received these satisfactory replies, and on them agreed to let the shop to Scorey—he went into possession about 29th September, 1888—there was an agreement for three years at £50 a year, commencing from Michaelmas, 1888—I was only agent, and so I forwarded the agreement to the owner—we got possession of the house again in May, 1889—he paid no rent during that time—I several times tried to get it from him—I took proceedings in the County Court and</p>

               <p>got an ejectment order against him, but we could not find him to serve the order—he had left the house, and left it in Gurling's possession—the shop was never opened—Gurling lodged on the first floor back room of the house, which was let out in rooms to about five lodgers—none other of the prisoners lived there that I am aware of—Gurling told me he could soon get possession if we wanted it, for a matter of £1 or £2—I did not do so, but took proceedings in the County Court—I saw Gurling go in and out of the house two or three times—when I got possession in May the house was knocked about a good deal, and was in bad condition; some of the basement flooring was gone, three coal-cellar doors were taken away—I did not see the furniture in the house.</p>

               <p>to repairs being done—we agreed to allow him the half-quarter's rent up to Christmas, 1888, for the repairs—the rent was to be £40 a year—he gave as references James Jenner and Wells—I corresponded with them, and received these replies.

Morgan said he would not give him anything to get possession—a day or two afterwards, Gurling called again, and we agreed to pay £5 for the possession of 133, Chesterton Road, and the following Saturday I went over, and received possession from Gurling; I paid him £5—this is the receipt I got for it. (<hi rend="italic">This receipt was dated</hi> 13<hi rend="italic">th July</hi>)—while Grant was in possession, I called on him once or twice; I could never get inside; I used to meet Grant in the road; his wife and baby were with him; he had no lodgers, I think—he did not do the repairs he agreed to do—I received no rent for the premises—the house was in a very bad state of repair—when it was given up several panes of glass were broken; the locks and windows were screwed up—I let another house. 46, Tavistock Crescent, to Owen Wood, who came about March, 1889, to our office with Gurling—he entered into this agreement, to take that house for seven years from 25th March, 1889, at £46 a year—I asked for references, and had the names of William Stevens, 190, Kilburn Lane, and Mr. F. Brown, 58, Netherwood Road—this is Stevens's reply to my inquiry. (<hi rend="italic">This said that Wood would be found a suitable person for a tenant</hi>)—this is Brown's reply. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had known Wood for some years, and that as hit tenant he was punctual in his payments, and he had every reason for believing he would be found a desirable tenant</hi>)—the first quarter, due on 24th June, was allowed for repairs, which Wood, the tenant, did—two days before 29th September, when rent became due, Wood went out of possession—he paid no rent—I went to the house two days after the 29th; I found lodgers there; Wood had gone—I then called on Gurling, who lived close by—on September 3rd I had had this letter from Gurling.

(<hi rend="italic">The reply from Foreman stated that he had known Brown about twenty-five years as a respectable and trustworthy tradesman, and in a position to pay rent of any premises he tool: That from Bastard said he had known Brown for many years and always heard him spoken of as a very honest man„but that he did not know anything about his means</hi>)—on receiving those replies I let the house to Brown—this is the agreement signed by him, it is for three years, in the ordinary form—the rent was £65 a year—he took possession on 16th October, 1888—at Christmas the first quarter's rent, less a deduction, became due—I got no rent—I applied several times for it—I saw Brown several times; he made the excuse that he had not the money to pay, but that as soon as he got it he would pay us—he continued in possession for going on for nine months—my client had to put the matter in the hands of his solicitor—no rent was obtained—after it became due I had a visit from Gurling one evening, who said he had nothing to do with Brown, he was connected with a loan office, and he came to know if Brown owed me any money, because he wanted to apply for a loan from an office he was connected with—he got no money from me—then the matter passed out of my hands, Mr. Saunders, the landlord, put it into his solicitor's hands.</p>

Smith, with regard to 18, Norland Road—I called there to see Fraser—I could not see him; I left a message, and he called at my office about 19th October, 1889—a letter had been sent to him demanding payment of the rent, and he called in reference to the letter, and said he was not then prepared to pay the rent—after some conversation I asked whether he was prepared to give up possession, as he had broken the covenants of his agreement, if I gave him a receipt for the quarter's rent</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189003240057"/>
               <p>due at Michaelmas—he said, with a sneer, "I want more than a quarter's rent"—I said he would not get it, and we should have to distrain—he said we could distrain; there were goods on the first floor belonging to himself, and the other furniture belonged to the lodgers—on the 18th December I went with Mr. Smith, the landlord, to 18, Norland Street; I there saw Eraser in a back room, first floor—there was very little furniture in the room—I said if he would give vacant possession at once we would give him £3—he consented to that, and promised to give notice to the lodgers on the following Saturday, and that we should have possession before Christmas—I had subsequent interviews and correspondence with him, and we ultimately got possession on 27th January—two quarters' rent were due then—I got no rent from him—I paid him £2 10s., not £3—there were three sets of lodgers at that time; Mrs. Fincham was living on the first floor—the house was in a bad state of repair.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Fraser.</hi> I wrote on 17th October, asking for the rent, and you said you would pay on the following Saturday—I offered to let you off the rent then—I may have applied to you by letter afterwards—Mr. Smith instructed me to do what I could—I called at the house on several occasions after the rent was due—I asked the lodgers what amounts they paid; I did not ask them to produce their rent-books; I think I informed them that you had not paid your rent the second time I went—I called on you with Mr. Smith—you offered me the house with the lodgers in—I refused that, and to!4 you that vacant possession would be required—you said that a lodger's wife was daily expecting to be confined—I afterwards heard that Mrs. Underwood was confined, but she was out before Christmas—I think this interview was a fortnight before Christmas—on the Saturday before you gave up possession you said you had a difficulty about getting a lodger named Humphreys out of the top floor, and I drew up a letter to him—I very likely suggested that you should pay him for his removal; I did not arrange that you should pay the rent by instalments; nothing was said about instalments—you said that eventually Mr. Smith should have his rent, and that you were not going to cheat him out of his money—I went over the house with you on 27th January—you had locked up all the rooms—I said it was in a very bad state; I complained about the repairs, and told you it would cost Mr. Smith £14 or £15 to put it in decent order—I said I thought you were acting very unjustly, and you admitted it—one of the doors was broken—the agreement was endorsed, "Cancelled by mutual consent," on the understanding that no claim should be made against you.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The letter from Clayton said Edwards would be found a most eligible tenant, and good for the rent named. That from Smith said Edwards would be found in every way a most desirable tenant, and in a position to pay the rent</hi>)—this agreement for tenancy for three years, at £40 a year, was drawn up and sent to Graham, and was returned signed by Edwards with a letter from Graham—I paid £2 in cash, on the day we received the agreement, to Graham, who called at the office; he is the prisoner Farrell—our book-keeper identifies him; I cannot—the first rent became due on 25th December—I received information, and in consequence of it Farrell and Scorey were taken into custody through my and Marshall's information—our case first brought the matter before the criminal courts—we got possession of the house when they were arrested at the end of December or the beginning of January; we got no rent—I recognise Gurling, who called very soon after the proceedings at Bow Street, and said he was very well acquainted with Scorey and Farrell, who were then in custody, and he could give me a great deal of information as to their past history—he told me they had robbed him of a piano twelve or eighteen months previously, when they were carrying it for him, and he told me of several other cases where they had taken houses, and left without paying rent—he called several times—after Farrell and Scorey were committed he told me he should be able on behalf of Mrs. Scorey, who was living at the house, 71, Disraeli Road, to get rid of her if I could pay him for his trouble—I don't think he mentioned any figure—he told me on a previous occasion he had received £5, and he showed me a receipt—I think he asked £5, and came down to £2—in the end I gave him 10s.—Mrs. Scorey was out of the house before, but she had taken the keys of the house with her, and I got them back then.</p>

               <p>William Clayton, 69, Endleaham Road, Balham, and Graham, Lillie Road, "West Brompton—I wrote and received most satisfactory replies, which I have destroyed—I let him the house; this is the agreement—he had possession about 25th September—I went to the house about a week afterwards, but not inside—Farrell occupied it; I saw his wife, no one else there—he remained in possession about five weeks—from information I received I ordered him" out—he paid no rent—he left the premises in a dirty condition—I am not aware of his having any lodgers there—there was a piece of paper in the window, with "apartments to let" written on it—afterwards I went to 87, Lillie Road, and found it was a sweetstuff shop—after going there I called at Farrell's house; he was not at home; he came to my shop—I asked him where Mr. Clayton was living—he said Mr. Clayton had moved from 69, Endlesham Road—I could not find him there—I asked him where Mr. Graham was—he said he did not know; he said he was a traveller—I said, "I thought so, he seems to have travelled pretty well; I have come to this conclusion, that you got into that house, 12, Holland Road, by a fraud; I am satisfied these two letters were frauds; they were written by one and the same hand, and on the strength of that I shall make you get out, hand me over the key and the agreement, and get away as soon as you can, otherwise I shall take steps to enforce it"—he did not actually deny it was so, but I protested it was—he may have denied it; I cannot call to mind his words—he said I need not be so sharp on him; "I can show you rent receipts for four years"—I said, "I should not value them any more than the letters I hold in my hands"—he asked me if he gave me the agreements and keys, would I let him have the letters back—I said I would consider that later on—I ultimately let him have till twelve o'clock the following Monday to get out—he said he would get out to-morrow if I would let him have 10s.—I said, "I have not 10s. to let you have"—he said, "Do you think the landlord would let me have 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>?"—I said, "I shall strongly advise him not to do so; you get out as quick as you can"—I was informed he left on the following Sunday night—he paid no rent.</p>

This matter was placed in my hands for inquiry at the beginning of November—I obtained a warrant on 12th November for the arrest of certain persons, A. Smith, Clayton, Graham, and Edwards—Smith, Clayton, and Edwards are all Scorey, and Graham is Farrell—on the night of 23rd November, about ten, I saw Scorey detained at Fulham Police-station on my order—I said, "I am Inspector Marshall from Scotland Yard, what is your name?"—he said, "William Scorey"—I said, "What is your address"—he said, "I decline to toll you"—I said, "I find you have had letters left at 468, Fulham Road in the name of Smith, and that you represented that as your address, and I believe you are the Smith for whose apprehension I hold a warrant"—he said, "Well, I admit I have been calling there for letters in that name"—I searched him and found this pocket-book, with many addresses in it; on the fly-leaf is "Endlesham Road," and on the second page is "69, Endlesham Road, W. Clayton"—I said, "I believe your name is William Edwards, and that you reside at 71, Disraeli Road, Putney, and I believe you are the man I have been following from time to time"—he said, "You seem to know all about it, that is my address, I live there in that name"—I left him at the Police-station, and went to that address with Sergeant Drew—I found in the house Mrs. Turton and her son-Harry, and this letter, addressed Mr. Farrell, 61, Grant Road, Clap-ham Junction, ready for posting, was lying on the table; it is in a woman's writing, and is signed Vennie—I then returned to Fulham Police-station at two or three on Sunday morning—after three I saw Scorey there—I read the warrant to him, and told him the charge of conspiring with Graham and others, and obtaining £2 from Mr. Brandon of 15, Essex Street, would be preferred against him, and that he had also obtained possession of 71, Disraeli Road by false pretences, also from correspondence that he was himself a reference to get into that house—I said, "You have also corresponded with others to get possession of 69, Endlesham Road, in precisely the same way, and amongst you have been getting possession of</p>

               <p>houses all over London upon references to each other, and you never paid your landlords or the tradesmen, and finally absconded; "I also said, "I believe you got possession of 14, Oxberry Avenue in the name of Samuels, also that you are Grant, and had letters left at an address in Bayswater, and I am not at all certain that you are not Graham"—he said, "I admit being Edwards, Samuels, and Clayton, and I have already told you I had letters in the name of Smith, but I deny being Graham or Grant"—I took him to Bow Street Police-station. and charged him—on the way there he repeated the statement in various forms; he continued to talk about it—he made no further reply when the charge was entered—in consequence of the letter addressed to Farrell, I went to 61, Grant Road, between 7 and 8 a.m., on Sunday, 24th November—I got the assistance of Sergeant Bremner and other officers, and about nine I knocked at the door, a female answered it—I inquired for Farrell, and was directed to a top front room—I knocked at the door, Farrell answered it—I said, "I am Inspector Marshall from Scotland Yard, and wish to know your name <hi rend="italic">n</hi>—he said, "Martin Farrell is my name"—I said, "I hold a warrant for a person called M. Graham, and I believe you are he; you gave that name, and an address, 4, The Pavement, Upper Tooting"—he said, "Yes, but I simply had my letters left there—I read the warrant to him, and he said "I hardly understand"—I said, "You are charged with conspiring with William Edwards and others in obtaining from Mr. Brandon, of 15, Essex Street, Strand, £2, and also obtaining possession of 71, Disraeli Road by false pretences"—he said, "I admit having the £2 from Mr. Brandon, but I knew nothing of it, I only acted as an agent"—I brought him out of the room, and put him in a cab in charge of other officers—his wife closed the door to, and looked us out—I demanded readmission, and was refused, and. on listening I heard a fire being made up, and the crackling of wood—I burst the door open with the assistance of the other officers, and I then found the grate heaped up with correspondence, and thought the woman was engaged in destroying it—as soon as she found I had entered, she rushed with this small bundle and put it under the mattress of the bed, but the fire was burning so fiercely I could not save any more of the correspondence—what was put on the fire has been destroyed—amongst these there are several apparently draft agreements for taking houses; one relates to 175, Cornwall Road—that case has not been inquired into here—there are several letters addressed to Harry Turton, Falcon Road, Battersea; another addressed to Turton was found in Farrell's possession; he is Mrs. Turton's eldest son—I took Farrell to Bow Street—on the way I told him that no doubt a charge would be preferred against him by Messrs. Collette and Collette for getting a house, 175, Cornwall Road, which this draft agreement refers to, and that probably there would be another charge of getting 12, Holland Road, North Brixton; also that he had been engaged, with others, in getting houses in different parts of London on false references—he said his correct name was Farrell—I said, "Yes, but you have usually gone by the name of Graham"—he said nothing to that; he was subsequently charged—I communicated with Inspector Morgan, and on the night of 4th January I went with Wheatley to 90, Loftus Road, Shepherd's Bush; the sergeant had a warrant for the arrest of Turton, penning, and others; the real object of going there was to, arrest Denning under the name of Graham—I</p>

               <p>knew him, having had him in my hands before—a watch was kept for some time on that house, but we did not succeed, and eventually I put on the attire of a journeyman baker, and went to the house under the pretence of delivering bread; I had some bread in a basket; we could not get the door open unless by a ruse—I knocked at the area door and shouted, "Bread!"—the door was opened by a child; I spoke about the bread I wanted to deliver, and Park came on the scene—I got up some conversation about the bread, and we got to rather high words; I delayed the time as much as possible, as I was anxious to know who was in the house—Park knew me in the ordinary way, but did not recognise me—after being there a few minutes Denning came running down the stairs with a young man whom I know now to be Harry Turton, and who was at 71, Disraeli Road when I arrested Scorey—as Graham got within my reach I seized him by the collar, and shouted out who I was—instantly the lamps were put out, and we were in total darkness in the passage in the basement of the house—Park struck me across the arm as I held Denning; I shouted, "I am Inspector Marshall; you know me very well"—Park tried to make me loosen my grasp, and somehow or other I was carried along the passage by three of them—I got to the door; they tried to eject me; I hung on to Denning—they got my aim between the door, but my foot was inside and saved my arm—I smashed a window; Wheatley came up, and we got in, but Denning had released himself and gone upstairs—when the door was closed on my arm I was outside and Denning inside—two dogs were let loose from somewhere, a. collie and a fox-terrier, and in the struggle and darkness I seized the first man I got hold of, and thought it was Denning; but when I got a light I found it was Park—when I got in again, by the assistance of Wheatley, the large collie dog flew at us; but in the struggle he bit Park on the hip instead of me, and tore his trousers—as soon as Wheatley could, he ran upstairs; he was held at bay by the dogs for some time—I went up too—we found Turton; Denning had managed to make his escape, and I have not been able to recapture him—Wheatley arrested Turton in my presence—we searched for documents—I took Park to the station and charged him with assault on me and rescuing Denning—he was remanded two or three times, and then Morgan discovered he was implicated in the frauds, and reapprehended him—on the Sunday (the 5th) after Denning escaped I went between one and two to 14, Fielding Road to try and find him—in that house I found Gurling and Brown drinking beer—at that time Gurling was professing to give me information as to Denning's whereabouts—earlier in the inquiry Gurling had been to me, and volunteered information against Farrell and Scorey, who he said were great scoundrels and swindlers, and about whom he could give me information—he was first introduced to me by Mr. Brandon, who brought him to me at Bow Street—he wrote to me once or twice making appointments to give me information; he did not keep the appointments—I was late at one—it was not till afterwards I learnt he was well known in the district—once he went to Mr. Brandon, and said he was authorised by Mr. and Mrs. Scorey to get their goods away from 71, Disraeli Road, and an appointment was made for me to go down there, because Mr. Brandon was anxious the goods should be removed, and I had given orders not to allow anything to go without my permission—Gurling gave me no information about Scorey and Farrell, with regard to</p>

               <p>different houses, but what I knew—he mentioned 196, Cambridge Road, in connection with Scorey—he complained about some furniture there, but I did not think it worth while to go into it—I cannot say if he mentioned the Cornwall Road house in connection with Scorey—he mentioned 53, Askew Crescent—after Scorey was in prison he wrote this letter, giving me information about Gurling—I kept an appointment of Gurling at Putney, and met Gurling, who had Brown and Young with him, but in consequence of what had come to my knowledge at that time I declined to let the goods go from 71, Disraeli Road—this is a letter Scorey wrote to the Commissioners of Police, complaining that I had not got sufficient evidence against Gurling—in the case of Dr. Margetson's house, 7, Lonsdale Road, the reference given by Farrell is in Farrell's writing, and signed by him—I have seen him write—he wrote this signature in my presence—in the case of 69, Endlesham Road, the letter signed W. Graham is in Farrell's writing, and I believe the signature to be his also—in the case of 12, Holland Road, the letter signed M. Graham I believe to be in Farrell's writing—I have not seen Gurling write, but I have letters which he told me he wrote—I have not seen Scorey write, but I have had letters from him—this 69, Endlesham Road letter, signed W. Samuels, is in Scorey's writing, to the best of my belief—this 71, Disraeli Road letter, signed Clayton, is in Farrell's writing, I should say—I should not like to say whose this is, signed Smith—as to 12, Holland Road, I believe these names of references were written by Farrell—the references themselves were burnt by Mr. Knight—I believe part of this memorandum is by Harry Turton.</p>

I picked out some of the addresses in the book—the name of Denning is mentioned once, and "Graham, 38," that is 38, Goldsmith Road; Farrell is mentioned once; Jametson, the house agent, once; Brandon once; and Montrose once; he was convicted at the North London Sessions a few months ago, for assault on a landlord where he took a house—he was convicted in the name of Reed, with no end of <hi rend="italic">aliases</hi>—the next address is 89, Lillie Bridge Road; 55, Ossington Street, is mentioned once—that is a sweetstuff shop, where he had letters left to be called for—14, Oxberry Avenue, is mentioned once; 18, Chippenham Road once; 38, Goldhawk Road is where Denning had his letters left in the name of Graham, and sometimes Turton—I find "Graham, agent for Torr," that is the tobacconist; "William Edwards, 71, Disraeli Road," and "W. Clayton, 69"—I believe these exhibits at 80, Portnall Road, signed "Goffin," to be in Gurling's writing—I have not seen him write, but I have had letters from him, which he has acknowledged to be his—I think I had two from him altogether—I think this signature (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is Gurling's, but should not like to be too certain—I have never seen Young's writing; Young has absconded, but when I found this letter Gurling said that it was his.</p>

Sergeant Wheatley to 14, Fielding Road, Hammersmith, on 5th February, and saw Gurling—I told him I was going to arrest him for conspiring with persons to obtain possession of houses by false pretences, and that he would probably be charged with other offences—he said, "I have never obtained any houses, and I have had nothing to do with them; I am a broker"—Brown was with him—I said to Gurling, "Who is this man?"—he said, "That is Mr. Jones"—I said to Brown, "What is your name?"—he said, "My name is Jones"—I said, "No, your name is Francis Brown; have you not lived at 58, Netherwood Road?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I shall arrest you also for conspiring with several others to obtain possession of houses by giving false references from 58, Netherwood Road"—he said, "I have lived at 58, Netherwood Road, but I have never given any references', and I have had nothing to do with obtaining any houses"—he also said, "I occupy this room"—I searched the place, and had to force open two doors which were locked—I said, "I am under the impression that Young is here"—they said, "No; he has been stopping here, but went away yesterday" and that he lived at 80, Portnall Road—I went there, and found he had disappeared, and I have not been able to arrest him—on January 28th I took Park outside Marylebone Police-court for assault, and I preferred the further charge against him of conspiring with Mrs. Turton and Denning, <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Graham, by giving a false reference to obtain possession of 90, Loftus Road; that he and Denning were lodging together at 53, Askew Crescent, and that he must have known of their circumstances—he said, "I have given no false' references; Turton and Denning lodged with me; what I said was true"—he occupied 53, Askew Crescent; it was let to him by Mr. Axton—I hold a warrant against Owen Wood—I also arrested Lewis—I found in the pocket-book the address of Grant and Scorey, 133, Chesterton Road, also 18 and 19, Fielding Road; 18 is the house which was attempted to be obtained from Mr. Hoskings—I also found an authority from Lewis to receive 25s. from Malcom, and a County Court summons and bill in Jones <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Lewis, and Jones's address, 52, Tavistock Road—Jones is a swindler, I have had him in custody twice—I also found a County Court summons against Malcom, and a draft agreement of Malcom's to engage young men; "Manager, previous knowledge of business not necessary; £20 security, 10, North End Road, West Kensington"—10, North End Road is a house which they left without paying the rent—I found forty or fifty letters in answer to that advertisement, and an agreement with Thos. Watson, who had been engaged, also an agreement with Fraser to pay 5 per cent, on the first year's rental—that is in Fraser's writing—I also found this memorandum, "To Mr. Lewis, Sir,—Provided you introduce a tenant I acceptn—that is in Lewis's writing—there is also a letter from the agent complaining of the use Lewis had put the house to, not opening it as a shop, and that the neighbours had complained—I found a letter from Mr. Harrison, a solicitor, advising Lewis to put the brokers into-64, Queen's Road; I also found a letter from the landlord to Lewis, about the rent of 126, "Uxbridge Road—he was there about nine months, and did about £80 worth of damage, and it cost about £90 for proceedings in ejectment to, get him out—there is a letter from Grayer and Son, the landlord's agents, to Lewis, telling him he would be released from payment of rent if he would</p>

Scorey, 38, Gipsy Hill," "J. Watson, 12, Westow Hill," "Dr. Williams, 118, Northam Road, South Hackney"—that is a fictitious address, given for 20, Fielding Road—I found a warrant to distrain, W. Scorey and Farrell, and an authority to Richards to get possession of another house—an authority to Scorey to get possession of 11, Woodfield Crescent—every one of them had to be paid to go out there—I found distress warrants from Wells to Richards, and from Roberts to Richards; Mrs. Roberts Is another of the gang; some envelopes addressed to F. Richards, 196, Cambridge Road, some post-cards from Makeham, 96, Clarendon Road, and from Nicholls, 64, Queen's Road—J. Rogers is another of the gang; he has had about thirty shops, and is under investigation by the police—I also find an application for a reference addressed to Dinning, a letter from Mr. Harrison, a solicitor, at 4, Askew Crescent—Denning was there with Gurling, and no rent was paid for nine months—J. Weston is the fictitious name of Denning or Scorey—I think Stevens is Denning—I found an order to visit Brown in Holloway Prison, a letter from Scorey, asking for a reference to become a licensed bailiff—I found in Makeham's pocket a letter from Lewis, and another from Young—I have a large number more to go through, this is not a quarter of them; they refer to names and addresses of houses about which we have had complaints—papers were found at Makeham's house which include the names of the whole of the prisoners except Park; Farrell's name only appears once; that is in the distraint with Graham—I have had some of these documents in my possession since 5th January.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. TAYLOR</hi>. When I arrested Lewis I showed him a letter; he said, "I did not write it"—I should say that Lewis's letter to Makeham is not in the same writing—comparing the signature S. Lewis to the agreement with the signature to the letter found on Makeham, I should say they are the same—the letter of reference denied to be in Lewis's writing is dated from his house, 64, Queen's Road—I don't think it is in the same writing as the other documents shown to me—I don't think the letter given as a reference and signed "Lewis" is in Makeham's writing, and I do not think it is Lewis's—I found from the documents at Lewis's house that he was being sued by Makeham for money; that was done to keep the Sheriff out, to get judgment—I don't know whether they got judgment—Jones does not deal in white lead; he is an unmitigated swindler; he gets goods up from the country, and does not pay for them—I found Grant's name in the book, but not Park's—Lewis was in possession of the house four, five, or six months; Mr. Lucas is, I think, the landlord—I don't know who Magee is—Dr. Lambkin has not been charged, and several others—if I had found out that Lewis was the agent of Lady Hope, I should still have charged him with getting possession of the houses by means of a trick, by referring to Magee—Magee was deceived; I did not see him, I go by the Sergeant's reports—I know Makeham under surrounding circumstances—the reference is lost, it got into the possession of a house agent who has quarrelled with Mr. Hopkins, and he will not produce it, and keeps out of the way—Lewis has not appeared under an <hi rend="italic">alias,</hi> to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> This is the letter: "I have known Mr. Makeham as a respectable man, and do not hesitate to recommend him to you as worthy of credit"—at that time Lewis was tenant of the house for nine months without paying any rent, and it is written from that house—it is not like, the two documents in his writing—Grant's address appears three or four times.</p>

I went with Inspector Marshall to 90, Loftus Road, when he arrested Park—the door was found open, and I followed him in—I was in plain clothes—the place was in darkness—Inspector Marshall took hold of Park, and two dogs (a large collie and a terrier), which were not muzzled, were trying to get at us till I drove them upstairs—I heard someone urging the dogs on to us—I said "We are police officers, and it is a very cowardly thing to do"—I drove them, into a room upstairs, and saw the woman there—I said, "I am a police officer, and hold a warrant for your arrest, for conspiring with a man named Graham"—she said; "Oh, you have made a mistake.

               <p>nothing about it of Graham"—I read the warrant to her relating to Gibbs' case—she said, "Oh, I have an action pending against Mr. Gibbs"—I searched the room, and found a large number of documents between the mattress and the bed—these are bills for goods; some of them are paid, but the majority are not—they are in the name of Mrs. Walkin-shaw, Mrs. H. Turton, Mrs. Denning, and a butcher's bill to Park—some of the others are addressed to 90, Loftus Road—there are about forty altogether.</p>

Go at them!"—I never heard why she did that—I am told that one of the dogs bit Park on his leg—I did not ask her why she had done it—she is a cripple, and could not get away; I did not charge her with assault for setting the dogs on me, because I was not injured—Park, Marshall, myself, Turton, and a little boy were in the house; Denning and Graham were not there when I got there; there was a light when I arrested Turton; that was the only light in the house: I drove the dogs into her room; she was at the doorway, and I asked her to keep them there—this was on January 4th.</p>

D., <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph;</hi> say three p.m.—<hi rend="smallCaps">THOMAS LEE</hi>")—in consequence of that letter I went to meet the writer, and I saw the prisoner sitting in the office of the address given—I said, "I have come in reference to the situation, about which I received a letter from you"—he said, "That is quite right; I suppose you understand that I require £50 security"—he said, "My name is Thomas Lee; I am the sole author of a book on potatoes; perhaps you have heard of it; I will give you a copy before you go, to give you an opportunity of reading it, to see that you are dealing with a gentleman and not with a scamp"—we were sitting in Mr. Dutton's office—the prisoner said he had bought that business for £800, and was to take possession on the 14th February; that they required a manager and book-keeper for that office—he said he was in business at Covent Garden at present—I said I could furnish the £50 required-; also references—he said, "I don't want references, all I want is the money, and that shall be returned to you as soon as I find you are honest."—he said he was worth £20,000, that the money required from me was nothing to him, because he was a wealthy man, that his wife had a private income of £400 a year, and owned the premises where he resided at 60, Museum Street, Bloomsbury—I believed those statements, and made an appointment at the close of that conversation—he said, "I think you will suit me, you can call again next Monday, unless you hear to the contrary"—previous to saying that he warned me against speaking to Mr. Button's manager, because he was to be discharged, and he did not want him to know it—on 3rd February I received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This requested witness to meet him at four p.m. on Monday in the smoke-room of the Manchester Motel</hi>)—I went there, and met him—he said the potato business in general was very profitable, and one that would enable him to pay me a food salary; he repeated his previous assertions as to his own and his wife's property, and then he said, "I have just sold my Manchester business for £2,000"—I believed that—he also said he had met Mr. Dutton that morning, and had given him a cheque for £200, and a bill at a short date for the balance of the. £800—he produced a blue folded paper, and said, "Here is the receipt," and replaced it in his pocket-book—he said he was sorry he could not engage me for the St. Pancras business, as he had already engaged a Mr. Langworthy, who had paid him £400 to put into the business at 5 per cent.—he said, "If you pay me £50 security I am willing to engage you for my business at Covent Garden; it is a nicer office than the other, and I think will suit you better; it is at No, 7, Bow Street opposite the Police-station; you can start on a set of books there next Monday"—he then showed</p>

               <p>me a small book, and said that was a record of the business done by him at Bow Street—this is the book; he called it a truck-book; he pointed out a page marked D—he said, "I can't take a lower amount than £50, some thousands will have to pass through your hands"—he said he had a sleeping partner, a Mr. Archer, but I should not come in contact with him; I have not seen him—he said he would take an early opportunity of introducing me to his bankers, the London and County, in Henrietta Street—he said now that he had the St. Pancras business, the Bow Street office would be only a branch, but I should take the money from the salesmen, pay it into the bank, and account to Mr. Langworthy at the chief office, St. Pancras—he said he had been in business there under the style of Elliott and Co., but he had had it now for some time in his own name—he said he had discharged someone from Bow Street for robbing him—I said, "Do you mean Mr. Elliott?"—he said, "I do, you will see it in my book"—I produced the book and showed him the passage, and he said, "That is the one;" he had given me the book previously; it was the book which principally influenced me throughout—he said, "If you pay me the £50 now, I will engage you, if not I shall probably decide upon a young gentleman I am to see to-morrow morning, who will pay me £100"—I said, "I have the money with me, and will pay you, if we come to terms as to salary"—he said, "How much do you want?"—I said, "£3 a week"—the terms ultimately agreed upon were 50s. a week for the first three months, to be raised to 70s., and then to £200 per annum at the end of the year—I paid the £50 in Bank notes, of which I took the numbers, 91452 to 61 inclusive; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of the notes—I wrote out this agreement at the prisoner's dictation, and we both signed it—(<hi rend="italic">ready</hi>—I made an appointment to meet the prisoner the following day, the 5th, at St. Pancras; that was when the salary was to commence—he then wanted me to go with him to Boston, Lincolnshire, for the purpose of buying potatoes—I kept that appointment, he did not, nor any subsequent one—I next saw him when he was in custody—I received several telegrams and letters from him, and then I applied for a warrant—I have not discovered any place where he was carrying on business—from what he said I believed the statements he made to me, and in consequence of them I parted with my £50.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> You told me you were inundated with applications for the position; you said you had 156 applicants—when you gave me one of your books, you said I should see who I was dealing with—you gave me a week's time in which to make inquiries about you—you said you were residing at 60, Museum Street, not that you had apartments there—I did not write to you there, I wrote to St. Pancras—you said nothing about a partner at St. Pancras, or about your having recently cleared £200 by the sale of your book; you said that the present Lord Mayor had purchased some of them—you said you were worth £20,000—you said you wanted the £50 as security—you did not tell me that you had speculated and lost heavily on the Stock Exchange; if you had I should not have entertained the proposal; you told me the truckbook related to the Bow Street business—I thought the inquiries I made about you showed that your statements were genuine—I told you that the inquiries I had made satisfied me that you were extremely well known in the potato trade—on 17th February I applied by telegram to have my</p>

                  </hi>. I am a potato merchant, carrying on business at 5, St. Pancras Depot; I entered into negotiations with the prisoner for the purpose of selling him my business; it was arranged that I should have £800, consisting of a bill for £250, at short date, and cash for the remainder on 14th February—he said he had a partner with means—he gave me this document: "January 8th, 1890, twenty-one days after date, pay to Mr. T. Lee's order £250, for value received," addressed to Mr. J. C. Archer, endorsed Thomas Lee—I did not regard that as a satisfactory document, and I drafted a proper bill; this is it—I put the signatures in pencil; it was never signed in ink—I also wrote this letter—I still hold the business at 5, St. Pancras Depot—I do not know of any office in London where the prisoner has business.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I first met you I think you proffered to sell me some books that you had written—I told you that my brother was retiring from business in Birmingham; I expressed a desire to get rid of my London business, as my business in the Midlands was increasing, and I should have more than I could do—I may have said it would suit, you, with your extensive knowledge of the growers—we had considerable correspondence about it we met very frequently at St. Pancras by appointment; first at one hotel, and then at another—I recollect you showing me a letter from your brother-in-law; I do not remember one from J. C. Archer—you said you were inundated with applicants, but it did not concern me—Langworthy was the only applicant I saw; that was at my office, and we adjourned to the White Hart Hotel—he said he should put £400 into your busies—I do not know; that your brother-in-law is a very wealthy man—I got a letter from you at Derby on January 1st, saying that you could not</p>

                  </hi>, I live at Victoria Dock Road, West Ham, and am employed by the London and India Dock Joint Committee as a piece-work foreman—on Saturday afternoon, 22nd February, about 2.30, I went between sheds 7 and 9, looking for some wool—I saw the prisoner there; he was rolling a bale of wool from the platform towards the tail of his van—I was about fifteen or sixteen yards from him, and about twenty from the van—I went to the end of the opening, and then saw that the bale had disappeared, and I went and gave information to Mr. West, my warehouse-keeper—I could not see whether there was any mark on the bale.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was bound with iron—there were three bales at that corner of the platform—it requires three or four men to lift one of these bales—I saw no other men besides the prisoner—I saw Nixon; he was standing near his own van—after the vans are loaded the carmen have to get a ticket to pass out at the gate—the prisoner says that eighteen bales were taken out at the gate—I have never known that there has been a bale too much, which has had to be brought back by the carman; that would not come to my knowledge—I have nothing to do with it—I daresay the prisoner could have seen me when he was doing this if he had looked—I was between the two sheds, about fifteen yards from him—there was no tarpaulin on the van—I suspected something wrong, and I watched at the end of the opening to see—I did not know him as coining to the dock before—I knew he was in the employ of Thorogood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The three bales on the platform were marked "T. G. B.

                  </hi>. I am check clerk in No. 1 room at the Albert Dock, and am in the service of the Joint Committee—on Saturday afternoon, 22nd February, I was engaged in loading two vans, checking the bales as they came from the pile in the shed—four men were engaged throwing the bales into the van—I checked off every mark as they came by me; they were marked in black—eighteen bales, checked by me, were put into the prisoner's van, and eighteen into Nixon's van—the vans are numbered; the prisoner's was 26, and Nixon's 16—after the vans were loaded, I took the gang to do another job, leaving the two vans there—I saw three other bales lying on the platform, about twelve yards from the van—they were marked "T. G. B. "in a circle in, red; they were all iron-bound—no bales go into vans with the bands on,—I had not tallied a <hi rend="italic">bale,</hi> marked with red and iron-bound, into Gayton's van—the tarpaulins were not on before I left; they were going to "put them on—on coming into the dock the carman would first go to Mr. Burrows, the delivery foreman, and fetch an order to say how many</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189003240091"/>
               <p>bales were to be delivered—the prisoner did not fetch an order that day, because it was part of an order which we had had before—they were to go to Bush Row.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The order was for 300 bales, I believe—the number of bales in a van is according to the weight of the bales—they would take as many as they could; the iron bands would be taken off in the shed—we have never loaded any with bands on unless in case of a strike, and then the men must chop them off—I have never known a case of one bale being overloaded; I have heard of it—I have not heard of a bale being returned unless it was a case of wrong delivery—my department has never made such a mistake; I can't answer for other departments—there were six or seven men engaged in fetching the bales from the shed, but only four in putting them into the van—none of those four men are here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I asked the carmen how many bales they were going to take, and they told me 18 each, and that was the load I tallied for them—I have known the prisoner as coming and getting the wool, that is all; I have been employed there five years; I have not known him that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable, stationed at the Royal Albert Dock—on Saturday afternoon, 22nd February, about half-past two, I was on duty in the dock—I received information—I saw the two vans, one of which was driven by the prisoner—I stopped them at the rear of No. 9 shed, near the opening between 9 and 11 sheds; they had started on the road out—there was a tarpaulin fastened at each corner, and over the tarpaulin a rope securing it; it would be impossible to tell how many bales were in the van without uncovering the tarpaulin—I asked the prisoner how many bales he had in his van—he said, "18"—I said "Have you a pass for the same?"—he said, "No; my mate has the pass for the two vans; each have 18 bales on"—I went to his mate, Nixon, and got the pass from him; and on examining it, I saw that it tallied with the account the prisoner gave as to the number of bales on each van—this is the pass—I said to the prisoner, "Your passes appear to be all right, but I am not satisfied as to to the quantity in your van; have you any objection to my counting the bales in your van?" he said, "No, sir"—I told him to draw the van into the opening, and I had the contents discharged on the platform and counted, and there were nineteen—there was a marked distinction between one of the bales and the others, there was a red mark on one, and it was bound with three iron bands; there were no bands on the others, and they were all black marked, the red bale was at the tail of the van, and on the top of the two lower bales—I asked the prisoner how he accounted for the extra bale on the van—he said, "I know nothing at all about it, it would be impossible for me to put it there myself"—I told him his answers were unsatisfactory, and I should charge him with being concerned with Nixon in stealing the bale of wool between 7 and 9 sheds—he said, "I know nothing about it"—they were both taken before the Magistrates at Stratford, and there Nixon was discharged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I should say there was nothing unusual in the loading of the odd bale; I am not sufficiently versed in <hi rend="italic">dockology</hi> to speak as to the marks—I cannot say whether the red mark was on one side of the bale, I know it was on one end—the bale was about three feet long, not square, somewhat of an oblong, the red mark was a large one—the gatekeeper is not here; he is still, in the employ—I have been over fifteen</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant L</hi>). On 1st March, about 12.30,. I was with Sergeant Williamson, near the Horns Tavern, Kennington, at midday, and saw the two prisoners together; they entered the Horns, and almost immediately Murray looked out at the door towards us—I went up and said, "We are police officers"—Edwards said, "I thought you were"—I said to Edwards, "You answer the description of a man wanted for stealing a gold watch and chain on board a ship last October"—he said, "You have made a mistake, I am not the man"—I asked them to come to the station, which they did—Edwards was wearing this watch and chain—he said, "I bought those of a man in Paris"—I said, "What is his name and address?"—he said, "I don't know"—he was wearing a plain gold band ring, two diamond and one sapphire rings,. and he had 2s. 1 1/2 d. on him—Edwards gave his address, 226, Cold Harbour Lane, Brixton.</p>

I was with McCarthy, and have heard his evidence; it is correct—I took charge of Murray; he was carrying this stick—he threw it away behind him going to the station, and it struck a man ten yards behind, who brought it to me; each end of it screws off, and by pressing this part a pair of forceps comes out, which will lift from a quarter of a hundredweight to a sixpence—it might be used for stealing from behind a bar; it is used by thieves.</p>

I was told so by a Continental thief going over by night; they sleep very close, and a gentleman may take off his coat or waistcoat, and you can lift it up and take the contents, and put it back again—I asked Murray where such a stick could be obtained? he said, "Yesterday I was in a public-house in London, and a man asked me to have a pipe; he left the stick with me, and never came back"—on searching him I found this small pocket spirit-lamp, which they light of a night when it is dark—Murray said, "I met this man to-day, and he asked me to go and have a drink; I have been in his company many times"—you might use this stick to take flowers off a tree, or to pick up your handkerchief—this part of the handle is constructed to pick up anything at a railway station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon—I examined Mrs. Champ on 17th February—she was suffering considerable pain about the right hip joint posteriorly, a shortening of the right leg, which was slightly drawn inwards; she had no power to stand on that leg; any movement of the limb gave her considerable pain—she also had deep-seated pain in the right side of the abdomen—a fall or a kick might have caused the injury to the hip—I do not think a fall would cause the injury to the abdomen, a kick might—I examined her the day before yesterday—she has slightly recovered—I think it will be a considerable time before she recovers the use of the limb; she still suffers pain if she stands on it, or if the limb is moved—it is quite possible that the violence which caused the injuries was inflicted as far back as the 12th January.</p>

I married Mary Perushot. I told her I was a married man; I said there is a certificate of it at Somerset House. I got the certificate from Somerset House and gave it to her, and she burnt it.

I married Mary Perushot, she knowing my first wife was alive when I got married. My first wife is dead"—I made inquiries—I went to Somerset House and got this certificate of the marriage on 19th November, 1874, of John Whittaker to Rebecca Shipman—I also compared this certificate of the marriage on Hay 22nd, 1887, of John Whittaker to Mary Perushot with the register at Somerset House—I obtained this certificate of the death on 29th November, 1888, of Rebecca Freeman, the prisoner's first wife, who married another man—the prisoner left her with three children—I have ascertained that from inquiries.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to James William Pocock, stationer and tobacconist, of 110, Blackfriars Road—on March 10th, about 6.30 p.m., just between the lights, a man came in for a twopenny cigar, and gave me a half-crown—I gave him two shillings and fourpence change, and put it into the till, where there was Do other half-crown—about, an hour and a half or two hours afterwards Mrs. Pocock took out the silver, and tested this coin; it bent—I had not put any other half-crown in—I then broke it with my teeth, and put the pieces in the till, where they remained till the 13th, when I handed them to Cox—on the 13th the prisoner came in, about the same time, for a twopenny cigar, and gave me a half-crown from a handful of silver, which he took from his trousers pocket—I recognised him as the same man, and took the coin to Mrs. Pocock, and went back and told him I had sent upstairs for change—he said, "Oh, don't trouble; here is twopence"—I said, "I have sent now, if you don't mind waiting a minute"—he did a step dance towards the door, and just then a policeman came, and he was given in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I attend to the till all day—Mrs. Pocock did not do so on the 10th—the window is full of articles, and there is not much light; the only light came in through the door—I have no recollection how he was dressed on the 10th—he used the same words on both occasions, and threw the money down in the same manner—I recognised the man—we do a fair business—other customers came in afterwards—the coin rang like a good one when he threw it down—I intended to look out for the man if he came again—I had not lit the gas, and it was nearly dark—he was in the shop five minutes on the 10th, he stopped to light the cigar—he was not dressed differently on the second occasion—Mrs. Pocock sent her eldest daughter for a constable—the prisoner could have gone if he liked, as I was behind the counter.</p>

I thought there was something wrong"—this was on the 8th, Saturday afternoon, the preceding Tuesday would be the 4th—he said, "You b—fool, hold your b—noise"—he rushed towards her with a view, either of assaulting or pushing her away, but we held him back, and she was removed from the station—on the way to Norwood in the train he said, "I suppose you will bring the gentleman that has lost the silver, when we get to Norwood"—I had not mentioned silver as having been stolen—when he was put in the dock at Norwood station I showed him this envelope, and said, "This is an envelope that was found in the stokehole of the conservatory at Norwood; do you know anything about it!"—he said, "No, 1 never see it, I know nothing about it"—the Inspector called him round and said, "What is your name?"—he said, "The same name as is on that envelope"—when the charge was read to him he said, "All right"—on searching him I found a long knife with a spring back and a blade 4 in long, a watch and chain, nearly £33 in money, and a gold spade guinea—he was asked if he could account for the possession or so much money, and he said it was what he had saved—he subsequently made a statement to Fox, which I did not hear—he said, "I should like to know what is going to be done with my money"—I said, "The best thing you can do is to write the various amounts on two pieces of paper, and give one to me to keep, and keep one yourself"—he did so—this is one of the pieces; I saw him write it—I put it in for comparison with the letter addressed to Biggs and Co.—there are eight dots on the back of this ivory-backed hairbrush, found on</p>

I assisted Reed to examine the rooms at Lamb's Conduit Street—I found a knife and a rifle level—when we were going to Norwood, Reed left the prisoner and me on the Holborn Viaduct platform to get the tickets, and the prisoner said, "You belong up here?"—I said, "Yes, Hunter Street"—he said, "Does he?"—I said,. "No, Norwood"—he said, "Who sent him up here?"—I replied, "I don't know"—he said, "Someone did; he could not find all this out himself"—Reed then came back with the tickets, and the conversation dropped—he was kept in the reserve room at Hunter Street.—Fox (<hi rend="italic">Acting Police Inspector P</hi>). On 10th March the prisoner several times asked me to give to him a portion of the money that had been found on him—I said I could not—he persisted in having answers as to why I would not give it up, and I said because it would be reasonably supposed to be the proceeds of the sales of property which he was charged with stealing—he said, "It would fetch more than that at 4s. 6d. an ounce"—I said, "I don't know the weight of it"—afterwards he said, £12 of it belonged to his wife—I sent an officer to make inquiry; the officer came back and communicated with me, and when the prisoner again wanted to know about it I told him his wife said none of the money belonged to her.</p>

I live at Eastnor, Sydenham Hill—on the night of 7th November I went to bed about twelve—to the best of my belief the house was fastened up; I am not sure all the windows were fastened—in the morning about seven, one of my servants came and told me something, and I found on going downstairs that the cupboards in the housekeeper's room had been broken open, and various plated things left, but various silver things had been stolen, among them a brush—this brush is exactly like it—it was one of a pair belonging to my wife; this is the fellow one that was left behind—both these bear the maker's name, "Truefitt, Bond Street," and also a number, indistinct, at the top, but very similar; it is the same number in each case, as far as can be traced—on the brush left with us is the monogram "H.
