                  </hi>. I was a seaman on the <hi rend="italic">Norwood</hi>—the prisoner was in my watch—he and the mate did not agree from the first day—the mate called the prisoner all the worst names that can be called to a dog—I have seen him hit him every day—the prisoner had to scrub the deck with sand and water after twenty hours on duty—on the night the mate was stabbed, at 7.50, he called the prisoner to do something to the fore upper topsail—the prisoner protested, as it is well known that one man cannot work the roping—it requires two or three men—the mate coming on deck saw the work had not been carried out as he wished, and he com<lb/>menced to call the prisoner all sorts of names—he followed him up aloft to the yard and there hit him—at 12 o'clock the mate came up on deck—he saw the prisoner working and said, "What are you doing there?"—the prisoner said, "I am doing the work I have been ordered to"—then we had to put the vessel about—the mate abused the prisoner—I was not far from him, by one of the masts, gathering up the loose ropes—I saw the mate hit him several times, calling him a bastard, and saying," I will kill you to-night"—he got a belaying pin and the prisoner flew for his life—from the first day the mate hit me, and broke my bead, and treated me as a negro all along—three times I went to the captain to complain, but he never gave me any satisfaction.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The mate specially ill-treated the Phillipinos—he broke part of the prisoner's ear, and he had it sore for three weeks—the mate was very cruel against the crew in general—I never heard him say that he had lost a ship before through the Phillipinos—the only satisfaction he used to give anyone was always with his fists—I saw the prisoner often being kicked—a Portuguese on board was drowned on account of him—I do not know his name—when he kicked the prisoner he had on a heavy pair of boots from the American Army; not his sea boots—he would pick up anything that came to his hands—he often hit him with his fists or picked up a belaying pin—the prisoner con<lb/>stantly complained that the deceased threatened to loll him—the prisoner had often complained to the captain, who gave him no satis<lb/>faction, although he saw what was happening all around with the crew.</p>

I am the master of the <hi rend="italic">Norwood</hi>—I shipped the prisoner at Manilla as an A.B.—I had to reduce him afterwards to a boy's rating because he was not capable of doing his duty as an A.B.—up to October 10th there had been no complaint to me that the prisoner had been badly treated—Ascolesi complained to me that the mate had hit him—I ex<lb/>postulated privately with the mate about it, and said I did not allow any<lb/>thing of the sort on board the ship—on October 11th I had just left the deck when the mate called me—I attended to his wound as well as I could—I laid him down—I found a stab in his stomach, about midway between the pit of the stomach and the navel—it was one and a quarter to one and a half inches in length—it was bleeding considerably—I dressed it—it seemed to be getting better—the bleeding seemed to stop, as far as I could tell—I gave orders for the prisoner to be looked for—we could not find him at the time—for some days the mate seemed to be progressing fairly well, but he died on the 15th—the prisoner turned up on the 14th—I have no doubt that the deceased died from the effects of the wound—I found a knife sheath and belt at the break of the forecastle, some little distance from where the mate was stabbed—the knife was never found, to my knowledge—I cannot swear to whom the sheath belonged—it was said it belonged to one of the Phillipinos—when the prisoner gave himself up, I had him put in irons—if my memory serves me right, next day I asked him if he cut the mate, and he said he did—he gave me no reason for doing it—we took him in irons to St. Helena—I did not take him before the Governor, but the harbour-master came on board and saw him—the prisoner told him in my presence that he cut the mate because he was abusing him and calling him <hi rend="italic">out of his name</hi>—he was brought to England and given into the custody of the Thames police.</p>

Eight o'clock that night he sent me up to loose the fore upper topsail. I loosed it, and after I make up the gaskets the bunt lines got foul and I could not overhaul them, they got clear.

He hit me on the head and face and made me bleed and knock me down on the deck when I got there, and kicked me afterwards. I had my work with the others cleaning up the decks. At 12 o'clock all hands put the ship about, and after she came round and ropes had all been cleaned, he sent me to the mizzen top gallant brace to haul the yard round. While I was doing: it he called me a black bastard and a son of a bitch and hit me and kicked me. I then took out my sheath knife and put it in his stomach. He say he kill me."—he called attention to his head. I examined it and saw a soar on his nose and his right ear was closed—I saw no marks on his head—on the 5th of this month I made a further examination of his head, and found two scars there, and one on the second finger of his left hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wholesale stationer, and carry on business in the name of Coutts &amp; Co., at 57 and 59, Golden Lane, E.C.—I have two factories, one called the New Factory at Great Arthur Street in the same neighbourhood, and the other called the Old Factory in Golden Lane, which practically abuts on to the New Factory—in the manufacture of boxes we use a large quantity of these straw boards (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), which are manufactured in Holland for me—I send specifications for 1,000 or 1,500 tons to be made at a time, and they are delivered over a specified period—in my specifications I name the quantities and sizes, which I require, which are almost exclusively twenty-five inches by thirty-four inches, twenty-five inches by forty inches, and thirty inches by forty inches—these sizes are most uncommon in the trade and are not to be got, as a rule—I also have them rolled less than the ordinary strawboard on the market, and I manipulate them in my own factories—this is a piece (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) to which we have added white paper on one side, and this is</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190501090024"/>

N.</hi>), which orders 160 bundles, thirty inches by forty inches, fourteen ounces, seventy-six in a diamond, ex. <hi rend="italic">Teal</hi>—the carman from the wharf would have his book in which are entered the quantities of the goods he is delivering, but not their description, and it would be the duty of Briggs at the New Factory, and Woodhouse at the Old Factory, to sign the book when these goods are received, and it would then be taken back to the wharf by the carman—the carman is also entrusted with a delivery note, which it is his duty to give to Briggs or Woodhouse, as the case may be, and it is their duty to hand such delivery note into the counting-house in the evening—there would sometimes be several deliveries in one day, and it is the clerk's duty, on receiving this blue docket or delivery note to compare it with the landing note and to write the goods off, in order that we may know what is left at the wharf, so that if a consignment is not delivered it would be discovered at once by this delivery note not having been forwarded into the counting house—the amount of strawboards that we use is on an average fifty tons a week—if the carmen's books were not signed, the wharf people would know the goods had not been delivered—we have from twelve to fourteen tons per week of waste, which we sell to paper mills in England,</p>

N.</hi>) to the wharf, dated September 28th, to deliver to us 160 bundles, thirty by forty inches, fourteen ounces; and this is the delivery note (<hi rend="italic">Ex. O.</hi>), for those 160 bundles, which was sent by the wharf people in accordance with their ordinary prac<lb/>tice, and given to Briggs, and duly lodged by him at the counting-house, as though the goods had been delivered—in this carman's delivery book (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is the entry for those 160 bundles, signed by Briggs, whose handwriting I know, as having been delivered—I returned with Laing and Inspector Kyd from Bracht &amp; Friedlaender's to my factory, and saw Schultz delivering some strawboards, which Briggs was taking in—I gave Schultz into the custody of Laing, and went with Kyd into the basement, where I gave Briggs into custody—Schultz made some remark that if he had delivered the goods, they would be signed for, and Briggs, as far as I heard, said he knew nothing at all about it—previous to this Hyman was arrested—I was not present when Ince was arrested—I charged Briggs and Schultz at 10 a.m. at the City Road police station, and all the prisoners were brought up before the Magistrate on October 5th—after the first hearing at the Police Court, I went to Schmaltz's, a wholesale stationer at 213, Featherstone Street, and found there ninety-four bundles of strawboards, twenty-four of them being marked with eighteen in a diamond, sixty-four marked eighty in a diamond and six marked ninety-four in a diamond—those marked eighteen in a diamond were part of an order which had been given on May 10th, 1904, for twelve tons of thirty inches by forty inches, fourteen ounces; the eighty in a diamond were part of an order for twelve tons, thirty inches by forty inches, twelve ounces, given on July 26th, 1904, and the ninety-four in a diamond were part of an order for ten tons, twenty-five inches by thirty-four inches, twelve ounces, given on August 15th—I had not sold any of the straw-boards obtained from those three orders—either that day or the next I went to the premises of Munt &amp; Sons, wholesale stationers, of Cross Street. Hatton Garden, where I found 119 bundles, which I identified in the same way—they all bore numbers and sizes corresponding with</p>

               <p>orders I had given at various dates—I then went to the premises of Mrs. Arnold, a strawboard liner, of 1. Dufferin Avenue, St. Luke's, whore I found ninety-five bundles of my strawboards bearing my shipping marks, corresponding with orders I had given at various times—I am prepared to refer to each order, if desired—from there I went to Dredge &amp; Co.'s premises at 62, Pitfield Street—on their declining to allow us to search, we obtained a search warrant from the Magistrate at Worship Street Police Court, and on returning I found 256 bundles, which I identified in a similar manner—from there I went to Pillivant's premises, where I identified 491 bundles—on September 29th, a messenger came from them bringing a sample strawboard, twenty-five inched by Forty inches, in con<lb/>sequence of which I had an interview with Pillivant—in the result I bought from him ten and a half tons, twenty-five inches by forty inches, fourteen ounces, at the rate of £3 17s. 6d. a ton, which were delivered on my premises on December 29th or 30th—I was not present when they arrived—after Laing came on October 3rd, I examined these 420 bundles and found they were my own property, the outside strawboard of each bundle bearing my shipping mark, without which I should not been have able to identify them—no bundle of strawboards is ever sold in the trade without the shipping mark, the size and the weight marked upon it, for without such distinguishing mark it would be impossible to sort them at the wharf; several different consignments to different people coming in the same ship—if a man offered me an unmarked bundle, it would arouse my suspicions; and I never buy broken bundles—they are not even sold in auctions rooms unmarked.</p>

I simply told Schultz that a gentle<lb/>man wanted to speak to him, and I then left him with Sergeant Laing—it is very likely that I said to him, "I have always looked upon you as a respectable man"—I had always regarded him as such—I did not know at the time that he was in a small way of business for himself—we sell very few straw boards, and when we do so they are despatched straight from the wharf to the customer; they do not reach my premises at all—when Schultz delivered strawboards they would be sent down a shute to Briggs—I per cent, of them would be made into boxes as they were, without any manipulation—Schultz said something to the effect that the delivery books would show what goods had been delivered, but that was in answer to a question put to him by Laing—very likely he said that the books at the Gun &amp; Shot Wharf would show what goods had been ordered from there.</p>

Nobody not connected with the trade would know what were the common sizes of the trade, and what were the sizes peculiar to myself—the waste cuttings are very largely dealt in—they pass through the hands of dealers before being repulped—I inspect everything that comes into the factory, so I should have eventu<lb/>ally discovered that I had purchased my own property from Pillivant—in all the bundles that I identified as my own, in the possession of whomever it was, none of the marks had been tampered with.</p>

The last time I took stock was in December, 1904, but the figures will not actually come out till February of this year—in a bundle of twelve-ounce strawboards, which is the general weight, twenty-two inches by thirty-two inches, there would be seventy-five boards, and in a sixteen-ounce bundle there would be fifty-six boards—if the outside board bearing the shipping mark had been removed, or the mark had been tampered with, I could not have sworn that the inner boards were mine—I was present at Bracht and Fried-bender's when Hyman was arrested—he mentioned, amongst other per<lb/>sons to whom he had sold strawboards, the name of Schmaltz, but I do not think he gave Schmaltz's address; he may have given it to the sergeant—I said to him, "You are the gentleman I have been looking for for some time"—he gave Pillivant's name, but not his address—I have nothing to say against the respectability of Schmaltz—the only purchase of strawboards I made last year under standard price, besides that from Pillivant, was a purchase I made in February from Schroeder's, which I sold to Darwin, as they were odd sites, of which I could make no use—I can furnish you with a list of the deliveries, and the price which I bought and sold them at; there was only one transaction—I sold them under standard price—the first I heard of the Schmaltz transaction was from Hyman—he also gave the names of Munt, and a firm of bookbinders in Clerkenwell of the name of Wright.</p>

E.</hi>), "Dear Sirs,—Replying to your favour of yesterday's date, I have a quantity of the goods for which you are enquiring lying on wharf, but I am unable to obtain delivery just at present; if, however, you would let the order remain open for a short period, I would promise you delivery in a few days. I must at the same time point out to you that the price quoted to you will not allow of a discount of more than two and a half per cent. Yours truly, R. Hyman"—the same day I wrote (<hi rend="italic">Ex. F.</hi>) to him saying. "Dear Sir,—In reply to your memo, we cannot understand why you should ask us £3 15s. less two and a half per cent, for the same strawboard that you were selling to boxmakers at £3 5s. per ton net. If the board suits us and your deliveries are satisfactory, we might take the whole quantity you have to sell, if we can come to terms regarding prices"—we knew from a traveller of ours that he had been selling to boxmakers at £3 5s. per ton—"he called the next day, the 29th, "with a reply to the letter—It must have been in the morning, as I saw the detective afterwards—he repeated what he had said, and offered me at the same time thirty inches by forty inches, fourteen ounces, of which he said he had four tons, and he said that if I could make that size do, he would let me have them at £3 12a. 6d. a ton in<lb/>stead of £3 15s.—he said that he had never sold at £3 Ps. to any boxmaker, but had supplied on a dealer at £3 10s.—I said he could send in the four tons, and he promised to do so the next day—shortly after he had left I saw Detective-Sergeant Laing—the next day, the 30th, the four tons were de<lb/>livered on a van, on which Was the name of Stephens, with a delivery note (<hi rend="italic">Ex.

I told him that that memo, did not refer to the parcel he had delivered—I did not give him a cheque, and said he could have the four tons back if he could not trust us for a month, which is the usual term—he said he would fetch them on the morrow morning, but as that was on a Saturday 1 said he must do so the next week, and so we parted—before I left the office I took three of the top boards of the bundles off so that they might be given to Laing—this board, marked seventy-six in a diamond, thirty inches by forty inches, fourteen ounces (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), is one of them, and all the 160 bundles were marked in the same way—as a matter of business I was in the wrong, but I kept it up—in consequence of a letter I wrote to him</p>

               <p>on October 3rd, he came to our office on the 4th and offered to accept my terms in that letter—I had been acting throughout this matter more or less with the police—the 160 bundles were identified by Mr. Mansell as his own—the market price of strawboards at that time was £4 15s. free domicile, less two and a half per cent, for one month—being delivered as they were at my warehouse, it would have cost me 2s. 6d. a ton to cart them to my customer—the thirty-inch by forty-inch and twenty five by forty-inch sizes are fairly common sizes in the trade, but not twenty-five inches by thirty-four inches—Hyman at one interview said he could supply from five to six tons a week.</p>

I have been in the business for thirty-two years—he may have asked me £3 15s. or £4 a ton at first; the £3 10s. would probably have been fixed by me—I looked upon them as cheap, but I considered it a fair price owing to the state of the market and that he did not want them—I paid either by cheque or a bill for three months—the market price certainly did not stiffen at the end of September; my recollection is that there was a fall—I was buying boards at £4 7s. 6d. by contract, 2£ per cent, discount for a month's credit; I</p>

               <p>mills with raw material waste for making boards from, and that he took in exchange strawboards, whatever size they might send—he said he made no profit as far as I was concerned, but that he wanted ready money—he also mentioned some of the names of the witnesses who have been called to-day as having supplied strawboards to them—there was to be no discount—my first invoice from him (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is "2 tons, 9 cwts. unlined strawboards, at £2 17s. 6d. per ton, £8 9s., then there is a dis<lb/>count of 2s. 6d.—there seems to be a few shillings knocked off in a few cases—I believe we were buying from the mill direct at that time at £4 5s., less 2 1/2 per cent., free delivery—he called many times—I said, "I will come round and see your place first," and I went round to his place at Hackney Road—I saw there a pretty lofty warehouse, with some stables at the side—over the door he had "F. Ince, Strawboard and Leather Dealer"—the place was quite full of strawboards, and I should reckon there were about 200 tons there—I cannot remember whether the first time I went there was before the second transaction, but I went there four or five times—during May and July I continued buying a few tons at a time, at £2 17s. 6d.—on July 22nd the price went down to £2 15s. a ton, as we said we did not want any more, whereupon he reduced the price, saying that he wanted the money—I said to him on one occasion," I think it is very funny; are you quite sure everything is perfectly straight?"—he repeated his explana<lb/>tion, saving that he had a lot of money owing to him—it did not seem possible to me at the time that a man could steal 200 or 300 tons—he said I was the only one he was selling the stuff to at less than market value—I had altogether from him 86 tons, 7 1/2 cwt., for which I paid him in all about £233—on September 23rd I went down to his place, and he offered me some strawboards for which I had no room, so I paid him £25 on account, asking him to keep the stuff at his place till I was ready for them—I produced the receipt for that £25 at the Police Court—five or six years prior to February, 1904, I knew him as a waste dealer, and he used to clear the cuttings from my place—the sizes that we had from him were twenty-five inches by thirty-four inches, twenty-five inches by forty inches, and thirty inches by forty inches—when Mr. Mansell came with the police my brother produced to him 491 bundles, the quantity we Had left, all of which were marked with a number in a diamond.</p>

Stevens, 421, Hackney Road "on them—after the vans were unloaded, Hyman, whom I had seen waiting outside, went into the premises and immediately came out again—he waited about an hour at the entrance to the yard leading to the premises until Bracht came out and spoke to him—after Hyman had departed I spoke to Bracht and went back to his premises, where I obtained samples of the strawboards—I took them to various persons in the trade, and eventually to Coutts &amp; Company, on October 3rd, when Mr. Mansell identified them—at 4 p.m. Inspector Kyd and myself went to Bracht's premises, where we saw Hyman—I told him who we were, and that I had been making enquiries about the four tons of strawboards that he had sold to Bracht, and that I had found they had been stolen on the 29th from Coutts &amp; Company, in Golden Lane—he said, "You are making a</p>

Ince, 406b, Hackney Road"—I asked him for his name and address, and he pointed to the card and said, "That is it"—on his card was "Richard Hyman, Paper Merchant and Metal Dealer, 349, High Street, Islington"—I said, "You do not live there," and he then gave me his address as 17, Park Court, Clapham—then Mr. Mansell came in—I told Hyman that I knew the person whose name he had given on the back of the card, and he said, "I have dealt with Ince for the past eighteen months in strawboards and ochre glazed paper. I have sold the boards to numerous customers, including Schmaltz, 21, Feather-stone Street; Pillivant, 31a, Old Street; H. Cordell, 5, City Garden Row; Messrs. Smith, 219, City Road; Messrs.

I have no place of business, and I keep no books"—he offered to give me any in<lb/>formation I wanted—he was taken to the station—next morning, on being charged, he made no reply—on the same afternoon, about 5 p.m., I went to the New Factory of Coutts &amp; Company, where Schultz was given into my custody by Mr. Mansell—I told him who I was and I said, "The four tons you carted from the wharf on September 29th have been stolen; where did you deliver them to?"—he said, "If I carted them, I deliver them here to Briggs. If I saw the books, I could tell you"—he was taken to the station and the next morning he was shown the carman's receipt book, and he said, "I cannot remember"—when Hyman was searched there were found the letters from Bracht (<hi rend="italic">Ex.

               <p>pounced on me, dragging me to the ground; a third rushed at me in front and caught hold of me—I struggled and got away two or three yards, when they got me down again—at the time one man was holding me by the throat, I could feel the others' hands in my pocket—they were pulling me about, when three or four other men came up, who turned out to be police officers—one of the latter said, "I have been watching this, I have seen him"—I let go of the man and he was taken to the station—I do not identify any of the male prisoners—I had about £2 10s. on me—I do not know what became of it—I heard jingling of money as we went to the station.</p>

I told him they were not in my line; I knew nothing about the value of them. I paid him £5 deposit"—I asked him if he knew the man—I pressed him to tell me the man who he bought them off—he said he was quite a stranger to him and he did not know; the man told him he was going to America and he must get rid of his stock—I kept on asking him to tell me the man who sold him these goods and he said several times he paid £5 deposit, and he said he had to give £35 for them—I then turned to Silverhamer and asked him what he had to do with it—he said, "I know nothing about it: I met this man," pointing to Rodsky, "this morning and he told me he had got a lot of stuff for sale; I am a traveller and I came up here to see it"—I took all three to Bishopsgate Police Station with the goods—when they were charged, neither Rodsky nor Cohen made any reply, but Silverhamer said, "I am innocent; I happened to be up in that room and unfortunately you came up.</p>

I was 18 years old on December 5th, and till then lived in Paris—I had no parents living and no relatives—I had been working in a phonograph factory, but on that day I was out of work—I was on December 5th in the Boulevard Sebastopol, Paris, with another girl—she was a stranger to me—we were looking at some advertisements on a board—a man came up and spoke to me—he was of medium height—[<hi rend="italic">A man here came into Court</hi>]—that is the man; he had a conversation with me—about 11 a.m. next day he came to the house where I was living—I went to a restaurant with him—the other girl was not with me—I re<lb/>mained with him all day—in the afternoon he sent this telegram to London—he gave me some underclothing when he called on me in the morning, and also this white shawl in the evening—I went to St. Lazare railway station to go to Dieppe about 6.30 p.m. the same evening—the man took the ticket for me—I had no luggage with me—on the way to Dieppe some ladies spoke to me—in consequence of what they said I spoke to an officer on the boat—when I arrived at Newhaven I spoke to two police officers—I then came to London, arriving at Victoria about 7.45 a.m.—I had this travelling rug and this shawl on my arm, carried in this manner—the man had told me to wear the white shawl over my arm—at the station I met the prisoner and she took me to a cab—I got into it at once with her—I saw some one get up on the box and sit beside the cabman—when we had nearly arrived at our destination the prisoner said, "That must be a police officer"—she looked out of the cab to see that no other cab was following—she asked me whether I had said anything in the train—I said I had spoken to nobody at all—we got to the prisoner's house, 22, Raphael Street, Knightsbridge, about 8.30 a.m.—she then made me go to bed and gave me some underclothing—the prisoner went to bed with me—I must have slept</p>

                  </hi>, K.C. I reside at St. Swithin's, Hendon—I produce a prospectus of Low, Sons &amp; Bedford, Limited, which came into my possession about March 21st, 1899, I think by post, and upon the faith of which I applied for shares in that company—it states that the capital of the company is £100,000, divided into 50,000 6 per cent, cumu<lb/>lative preference shares of £1 each, and 50,000 ordinary shares of £1 each, and it invites only subscriptions to the preference shares—25,000 ordinary shares are to be paid to the vendors in part payment of the purchase money and the balance of 25,000 are not to be issued for the present—it also states that the preference shares are entitled, amongst other securities, to the formation of a special dividend guarantee reserve fund of £10,000 to be separately invested, and that no debentures can be created without the sanction of at least a three-fourths majority of preference shareholders at a meeting specially convened for the purpose; the directors are James Adams Low, Malcolm Low, Herbert Bedford, and Donald Lamont, who are described as the present partners in the firm of Low, Sons &amp; Bedford, of 101, Leadenhall Street, London, E.C., that the auditor is George Shead, F.C.A., of 18, Laurence Pountney Hill, London, E.C.; that the object of the company being formed is for family reasons to acquire, carry on, and extend the old-established and well-known merchant business of Messrs. Low, Sons &amp; Bedford, including the Australian and African import, and export general merchants, ships' stores merchants and manufacturers, provision merchants and chocolate manufacturers, metal merchants and agents, commission agents and contractors; that the business was founded in 1856, and carried on by Mr. Walter Low until 1891, and since managed by the present partners; that the properties have been valued by Mr. George B. Small piece, a Fellow of the Surveyors' Institute, whose valuation is given in the prospectus—the prospectus then shows a list of assets which will belong to the company, including some working capital for 1898, the total assets up to 1899 being £78,103 1s. 9d.—the first item is, "The freehold and leasehold properties., with the plant, machinery fix<lb/>tures and fittings and appliances therein, the trade marks of the well-known 'Pyn-ka' metal polishes, and the goodwill of the whole, valued by George B. Small piece, £35,500 2s. 10d."—that is taken from the valuation—the second item is, "The cash at bankers and in hand, bills receivable, book debts, and stock-in-trade, guaranteed by the vendors as on 31st December, 1897, after discharging the outstand<lb/>ing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190501090063"/>
               <p>liabilities of the business, at the sum net of £10,200 (but so that any surplus beyond this guaranteed sum shall be handed over to the vendors)"—then there is, "The net profits for 1898 guaranteed by the vendors at not less than £9,500 (less income tax, interest on capital, and discount on bills in that year)"—on the next page is this statement with regard to profits, "The business is a steadily progressive one, as will be seen by the following certificate of the profits from George Shead, F.C.A."—then follows his certificate, dated March 1, 1899, which shows the profits for 1894 as £3,846 15s. 2d.; 1895, £4,213 9s. 4d.; 1896, £6,063 5s. 10d., and 1897, £8,485 16s., and it states, "The figures for the year 1897 include a gum of £1,361 19s. 6d. in respect of an interest in a manufacturing business acquired during that year, such amount being based upon profits up to the time of acquirement"—I read those figures, and in connection with the next paragraph I regard them as the most material thing in the whole prospectus: "The purchase price includes the profits of the business made during 1898, the account of which cannot be completed pending the arrival of returns from Australia and Africa for outstanding shipments, but the vendors, with the knowledge of the increased amount of business done, and of the results obtained, are able to estimate the profit earned, and they therefore guarantee the net profit for the year 1898 on the same basis as above shall amount to not less than £9,500. The net profit for 1897 as certified, amounts to £8,485 16s. To pay 6 per cent, dividend on 50,000 preference shares requires £3,000; to pay 10 per<lb/>cent. dividend on 25,000 ordinary shares requires £2,500, the total £5,500 leaving a surplus for re<lb/>serve account of £2,985 16s., without taking any account of the increased profit of 1898, or of any profit to be earned by the employment of the £20,000 additional working capital"—I was impressed by that paragraph; it was by those figures of the income over a series of years with reference to the capital of the company, together with the figures of the purchase price in connection with the assets, which induced me to apply for preference shares in the company—I observed that the net profit in 1897 was nearly three times as much as the dividend on the preference shares—this paragraph is material in reference to the statement as to the assets: "The purchase price to be paid for the business and assets as above mentioned has been fixed by the vendors, Messrs. Low, Sons &amp; Bedford, who are the promoters at £55,000, payable as to £25,000 in fully-paid ordinary shares of the company, and the balance in cash out of which they will pay all expenses connected with the formation of the company up to allotment, except the registration fees and stamp duties"—on the faith of the statements con-tained in that prospectus I applied for 500 preference shares on March 21st, 1899—my cheques are produced for £62 10s., the application money, £186 10s. on allotment on March 24th, and the balance of £250 on May 1st—I think I received four dividends—the first was in March, 1900—I also received the report and balance sheet of the directors dated June 27th, 1900 (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I attended the meeting of the shareholders when it was pre<lb/>sented—it shows a net profit of £9,135 9s. 1d.—among the assets stated are, "By cash at bankers, in hand, and bills receivable, £3,985 11s. 2d." "Freehold and leasehold properties, with plant and machinery and the</p>

               <p>'Pyn-ka' trade marks, goodwill and valuations, together with additions of machinery since made, £38,181 7s. 7d. 'Sundry debtors, £7,078 12s. 2d.,"—I was greatly struck by the 15 per cent, dividend paid the first year, and the fact that in addition to that a large sum was stated to be carried forward to the reserve fund, and I purchased further preference shares upon the market—the asterisk refers to sundry creditors and sundry debtors, and the notice on the next page states that the amount set aside for depreciation and all possible debts is ample for the purpose—the auditors certificate is dated June 27th, 1900—I looked upon that as showing that the business was very flourishing for the preference shareholders, and on November 24th I made a further purchase—my cheque (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) for £205 is dated Novem<lb/>ber 27th, and includes the payment for 80 shares at 16s.—the note on the back of the cheque is a copy of my counterfoil—I think I had a dividend upon my second purchase—I think I had four dividends altogether, and those I received on the dates at which they became due—I have not received anything more for my capital, and since then the company has gone into liquidation.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RAWLINSON</hi>. The company was voluntarily wound up in July, 1901—I will take the figures from you—I attended the meeting of the company when the resolution was passed to wind up the company voluntarily; I think I either proposed or supported a resolution for a com<lb/>pulsory winding up, but that was not carried, and the resolution for winding up voluntarily was carried against me—I had been on some committee before that, but after that I had nothing more to do with the company—after the resolution was passed I was put upon some other committee, but I declined to serve—I only know that by a letter I had from Mr. Watkins, the voluntary liquidator—I had nothing whatever to do with Mr. Watkins; I saw him several times, when the consideration was whether the company was to be wound up voluntarily—I cannot recollect when Mr. Watkins was appointed—he may have acted for eighteen months—I cannot speak as to his absconding with £6,000, as I took no further interest in the matter, except with regard to my shares—I never ascertained what they realised—I heard that Mr. Watkins absconded with £6,000—I believe Mr. Evans, a member of a committee, called upon me, and, excepting seeing Mr. Evans, whom I got rid of as quickly as I could, I do not think I saw anybody in connection with the company—I saw Mr. Peterson—I am trying to recollect—do you refer to someone who was a former clerk of the company and was convicted of embezzlement?—I do not think I saw him after the date of the resolution—Mr. Peterson wrote to me when I was a member of the first committee, and said he could give me important information, and I took what information he could give, so that I saw him on one or two occasions, but to the best of my recollection after the date of the resolution I did not see Mr. Peterson again—I went into the figures with Watkins before the resolution—I am sorry I cannot help you but I have no knowledge of the facts referred to in the prospectus—I will take them and the dates from you—I know nothing about Mr. Smallpeice—I am not making a complaint—I have only complained that the business was represented as flourishing when it all tumbled to pieces—I cannot criticize it upon your summary of</p>

               <p>facts—I controvert your proposition that the business was steadily pro<lb/>greesive when there was a lose in any year—I should have thought that the profit and loss account for the series of years from 1894 to 1897 would hardly apply at all to this case—I do not think I had the books before me; all that was brought to my notice when I served on a committee was Mr. Watkins' statement of assets and liabilities—I can tell you what took place at the meeting, and the questions we had to decide—I have seen books, but not their contents—what was put before the committee were figures derived from them, but the books themselves were not gone into; a subse<lb/>quent committee very likely did go into the books—I did not arrive at any definite figures, but only the general conclusion that there was a very large margin to pay the dividends on the preference shares applied for—I do not remember seeing the contracts with the company—I do not think I knew of anything unless I gathered it from the balance sheet and the report—I did not know of the debts of the vendors, but it would be equally im<lb/>portant to make allowance for debts whether they occurred in one year or the year before, or at any time, provided they were not statute barred—I was aware that any surplus over the £10,000 would have to be paid to the company and any deficit made up—the Report dated June 27th was read at the meeting on July 6th—before I bought my second lot of shares and paid my £80 cheque I read a broker's circular pointing out an extraordinary divi<lb/>dend—I have not got it—I do not know where it is—I think the broker's name was Jenkins on—about the same time I got another offer of preference shares at 16s.—I have not got that circular, but I have a letter in reply to mine which fixes the date as November 24th.</p>

Mr. Walter Low, and I think that name was added as the fourth surety—there was some difficulty in getting him to consent to become a guarantor—I knew he was Low's father, but that he was unconnected with the firm—I produce a copy of the letter I wrote on the matter, and the further correspondence with reference to it—after negotiation, the four directors were added as sureties, including the defendants, James Low and Bedford, and this cheque was drawn for £9,509 7s. 6d., payable to Donald Lamont or order; it is endorsed by him, and it has been paid into the City Branch of Lloyd's Bank in Lombard Street—the difference between that sum and the £10,000 borrowed, viz., £490 12s. 6d., represents premiums and legal expenses, but no interest; the interest is not payable in advance—it is a premium on the life insurance, or in connection with it, of Donald Lamont, and of the other directors—I think they were all insured—the words" Payees dis<lb/>charge direct" are added by the bank.</p>

I live at 19, Winchester Terrace, Twickenham—I was appointed voluntary liquidator of Low, Sons &amp; Bedford, Limited, in July, 1901—in going into the claims against the company I saw James Low in the summer of 1902—he stated that his wife had a claim against the company too, but the books did not disclose that, and I told him that he should support his claim by his statutory declaration, or by an affidavit—subsequently a formal notice was sent by the solicitor to the company to Mrs. Low to put in a claim—Mr. Tippetts was acting as my solicitor—on August 19th, 1902, Mr. and Mrs. Low called upon me, when the claim was put in writing in the shape of a statutory declaration jointly made by them as to two claims of Mrs. Low—I handed it to Mr. Tippetts—I have no record of its being returned—when the compulsory winding up order was made, the books and documents in my possession were handed over to the Official Receiver—I have now no papers of the company, and I should say that document is lost.</p>

I went into the papers carefully during the eighteen months I was liquidator—I made a return to the Income Tax Commissioners in March, 1602—I think it was drawn up by one of my managing clerks for the purpose of getting the claim for income tax struck out—£4,600 appeared in the books in reference to Captain Cutler—this is a copy of accounts sent in to the Income Tax Commissioners—I was an accountant at that time—I knew the Government would act upon my certificate—the £4,500 appears on one side of the account and not on the other, unless it is included in the statement, "Bad debts, £8,900"—speaking from memory, the company sold their rights to Captain Cutler's Syndicate for £4,500, and if that syndicate had not paid the £4,500 it would certainly be recorded amongst the bad debts—accord<lb/>ing to the books, the money was not received—my clerk, I should think, would furnish me with a list of the moneys making up the £9,500—in the cash book is the record of sale to Captain Cutler's Syndicate for £4,500 on July 13th, and on the other side is the record of a payment partly by bills, but the question arises, were those bills met, and there is an entry of £2,100 cash—that is <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi> evidence that the money was paid—that being so, I have taken it as a profit, and income tax has been charged—there were no profits.</p>

When the books and documents came into my possession under the order for the compulsory winding up of the company in March, 1903, they were registered and handed to an accountant (Mr. Walter Nearney, I think), who was instructed by the directors to prepare a statement of affairs—that was put in in July, when I found I had not all the books—I received other books in November—I missed Ledger H, a private ledger which was afterwards found in a vault which had been rented by Mr. Watkins in the City, and there were a large number of other books referring to this company and to other cases in that vault or coal cellar—private Ledger H was necessary to complete my investiga<lb/>tion—among the other books that came into my possession was the directors' minute book, from which I find that the first meeting of the company was held on March 20th, 1899, and those minutes show that James Low, Herbert Bedford, Malcolm Low and Donald Lamont attended, and there were two resolutions that the agreement of that date between those gentlemen and the old firm should be executed, that they should become directors, and that George Shead should be appointed auditor and S. Brindle secretary—those minutes are signed by James A. Low as chairman—they were confirmed on March 23rd, when all the four directors were present, James Low being in the chair—applications for shares were considered at that meeting—Shead's certificate that the books and ac<lb/>counts for the three years 1895 to 1897, inclusive, were correct is dated June 18th, 1898—that certificate is identical with the ones for the years ending April, 1888, and March, 1894 and 1899—I think it is in Shead's writing—the words, "To the directors of Low, Sons &amp; Bedford, Limited," and "I am, Yours faithfully, are in pencil—the figures and profits for 1896 and 1897 are the same—among the documents handed to me by Inspector Willis are the letters written by Bedford and Shead between July, 1898, and July, 1900, on the company's business, and some minute books of the company (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I also find amongst the documents copies of the directors, report and balance sheet, agenda papers, and other papers in Shead's writing—I find that a preference dividend was paid in Sep<lb/>tember, 1900, and in March, 1901—the profits of 1896 and 1897 are stated to be £6,063 5s. 10d. and £8,485 16s. as certified by Shead.</p>

Amongst the docu<lb/>ments that came from Watkins I find a detailed profit and loss account for those two years showing those profits—this document pro<lb/>duced by the police shows the same figures and that some figures have been erased—some of the items are in Bedford's writing—the figures £8,546 19s. 4d. as profits have been crossed out and £8,596 19s. 4d. copied below it—the sum of £8,485 16s. has been substituted for £8,546 19s. 4d. and there are other alterations—from examination of the accounts I find there was a loss on the confectionery part of the business in 1896 of £806 19s. 8d.—it was carried on by the firm at 89 and 90, Bermondsey Street, the premises mentioned in the schedule—that business was transferred

               <p>to the company in December, 1895—it was acquired from Radcliffe, Hoskins &amp; Co.—that loss was not taken into account in arriving at the profit in 1896, as shown on the prospectus—in 1897 there was a further loss of about £3,046 8s. 8d., which was not taken into account in arriving at the profit for 1897—the loss continued in 1898 and 1899—the lose on that business in 1898 was £2,057 16s. 1d.; in 1899, £1,939 6s. 11d., or £3,997 odd for those two periods—I find an entry in the books of a bill for £1,939—the total loss from that business from 1896 was over £7,000—it was going on all the time—the balance sheet to December 31st, 1897, when the old business was taken over by the old firm by the company, is in Shead's writing—I find this entry, "Lees Confectionery Establishment Account, £3,594 19s. 2d."—that is the debit balance on the confectionery trading account at the end of 1897, including a balance brought forward from 1896—it is deducted from capital and not charged to revenue as it should be—I see no reason why those losses should be disregarded in the profits shown in the prospectus—before arriving at the definite balance on the account in 1896, which was £500 odd in the ledger, the actual loss was £800 and a proportion is written off, £270, I think from recollection, to capital account, towards the end of 1896, so that you have to add that to the debit balance—these sums are treated as a deduction from capital, leaving out £500 odd of the loss shown on the account—I have examined the books with regard to the cash at bankers, bills receivable, and so on, put at £10,200, and find that the total gross assets from that source comes to £53,234 14s. 10d., without any deduction; and Exhibit 30 shows the particulars of that, viz., book debts as per separate list which I have made out, and which amount to £30,583 2s. 8d. as shown in Exhibit 31—Exhibit 32 is a list of the outstanding liabilities, which amount to £50,817 0s. 11d.—deducting that from the assets it leaves £2,517 13s. 11d., assuming that all the book debts are good, instead of the £10,200, as appears in the pro<lb/>spectus—in the book debts I include the item from the suspense account of £3,239 4s. 5d.—since I made that calculation I have come to the con<lb/>clusion from the books that credit should not be given for that amount—if that credit be deducted the whole surplus disappears, and instead of a balance of £10,200 there would be a deficit of £721 10s. 6d.—Exhibit 95 shows how the £10,200 was arrived at—it is in the writing of Pillinger, Shead's clerk, and is a balance sheet from March 31st, 1900, drafted from journal entries—in Journal J I find corresponding entries—this is fifteen months after the company had been formed—the cash at bankers and in hand is put at £1,112 14s. 9d.; bills receivable, £1,296 5s. 7d.; and stock in trade, £20,204 7s. 9d., &amp;c, adding up to £59,600 8s.; but some sundry debtors are left out and sundry creditors are put down as £16,054 5s. 1d.; bills payable, £17,956 2s. lid.; and Parr's Bank, £15,390—there was a loan by Parr's Bank—the total is £49,400 8s.—that sum is left out of the surplus shown in the prospectus—this document is the purchase price account of Low, Sons &amp; Bedford; the vendors' account, as per regies<lb/>tered contract, March 8th, 1899—in arriving at the surplus of £10,200 in the prospectus the sundry creditors are taken at £16,054 5s. 1d. or 4s. 1d. in another document, which does not agree with my figure, which comes</p>

Bedford, £4,520 5s. 6d.—except Lamont, I have included those in my figures, and the total is £13,421 12s.; but Lamont should have been taken into account in arriving at the £10,200—in my list is another liability to Fisher of £5,353 14s. 10d.—that is the largest liability—that is not included in the list—adding that sum brings the total up to £15,766 14s. 3d. which has been improperly disregarded—looking at the balance sheet of December 31st, 1897, I find this entry on the left hand side: "The deposit accounts to be paid off by the partners and provided for in the agreement of sale, £13,421 12s."—the word "and" has been altered from something else—it is all in pencil—most of it is in Shead's writing, but some of the words are in Bedford's hand—the figure is the same as the total of the deposit accounts in the bracket, but excepting Fisher and including Lamont—that sum was not paid off by the partners—I find no provision in the agreement providing for it—after the formation of the company the accounts were continued in the firm's books and were carried on as the company's accounts in those books—the deposits appear as liabilities of the company and payments were made to the depositors for interest from time to time and there were repayments—some depositors had been paid out of the company's assets, including Brown k Brown on January 18th, 1899, and, I think, Miss Marrison, before the formation of the company in March, 1899, for taking over the business from January, 1897—there are payments of interest to Miss "Marrison in April and July, 1899—the trustees of Mrs. Walter Low were paid off in April, 1899—none of those payments were debited to the vendors—there is one journal entry in March, 1901, debiting four sums to the vendors in the transfer accounts—in Journal J there is a debit to Major Gardner of £39 4s. and J. B. Macdonald £90 9s. 6d.; and credits to Miss Marrison, £345; Mrs. Brindle, £1,320; J. T. Bedford, £5,307 18s. 6d.; and Fisher, £2,178 16s. 7d.—the difference between the credits and debits is £9,022 1s. 7d.—some of these accounts had been cancelled by amounts previously standing to their credit being credited to the vendors before the date of the balance sheet and after the date of the balance sheet (1900) they were written back again and the depositors appear as creditors of the company instead of creditors of the vendors—they were old deposits which had been transferred from the credit of individual people to the credit of Low, Sons &amp; Bedford transfer account in March, 1900—the deposit accounts were improperly excluded in arriving at the £10,200—that account was carried on in the books of the company as a liability of the company—there is a note on Exhibit 35, "Deposit Account"—</p>

Fisher died before the formation of the company, and the amount was due to the executors or the trustees of the marriage settlement—this is the contract (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) made by James Adams Low for the company in the winding up, dated February 19th, 1904, with regard to the deposit account—the £106 8s. 2d. relates to the balance of Fisher's account in the J ledger, the rest having been paid off—I did not deal with the claim, but I understand that on the ground of Low being a trustee he could not claim it—two sums were paid off in March, 1900, of £1,650 and £1,3 50 and there was another payment made on May 18th, 1900, of £2,062—that is all after the formation of the company, and appears as paid off out of the company's assets and by the company's cheques—apart from the suspense account I treated all the debts as good—the £4,407 13s. 11d. due from Gordon Dilworth &amp; Company, and appearing in the bought ledger, is not shown in the list of creditors—£3,225 10s. appears in that ledger as a balance—if that £4,407 13s. 11d. was a bad debt it would swell the debits—5d. in the £ was paid on £1,750 and on £55—Jeasurun's name does not appear in the books-as a debtor of the company, nor in the directors' statement of affairs in the winding up—nothing has been paid by him in respect of his debt—I know of no contract with him guaranteeing anything with regard to that debt—the Monarch Motor Company, Limited, and the Dilworth Safety Bottle Company were in compulsory liquidation before Low, Sons &amp; Bedford became a company, the winding up orders being in December and June, 1902—there is a debt of Ratcliffe Hoskins &amp; Company, of £7,363 18s. 5d., in respect of which nothing was recovered—the list of book debts includes £785 3s. 1d., a very old-standing debt—I have not gone back to 1892 in this ledger—there was an old Ledger J—this begins in 1894, with a balance of £14,000 2s. 3d.—on Decem<lb/>ber 31st there is, "By draft transferred from account Watson, £8,215 4s. 2d." and there are some trifling debits, one in December, 1894, of £932 7s. 6d. for sundries; another for interest, £514 2s. 10d.; and in December there are two credits, the £8,215 4s. 2d. and sundries, £5,549 9s. 3d.; and a balance due from Inglis on January 1st, 1895, of £1,686 15s. 10d.—the £14,000 debited in January, 1894, is cleared off in December, 1894, except £1,686 18s. 4d.—that is slightly increased in 1895—the bills payable are: May, £53312s.; June, £714; July, £77319s.; and there are these debits: cash, £150; cables <hi rend="italic">re</hi> Scottish Australian Bank, £163; and sundries, £260. on the other side are amounts of cash in January and July, 1895, of £102, and £81; and sundries, £146; and then we go on to 1897—all the debits' of the £1,686 belong to 1896, and not to 1895, except the debit for sundries of £29 15s. 4d. for bills receivable, cash, and so on, and then there are credits which may be 1895 or 1896, it does not state—in January, 1897, there is a debt due from Inglis of £3,146 0s. 7d. on the other side of the account—on January 1st, 1896, there is: "By sundries, £1,213 0s. 5d.," again on the debit side, and there i# a second balance of £1,94316s.—"Inglis, £385 3s. 1d," is in my list—in 1897 there are two credits, one from Inglis (Scottish Bank), of £86 15s. 6d., and "Service, £163 13s. 8d.,"which brings down the balance to January 1st, 1898, to £1,785 3s. 1d.—as Official</p>

               <p>Receiver I tried to communicate with Inglis, but could not find him—we made enquiries through our Australian agents—formal application was made for the debt, though not by me—another debt of £1,511 2s. 4d. is due from Oldham in that list, from Watson of £872 9s. 5d., of which nothing has been received—in the report of the directors the balance due to them is stated to be £9,135 9s. lid., during the period of fifteen months' trading—I think the real amount of the confectionery loss was rather more than £1,939 6s. 11d., part of the amount being debited to Malcolm Low—the real lose was £2,034 19s. 5d.—I find according to the books that he gave his bill for that amount on December 12th, 1900—that bill was cancelled—it is in Brindle's writing—that loss was not taken into account—in the profits there has been included in the profit and loss account £6,552 11s. 3d. from the "Pyn-ka" trade marks—I get that from Ledger J 3, folio 167—that profit includes a special item of £4,500 for profit made on the sale of trade rights of Captain Cutler's Razor Reviver—turning to the trading account ii the ledger I find under date March 31st, 1900, that the account is credited with an entry, "Captain Cutler's Razor Reviver, £4,500"—on the same date there is an account opened called "the Captain Cutler Account"—I do not know when it was opened, but February 11th is the last date covered by the balance sheet in the profit and loss account, and the Captain Cutler account is debited on March 31st, "To Trade Mark and Trading Rights, Captain Cutler's Razor Reviver £4,500"—bills are credited on the other side, to become due in June, October, and February, 1901, to the total amount of £2,400, leaving a balance on March 31st, as due, of £2,100, so that according to the accounts the position on March 31st, 1900, in respect of this transaction, was that the company held three bills for £800 each, none of which had matured, and that a balance of £2,100 was due from whoever had purchased the Trade Marks and the Trading Rights described as Captain Cutler's—there is a further entry of a payment on May 19th, by cash, of £2,100, the balance—on the credit side under date February 11th the bill due and the folio "7"and the figures "72"have been written over an erasure, but not the "1900"—the word "by" is not over an erasure, but I think the words "bills due" are—then there is another erasure where the figure "8 "has been written in in the "800" in the first line—turning to the bills received book I produce Exhibit 43, where I find entries corresponding to those I have mentioned as the amounts received from Captain Cutler's Syndicate—February 12th, 1900, is said to be the date of one bill, but there is no date when it was received—the bills are drawn on Captain Cutler's Syndicate—the date has been altered from February 11th to February 12th—the first bill is due on June 15th, the second on October 15th, and the third on February 15th 1901, and they are each for £800—in the column to be filled in "When and how disposed of, "there is an erasure—"3s. 4d." is scratched out and "19th May" substituted, and similar entries are made with regard to the second and third bills, but there has been no scratching out on the third, only on the first and second—the date of the previous bill "H. H. S. Budget," is March 30th—from my examination of the books I should say the three bills with regard to Captain Cutler's Syndicate must have been</p>

Who had advanced money to the company which he had guaranteed the repay<lb/>ment of—his personal debts were only £24 or £25 to trades people—he had a trust claim of £100—I do not suppose he will ever get it—his wife hid to pay between £3,000, and £4,000, of her private money over the guarantee to the Norwich Union—through the formation of the company Low has parted with his interest in the firm—he has been made a bankrupt and is earning his living as the manager of a canned goods department in the City—the partners (the vendors) were liable to pay the debts of the firm to December 31st, 1897—if the assets were under £10,200 they were liable to make up the amount, and if over that sum to keep them—that was the guarantee—they would have to wait eighteen months before the accounts could be settled—the sale of the business to the company was carried out in March, 1899—the books were constantly altering between December, 1897, and March, 1899—the exact balance would take some time to ascertain as regards the profit and loss account—the adjustment would run into a good many months—the firm's books were continued by the company—the company not being able to pay £30,000 in cash caused further difficulty, as the vendors had to take shares—many of the vendors, friends had deposited money in the business in that sum of £13,473, which was bracketed as the deposit account—the firm was regarded as a well<lb/>known solvent firm—Major Gardener was a friend of the senior partner—I regarded the deposits as different in character to the ordinary debts of the firm; they were money lent—I put them down as trade debts—I had many interviews with the company's officials in the winding up—I did not ex<lb/>amine them in Court—I asked them for explanations where I needed them—the Official Receiver's report, which I had drafted in support of the applica<lb/>tion for an order for public examination, was ready to be filed, but the facts had been reported to the Board of Trade, which issued a report stating there was a <hi rend="italic">prima jade</hi> case for criminal proceedings, and in those cases the practice has been not to publicly examine—the exclusion of the deposit accounts went on to March, 1900, when matters were approaching adjust<lb/>ment—by the guarantee those liabilities must be met by the vendors—in 1897 they simply went on in the books—on March 31, 1900, they were credited to the transfer, and the books showed them to be a liability of the vendors—the company continued to pay the interest on them—the £693 17s. 7d. shown in Journal J is interest on deposit and on various bills—the £344 10s. 10d. in Ledger J, one of the items marked with a cross, refers to interest on deposits and bills payable shown in the journal—the £8 5s. 4d. is a bill account—the names of the depositors are given in the ledger—the</p>

In Bedford's bankruptcy there was no private debt—his debts were in connection with liabilities which he had personally incurred on behalf of the limited company—the £10,200 wrong, Among other reasons, because of the debts which were taken as due to the old firm at that time—the list (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 30) shows them to be about £30,000—in the suspense account I have given you the benefit of too much—that would bring the figure down to £27,000—I take that figure from the books—in Exhibit 34, handed to us by the police from Shead's possession, the debts are shown as £41,572, "as per list" (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 100)—I probably checked that list with mine—the figures, except two balances, are at the end of the Bought Ledger and General Transfer Account—they are the same as mine, of £27,000—I have taken the balance in the Bought Ledger and General Transfer Account, which are the sums of the Bought and Sold Ledgers, as one balance—those are debts of the old firm—I was told by Bedford and Low that in selling these book debts, if they were sold to the company, the firm charged £5,000 less than their face value, £41,572, so as to make an allowance for the bad debts—in the books I found that had been done, but the amount is £36,000 instead of £41.000—the amount allowed for bad debts in the ledger is £5,582 3s. 11d.—there is no entry showing this £36,000 until the end of March, 1900—the amount could be arrived at at the close of the year—I do not know that the £5,582 was taken off before the guarantee—I discovered how the £10,200 was made up from the journal—I saw Piliinger's draft (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 95) dated March 31st, 1900—to the £3,239 in the suspense account should be added £1,785—that leaves the debts that ought to have been known to be bad at £8,700 up to December 31st, 1897—the figure is not £13,700, less £5,000, because you have the large debt of Ratcliffe Hoskins—taking the debts which turned out to be bad since December, 1897, of the £8,700 £4,400, rather more than half, is the debt of Gordon Dilworth, or £4 500—I do not agree that you were only wrong in your estimate by £32,000—there is a definite statement that the assets exceed the liabilities by £10,200—as far as the debts are concerned, your estimate is only wrong to the extent of £30,000—I was told that the Monarch Motor Cur Company and the Bottle Company had deposited shares with Vandyke, Gordon Dilworth and others—I saw that on the minutes of the company after the</p>

               <p>notice to produce—Jessurun deposited shares which were transferred into the names of one of the Lows or two or three of the directors, as the case might be—I was told in May, 1903, that security was given for £4,400 by shares in two separate companies, and in the books I found an entry of 200 shares in each of those companies standing in the names of each of two directors, or 400 shares in each company—shares were pledged to Vandyke, I do not know to what amount; he was not approached, as he has not brought in a claim—we have had some claims for bills which were originally issued by Vandyke—he advanced money to the company, and shares were given as security—I asked him for, a statement, but he has not sent one—it is new to me if he has made a statement—some Dilworth shares are in the hands of Vandyke at Amsterdam for an advance; about 400, I think—the shares are quite worthless—the companies were not wound up till 1902—if the companies were wound up prior to June, 1891, that would be material to the prosecution—I do not say that you ought to return all Gordon Dilworth's debts as bad—£3,239 is in the suspense account for bad debts—the fact that the company paid the interest to the depositors seems to support the view that the deposits were the company's debts—in the confectionery losses the years in question are 1896, 1897—the profits shown in the prospectus are subject to the deductions named there for income tax and so forth—they were £8,000 odd in 1897 and £6,000 odd in 1896, but they should be reduced, as regards 1896, by £800, which would make the profits in 1896 £5,000 odd, and the profits in 1897 should be reduced by £3,000 odd, making them £6,000 odd—I do not suggest that any bad debts should be deducted for 1896—so far as 1896 is concerned, the difference between us is £806—the valuation of the confectionery business at £1,763 16s. was included in the valuation of £7,763 for the Pyn-ka and confectionery business together, by Mr. Smallpeice, who is dead—that excludes any value for stock or goodwill—the company did not get the goodwill for nothing, because Mr. Smallpeice valued the whole business at three years' profit, but the defendants have left out the losses—the object being to produce a more valuable business, it would defend on what you spend the money on whether they can be called establishment expenses; money spent on advertisements and commissions are establishment expenses, but not simply purchases of goods—extra labour would, if it is for the purpose of working up business—money spent in the first year you put down as an asset—I did not notice that there were extra travellers, and so forth, but there are charges with regard to the trade in South Africa, which would involve travellers' expenses and so forth—in the confectionery business there was a loss in the fifteen months of £1,900, and Malcolm Low gave his bill for £1,900 odd in June, 1900; it became due in December 1900, and it was cancelled on March 19th, 1901—it appears to have been carried to the debit of Malcolm Low—that did not finish the transaction; I have read the entry, "To bill cancelled"—it only appears in the ledger in his own account—I have never seen the bill—the document ceased as a negotiable instrument, but the entry is against Malcolm, who has never been made a bankrupt—the bill was given because of the confectionery loss—it was found that Captain Cutler's Pyn-ka polish, powdered up,</p>

               <p>could be used as a razor reviver, so I have been told, but I have not tried it, and samples were sold to all sorts of traders; afterwards the syndicate was formed, and agents were appointed to sell it for the wholesale business—the confectionery business was mostly chocolate, I believe—that was wholesale, but separate from the Pyn-ka—the trade mark of Pyn-ka or Pun-ka was taken out to prevent anybody adopting the word "Pun-ka" end the public confusing it with Pyn-ka—Low, Sons and Bedford acted as the distributing agents, and the triangular box was registered in the name not of the limited company, but in the name of James Adams Low—the trading account, which was headed "Captain Cutler," has been altered to "Captain Cutler's Syndicate"—that account shows the purchases, end so forth—the account is for the purchase of materials and for advertisements, but I do not think for any sales—this is the Pyn-ka agreement—on it I can see pencil marks and brackets as if it had been used as a model.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RAWLINSON</hi>) The Pyn-ka agreement is dated June 18th, 1894—I find an entry of three bills of £800 each, one dated February 12th and the other two February 11th—there is a further entry, showing a debit of £2,100, making up £4,500, on February 11th or 12th—a balance has been struck, and there is properly credited in April £3,056 17s. 9d.—the entries come in their proper order, April 2nd, 11th, 14th, 17th, and 28th—it appears to me the analysis of six months are written up at once—the £4,500 appears to have been paid by bills and by part of the Norwich Union cheque, according to the books, to the earlier syndicate—the Norwich Union cheque for £9,500 was paid into the company on May 18th—there would be discount charges on the bills, the cost of the agreement to act as agents, and so on to be ad<lb/>justed—the prospectus was issued to the public on March 20th, 1899—Shead has had the opportunity of going through our papers and the books—the company was to have paid to the vendors £25,000 in ordinary shares and £30,000 in cash—the 25,000 ordinary shares still remain—for the £30,000 the vendors had to take preference shares, which realized £5,549, payable to them or to their nominees—the £5,549 was carried to the transfer account on account of their indebtedness—I do not know that 1901, when the company was wound up, was an exceedingly bad time for commercial companies having trade with the Colonies and general trade—the war was coming to a close, but I do not know anything about the trade—I believe things were pretty bad in 1901 and 1902—when the company went into voluntary liquidation in July, 1901, Watkins realised about £17,000—he absconded with between £5,000 and £6,000, but he had to pay out a large sum to realise that amount—I realized £3,000 in round figures—practically Watkins walked off with the whole of the net receipts—the Treasury made a communication to the Board of Trade, but I cannot say the date—at some date or other Watkins sent to the Treasury a printed report—the Board of Trade took proceedings against him in 1902—they never got anything from him—our department

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> In the prospectus the profits are shown for 1896 at £6,000 odd, less due on the confectionery business £800—that £800 has not been deducted from the profits for that year—in 1897 the same thing occurred with regard to a larger sum, the profits are put at £8,465, less on the confectionery business £3,000, which has not been deducted—from the books I find those losses were incurred in purchasing goods, in salaries and in rent, as compared with receipts—in my opinion they could not be treated as establishment expenses, but must be treated as losses—they are treated as establishment expenses because they are put in as an asset—in the books of the company they are put in as a debt due to the vendors, and therefore as an asset—in the list of assets in the prospectus which are to be taken over by the company they are not included—they must be treated either as assets or as losses, and they are treated as assets—they are not so treated in the prospectus; they are left out altogether and ignored—the losses on the confectionery business which Malcolm Low took over has nothing to do with anything before January, 1899, so that debiting him with losses has nothing to do with the period referred to—the £10,200 is wrong because the deposits were ignored, including Mr. Fisher's deposit, and because that bad debts are ignored—roughly, about £15,000 was due to depositors, including Fisher—the dates given in the prospectus are to the end of 1897—some of the debts had then been paid off, but the bulk of them Were still due—the vendors were debited with interest to the amount of £344 in March, 1900, but without that entry, the company is debited with those items for a period of twelve months after they had been in existence, and at a date at which they are preparing to issue a "balance sheet to the shareholders—the entries marked with the red cross are from March, 1899, to March, 1900—none of those items for interest are debited to the vendors so far as I can see—they are, not marked with the red cross or included in the £344—the company paid those sums when they continued the business from January let, 1398, and the vendors are not debited with any of them—in 1899 there is a payment of principal to the trustees of Mrs. Walter Low, of £100—that is not debited to the vendors—principal sum of £375 is paid to the estate</p>

               <p>of Walter Low (deceased) in April, 1899—that is after the company is in possession—I do not find that the vendors are debited with that—the interest paid was 5 per cent, on the principal that was due—if the debts which have turned out to be bad had been taken into consideration the £10,200 would have disappeared altogether and a deficit of over £7,000 would have taken its place, because the debts at that time which have turned out to be bad amount to £17,570—allowing for the £5,582, there still remains £11,988 for bad debts, so that the £10,200 would have been wiped out and there would have been a deficit even if that deduction were made—among the items making up the £17,570 11s. 6d. are Ratcliffe Hoskins, £7,263; Gordon Dilworth, £4,407; Imperial Crown Labels, £371; Fairman, £358; Inglis, £17,085; Oldham, £15,011; and Watson, £18,072; leaving out the shillings and pence—the £5,582 comes first into the books in March, 1900—that sum had been deducted so as to arrive at the total, tat not put in the books till the end of 1899 or the beginning of 1900, when it comes in J 349 only—in the general transfer account the figure credited to the purchase price for the amount of book debts is £36,986 19s. 11d.—that is different from the £42,569 3s. 11d.—there is a draft journal entry which agrees with that book—at the period of the balance sheet of 1900 the bad debts which turned out to be bad existed at the same figure—there is a slight deduction, but the sum reserved for writing off is not sufficient whether it refers to debts incurred within that period of fifteen months or before it—the profit set out in the report and balance sheet in the profit and loss account with regard to the Captain Cutler's Syndicate is £9,135, but that is reduced by one half, and the £4,500 was paid to the company out of the Norwich Union cheque—the books show that—the bank column shows that £5,500 was paid into the Bank by Low, Sons &amp; Bedford; the other column shows the ledger page to which it is posted, but the cash book does not show one cheque of £9,600 as paid into the bank—in order to make up the total of £10,000,£490 12s. 6d. is represented to be paid to Low, Sons A Bedford—it is not a real payment—there are two journal entries with regard to that, and that transaction is completed on May 18th, 1900—it was a borrowing by Mr. Lamont, one of the partners and vendors, with the other partners as sureties, and additional sureties, of £10,000 from the Norwich Union, and the cheque was paid into the account of the company the same day, or on May 19th—on May 18th, 1900, there is a bill accepted by the company given to Mr. Lamont—it is endorsed by Lamont and "Mr. Walter Low, so that the company immediately made themselves liable for £5,000 of the money borrowed—the £4,500 balance of the £10,000 was claimed by Mrs. James Low from the company as a debt due by the company—in one place she only claimed £3,000, but she put in another claim for £5,000—the proof was supported by the statutory declaration of Mr. James Low—if the company were liable to anybody they never got a farthing profit out of that £4,500—Mrs. James Low's proof has not been rejected, but Mr. James Low's has to the extent of £106 2s.—Mrs. James Low claimed through Lamont, who owed money to the father, and one debt was set against the other—the directors drew money out of the bank during 1898, 1899, and 1900—during 1898 James</p>

I cannot find that the vendors were debited with any part of the principal due to the depositors—I have examined the entries with regard to the payment of principal from January 1st, 1898, to the end of the books, that is, to the end of the balance sheet, March 31st, 1900—I have given evidence of a debit entry after that date in connection with the £9,000 odd from the Norwich Union-there is no date, simply the balance the vendors received to credit £13,000—it includes some old depositors—the debit of £9,000, I think, acknowledges that to the extent of £9,000—the first entry with regard to credit in respect of deposi<lb/>tors with Low, Sons &amp; Bedford is in the transfer account, folio 438, "March 80th, 1900. By sundries, £13,143 14s. 5d. "at page 4 of the journal; that is made up of, H. Bedford (B Account) £3,843 16s. 4d., that is not an old deposit account which appears on January 1st, 1898—then Gardener, £925 16s. 2d.; Marrison, £345; Mrs. Brindle, £2,000; J.T. Bedford, £6,029 1s. 11d.—with the exception of H. Bedford, the first named, they are all old deposit accounts which existed on January 1st, 1898, and they represent the interest account on March 31st, 1900—I cannot find any Justification for the credit entry to the vendors—my experience in accounts has been since 1888—I have been a chartered accountant a year and a half—since then I have been in one situation as a bookkeeper—I have had experience not only in accounts but in accounts that have got into a muddle—the debit entry "To sundries, £9,022 1s. 7d." cancels the credit entry of £13,143 14s. 5d. to the extent of £9,022 1s. 7d., the amount of all the depositors existing on March 31st, 1891, except Bedford—up to March 31st, 1900, the old depositors appeared as creditors of the company; after that date as vendors, but in March, 1891, the depositors are brought back as creditors, so that the state of the books is brought back to where they existed in 1898 and 1899, allowing for the payments off—in May 18th, 1900, when a bill of exchange for £5,000 was given by the company to Lamont, he was indebted to the company for drawings for two years and a quarter, so that there was no reason why the company should give him a bill—I find no consideration for that bill except the Norwich Union matter—£5,009 12s. 6d. is the net effect of the credit and the debit—it is money received from the Norwich Union—the flotation account on May 19th, 1900, is credited by cash £5,500, and the company is debited in the receipt of £5,009 12s. 6d., and the vendors are debited with £4,909 12s. 6d.—the company has assumed responsibility or given credit for the whole £10,000—

The smallness of the sum of £344 debited to the vendors excited my suspicion, and I examined the books carefully, and on Saturday afternoon I looked through the books again and find, in addition, entries to J. T. Bedford of £100, £62 10s., £239 3s. 4d., and £9 3s. 7d., and E. Bedford £2 11s. 6d., and £1 5s., with contra entries in an account called "Interest L.S. &amp; B.," but I have not found that any of those are interest on deposits, except the £62 10s. and the £229 3s. 4d., in that period between January, 1899, and March, 1900—I have not stated that fact before now because I forgot it, and all along I have said that no interest was charged to vendors for 1898, and that is what I tried to find out on Saturday—the £344 refers to the same period as the two excepted items—in consultation with counsel on Saturday afternoon I said I was sorry I had made that mistake about the interest and we passed on—I said the whole of the interest for 1899 and 1900 had been debited to the vendors, when I thought £344 was the whole—those debits show the vendors were liable—in 1898 the company took those liabilities over for good or evil with the books of the firm—the amounts carried on are not opening entries, they are as the account stands at the end of the year, and the account is not carried out as an adjustment; the debit balance has been brought into the book debts as an asset, which cannot be right, because it is not £15,700 due on January, 1898, but an amount due in March, 1899 or 1900, including Fisher—if you exclude Fisher, the deposits on January 1st, 1898, were, roughly, £9,000—since 1898 some of the principal has been paid off—that £15,700 would be the amount, less what was paid off and plus what was received—it ought to have been credited to an adjustment account—instead of that I find a smaller sum credited to the vendors—a considerable amount was paid of Fisher's debt, but we may credit him with the £10,000 as the amount due on January 1st, 1898—the sums are to be treated as concerning the vendors and not as concerning the company—that applies to the further payments off of deposits to March, 1900—the interest to March, 1898,1899, and 1900, is debited to the vendors—I have traced it into the profit and Joss account—the payments of interest come in under the guarantee of £95,000 in the prospectus, with the qualification that I have traced into the profit and loss account of 1898, two items of £3,819 6s. 8d. and £7,896 and</p>

               <p>mother figure is substituted for £6,166 16s. 10d., which is a derided calcula<lb/>tion, so that I do not check that account—Lamont's bill was drawn for £1,008 in round figures—the company was liable to pay the vendors interest at 5 per cent, from January 1st, 1898, till the date of completion, which was the end of March, 1899—the amount credited to the vendors in their interest account is £3,437 10s.—that was due in March, 1899, under the agreement—Lamont was not entitled to anything, he already had credit in the Low, Sons &amp; Bedford account, the drawings were in March 1900—if you say Lamont was separately entitled to £800 for interest, then I suggest he was separately indebted in a further large sum, and that is a transferred sum—he was credited with interest; he could not be separated from his co-vendors; they were all entitled to interest to March, 1899, and in March, 1900, they had been credited with the full amount—Lamont drew £1,008 during the year, from March, 1899, to March, 1900—in 1900 he drew £794 9s. 6d.—I do not think he was individually entitled to £800 for inter<lb/>est, but the vendors as a body were entitled to credit as interest—there would have been a set-off of £200—the accounts were not to be adjusted till June, 1900—the confectionery was a wholesale business, but I do not know that special travellers were employed in working it up—in Ledger J I find entries for travellers, for expenses, of £134, £198, £174 15s. 9d., and £119 3s. 9d. for the six months, apparently—the travellers' salaries and factory wages come to £1,107 2s., but I have not worked out the proportion to travellers—I have said the losses were from purchases, salaries and rent—the commissions to travellers amount to £65 15s. 9d. for three months, and for the next three months £52 5s. 4d.; then there is £47 2s. 9d. and £104 12s. 4d., or for the year about £258:1 have not added shillings and pence—here is a special exception, "Less on Exhibition Account, £12 3s. 1d."—hat would not be a special establishment charge; some firms exhibit every year—the discount is not special; the amount is £149 odd, nearly £150—there is a transfer in "E. Loder" of a payment to Graetz of £433 12s. 2d.—I think Graetz was manager—there are charges for machinery which go to another account in 1897, and there are various items of expenditure for fixtures carried to another account; one is £39 3s. 8d., and there is transferred in that year £399 0s. 7d.—that is carried out as a trading account—it is not included in the trading account, but it is carried out—it does not go to swell the losses—a debt of £400 was incurred in December of 1897, but the removal occurred before that—there is a balance brought forward from the confectionery account every month, headed "General Purchases,—the account headed "Purchases" in the ledger is the total of the invoice—to ascertain establishment charges you have to analyse those figures; I have not had time to do that, and it is difficult to know where the material exists, but I think I am entitled to assume these are purchases for sale—I have not said that nothing could be charged as, establishment charges, but, taking the account as a whole, the items do not appear to be establish<lb/>ment charges—special expenses in working up the business are establish<lb/>ment charges—Mr. Muir put in a further list of bad debts to an amount of over £7,000—that included Ratcliffe Hoskins—I did not give Ratcliffe Hoskins as a bad debt before the Magistrate—I think the list put to me</p>

               <p>did not include that—it is included in the Bought Ledger balance—when you first crow-examined me the bad debts came out at £3 000—I do not think the debt of £726 3s. of Ratcliffe Hoskins was then known to be bad, or I did not appreciate the question—it was in the list of debts, including good and bad—I have been in the witness box four or five days, and it is difficult to recollect, I think the directors should have known if the debt was bad in March, 1899 and 1900, but the difficulty was they had shares in the limited company of Hoskins as against their debt—it depended upon whether the business was good or bad—I did not inquire whether the business was good or bad—I did not inquire whether the directors had dock warrants as security amounting to almost £1,000—they received a deposit of 21,000 shares in Ratcliffe Hoskins—I think they were credited with dividends on those shares in 1898, that is, they debited Ratcliffe Hoskins in an account—the dividend did not go against the old debt; it went into the current account of the limited company—the shares were held as security—they held them still in 1901—I do not think they were formally transferred, but they were in the hands of nominees, clerks, and so on—in 1901 the company deposited their 2,100 shares in Hoskins &amp; Co. with three different people for an advance: Vandyke of Amsterdam, Bruce &amp; Co., and Major Gardener; I do not know the amounts—with regard to Gardener it was only part of the security—Hoskins&amp; Co. are not in liquidation; the case is complicated; they had no money, and if Low, Sons &amp; Bedford failed, their business stopped—I am speaking of before the voluntary liquidation of Low, Sons &amp; Bedford—Hoskins &amp; Co. were solvent as long as Low, Sons &amp; Bedford were solvent—I do not think I put Hoskins &amp; Co. among the bad debts—the debt has turned out to be bad—Lamont's loan from the Norwich Union was £10,000 on the security of the directors as directors and that of Walter Low; the company were not liable—as it was paid by a cheque for £5,900, the entry is £1,000, less debit against directors £409, but that is a different date to the credit—the debit is on the 19th and the other on the 31st—the £9,500 odd were paid in to the credit of the company's account at the bank absolutely—the company have never repaid it, and they were under no liability to repay the Norwich Union—£4,500 of that is dealt with by wiping out from the Captain Cutler's Syndicate £4,500—the entries are in proper order to effect that purpose—the balance is the same, but they are journal entries—the bill for £5,500 is subsequent—besides the bill the company give consideration; they knock off £5,000 of the indebtedness of the vendors to them—Hodgkinson was the solicitor who advised the company's directors, and Walter Low had the bill of costs; Hodgkinson was one of the Middlesex Coroners—he is dead—that bill of costs includes these items as to the Norwich Union, on June 19th, 1900: "Attending Mr. W. Low, conferring and advising as to whether he could in the event of the company at any time going into liquidation claim as a credi<lb/>tor, and explaining that in my opinion he could not, as the transaction was not with the company, but with Mr. Lamont, who had advanced to the company, and suggesting that Mr. Lamont should draw on the company and endorse the bill to Mr. W.

               <p>preliminary expenses are generally charged to capital—they are written off in the course of years—it is not the custom to write all off in one year's profit, but to write off so much a year for a series of years—as to the amounts bracketed it appears to me that those deposit accounts were to be carried to the capital account of the vendors, and were, therefore, not taken over by the company—looking at Exhibit 34, the pencil balance sheet, I see "Deposit accounts to be paid off by the partners as provided for in the agreement of sale"—that £13,421 12s. is the same figure as the total of those bracketed—so that in the list of creditors making out the £13,421 12s. I have written the words in blue pencil, "Capital and Deposit Account/, which would indicate to me that it was going to be taken over by the vendors, and in the deposit account I see in Bedford's writing, "To be paid off by the vendors, and provided for in the agreement of sale"—that would be thoroughly consistent with my blue pencil note, "Capital and Deposit Account"—the draft balance for December, 1897, is clearly in Shead's writing—to the best of my recollection I had not seen that in 1899—I have never seen anything fraudulent or improper in the prospectus from first to last—there would be a list of debtors drawn up, as the memorandum is, "Debtors as per list"—that figure is £41,000 odd—I remember an allowance being made of £5,500 odd out of that £41,000 odd—the first entry, "Sundry Debtors, £36,986 18s. 11d.," is my writing—that was arrived at by me—it is my writing, and it was prepared by me—in the purchase price as per registered contract, dated 18th March, I find the heading, "Sundry Debtors, £36,986 18s. 11d.,—that figure is arrived at from the list showing the total debts at £42,000, or thereabouts, and deducting the £5,500 odd—as far as I remember, that figure was arrived at as stated in the prospectus, the figure being guaranteed at a certain sum—I mean the £41,000 odd was in the list of debtors to the firm on 31st December, 1897—in my document (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 95) that figure appears as £36,986—the £5,500 for possible bad debts is the difference between the two—it was reduced, but under what circumstances I do not remember—I understood the directors had guaranteed the reduced amount—the balance sheet (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 34) corroborated my view that the vendors were to take over that liability to the depositors—the £800 reserved for possible bad debts would refer to that year 1900, because the directors guaranteed the other—I have no doubt about that—I do not think it was for the fifteen months.</p>

[<hi rend="italic">The jury complained of someone making signs to the witness.</hi>]—I have not seen any gentleman, and do not know of any gentle<lb/>man making signs to me in Court—I queried certain items as I went through the books—that is the ordinary duty of a person who is going through books, to find out if the figures are correct—the object of making the queries was to draw the attention of my principal to them—I do not remember discussing them with Shead after<lb/>wards, or with anyone—I did not decide them—I do not remember what queries I put in—I was an accountant and working auditor, and my duties were three of laving information before the person who was the auditor, for him to deal with—I was not responsible; I merely laid the facts before Shead, as was my duty—among other items, I remember that of Captain Cutler—I did not know that in 1896 there was a loss on the confectionery business of £806, or in 1897 of upward of £3,000—supposing those were preliminary expenses, a proportion of three should be written off each year—that is the general practice—I understood the question as to my discre<lb/>tion was a general question as to my several duties; I do not think Shead bad seen the figures until I brought them to him for his signature—my information was obtained primarily from the books, therefore I assumed the books were right; if it was not in the books I could not bring it in—I was not aware from the books of a bill given by the company, accepted by the company, in favour of Lamont, of between £4,000 and £5,000; I have heard of the transaction, but that was of later date than the audit—it does not appear—the sale to Captain Cutler's Syndicate does, appear—as far as I recollect, that was returned as a book debt due to the company; he had not paid that—I began after March or some time in April, and carried on the work up to the time the accounts went to the printer.</p>

Why don't you give it back to me now?"—I gave him the two pieces back—he went out—he had given me another 2s. piece, a good one—about 9.55 the same evening I was asked to go to the police station to identify the prisoner—I saw a number of men—I picked him out.</p>

                  </hi>. I now live at 158, Merton Road, Wands worth—in 1898 I entered the prisoner's employ as clerk—I had had experience as a solicitor's clerk—I have been in three solicitors' offices and the P. &amp; O. Company's office—the prisoner's office was then at 4, Church Row, Wands<lb/>worth—I was the only clerk—I got 30s. a week wages—it was his practice to attend at the office from Monday to Friday or Saturday, and then go to Brighton from Saturday to Monday—I remained in his employment until the end of June, 1903—I made up my mind one evening to leave, and I went own to tell him so—there were several unpleasant matters; some money had been received and not handed over—I told him I was going to leave, he made no charge or accusation against me—I told him why I was going—when I first went there there were no books kept except the usual diary of a solicitor—there were no ledgers or cash books or account books—there was a letter book, but it was not used much after I left—letters were copied on loose sheets of copying paper—the business was principally local—the prisoner practised in the County Court, and occasionally there was High Court business, but that was sent up to the London agents—the prisoner gave his personal attention to the business—in January, 1901, I remember his being appointed to art for the Assessment Committee—that was the first quinquennial period while I was there—the revision took place in 1900, and the appeal work, if any, comes on, I think, in January, 1901—when the prisoner was appointed to act for the Assessment Committee in some of their cases he was very pleased and said it would be a good thing, that it might be the last quinquennial he would have, and he was going to make the best of it; that all connected with it were all old friends of his, and he could do what</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190501090117"/>
               <p>he liked with the Guardians, and that if any of the Guardians or the Assess<lb/>ment Committee winked it would be 6s. 8d. or 13s. 4d—there were fourteen Battersea cases in which he acted for the respondents, the Assessment Committee, and eleven others—the fourteen cases were cases in which the Battersea Borough Council were the appellants, the respondents being the prisoner's clients—there were thirteen public houses and one theatre—he acted for the appellants in the cases of the Wandsworth Gas Company—in the fourteen cases the first thing done was to give notice of intention to defend, and after that to obtain the copies of the appellants' cases—Mr. Boyle, K.C., and Mr. Henderson were retained—Mr. Henderson I knew as super-intending registrar of births, deaths, and marriages—he had his office and residence in Wandsworth—I made out the retainers—they consisted of the usual half sheet of foolscap with the name of the case, the name of the counsel and the fee, £1 1s., which amounted to £1 3s. 6d. 2s. 6d. being added for a clerk—there were twenty-eight in all—the prisoner delivered the retainers to counsel—I did not have anything to do with the retainers—in course of time instructions were given to prepare the respondents' cases—Mr. Henderson had them all—the respondents, cases were prepared and printed-the prisoner went to Mr. Hunnard in Tanfield Court, Temple, and saw to them—some surveyors were appointed: Mr. Flowery, and afterwards Mr. Morgan and others—later on something was said about a view and the prisoner said he would engage a trap, and they would all go together and inspect the thirteen public-houses—a private omnibus came, and the surveyors came to the prisoner's office, and they started from there—it was all done in about four hours—a little later on something was said about the cases being in the list—I believe the prisoner went up once to look at the list—he told me he was going to—the lists were at the Quarter Sessions—he said he must see about instructing counsel and that he had not any time for the briefs, and told me to make twenty-eight back sheets; fourteen for Mr. Henderson and fourteen for Mr. Boyle—they would have on them the name of the case, Wandsworth and Battersea Borough Council against the Assessment Committee, the name of the Sessions, the number of the case and the fee, the name of the counsel, under the name of Mr. Boyle, "with you, Mr. Henderson," and the name of the solicitor—in one or two of the briefs the appellants' and the respondents' cases were copied on sheets of brief paper, which were attached to the front of the back sheet, and formed the whole of the written portion of the brief—in the cases where I did not copy the appellants and the respondents cases the outside wrapper enclosed the printed notices of appeal, the printed cases and some shorthand notes which had been taken sometime before—they were borrowed from one of the reporters, I believe—in the two cases in which the appellants, and respondents' cases were copied, the prints of the same cases accompanied them—I delivered the brief to Mr. Boyle, and the prisoner took the other to Mr. Henderson—in none of the fourteen cases were there then any observations drawn in the usual way—there were some back sheets en<lb/>dorsed, "Instructions to advise on evidence," and the name and number and fee, £2 2s.—the prisoner said he should lay them before Mr. Henderson—there were no proofs in these briefs—I prepared fourteen "cases to advise,"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190501090118"/>
               <p>with Mr. Henderson's name on them, with the fee, £2 2s.—there were no observations in the papers setting out what the points are or which advice was wanted, simply the back sheets endorsed in that way—I gave them to the prisoner—I did not see them again—they disappeared in a most mysterious way, except one, which I found amongst some papers on the prisoner's table—on February 28th these cases came into the list, the prisoner and myself went up to the Sessions—I cannot say positively if we met both our counsel there—I do not think Mr. Henderson was there, only Mr. Boyle—there was a hurried conversation for about ten minutes, but I did not hear much about it—the surveyors attended it, and Mr. Boyle and the prisoner—the four surveyors were each written to—the appeals were adjourned till March 12th—I should think that, allowing a margin, one and a half hours would cover the time we were at the Sessions on February 28th—in the interval an arrangement was come to between the parties—no further instructions or figures had been sent to either counsel—on March 12th all the appeals were dismissed by consent—I was not present on that day—they had agreed to figures on my first attendance at the Sessions—I saw the prisoner with two half-crowns in his hand, and I judged they were for the policeman—I did not see him give any money to anyone—very shortly after March 12th the prisoner said to me, "Now, Mandy, we must drag out these briefs; Sally Brass wants £20 out of it"—he called his wife "Sally Brass"—she used to assist in the office work, but not for some years—recently she did some copying; she writes a very good hand—she had been formerly his clerk, and that is why he called her "Sally Brass"—he said, "Sally Brass want £20 out of it, and I want bills which must come to £150 or £160, in fact they must come to it; I want £150 or £160 out of the bills"—he went into his room, brought back a law report, and called my attention to a case as to tied public-houses, which had gone to the Court of Appeal—he said he wanted it copied, leaving out the judge's name, because he wanted the observations to appear as if he had drawn them—it was a very long case—I forget the name—I was to copy the notice of appeal, the appellants and respondent's cases, and several other things—he gave me the surveyor's reports, and said, "Copy them into the body"—I prepared a copy of the reported case, and he took it to Brighton—the judge had begun "I am of opinion that," but I copied it as, "It is apprehended that the law on this subject is as follows," and then I copied the case—twenty-eight copies of it were made—the prisoner made some slight altera<lb/>tions—he took it to Brighton to have the copies made—he brought them back to the office—he gave them tome as Mrs. Jones finished them—they were all in her writing; each was 68 folios—I did some of the additional copying, and a brother-in-law of mine did some—the fourteen copies came to 2,117 folios—on the average each proof was about 150 folios—the back sheets were obtained from counsel, as the bills of costs were being taxed and fees paid, and then the parts copied by Mrs. Jones and myself were put inside the back sheets got from course, who signed the lists of fees and the briefs as well—for the first copy I made of the lists of fees there was a charge entered to Mr. Henderson for advising on evidence, and the prisoner struck it out—the next thing to be done was to make up bills of costs—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190501090119"/>
               <p>the prisoner told me to look at the Battersea case, No. 1419, and to make a rough draft—I took the papers and put them in order—he gave me a book con<lb/>taining a precedent, Beal's "Practice of Assessment, "an old copy, and said, "You will start there and work it all in"—I made a rough draft, and copied it up to the item "Previous to attending Court with minutes"—the prisoner came into the office next morning, and said, "How are you getting on with the costs? what do they amount to?"—I laid, "I cannot tell yet; there are some items which you must settle, and I do not know the length of the briefs"—he said, "Even with the proof it does not come to 150 folios, but I am going to have a heap of attendance; I will see to that," and he took it away—I had not finished copying from the precedent book, and next day he brought it in and said, "You have not finished it; copy it all to the end"—I did not copy it then, but I put in the margin of the bill "Copy page so and so, Beal"—he did not have the skeleton draft, because we went through the skeleton and a fair copy, and he dictated the items to me in the fair copy—he dictated the items from the book—I do not think I quite finished the skeleton draft—when he said, "Put all the items in, "I said, "Don't you dunk, old fellow, we are skating over thin ice"—he said he had friends in Court who would help him, and that nothing had been looked at—the payments to the police was one of the items queried—he told me 7s. 6d. was to go down—it was put in and he increased it to 10s.; it was for the hire of the consultation room at the Court—I queried the coach hire item—I said, "How about' this coach hire"—I did not know what had been paid then—he said, "Well, I will see"—he took his pen from his book and made a calcu<lb/>lation, and said, "17s."—I think that item he put in the skeleton bill himself—when we went through the draft bill with the skeleton I had made, we checked the items, and when we came to the "Advice on evidence," which had been crossed through by him in the skeleton draft, he said, "I had a good deal of trouble in this case, the Francis case, and I am going to charge this "—he was sitting at the side table—he said, "Put them in" and he dictated, "Instructions to advise on evidence, £2 4s. 6d.," and I inserted it as counsel's fee, and 6s. 8d. for perusing it—it was altered in green ink—when I made the copies of the draft bill, everything was repeated as in the first bill—I made thirteen fair copies—no one attended to the taxing of the fourteen Battersea appeal cases, the prisoner took the papers up for the purpose of lodging them at the office of the Clerk of the Peace—the only paper which did not go was the advice on evidence, because I could not find it—I never had anything to do with that taxing except with the first case, which was not a Battersea case—the first of the fourteen cases was in June, 1901—I think they went up to August or September, 1902—they were taken up two or three at a time in case Sir Richard Wyatt looked at the briefs—these observations, being part of the briefs, were charged thirteen times for—the official at Sir Richard Wyatt's office who looked after the taxing matters was a Mr. Smith—that is who the prisoner meant by saying a friend in Court who would not look at anything and pass the lot—on two or three occasions I spoke to him about it, and more than once he said, "What the devil are you worrying about? everything will be passed; it does not matte what is sent up"—once there were three very large bills, amounting to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190501090120"/>
               <p>about £600, to be taxed—the Derby was close handy, and the prisoner came in one morning waving some papers and said, "I am going to ask Smith to go to the races, and Bill Morgan, and we can have a good day of it, and I think it is a great stroke of diplomacy, what do you think?" I said I did not know anything about it—he said, "Pitch in these three heavy bills"—they went in soon after the Derby—I did not see Smith with the prisoner in the trap, which started, I believe, from the Eagle, but the prisoner told me next day he had been with him, and they had enjoyed themselves—there were three bills—the railway bill and Thorne's Brewery bill were copies of each other—they went in and were taxed—I had a friend or connection, a Mr. Ladd—I employed him to assist me to copy some of the briefs in the Gas Company's cases and the Battersea appeals—the prisoner said some<lb/>thing about getting Ladd to go to the Shakespeare Theatre, to find out the number of people there—I was to go with him—the prisoner brought a half sheet of draft with some items: "Attending the surveyor, who thought his work should be checked; attending Mr. Henderson, who agreed with him"—neither Ladd nor I ever went to the theatre for that purpose—we made no report to the prisoner—we did not go, because everything was over except the costs—I first heard of something being said about going to the theatre after the appeals were settled—when the prisoner and I got to the item in the costs for Ladd's payment, the prisoner said, "Oh, just write me out a receipt for Ladd's money"—I thought for a moment—I was rather misled, but I did it, although it was a stupid thing to do—I said, "Are you going to pay Ladd?"—he said, "Yes"—I signed it, "E. Ladd, per H.C. M."—I said, "What are you going to pay Ladd?"—I gave him the receipt—some few weeks afterwards I said, "What about that receipt for Ladd," because I had thought it over, and I wanted to see what had become of it—he said, "Never mind about that; don't you trouble about it"—I asked him a second time—I made up my mind the receipt should not go to the taxing master, and it did not go—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—it is entirely in my writing, "To charge to attending at Shakespeare Theatre counting house, &amp;c., March 12th; attending at Sessions House, Clerkenwell, as agreed, £3 3s. Ladd, November 20th, 1901, £1 3s., pp. H. C. M."—I suppose I was receiving it for Ladd—I could not make out what the prisoner wanted it for, and I cannot now—from the time I wrote it till I was at the Police Court I never saw it—it was produced there by the prisoner—I remained in the prisoner's employ till June or July, 1903—when I left I went to St. Joseph's Home at Hove—while I was there I wrote certain letters to the Town Clerks of Wands worth and Battersea, and to the Local Government Board—I did not then know of Messrs. Ward—those letters were dis<lb/>closures of the matters I have been telling you of—I also wrote some letters to the prisoner in the summer of 1903—in March, 1904, I recollect an inquiry before Mr. Burd—I attended and gave evidence on oath—he is the inspector to the Local Government Board—Ladd was also present and gave evidence—I have since lost sight of him—I have made every effort to find him, but have been unable to do so—the prisoner was not present at that inquiry.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I cannot fix the exact date when I left the prisoner's employ—I think it was the end of June, 1903—I had a complaint against him then I was dissatisfied altogether with him, and had been for about six months from the time I went into his office, which was in October or November, 1898—I had been dissatisfied since the spring of 1899—I did not take any steps to manifest my dissatisfaction; I could not, I was tied by the leg—I think I am the prisoner's second cousin—I have been ac<lb/>quainted with him since about 1853 or 1854—I do not know if he has been a solicitor during the whole of that time, or that for thirty-eight years he has been practising as a solicitor at Wandsworth; he has for some years, but I cannot say the number—I know that for a number of years she was the most prominent solicitor at the County Court—I believe he had eighteen or twenty cases a day frequently—he sometimes acted as deputy registrar; I think on two occasions while I was his clerk—very often for the whole of the working day he was absent from the office, and sometimes for two or three days together, or a week—I was then left in charge of the papers and books and was the person who saw anybody who called—I believe he was very well known in Wandsworth for many years—I do not know if he had a great many friends and a great many enemies—I am not aware that there was any rivalry between him and any other firm on solicitors—I am not aware that he was associated with any other Board or municipal body—when I began to be dissatisfied I tried to find another situation, and if I could have done so I should have walked out of his office without a word—he called me "Old Fellow" up to the end and praised me—I did not take any papers away from the office when I began to feel dissatisfied—I never tore a few leaves out of a book—the steps I took to prevent Ladd's receipt from going before the taxing master, were only searching for it among some other receipts—Ladd is my brother-in-law—I asked him if he would like to do some copying—I am seventy-three years old—the prisoner asked me Ladd's name—I mentioned the name, because some time previously I tried to obtain a situation for him in the Gas Company, and I asked the prisoner if he could aid me—I did not tell him I had paid Ladd the £3 3s.—I could not pay a man who had never been engaged—I last met Ladd about a couple of months ago at Victoria Station by accident—that was after he had given evidence on one of these inquiries—we wanted him, and I went round to all the Rowton houses and different places—this receipt was concocted at the time the prisoner sent in the bill for the theatre appeal—it must have been shortly after the figures were settled for the assessment—there was no occasion for me to keep any memoranda or diary—if the receipt stamp has November 20th, 1901, that, I suppose, would be the date it actually came into existence—the whole of that document is a forgery as regards the money paid to Ladd, and it was made expressly to back up the prisoner's attendances, which were brought to me to put into the draft bill—I did not do it to assist him to defraud other people—he asked me for it and I gave it to him, knowing it was no use to him—of course it was a lie—it was simply to back up his mythical charges, which he had got on half sheets of paper—I gave him the receipt after I had been dissatisfied with him for over two years—I knew it was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190501090122"/>
               <p>useless and I could not make out what he wanted it for—I was not made a tool of in any way, because I told him over and over again he was skating over thin ice—I had had considerable experience when I went to him in the drawing of costs—I did the principal part in making out the costs, but he settled everything—I would not take any responsibility—it is not an invention on my part that he told me to write out the ex<lb/>tracts from the law book—it was not my own idea to take the observa<lb/>tions from the book—taking the prisoner all round, he was rather irritable and bombastical—I left simply because he did not carry out his promise to give me £2 a week after I had made myself acquainted with the County Court practice—before I went to him I met him in Chancery Lane—he asked me what I was doing—I said I was not satisfied, although I was making good money; it was night work—I had made £6 in a week, and sometimes £1 a day, and that if I was single handed I would take a situation at £1 a week, if it was in the country, as the doctor had said my daughter should go into the country—he said, "You are worth £2 a week"—I went to Wandsworth—he said, "I have a berth for you"—I said, "What is the screw?"—he said, "£1"—I said, "No"—he said, "25s."—I said, "No"—he said, "30s." and I said, "In two or three months, when I get into the County Court practice, I expect £2 a week—he said, "All right"—I do not think I earned £5 in the two years for copying, except for copying the briefs—in September, 1897, I wrote to him, saying I was trying to obtain a situation in a solicitor's office, and could assist in the common law and could make out costs—that was at that time one of my special abilities, because I had had so much practice—the skill in making out costs is to make them out fairly—that is not what I did in these cases, because the prisoner dictated them and altered them as the skeleton bill was going on—the morning I left him I said, "I will try and have this Treasury money cleared up, and if you get into trouble about it you will say it is my fault"—the Treasury money he had misappropriated four years before—I gave the prisoner an hour to pay the money into Court—a woman was sued by a bailiff for assault; she was fined £5 and costs by the judge—the prisoner, to get his money, said to me—"You will see the woman and tell her if she will pay the costs I will give her time to pay the money"—I told the woman and she was pleased about it—the prisoner said, "Don't pay it into Court"—she was to pay so much a month—I gave the money to the prisoner—I gave the woman a receipt for the £1 she paid me—the prisoner was acting as solicitor for the high bailiff—he sent a bill to the high bailiff for £4 and said he was going to stick to the money—I knew something dishonest was going on in the office before 1899; that is the reason I wanted to leave—I wrote letters to the different bodies to get the whole matter ventilated—I had to get the two councils together, the Wandsworth and Battersea Councils—they were at loggerheads—I wanted them to do something—I never thought of blackmail when I wrote the letters—I wrote to Alexander Pope, Esq., on July 23rd, 1903—this is a passage from the letter: "I then sent a copy of the letter to the Guardians, and tell him that if they give me £500 I will show them how the taxation can be reopened on</p>

               <p>good grounds, for a certainty, and I think I can get that undertaking to pay me this if I knock off £1,000 from the £4,000, and more, sent in to the Guardians"—I thought any sensible person would give me £500 if I got them £1,000 and did not want the money until they got the money themselves—I went to Hove and then came to London for the Local Government Board—since the beginning of these proceedings I have been paid something by the accountant at Battersea—I forget his name—I have not been in the regular employ of the Borough Council—I have been paid £1 a week since just before the information was laid, about September, 1904—I was without money—I have been copying for one Borough and making inquiries for the other—I have been about all over London—I was nearly a week looking for Ladd—they did not ask for any references as to my character before they took me into their em<lb/>ployment—I wrote this letter with the memorandum, "An old and tried friend of mine is coming to see me on Monday next and will return to London and see that a letter (below) is delivered in the proper quarter." [<hi rend="italic">This was written by the witness and stated that the prisoner had, he believed, for some years returned his income at</hi> £300, <hi rend="italic">but that he received</hi> £682 <hi rend="italic">from various people, and from the Assessment Committee over</hi> £2,000 <hi rend="italic">in</hi> 1892, <hi rend="italic">giving the different items paid.</hi>]—he only kept his diaries to act as cost book and ledger—I swear that before I left the office I did not tear a lot of leaves out of an old cost book—there was an old ledger prepared by me for my own guidance, because if I had to make out a cash account I had to wade through perhaps ten years, and it took a long time—I could refer and tell the prisoner how he stood—I told him the sums he received for the Treasury business—the items in the letter were given purely from my memory—I know that besides the quinquennial assessment the prisoner had in the previous assessment acted for the same committee—I do not know if I wrote that letter from Hove or where—the home at Hove was a Catholic home for aged people—at the Police Court I said how I got possession of the figures—the prisoner first of all sent in a list of the cases with the amounts charged by the surveyors and for the particulars, giving credit as £250 which he had paid—that was sent to Mr. Piper, and one evening just as I was leaving he asked me to make two copies of this particular account—it was just 4 o'clock—I said, "I am going to tea; won't it do to-morrow?"—he said, "No"—I said, "I will take it home and copy it"—I took it home and made two copies, left this draft behind me and rushed down the town and gave it to him—I went back and found I had left the draft behind me—I put it in a precedent book and put it on the cupboard, and did not think any more about it—the day after, I think it was a Saturday, I discovered this, and I got a piece of string and tied that book and two others together and put the draft on the top—I thought to myself, "This may be useful, I will make a copy of the document"—I took the original draft back, but I kept a copy, and that is how I got possession of the sums and the appeals—the day I took it down must have been the day after I left his service—it was about September, 1902, that I took the list home in the precedent book—it was about the time of the second statement of account—I had three precedent</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190501090124"/>
               <p>books—they went to and fro between the office and my home—one was Prideaux—if the prisoner wanted to make a long draft where he was going to charge by folios, I took the old book home—I did most of the appeal work at home—I must have had the precedent book in my possession for two or three months—I took a copy of the lists for my own purposes because I told the prisoner I should expose the whole affair, particularly if he did not settle up about the Treasury—I would not chance it being thrown on me—I also said in that letter, "Sir George Wyatt, Newington Sessions, taxed the bills under the following circumstances; this I omit here. Jones also receives a large sum through his London agent, Mr. Alexander Pope, solicitor, 1, Devereux Court. Pope sends account yearly to Jones. Now you caused my wife to be in ill-health through not offering me more money weekly; you have broken up my home all through your damned meanness"—that is true—I wrote that from a religious home, why not?—I wrote that to compel him to refund the money he robbed the parishioners of—his letters are suppressed, and these produce—I tried all I possibly could to induce him to go to the Guardians—"I have written Mr. Henderson as he will perhaps lose his billet"—he was a barrister employed in the appeals—I thought he took the fees in four cases, but I found out afterwards he did not—the letter means that he had been doing something very wrong, and that is what I thought—I thought he had received £22 4s. 6d. for advising on evidence when I knew advice had never been given—all four bills are copies of each other—I took the briefs to the leader, Sir Edward Boyle—I think they were marked twenty guineas each—I say they were excessive fees—there was nothing in them except the back sheets—I do not say Sir Edward Boyle did anything wrong, because a barrister would be a fool if he did not take the fee—Mr. Henderson was paid fees in some cases, and fees were charged which he did not get—Sir Edward Boyle was paid the twenty guineas on each of the briefs—he is a specialist in rating; that is the reason it was given to him—the settlement was all done in about ten minutes—if the cases had been fought Sir Edward Boyle would have had to fight them—I did not put the 17s. and the £2 6s. 6d. for 'bus hire in the bill; I left it blank; and if the skeleton draft could be produced it would be seen that the prisoner put the 17s. in in his own writing—there were fourteen bills—I believe £2 12s. 6d. was paid, which is about 4s. apiece, but really 17s. apiece was charged—it was not my constant practice to make a profit for the prisoner—I was not at that time intending to have something to hold over the prisoner until this unfortunate Treasury business cropped up, and then I decided to expose him in every way, and if he had put me free from suspicion I very likely should not have taken the steps I have; but he laughed at me—the only wonder is that I did not give him a most un<lb/>merciful hiding—when one has been on the diggings in Australia for twenty-five years one does not stand any nonsense—I found my wife was suffering in health, and I would not stand what he was doing—if I left there was a chance of his being found out by the auditors who came from the County Court, and then the receipts would have been produced</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190501090125"/>
               <p>against me—he would have kept the diaries back, the same as he does now and is ashamed to produce them, because it verifies every word I have said—in my letter I said, "I shall have an affidavit by another person, and prove to the hilt that the briefs were got up after cases settled," and so they were. Ladd has made a declaration, which is before the Local Government Board, and there was not a single folio copied until after March 12th, when everything was settled—Ladd made a declara<lb/>tion at the request of the Local Government Board, "I shall ask the Committee to guarantee me £500 if I knock off a certain amount, and then my friend will be in touch with Paul Caudwell"—he is solicitor to the Borough Council—"my friend" is the prisoner, I suppose—on July 23rd, 1903, I wrote to Mr. Pope, "I have received a letter from a friend at Wandsworth, and hear that Jones has been referring to the past, and stating what he could do. The letter contains facts, and only Jones knew the circumstances. I intended to leave him alone; in fact, I helped him. You could not advance the money for him, so I borrowed it, and got the dates of the receipts"—that refers to the dates of the receipts that Mrs. whatever her name is, paid in—she paid £1, £1, etc.—I told the prisoner I had got the dates, and gave him an hour to pay them in—I do not know if it was the morning that I regretted I had not given him a hiding—I went down the night before to do it—it was a wet night—I could not find him, or I would have mopped the streets with him—I had had three glasses of whiskey hot to make me do it—I went down to tell him I would not stop with him any longer—of course I left on my own accord—why did he ask me to come back?—it is not a fact that I went to the office suffering from the effects of drink—three whiskies and water at the public house do not make you suffer, except want to recover—I was speaking in a loud voice—I got the receipts from the rough ledger about the Treasury matter—the morning I left, before he came to the office, I made a rough copy from the rough ledger of the sums and the dates this woman had paid—"I stated I should be away from Wandsworth. I offered Jones to put two bills of costs right, but he put it off until the Wednesday, the day I left, and I could not do them; his usual style. I shall hope to be in London in about three weeks and teach Jones such a lesson he never had before. As I told you, he caused my wife to go without food, that I and the little one could be well provided for. I found it out the night before I walked out of his office"—that was the night I had three glasses of whiskey—"Some time ago I earned money after 4 o'clock, but had to discontinue doing so for several reasons. When I reach London I shall hand Henderson, late clerk to the Wandsworth Guardians, and who held the back sheets of the appeal cases, a letter, asking him (1) To repay the Guardians the money he had for consultation in all the cases, (2) The fee marked on the briefs in small cases which were settled before he got his briefs, (3) The fees marked on the back sheets, as he did not attend at all, (4) The fees charged by Jones for advice on evidence. Henderson did not advise on any case"—only one of those charges is wrong, the small cases were not paid, but the other charges I thought he and the prisoner would</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190501090126"/>
               <p>come to an understanding about, because he did not attend Court at al—I thought then that there were three charges in respect of which Mr. Henderson ought to be made to pay back, but I have con<lb/>sidered it since and I withdraw them because the Guardians expressly wished Mr. Henderson retained—"I then send a copy of the letter to the Guardians, and tell him that if they give me £500 I will show them how the taxation can be re-opened, on good grounds, for a certainty, and I think I can get that undertaking to pay me this if I knock off £1,000 from the £4,000, and more, sent in to the Guardians. All the drawing and copying items come off; Mr. Jones made over twenty copies of what I copied from a case in the "Law Times," so it is clear the railway case was copied from "Hodges on Railways," so drawing, etc., comes off. Back sheets only were given to counsel and briefs completed afterwards; there are many other items which speak for themselves, which I shall embody in an affidavit and the order for taxation must go. Jones is under the impres<lb/>sion the bills can't be taxed. As he has been the means of breaking up my home, the money I have received I have devoted for my little one to receive a good education, and she will be provided for. I intend to punish him. I shall interview the Income Tax Commissioners"—I told him I should see the Income Tax Commissioners, because he returned his income at £300 when he made £2,000—he allowed himself to be summoned each time—he said, "It is worth while to pay 1s. for the summons, because it looks like poverty"—"He has returned his income at £300 yearly. He received £500 from the Gas Company's appeal and £4,000 from the Guardians. Five years ago he received a large sum for appeals. His diary gives yearly balance sheets, and other demands will place him in an unenviable position with the authorities. There are several other matters to ventilate, but the foregoing are enough to go on with. I worked hard for him, but he did not recompense me. Had it not been for me he would have lost money on several occasions. I was told by tradesmen in Wandsworth that he was the meanest man going, and I found it so. As Jones may not have given you the letter I left at his office, I give the dates of the receipts: 1899, October 23rd, £1; November 20th, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; November 27th, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; December 15th, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; 1900, January 22nd, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; February 5th, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; March 17th, 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; July 31st, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; October 4th, 5s."—that is Treasury money—it was his duty to pay it into Court—"The Gas Company could get an order to retax; at all events if the nature of the items is laid before them there will be a bother. There was not a single folio drawn. A report of a surveyor twisted and turned, which I could make the directors understand in five minutes. I would not do this but for his raking up the past, and by the living God I'll do it. Yours very truly, H. C. Mandy"—he made 6,000 folios at 1s. and there was not a folio drawn—I was not in a vindictive frame of mind when I wrote that, only that he laughed at me—"This place is reached by the train from Brighton to Hove, and is about ten minutes walk from the station. It is of no use Jones trying to see me, as I would not speak to him. With all his boast I could twist him round my finger"—I had a thorough contempt for the man for the way he conducted his business, and his desire for money—he did not care what he did as long as</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190501090127"/>
               <p>he got it, keeping clients' money back—I remember being in Mr. Pope's office a few days after I left the prisoner—I think I said then, "Jones, I have got him like this!" and so I had—I knew dishonest things had been going on—the prisoner kept £40 belonging to Mr. Hollingsworth—"But all the people call me a fool in Wandsworth for making him money and receiv<lb/>ing 30s. per week for it and a day or two for a holiday in five years"—he would not give me a holiday because he said he would have to mind the office—an old friend had come down to see me—I had got out as well as I could the total amount which had been wrongly charged, and I thought if Mr. Pope saw the items and saw how I made it up, he would persuade the prisoner to take a cheque to the Guardians—I knew the greatest punish<lb/>ment would be to put his hand in his pocket and pay money—I wrote this letter to Mr. Pope on July 29th, 1903, from St. Joseph's Home: "Dear Sir,—I have written Jones that a letter will be sent to the Income Tax Commissioners by me on Monday next, proving that Jones received over £4,000 in the year 1901. Five years before about that sum in one year, and also proving that he receives rent per year £50, £50, £50, £52, and £39, trades about £500 a year at least through his business; they can be proved up to the hilt"—when tenants pay rent they deduct income tax—I do not know why I piled it on—I did not mind so long as I got him to pay the money—that is what I am trying to make him do now—"Before sending the letter I think it would be wise on the part of Jones to ask you to see me here early on Monday. If you agree I will wait in as it is an out day here, and I will defer gathering shells by the sea-beach shore"—I used to go to the sea-beach shore—I wanted to see Mr. Pope so that he could understand about the items and try to get him to square up in some way—I was not still open to a little persuasion—I was not such a fool as to believe I should get anything—I wanted to prove to Mr. Pope that if the costs were re-taxed at least so much must come back—"Jones is skating over thin ice and seems callous. I know he is pig-headed, but I thought that when matters affected his pocket he would bob up serenely from his lethargy. That is rather a good expression"—I thought the only way to get at him was to do something to frighten him—I had written a letter to him at Rottingdean—I had received an anonymous letter, saying he was going to send his wife to get me out of the place—I had never seen Mrs. Jones, but I recognised her coming into the grounds from a photograph—I wrote a letter to the prisoner, giving him advice—I have not written a great many anonymous letters—I may have written a joking letter to a friend—"He has divided his profits with a non-profes<lb/>sional man"—that was a man named Coe—I think I have written to Coe—I was not a servant using the whole of my time getting that infor<lb/>mation to betray my master—this letter was written after I had left his office: "He has divided his profits with a non-professional man, and for some years allowed him to use his name. Keep the plant notes; take money out of the Court, and then Jones received half. Jones says he is legally entitled to do so, but I think the Law Society will take a different view—I have made no communication to the Law Society, except making out a short application to get him struck off the rolls—I told him I should</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190501090128"/>
               <p>give information to the Income Tax Commissioners—I told him all these things before I left the office—he said, "What can you do; you will have to starve if you leave my office?"—there is no step to punish him that I have not taken, and if there were 100 more I should take them—although I primed myself with whiskey to give him a thrashing. I never did it—I never had the chance—when I was in the office I had quieted down a bit, but if I had got him the night before—"I have written to Mr. Hen<lb/>derson, the late clerk to the Guardians"—I think I wrote to him from Brighton—I cannot tell how many times—"Now a barrister and registrar of marriages at Lavender Hill. Counsel stated he could not find his chambers. No wonder"—I was sorry for Mr. Henderson—"Henderson's billet is in jeopardy when the Assessment Committee find he did little and received much, particularly in the cases (4) which the appellant withdrew; after which Jones got up four briefs and Henderson received the fees. In short, Henderson received £15 on back sheets in twenty cases. I shall have an affidavit by a man who copied a large portion of each brief after the cases at Newington"—that was Ladd—"were settled, and I hold his receipts for money paid him"—I do not hold Ladd's receipts—I am just thinking what that means—I ought to know—I should not write a line at all—I can hardly tell you what is the meaning of that expression—Ladd got more money than anybody—I got very little apart from the Gas Company's briefs—I got receipts for money I paid Ladd, and then I took them to the office, and they were put into the assessment appeals, which were kept in one box and the Gas Company's in the other—I handed them to the prisoner—he entered them in his book and handed me a cheque—I gave him a receipt every week for the folios copied by me and Ladd—when I wrote that passage the prisoner must have had the re<lb/>ceipts—I did not have any receipts at all at Hove—I have not got them now—I have got the receipts that Ladd gave me—"There was only one attendance, but he has charged the same money in twenty cases; he has charged £1 for twenty orders, none drawn up; he has charged 'paid police 7s. 6d.' twenty times over; he has turned letters into attendant; advice on evidence, two, nine, six, twenty times. No advice in any case, etc., etc.—If you decide to come, write me and take a 1 1/2 d. ticket from Brighton to Hove and it is ten minutes' walk. The more I think of what I did for him the more surprised I am that he did not value my services at more than the paltry 30s. per week. But money is his god. I shall write to Messrs. Young &amp; Ward and the Assessment Committee, stating that if they guarantee me £500 I will let them have affidavits and the order for taxation must go. The bills will be reduced half, apart from Jones losing the next lot of appeals. Best wishes. Yours very truly, H. C. Mandy-Gardener at St. Joseph's House. Hallelujah"—I assisted in sweeping up some loose leaves, to kill time, and did a little bit of hoeing round the front garden—I was not successful—these letters were coining from a fool or a knave, whichever you like—I wrote them as farcical, stupid letters—all that nonsense about Hallelujah I thought would make him laugh—I also wrote some letters to Jones, to get him to settle up—"Memorandum for H. R. Jones"—I meant by that that the memorandum was to be</p>

I do not quite understand that—"and you have to thank the women"—that is it; she asked me not to go against him "whom your selfish nature caused to fall into a bad state of health by going without food to enable myself and child to obtain sufficient"—she (<hi rend="italic">the witness's wife</hi>) did not wish me to take proceedings—"I hope you have paid the money into Court which belonged to the Treasury. They are aware that you retained it wrongfully. The Commissioners of Income Tax know whit your income is from rents agency, and that you received £3,000 odd in one year from the assessment appeals, and returned your income it £300. The Wandsworth and Clapham Assessments Committee know that you have charged for money (fees) which you did not pay and that the briefs were prepared after the cases came on. Others are aware of it. This will doubtless touch your pocket, as it is your god. It will serve you right for interfering with my private affairs. I heard a deal of your boasting, and left you to your remedy and defied you." I was a Common Law clerk and certain events took place which he heard of and I heard he had been chatting about it in public houses—I spoke to him about it and said, "If you do that again you and I will have row"—he must hare done it again, because I got an anonymous letter, saying he had done it—"Take my advice, (1) Don't skate over thin ice, (2) Leave the religion of other people alone"—and to read Huxley—he called me a damned fool, and I told him to go to hell—I am a Roman Catholic—I was re<lb/>ceived into the Church about three years ago—I thought if Huxley was in hell they could discuss the book between them—"(3) Cease talking of 'Sally Brass,' people think little of a man who does not pay proper respect to his wife. Bear in mind you owe much to her in the past. Burn Huxley's works. Every man can go to hell his own way, but you are putting on extra steam to get there"—I thought it was very good advice—"Bear in mind you lie when you say I got drunk in your office—I admit to twice"—twice that he had had occasion to complain, but he had not—after I left Mr. Pope's office I met with an accident, in fact I am suffering from it now—I was told that I ought to lay up for varicose ulcers—I talked to a friend about it—he said, "You get an order to go into the workhouse and they will transfer you to the infirmary"—and they put me right as far as they could—then they put me into the office, and I had a very cosy time of it—I was fined 6d. by Mr. Plowden—I thought some rum and water hot would be good for me, but I found I made a mistake—I was taken to the station and was kept there till 12 o'clock, and then had to walk home—I got there about 5 a.m.—I met Mr. Plowden at the Marylebone Police Court—"The last time I did so purposely and you may thank your lucky stare I did not carry out what I intended to do. H.C. Mandy. I have omitted to say that I shall not make any affidavit to put before the Law Society. The whole affair of the excesses in your bills is now exposed, and I hope you will have to return what you will be made to do if you persist in going on in your own pig-headed style"—it is not a fact that shortly before I left the office I was in bed drunk o</p>

               <p>had been on the <hi rend="italic">spree</hi> for three days—I sent my wife down to the office—I did not ask the prisoner to let me go back—I did not go down on my knees and offer to kiss his feet—I should not have gone through such a legal pantomime—I sent my wife to the office, to tell the prisoner I was unwell, because I had not got home till 5 a.m.—I spoke in my letter of overcharges, but I regarded it as fraud and collusion between the prisoner and the clerk to the taxing master—Sir Richard Wyatt was humbugged by his clerk—the next letter is "7th March, 1904, memorandum for H. R. Jones: "As I find you followed up sending Mrs. Jones to St. Joseph's House to try and do me an injury by writing a letter to the Assessment Committee stating that I tried to get money out of you the same as I did them, I now give you notice that I withdraw that part of my memorandum sent to you at Rottingdean shortly after Mrs. Jones paid the visit (I recognised her from the photo I had seen at your office), which related to the Law Institution"—I had never seen Mrs. Jones at that time except in a photograph—"unless you write a full apology for the statement in the letter. The Court saw on Monday that you wrote the letter solely to throw the blame on me, and now your letter is not believed"—that was the Local Government Board Court—"You deserve all you got for your damnable meanness and fooling me, but I should have let you alone had you not written as you did to the Assessment Committee, of course thinking I should never see the letter. I know why I did not receive a reply from two Government offices in London"—I had written to the Treasury—"but I can write again and take care the letters reach the quarter I want them to. When the report of the Local Government officer is made if you have got any sense left you had better draw a cheque for an amount to be agreed upon, and get out of the trouble. I should think £1,000 would be enough; you will have to do it sooner or later. Now once more I warn you to Jet my name alone. I have been posted since July last as to all that has taken place since I left, and you cannot do a single thing in Wandsworth but what I know. This is no idle boast, as you will know sooner or later who my correspondents have been"—I think I wrote that when I was in the home at Brighton—"I will only add that you must be an infernal fool if you think you can do as you please with me. It is a bitter pill for you to swallow, but all brought about by your avarice, and letting others go to the wall so long as you could swim"—that is true—"A pretty beauty you are to talk of drunkenness; a nice figure you cut on the common on a moonlight night rolling about the furze bushes until picked up by a policeman and brought home at two in the morning (this occasion was when Young's solicitors managing clerk came to see you in West's action)"—the prisoner undertook to see a gentle<lb/>man home—I do not know how Young's name came there; it ought to have been Levoy—I do not know how long that was after I left the prisoner—"I made up my mind to have nothing more to do with you the night before I left, and, knowing your character so well, I took an extract from the rough ledger made of the monies you misappropriated belonging to the Treasury, so that you should not say by-and-bye that I received the money and not yourself, although they are entered in your diary—as to</p>

               <p>having a list of the costs I explained that to the Local Government Board"—the next letter is, "Memorandum; I made an appointment last night with Simmons to see you this morning, but I do not see the necessity for our meeting—please give Mr. Pope the enclosed when you see him, and he will tell you what took place as regards the dates in the letter I have written to him"—Simmons is the husband of the caretaker at Jones' office—I told Simmons that I was going down to the office—that was after I had left the prisoner—when I went down I saw a boy—I was at the Police Court at each hearing of the oases, which lasted from September until just before Christ<lb/>mas—I heard Simmons say that I had admitted to him that I had taken some leaves out of a book—Exhibit H. is a letter written by me, addressed—to Mr. Pope—"On Saturday I posted the "South-Western Star" of the 18th inst. to you, and you will see the Local Government Board inquiry has disclosed a state of affairs which has astonished the Parish of Wands<lb/>worth ratepayers. I know you will say 'Damn Mandy and Jones; why should I be bothered?' but I write as you are an old friend of Jones, and a word or two of advice from you may bring him to his senses; if he acts in a manly manner he may be in a better position. I sent him a memorandum on Saturday, and suggested that he should-try and settle matters by offering a cheque for £1,000, which is about the amount overcharged and for which the ratepayers have suffered. I know Jones rests on the fact of taxation pay<lb/>ment and twelve months having elapsed he told me so long ago, and laughed then I referred to special circumstances giving the Court power to open the taxation. Now he has tried all his low cunning to injure me; he sent Mrs. Jones to Hove (where I was staying) and I recognised her by a photo in his office. I have been kept well posted as to his boasts of what he could do, and I left him to his remedy and defied him. His object failed at Hove as did his letter to the Assessment Committee that I had tried to blackmail him, and he dismissed me for drunkenness"—I had received letters saying what the prisoner had been about, but they did not disclose their names—"I only called one witness to refute the latter charge, but others were forth<lb/>coming if required (memorandum, I shall call if I issue a writ against him). Letters written by me I believe were intercepted; anyway, I have a strong fact in my favour, and I can write or see the Government officials on the sub<lb/>ject matter of my letter"—I think two persons were giving me information—I tore their letters Up as anonymous, because there was no use in keeping them—I was not paid anything at the home—I was there as an inmate—it is not for inebriates, it is for infirm people—I did not pay anything for being there—"Jones did not appear on the Inquiry, but sent a letter. I am informed that he was suffering from gout, and had instructed you to appear. I knew where he was and also knew he did not dare appear and produce the papers. My object was to make him punished through his pocket, money being his god, and I told him in my memorandum that if he apologised now that his wretched letter is looked upon as a lie to cover what he had done, I would stay my hand; it rests with him now"—I meant I would not go any further with it if he sent a cheque for £1,000 and repaid the monies he had obtained and apologised to the Assessment Committee saying I was drunk—"The evening before I left I made up my mind to</p>

               <p>have done with him for good reasons, and the next morning at the office I took a memorandum of the dates when he received the money from a woman who was fined for assaulting a bailiff of the Court. As I told you, he would not pay the amount into Court, as he was bound to do under the rules, but stated he should 'stick to it' as it would repay him an amount which the registrar had deducted from a prior bill Jones had against him person<lb/>ally, and you took a note of this when I called on you. My object in taking this memorandum was to compel him to pay the money into Court so that he could not say that I was responsible for the money. As to taking a list of the bills he had against the Assessment Committee, I had a draft list from which I had made a copy for him one evening at home. I took this draft to his office the day after I left him; also two or three precedent books I had used for drafting documents for him at home, but kept a copy of the draft, as after the way he had served me I had made up my mind to use it, but not blackmail him. I left the Court with the clean sheet, and, as I have said, he tried to make out a very different state of things and failed. I hope when you see him he will see his position. I did not want money from him; I wished to make him pay others. Apologising for troubling you, Yours very truly, H. C. Mandy"—among those books there was not one which contained a precedent of Mr. Beat's for formulating bills of costs—I had had the precedent book at home for some two or three months—I was only paid 30s. a week; never 35s.—I took the book home to copy the precedent—Ladd has now been found—he came to the Court last night, and from my description of him the detective served him with a subpoena—Exhibit I. is another letter from me to Mr. Pope—"I send you a copy of the paper I spoke of yesterday. I consider I am fully justified in acting as I have. I am positive you would have done the same had you been in my shoes. It is useless to argue. I was told again to-day at the Spread Eagle, of Jones' boasting threats, but I leave him to his remedy, and defy him. In the interests of Mr. Jones, I again say he ought to make an offer, say £1,500, and get his Masonic friends to try and help him"—I think he is a mason—I do not know how his friends were to help him—I thought he would be able to raise money—"As you are aware, if the Committee entertain the application they fix a day and the applicants have to forward to him and the Registrar, the documents on which they rely within seven days after lodging the application. It is well that he should not try to imitate the ostrich. As I told you, all the copies of Mrs. Jones' sixty-eight folios are not destroyed"—a document was produced to me which was not opened—"she may recollect writing to me as to the copying. I mention this as a warning."—she did write to me—I did not mean to convey that I had a letter in my possession which I could use if I wanted to—I am going to Rottingdean on Sunday, and if they fool Ward's clerk, they cannot fool yours truly, H. C. Mandy"—they" must mean Mr. and Mrs. Jones and those in the office—I got this cheque of the prisoners, dated February 9th, 1901, for £4 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; 3d.—it is endorsed by me, and this one of February Kith, 1901, for £6 7s., also £6 17s., February 23rd; and £11 14s. on March 2nd; and £12, but there is nothing to show the date of that; it is partly torn off—the amount altogether is £41 14s.,—the whole</p>

               <p>of these cheques were paid to me before March 12th, 1901—they are outside my wages of 30s. a week—they were for writing at home or in my time which were not office hours—they represent some thousands of folios at 1 1/2 d. per folio—it works out at £6 5s. a thousand—not a penny of that money was paid for the copying in connection with these fourteen appeals; it was for the Gas Company's appeals—if the prisoner produces his diary it is entered for the Gas Company's appeals—I think they were all heard at the same Sessions—I do not know if they were in the same list—the Gas Company's appeals were settled—the bills were not taxed or sent in—there is t letter dated the 12th July, 1903, from me to the prisoner—"I have two days to spare before I leave"—that is for Brighton—"if I can run through the costs for you, I will do so on Tuesday, but let me know as soon as possible, as my time is precious"—I had left him on June 26th or 27th—there was no limit to the amount of contempt, or something worse, in which I held him—I wrote that letter because on the Monday I met him and a Mr. Pincher—the prisoner said, "You are putting me to a lot of trouble staying away from the office"—I said, "Serve you right; I am glad of it"—in the evening I met him again—he said, "Look here, Mandy, how much longer are you going to fool about; you promised to get out Durdon's costs for me. When are you coming back?—I said, "I told you I had had enough of you and I had left you"—he said, "You promised to do it"—I said, "I will see about it, as I promised to do it for you"—I afterwards thought I would go and 'do it—he made an appointment to meet me next morning—in the evening I had arranged to go into the country, so I did not go—he charged £25 for his costs in an executorship account where only £4 was due—he told me to make a memorandum on the costs; "these costs to be £25"—he said he would dictate the items to me to make up the £25, which he charged, and he got the executor to swear to it that he had paid the £25, and the executor swore to the account—I did not write that letter because I desired to get back to him—he invited me to go back—he wrote to the Assessment Com<lb/>mittee, saying he had dismissed me for drunkenness, and that is what annoyed me—he thought I should never see the letter—I showed him the amount of his profits—that was a hint to him, and to show him the dishonest things he was doing—I think it was about twelve months after I went there—that is how the income tax business cropped up—I said at the Police Court, "I am under the impression that Mr. Jones gave a policeman 5s."—I was under the impression he was jangling them about, and I thought it was for the old gentleman at the door—I got out all the bills, but left them for him to settle—he was so afraid of losing 6s. 8d. that he went through every bill three or four times—Mr. Smith was undoubtedly guilty of collusion with the prisoner—I never saw any money paid by the prisoner to Smith—I think I saw Smith once at the taxing office, and once afterwards, when I tried to get an allocator put right—the auditors would not pass one of the bills, and the prisoner sent me up to get Smith to put it right—on the occasion we taxed the bill I had two pints of Burton with Smith—I never gave him any money, and he never gave me any—I spoke of him to the prisoner as "smith"—there is no doubt that the prisoner took him to the Derby to</p>

               <p>pass the duplicate bills—one bill of costs was from one of Mr. Beal's precedent books; it was copied—I did not use the precedent from beginning to end; I stopped at the item "Attending counsel for briefs"—I wrote two letters to Mr. Coe; one is dated July, 1903, written from Hove—Coe was not a solicitor—I do not know what he was—I think I said something to the law Society about Coe, because the prisoner contended that he was entitled to share money with a layman—a Mr. Donogan had made a statement to me that I had been provided for, and that he had put something away for me, and that I had a legacy under his will—I tried to get the money, but was not successful—he had told me he had put by to the value of £2,000 for me—I was to have a life interest, and the rest was to be put by for my child—before I went to Brighton I was not a lodge keeper at a Wandsworth institution—between leaving the prisoner and going to Brighton I was un<lb/>fortunately kicking about Wands worth—it was the talk of the town about my leaving—everybody wanted to know what it was about Jones—I wrote to the "daily Telegraph" with reference to the prisoner's statement that he had dismissed me for drunkenness; they did not publish the letter—I lost some of the letters in the case coming up this morning—from September last I was staying in a house in Merton Road of which the prisoner was landlord—a fire occurred while I was there—the insurance company refused to pay anything to the landlord for the damage done—I do not know their reasons—I have not heard it suggested that I had something to do with its being caused—the insurance company refused at first to pay, because they said they had received no application—they found out their mistake and apolo<lb/>gised—I am not the person who got Smith to get Sir Richard Wyatt's signa<lb/>ture to the allocator which was altered—I did not suggest to Smith how the allocator should be signed—I saw Smith, and he said he would get in great disgrace for having acted as he did—this paper is in my writing (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), but it is not a suggestion as to how Sir Richard Wyatt's signature should be signed (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>)"Try Piper. The auditor won't take the allocator unless signed by Wyatt. Shall I see Smith on Monday and get him to stamp the signature?"—Piper was the clerk to the Guardians—I never suggested to anybody that I should approach Smith on the question—the prisoner sent me up—I wrote this because the auditor would not pass the item because it was signed by the clerk, and I looked upon it as a strange thing for the clerk to do, to strike out a principals allocator and then write an increased one—the prisoner said, "For God's sake go and see Smith"—Smith said, "I shall not have anything to do with it," and the prisoner went up and saw him—I thought if Smith stamped the allocator it would save time—the stamp was "R. H. Wyatt"—sometimes it was signed and sometimes stamped—I wrote to Coe on June 13th, 1904, and to Simmons—I said to him, "If I hear any more of your threats it will act to your prejudice"—Simmons was a police<lb/>man living on his pension, I believe—when the prisoner was giving evidence at the Police Court he referred to a great many alterations by me in a bill of costs—there is another item of 17s. in red; it is coach hire for 7s., which the prisoner put here, and I altered it in red to 17s., because it was altered in the draft, and I made a mistake in copying it—they were the prisoners figures—he made some calculation and said, "Oh, charge 17s."—what<lb/>ever</p>

               <p>alteration or increase I made in the figures was at the express direc<lb/>tion of the prisoner—he knew perfectly well every item of the bill, and checked it with me.</p>

I am a member of the Bar and was formerly Clerk to the Guardians of the Wandsworth Union and to the Assessment Committee—I am now superintending registrar of births, deaths and marriages for the Wandsworth registration district—I was called in 1396—I was then Clerk to the Guardians—the Benchers knew it—it was before any regulation to the contrary was passed—I belong to Grays Inn—I practised while I held the position of superintending registrar—I did not know there was anything irregular in doing it—I have not practised since these cases—I resigned my office as Clerk to the Guardians and Assessment Committee about December, 1899—I heard that I was to be junior counsel in the assessment appeals of the Battersea Borough Council about January 15th, 1901—I do not think I knew anything of it before the prisoner came to me—the first thing that happened in regard to my being instructed as counsel was that the prisoner sent me fourteen retainers—he probably brought them himself, one in each case—the retainer was is the usual form, with the fee of £1 1s. marked on the outside of it—he said I had to sign the papers—they were the first retainers I had had, and I signed them—he showed me whereabouts to sign them—it was somewhere near the fee, I suppose—that is where I did sign them—he did not tell me why I had to sign them there—I signed them because I thought I was merely confirming the fact that I was being retained in the cases—he did not pay any fee at that time on any of them—I was a barrister then—I had no chambers; I have now—I had clerks, but no barrister's clerk—I knew I was being retained, but I did not know I was signing a receipt—I did not know much about the scale of fees—the prisoner brought them to my office at Lavender Gardens, where I carry on the business of superin<lb/>tending</p>

               <p>registrar—I having signed them, the prisoner took them away—I did not know it was usual to keep a retainer until the case came on, I have had very great experience in rating matters, and that is why I was employed, but I knew very little about these fees—I had had no previous experience—I know now that a retainer is a document which entitles a barrister to demand a brief if he has received it, and that it keeps him off the other side, but I never thought about it then—I thought this was the usual procedure—it never occurred to me that there was anything unusual in it—I knew that if the Battersea people had come to me and said, "Mr. Henderson, I want you to take a retainer from me; I want you to take a brief," I could not take it—if they had said "Show me your retainer," I should have said Mr. Jones had taken it away—I should have spoken the truth—I should have had nothing to show that I was retained—I trusted everybody—the next thing that happened with regard to the cases was that the prisoner instructed me to prepare the respondents' case—he brought a sort of back sheet marked, "Instructions to prepare respondent" case"—I did so—there were fourteen cases and two were standing orders, so did not require the respondents' case to be prepared, because they were under a certain amount, so I prepared twelve—he brought me twelve papers, instructions to settle the respondents' case—those were the cases which were subsequently printed—after that the prisoner said I should be briefed in one of the cases, that of Francis &amp; Son—it was not one of the fourteen—he put the evidence before me and asked me to advice on the evidence—I did advise in the case of Francis &amp; Son—then he gave me instructions to advise on evidence in the fourteen cases—the in<lb/>structions were on a back sheet, marked, "Instructions to advise on evidence" and my name and the number of the appeal, the number of the Quarter Sessions and the fee of £2 2s. on each—I do not remember anything besides the back sheet—the prisoner brought the back sheets to me—they were put on my table—I think they were there perhaps a day or two—he had to come and see me on other business—he was always seeing me and he saw these papers on my table and said, "You will have to sign them"—I said, "Is that all you want me to do?" and he said, "Yes"—I signed each of them near the fee—I did not know at that time that such a signature under the fee operates as the usual receipt for it—when the prisoner came to retain me he brought a fee list—I did not know the signature was the ordinary voucher for a taxing officer in allowing fees on briefs—I thought the regular brief was the voucher—the prisoner took them away with that signature upon them—before he did so I did not write anything upon any one of the cases in the shape of advice on evidence, so there was nothing for him to peruse when he got them home—the briefs were delivered on February 28th, I think, because the cases were going to be in the list on the 28th—I did not attend the Court on the 28th—I was not well enough to go—the briefs were complete briefs; the same as I had received in other cases—as far as I can remember, they consisted of a back sheet and a lot of other sheets attached to it—some were blank, but several of them were written upon, containing manuscript</p>

               <p>copies or portions of manuscript copies of the original objection which was made before the Assessment Committee—the appellants' case, the respondents' case, and the notice to appear separately, which had been printed, and a lot of papers enclosed with them, with the shorthand notes of the proceedings which were taken before the Assessment Committee—in one or two cases there were some reports from the surveyors—I do not remember any instructions to counsel in them or anything in the nature of a disquisition on the law as to the rating of public-houses—I know the celebrated Camberwell case, in public-house rating—I do not recollect anything in the brief anything like that case; it is four years ago—I read the brief and made a lot of notes, which I have here—this was not quite my first brief—some other cases had come on—I had no brief before February and January—at that period of my career I should have read a brief if I had had one—I do not remember reading anything about the law in the Courts of Appeal—the prisoner said he had not had time to prepare the briefs—he said he was going on and that the cases had come into the list sooner than he expected—I believe I heard that the cases were adjourned on February 28th to March 12th—I am afraid I cannot recollect how soon I heard there was a prospect of their being settled without being tried—I was at the Court on March 12th, when they were disposed of—they were not dismissed; they were withdrawn by consent, each party being left to pay their own costs—the figures were to remain; the valuations were to remain the same—be<lb/>tween February 28th and March 12th I received no further papers at all in the nature of a brief, nor did I at any time—I was paid a retainer; I have got a copy of the fee list—the prisoner brought me a fee list—I signed it and in exchange he gave me a cheque—he brought me a separate fee list in each of the fourteen appeals—I was paid the retainer fee in nine out of the fourteen—when the prisoner came to pay me in April, 1902, he said the taxing master had taken exception to the retaining in my ease and I at once struck it out and said I would not receive any fee where there was any exception to it—he had then already paid the nine—with regard to the fee for advising on evidence, which I had signed £2 2s. for, I never received that in any of the cases—it was never mentioned again—it was never included in any list of fees which the prisoner paid me—he put it on the list of fees in the case of Francis, but not of any of the fourteen—I never suggested it should be paid—the cases were settled and there was no necessity to advise on evidence.</p>

Young, Son &amp; Ward, for some appeals, and some other solicitors—all the solicitors who had appeals in their hands instructed me—I had very few briefs: three or four or five; the prisoner had eighteen—I understood the Assessment Committee desired me to act, but I was not there—they thought I had a great know<lb/>ledge of these cases—I ceased to be clerk about September—these appeals were five or six months afterwards, and I had nothing whatever to do with the Committee then—when the clerk was ill I did not want to help them, but the assistant clerk said he could not do the work—they were in great difficulties and I assisted them temporarily—I did not then know what was permissible to barristers as members of Inns of Court and counsel—as far as I can remember, the retainers were brought to me in the first instance by the prisoner—there were fourteen separate back sheets—I cannot recollect how long I had them before they were taken away; I should think perhaps a week—I cannot remember when I put my name on them; it is four years ago—it was at the time they were taken away—I put my name just under the fee; I put my full name as far as I can remember—I knew a great deal about these cases and had a good deal of knowledge and information with reference to the work I was ex<lb/>pected to do if the appeals had been fought—between February 27th and March 12th I frequently saw the prisoner and talked matters over with him at my office—they were not regular consultations, paid for in the ordinary way—there were two official conferences; he came to my office on other business in connection with the business—I did advise in the case of Francis—I cannot say if the points and questions to be considered in that case were the same as those in the fourteen appeals—Francis's was a store with an off licence; the others were thirteen public-houses and a theatre—I do not remember if I had any conversation with the prisoner before February 27th about the probability of my being instructed—I do not remember when it was present to my mind that I was likely to be instructed as counsel in the cases—the prisoner came to pay me later on; I think about April 12th, 1901—about June 14th, 1901, there was £22; on August 15th, 1901, five cases paid for, £72 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; on or about January 19th, 1902, three cases paid for, £55 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; on or about April 19th, 1902, two paid for, £34 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; on or about May 12th, 1902, the theatre was paid for, £2 4s. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and May 23rd, 1902, two cases paid for, £34 17s.—I be<lb/>lieve that is all; that comes to about £220—in each of the cases when a payment was made there was a list of fees in respect of which those amounts were paid and vouched by me—the prisoner brought lists of the fees due to me in each case and gave me a cheque when I signed the fee list—each time he brought a cheque I signed a list exactly corresponding with the amount of the cheque—there was nothing in the nature of an improper understanding between me and the prisoner—I entered the service of the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> During the period from July to September, 1900, when I was acting as Clerk to the Assessment Committee, they were revising the lists and hearing objections of parties to their rating—I heard the arguments and assisted and advised the Assessment Committee as to the figures they ought to put in the valuations—any appeals from the decision of the Assessment Committee have to be notified by January 14th of the following year.</p>

When I went to help the Committee their regular clerk was away ill—I took his place temporarily—I was not paid—at the end of the year there was a sum of so much voted and he gave me what he thought was fair for my services—during that time I became acquainted with the details of these appeals, how and why they were arrived at, but I did not interfere or advise them very much—if I Was asked I should give them what amount I thought would be the proper rate—I should work it out according to the rules—in most of the cases they had a valuer to value them—I was conversant with it all—at that time I was a barrister—there were objections in some of the fourteen cases—I had a good deal of information acquired in assisting the Committee, which might be useful to one side or the other; that is what the Committee thought—it never occurred to me that if the Battersea Borough Council wished for my services they could have brought me a retainer and insisted upon having them—I did not see that I might be compelled to put all my information at the disposal of the Committee's opponents—I see it now—I see now the utter impropriety of my acting as clerk, I being a barrister—the Council wanted to have me; I did not want to take the clerk's place—I see now the absolute inconsistency of the functions and duties of a barrister and those which I took upon myself upon that occasion, but it never occurred to me then.</p>

I am the assistant clerk to the Guardians of the Wandsworth Union and also to the Assessment Committee—on January 1st, 1901, the prisoner was appointed by the Assessment Committee to act as their solicitor in the fourteen appeals—I believe they were numbered 1419 to 1,431, inclusive, and 1,468—on April 4th, 1901, on the application of the prisoner, a cheque for £2,000 was paid to him on account of costs, and in 1902 the prisoner's bills of costs were handed to the Assessment Committee and then to the Guardians for payment—the total sum of his bills of costs in those fourteen appeals came to £1,804 15s. 8d.—on Sep<lb/>tember 22nd, 1902, a cheque for the balance of £967 8s. 10d. was paid to the prisoner, who gave a receipt for it.</p>

               <p>so acting when the appeals by the Battersea Borough Council against the Assessment Committee of the Wandsworth Union were entered and throughout the time they were pending the prisoner acted as the solicitor for the Assessment Committee—in the ordinary course the cases for the appellants and the respondents are printed, lodged with the Court and used by both sides—it is usual for the appellants' and respondents' solicitors to exchange the printed cases—the charge is made up, and if there is any difference it is usually paid afterwards—if the copy on the one side is equivalent to the copy of the other, then there is no charge—in these cases in which the prisoner was acting the printed cases were exchanged between us—there was no payment made at all by the prisoner for the copies of the appellants' Cases which we supplied to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Fourteen cases were put into the hands of one solicitor and fourteen dealt with—if the fourteen cases had been given to fourteen solicitors a separate bill would have been chargeable by each solicitor—I am pretty familiar with the proceedings of taxation before a taxing master—solicitors often have a clerk who they send to attend to the taxing—taxing of costs is regarded as a special branch—in every firm of any standing the principals rarely go themselves, but send a clerk, and in many cases before a Master in the High Court a clerk attends on each side generally—one of the first items is "Instructions for brief"; then "Drawing brief"; and then "Copies of briefs for counsel"—the "In<lb/>structions for brief" is fixed by the taxing master at a lump sum—there is no exact process by which that sum is arrived at—bills which have to be taxed are left with the Master for a time—an opportunity is given to some representative on the other side to attend if necessary—the sum for the drawing of briefs is arrived at by charging so much per folio—I do not think that includes observations for briefs or documents—I think it is merely for the brief, which consists of so many pages of in<lb/>structions and then the proofs—1s. per folio is usually allowed by a taxing master—if the Master found there had been any duplication or repetition I imagine he Would cut it out—I think the Master allows something like 4d. per folio for copies of briefs for counsel—I know what a Crown Office subpoena is—it includes three witnesses in one, upon each of whom you serve a copy—6s. 8d. is put down and allowed when you get a Crown Office subpoena—if you have eighteen witnesses to bring up you get six Crown Office subpoenas, and it is often the practise in the King's Bench and Chancery Divisions to put down 6s. 8d. for each Crown Office subpoena, but the taxing master questions it—it has never been done by my office—I think there would be an extra allowance, but not so much as that—I have never had more than one at a time—I have never given the matter a thought, but I do not think I should charge for six—I do not know that Mandy has been in any one's employ since the initiation of these proceedings—I believe he has been doing work for the Battersea Borough Council in connection with this case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It is usual for a clerk who attends taxing to take with him vouchers for all payments out of pocket—I have never known pay<lb/>ments out of pocket in a bill of costs to be allowed without a voucher—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190501090141"/>
               <p>have never heard of an item of drawing a brief being charged in a bill of costs after the case is over.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MOYSES</hi>. In my experience, a taxing master always insists upon a voucher for everything he allows—the taxing master would always wish to see a voucher for a payment out of pocket, whether the other side agreed or not, because he might object to its being paid—I have heard of an affidavit of increase—when a voucher cannot possibly be obtained then the Master requires an affidavit of increase.</p>

I am a clerk in the office of Mr. Beal, who is clerk to the Quarter Sessions at Clerkenwell in assessment work—among other appeals which were lodged in 1901, I remember a number by the Battersea Borough Council against the Assessment Committee of the Wandsworth Union—out of the fourteen mentioned in this case, thirteen related to public-houses, and one to the Shakespeare—Nos. 1,419 to 1431 and 1,468—I was not in Court, but I believe they were adjourned from Feb<lb/>ruary 27th or 28th, 1901. to March 12th—I produce the minute book of the Court of March 12th, and find an entry as to these fourteen appeals; "By consent, appeals dismissed," that is the only entry—nothing further was done in connection with those appeals—no order was drawn up or applied for—no money was ever paid to the Court for an order—there was no occasion for drawing minutes—there could have been no attendance for minutes—if the prisoner had attended for them they would have been drawn up—there was no payment—there were no minutes to peruse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and a member of Young, Son &amp; Ward, of 24, Ely Place, now acting as solicitors for the Guardians of the Wandsworth Union—I have been acting as their solicitor in this matter from the com<lb/>mencement of the inquiry into the charges by the prisoner in his bill of costs—my firm also acted as solicitors to the Guardians in sixty-one of the assessment appeals in 1901—on March 14th, 1904, I attended, upon in<lb/>structions of the Guardians, the inquiry which was held by Mr. Burd, the Local Government Board inspector into the allegations made by Mandy in his letters to the Assessment Committee, and to the Borough Council—I know the prisoner had notice of that inquiry—he was not present or repre<lb/>sented by anybody—I have the letter which was received from him, dated March 13th; it says, "I am sorry to say I am suffering from the gout, and cannot come up to the inquiry to-morrow. I am instructing my London agent, Mr. A. Pope, of Grecian Chambers, Devereux Court, Temple, to look into the matter for me, and you will no doubt hear from him"—I have a letter received from the prisoner, dated September 12th, 1903—that is a reply to a letter sent to him by the Clerk to the Guardians on September 21st: "In reply to your letter for my observations upon the contents of Mandy's letters, I may state that I know little about the items in the bills of costs, as they were all drawn and engrossed by Mr. Mandy himself; in fact, he did most of the writing in connection with the appeals. Since his discharge from my service in June last for drunkenness he has threatened revenge</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190501090144"/>
               <p>and endeavoured to obtain money from me upon the same grounds as he is now applying to your Committee"—I have here a letter giving him notice of the inquiry which was going to be held, dated March 4th, 1904: "I beg to inform you that Mr. Burd, Local Government Board inspector, will bold a local inquiry at the Board Room of the Guardians, St. John's Hill, on Mon<lb/>day, 14th March inst., at 11 o'clock a.m., with reference to your charges in connection with Assessment Appeals. The Guardians expect you to be present at such inquiry, at the time named, to furnish the inspector with all details in connection with your accounts, and it will be necessary for you to produce all papers relating to the matters charged for in bills of costs for appeal to both Special and Quarter Sessions"—at the inquiry evidence was given, and after that, in consequence of instructions, I wrote a letter to the prisoner, dated April 15th, "We are instructed by the Guardians of the Wandsworth Union to ask you to hand over to their clerk, Mr. Piper, all papers and documents relating to the Assessment Appeals in which you represented the Guardians in the year 1901, including draft briefs and copies of documents made by you and charged for in the bills of costs delivered to the Guardians, the taxed amounts of which have been paid to you. We are instructed to request that you will hand these papers to Mr. Piper at the latest by Tuesday next"—we got no reply to that—on April 20th, we wrote again, "We are surprised you have not replied to our letter of the 15th. We do not want to take proceedings in the matter unnecessarily, and we shall be glad to hear from you by return of post, whether or not you intend to hand over the papers in question"—on April 27th, we got a letter from Mr. Pope, "Mr. Jones has handed me your letters in this matter, and has instructed me to accept service of any process which your clients may wish to issue against him"—that is the only answer we got for the request of the papers, and upon receipt of it, by the instructions of the Guardians, we took out a summons against the prisoner, before the Master in Chambers, for delay of these papers—the summons was heard on May 3rd, 1904—the Master made this order on that day (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—the prisoner was represented before the Master by Mr. S. G. Lushington, instructed by Mr. Pope—he opposed the making of any order, and appealed to the Judge in Chambers for that order—the appeal came before Mr. Justice Bruce on May 7th, 1904—the prisoner was represented by the same counsel and solicitor—he sought to upset the order of the Master—the appeal was dismissed by the Judge with costs, leaving the order of the Master as it was made—neither on the summons before the Master or the Judge did the prisoner suggest that the papers were destroyed or were not then in existence on May 11th—I received a letter from Mr. Pope dated May 10th. [<hi rend="italic">This stated that his client, the prisoner, had ascertained from his wife that the papers has been destroyed in her spring cleaning; that affidavits as to that should he made if desired; that he had already stated the reason for his absence at (he inquiry held by the Local Government Board and the circumstances which led to Mandy, who alone was responsible for the bills of costs, making the allegations against his client, and asking for a copy of the taxed bills of costs in order that it might be ascertained whether there was any foundation for such allegations, as it was impossible without them so to do.</hi>]—in reply to that I wrote this letter on</p>

               <p>May 11th [<hi rend="italic">Stating that the witness wrote saying that before the matter could be dealt with in any way, his client must make an appointment to be served with the order</hi>]—I had attended twice at Mr. Pope's office, and my clerk several times, to endeavour to serve the order on the prisoner, but had failed to do so—I received a letter in reply from Mr. Pope on May 12th, making an appointment for 11 o'clock on the following Wednesday—I kept the appointment myself and served the order for the delivery up of the papers upon the prisoner personally—this was about May 14th—no papers were delivered up in pursuance of that order, and on July 5th I obtained a summons for attachment—I sent a clerk to Mr. Jones' office, another to wait at Clapham Junction to watch trains leaving for and coming from Brighton, and an<lb/>other to his residence at Rottingdean, but at no place could the summons be served upon him—consequently, on July 11th, the summons, affidavits, and exhibits were left at Mr. Pope's office—on July 13th I received a letter from Mr. Pope [<hi rend="italic">Stating that his client had left for the Continent, with his family, for a month; saying he would send his address as soon as he could, and asking that the summons should be adjourned, as, not having yet heard from his client, he had no instructions</hi>]—I wrote a letter, agreeing to that—on July 14th the matter came before Mr. Justice Bucknill, and Mr. Pope, who attended, gave an undertaking to supply the prisoner's address as soon as he had ascertained it—the judge's note is as follows: "Mr. Pope under taking to give applicants his (Jones's) address as soon as known to him, adjourned for a fortnight; liberty to apply counsel's costs reserved"—on July 28th, not having heard from Mr. Pope, we wrote to him, reminding him of his undertaking, and on July 29th he replied that as yet he had not received the prisoner's address—on July 28th the summons for attachment came before Mr. Justice Phillimore, who refused to make an order for attachment, because service was not brought to the prisoner's notice—this is the judge note: "Stand over generally, liberty to serve at any time, and restore with two days' notice; liberty to issue summons to retax"—he also ordered that service on the housekeeper or on the clerk, or on Mr. Pope at Wandsworth, was to be deemed good service—on the morning of that day I received a letter from Mr. Pope dated August 3rd [<hi rend="italic">Stating that he had not yet heard from his client, but was willing to accept service of the summons of attachment on himself in accordance with the instructions he had received from his client before he left, and asking for an adjournment of the application for a summons for relaxation in order that his client could be advised as to the position</hi>]—I did not consent to a further adjournment, and on August 4th the matter came before the Master in Chambers, who made an order for the bills to be retaxed—the prisoner appealed from that order and on August 9th his appeal was dismissed with costs by the judge, and leave to appeal was refused—notwithstanding that, the prisoner appealed, and the case will be in the civil paper on Monday—the prisoner was repre<lb/>sented by the same solicitor and counsel before the Master and the Judge—I have the fourteen bills of costs as rendered to the Guardians before me (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—they appear to have been taxed at different dates from October, 1901, to April, 1902—they all bear the facsimile signature of Sir Richard Wyatt, a rubber stamp, except the 14th, which is signed by him self—all the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190501090146"/>
               <p>bills of costs are drawn in practically the same form as far as the order of the items go—there are a few dates, but, generally speaking, there is only the month at the top of the page, and sometimes only the year—in each bill there is a charge made for printing the appellant's cases, making a total in the fourteen cases of £19 6s. 6d.—in each bill I find a charge made for the payment to printer for the respondent's cases, making a total amount of £20 6s.—the actual amount paid, according to Mr. Panton, is £8 16s. in each bill there is a charge made for coach hire as the amount paid in each case, with the exception of the appeal in the Shakespeare Theatre matter of 17s., making a total of £11 1s.—in the public-house appeal, in reference to the Falcon, there was also an appeal by the occupier, on the ground that the Assessment Committee had put him too high, and in that case there is a charge of 17s. for coach hire twice over, bringing up the total to £11 18s.—the sum actually paid is £2 12s. 6d.—there are different sums in each bill for rent of consultation room, making a total of £6 6s. 6d.—in each bill there is a charge made for drawing minutes, attending to settle, and settling minutes of the order of the Court, and other fees alleged to have been paid for that order, making a total in all of £17 10s.—in each bill there is a retaining fee of £1 1s., as having been paid to Mr. Henderson, and a further fee ofpounds 2 4s., 6d. for advising on evidence—in each bill there is a charge for instructions for brief, making a total of £136 10s.—a charge for drawing brief in each case, making a total of £106 7s., and a further charge of two copies of brief for counsel amounting to £70 18s.—these are the amount that have been actually allowed on taxation—there is a charge in each case for the prisoner's attendance with the valuers in visiting the various public-houses, making in all £232, excluding the case of the Falcon, where an extra guinea, was charged—there axe charges in each bill for "drawing bills of costs," "copy for committee," "copy to tax," and "copy to keep"—he would only be entitled to charge for the copy to tax; all the rest are most unusual charges—the total for drawing the bills of costs is £52 11s. 4d., of which all that he is really entitled to is ££9 14s. 8d., being for the one copy in each case, for the taxing officer—taking it generally, every letter he wrote and every attendance he made is charged fourteen times over—it is not always allowed fourteen times, for instance, in some cases a letter is reduced to 1s. 6d., and in other cases, allowed at 3s. 6d.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have had sixty-one appeals to conduct for my firm, in which I employed surveyors—the surveyors charged a separate fee for each one, and got paid—I forwarded the accounts to the union, and they dealt with them—if there had been fourteen solicitors the amount incurred for printing would be the same—I do not think the case of a surveyor charging fourteen times over for surveying houses is the same as a solicitor charging fourteen times over for the same letter, as the surveyor surveys on fourteen different houses, and charges accordingly.—I grouped my sixty-one appeals, as far as I could for instance, forty cases related to property in St. John's Road; I put all my entries relating to general circumstances, in which the work done in one was practically the same as in the others, in the bill of costs in the first case and left those charges out in the others—one of my bills, thus grouped,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190501090147"/>
               <p>related to engineering works, and another to gas works—I think if a letter were charged 3s. 6d. in the first bill, the same letter should not be charged for fourteen times over; we are not allowed to charge more than once for what we do—if it be a taxation between party and party, you make a charge for a copy of the bill of costs—I have never before, in sending a bill of costs to a client, made a charge for a taxation copy—I was concerned on behalf of the Windsworth Guardians in prosecuting Dr. Revell, who pleaded guilty at the last minute to having defrauded the Guardians for vaccination fees—sen<lb/>tence was postponed, in order that he should make some reparation which, amongst other things, included payment of our costs, which amounted to £562 2s. 3d.—from that amount £158 3s. 2d. was taxed off—I have been a solicitor for four years, and previously I was twenty years managing clerk for my firm—we were in friendly rivalry with the prisoner, and up to this time we had always regarded him as an honourable solicitor—my firm also instructed Mr. Henderson; he settled the cases, and, I think, he was junior counsel in three appeals—I did not know that he had acted as a member of the Assessment Committee—I knew that for some years he had been in the service of the Guardians—I only knew then that he was a superintending registrar—the item in my bill of costs against Dr. Revell of seventeen guineas for instructions for further brief represented innumerable letters and attendances, and a clerk being At the office till twelve o'clock at night for days; the usual fee for a witness one guinea—there were eighty witnesses in the case—there is an item of fifteen guineas in the same bill for instructions on brief and perusing documents, which the taxing officer increased to twenty guineas with the consent of Dr. Revell's solicitor—it was taxed as between party and party—in some cases I had Mr. Horace Avory as leader, and in other cases Mr. Boyle, as he was then—the highest fee I ever paid was ten guineas to Mr. Avory—I did not employ Mr. Balfour Browne in any case—only a few cases were fought; no fees were paid in those that were not—there were a large number of subpoenas—I do not know that we ever got them from the Crown Office in a batch—the scale fee for a subpoena is 2s. 6d.—you have first to fill up a form, then stamp it, then fill up a subpoena on a parchment form—all that has to be handed in to the Crown Office, and you get your subpoena—I do not think that we got as many as four sub<lb/>poenas at one attendance at the Crown Office—I do not suppose the four subpoenas charged at 6s. 8d. each on March 11th, were all issued on that day—I cannot swear to that, but it is extremely unlikely—you cannot put more than one name on a subpoena—there was an, inquiry held in May, 1902, at which the prisoner attended—inquiry was made in to the charges made by the valuers; it was incidentally mentioned that £2,000 had been Paid to the prisoner on account of his bills of costs—only seven of the ori<lb/>ginal bills of costs could be found of the fourteen that were filed at the taxing office—I know that it is a substantial amount that was taxed off by sir Richard Wyatt—I employed two of the same surveyors that the prisoner employed in his cases—I knew Smith as Sir Richard Wyatt's senior clerk—it is correct what I said with reference to the taxation of my own bills, that "I had no occasion to complain of Mr. Smith in connec<lb/>tion</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190501090148"/>
               <p>with the many cases. He exercised his own judgment and reasonable discretion. Mr. Smith always dealt with the bills after they had left the taxing master seeing to the production of the vouchers, checking folios, etc."—that would apply also to counsel's fees.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The Revell case took a very long time I think it was heavier than this case—it was Dr. Revell's own suggestion that he should make reparation, and he offered me my costs as between party and party—very nearly £100 of the £105 taxed off was for actual payments for counsels' fees and witnesses—Mr. Bodkin represented the Guardians at the Police Court, and his fees were taxed off, as were the sums paid to the witnesses—the taxing master expressed the opinion that it was a most reasonable bill and increased some items in several cases with the con<lb/>sent of the other side—the learned Recorder was at first rather alarmed at the amount, but afterwards accepted the view of the taxing master—I have examined the seven bills of costs which have been found at the office of the clerk of the peace, and not one of them bears any trace of having been taxed by Sir Richard Wyatt himself; there is not a mark of his upon them—the figures we are dealing with are the amounts which have been allowed after taxation—my bills were taxed by Sir Richard Wyatt—he always worked with a blue pencil, and in the fourteen bills which I have there is only one with reference to the Shakespeare Theatre, which has been marked in blue pencil and afterwards rubbed out—it was by the special instructions of the Guardians that I briefed Mr. Henderson—in the cases in which I instructed him I did not deliver any retainer to him, or any case to advise on evidence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical practitioner practicing in South Kensington, and I am a brother of the deceased—he was fifty-six years of age and a barrister, but did not practice—he toured at times with theatrical companies—to my knowledge he was not a married man—I know the prisoner had lived with him for about thirty years, and in De<lb/>cember last they were living at 51, Gorst Road, Wands worth, where they had been for six months—I think I saw the deceased about seven months before his death—I think he drank to excess, and he was very bad tempered.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical prac<lb/>titioner, of 1, Bolingbroke Grove, Wandsworth Common—I knew the deceased slightly as a patient some years ago—about 5.30 p.m. on Decem<lb/>ber 21st I heard a loud knocking at my door, and the prisoner was admitted to the house—she was very excited and in great trouble—she had no hat or wrap on, and had evidently rushed out of the house in great haste—I thought she had been drinking—she said, "You must come at once, my husband is bleeding, If you do not come at once he will bleed to death."</p>
