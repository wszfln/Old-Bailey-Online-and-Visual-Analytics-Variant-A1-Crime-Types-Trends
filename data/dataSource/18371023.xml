T., some neckcloths, some boys' shirts, and night-gowns, some ladies' apparel, and some pillow-cases—about two o'clock I received a communication from my mistress, and missed all these articles from the line—I saw them again last Wednesday at the watch-house—they were the things that I had hung up in my mater's orchard.</p>

I apprehended Johnston—when I first went into Mr. Dickenson's house, the first word Moat said to me was, "If you will to the door you will see a man with a stick in his hand and a jacket; you will get the right person"—I went, and found Johnston by Williams's eating house, opposite Mr. Dickenson's—when he was going up the Old Baily, he said it was his father's fault for not relieving him, and at the justice-room he said the order was his handwriting—both papers were produced at the time—I took him about twenty yards from Mr. Dickenson's house—he was going down past the door towards Ludgate-hill, going away—there was nothing to prevent his being at the door when Moat entered—he would have had time to get that distance, if he had been at the door.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Hendon-street, Pimlico, in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square—my mother rents the house. On the 30th September I went to bed at half-past tenor eleven o'clock—I was not the last person up in the house—I and my mother went to bed about the same time—the house was fastened up—there is a shop door, and a side door to the house, and a back door to the yard—I examined them all before I went to bed—the windows were fastened—I am sure they were all fast—I was awoke by a neighbour's boy about five o'clock the next morning to go to market, and I went into the yard to harness the horse—it was just daybreak—I did not perceive anything—I harnessed the horse and put him in the cart—I had occasion to go into the coal-shed for a sack, and there I found the prisoner—I knew him before—he was for<lb/>merly in my mother's service about five or six months—he was crouched in a corner of the cellar almost down on his knees—I observed the coat and two bars of soap—the prisoner had the coat under his arm, and the soap was close to where he was kneeling on the floor—I asked him what business he had there—he said he came there to sleep—I said nothing more to him, but sent the neighbour's boy, who came to call me, to call a policeman—I remained with the prisoner till the policeman came—he begged for mercy, and asked me to let him go and he would never come. again—I refused, and he said nothing else—when the policeman came he was taken to the station-house—the soap was tied up in a handkerchief there was nothing else in it—there were a few onions wrapped up in an old black apron, close to the things in the corner—I found them at the same time as I found the other things—the coat was my property, and the rest my mother's—the coat hung on a nail close to the parlour door the night before, ready for me to take to market on the following morning—I had not had it on the day before—I hung it up myself over night—the soap had been in the cupboard down stairs—that is the only place where we keep it—I have no mark on it—there was soap there the night before, but I cannot say this is the same—I had a quarter of a cwt. in the day before, and when the policeman came to weigh it there was just the two bars short—I had seen the soap put into the cupboard—I was present when it was weighed next day—I know the apron the onions were wrapped in to be my mother's property, and we had such onions in the house—I found all the doors right as they had been the night before—I suppose the person must have got over some of the neighbouring yards—there is a vacant piece of ground he could get over—the windows were all broken it was very easy to put a hand through the kitchen window and unfasten it—the panes of glass were broken—the panes were very small, not large enough for a man to get through—he might put his hand or head through but could not get his body through, I am sure—I think it was big enough to get an arm through—there is a little catch, and by undoing that he might throw the window open—the kitchen window was the only one he could open—there was no other in the same state—the kitchen window is on a level with the ground of the yard—the yard is surrounded by a wall seven or eight feet high, but the yard goes down four steps—it is about eight feet at the outer side, and deeper inside—I think the onions were kept in the cupboard with the soap, but I could no say with certainty.</p>

On the 16th of September I was in New Brentford—Mr. Upjohn called me into his shop, and Perkins was there with the forks—he gave her into my custody with the forks, which I produce—I brought her to the station-house, and afterwards went with her to her mother's house, and the prisoner was there—I told her Mr. Upjohn had stopped the forks she had sent by Perkins, the girl—she said, They are my forks, but I did not send her to sell them; I only sent them to be mended;" and she turned to Perkins, and said, You little hussey, how could you be so silly as to say I sent you to sell them?"—the girl said, No, aunt, you sent me to sell them, and to get what I could on them" when the prisoner was taken to the station-house, she was examined by the inspector on duty, who asked how she came by the forks—she said she had purchased them in Chancery-lane, about two years ago, at a sale room.</p>

The house belongs to my aunt—the prisoner slept in the same room with me—I am a tailor—on the 21st of August last, I left a waistcoat at the corner of my bed—the prisoner was in the room when I left—I missed it next day—he did not return to the lodging—I went in search of him, and found him on the 24th in Grotto-passage—at first he said he had not seen it—he then said he had taken it, and if the Lord would spare his life he would bring it back next day, about ten o'clock, but he never came, and I could not find him till the latter end of September, when I asked where he had been all that time—he said he did not know, and I gave him in charge.</p>

A watch was pledged by the prisoner on the 25th of September—on the 26th he came and had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more on the watch, and while he was there he took the waistcoat down, I suppose, as it was found on him—the waistcoat was there in the morning, and this was six or seven o'clock in the evening—I had observed it in the after soon—I did not see it again till at Marylebone office—this is my master's waistcoat.</p>

On the 29th of July last I was at the Acton Arms public-house, Kingsland-road—I had missed my road, and went there to ask my nearest way to Islington—I was not tipsy, but I had dined with four gentlemen at East Ham, in Essex, that day, and was a little the worse for liquor—I had certainly taken a glass of wine—I mean several—we had two bottles of wine between four of us—I did not sit down in the public-house—I did not sec the prisoner there—I believe she is one of the three women who followed me in—I had not seen them before I went into the public-house—they followed me in almost immediately after—one of them called for a quartern of gin—I called for a glass of beer my self before they came in, and put my hand into my pocket, supposing I had silver to pay for it, but I had none, and took out my purse to change a sovereign to pay for it—as the landlord was giving me change, he asked the female who called for the gin who was to pay for it—(that woman has been posecuted already)—she immediately said I was to pay for it—that was not the prisoner—the price of the gin was taken for out of my change—I objected to it at first, but finding it likely to make a disturbance, I told the landlord he had better take it rather than have a disturbance there—I put the change into my purse, which I placed in my right-hand trowsers' pocket—I then immediately left the house—the women followed me out directly, all three of them—the moment I got out I was seized by one of them by both arms—that was the one who has been already prosecuted—the second came to my left side, and placed her hand on my left side, and the third came on the right side; and the moment I moved to get away, she unbuttoned my pocket, and drew the purse from it—I believe that was the woman not in custody—there were six sovereigns and one half-sovereign in my purse—I am sure they were safe in my purse; and I believe the silver in it was three half-crowns, one shilling, and a sixpence—I had changed sovereign, and received half a sovereign among the change; and the half pence were in my waistcoat-pocket—I cannot swear whether the prisoner was one of them or not, but I believe her to be one—two of the women immediately made off, down Kingsland-road—the third remained for a second, and then walked in a contrary direction—she was immediately apprehended by a policeman, and has been tried—I never saw my money again, nor my purse—there was nothing found on the woman who was taken up.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Old Gravel-lane, in the parish of St. George in the East. I live in the house myself, and take in lodgers by the week to board and lodge—I know the prisoner—he had lodged in my house two or three days previous to the time he broke in—I had desired him to go—on Thursday night, the 22nd of September, the house was all fastened up when I went to bed—I did not examine it myself—I was called up by one of my lodgers about half-past four o'clock in the morning and came down stairs—it was daylight at that time—directly I came down I saw the prisoner in the yard—my lodgers had got him there—I saw him searched when the policeman came—the policeman was sent for immediately—I did not see any thing taken from him myself—a pair of stockings was shown to me afterwards by the policeman—they were William Birch's stockings—he was one of my lodgers at that time—I am positive they are his—I washed them for him on the Tuesday previous—they are cotton—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183710230047"/>
               <p>I saw them hanging on a line in my back kitchen after I washed them on the Wednesday—I cannot exactly say at what time—the prisoner had left my house at that time—I think it was on the Tuesday that he left—I can lot exactly say whether it was on the Monday or Tuesday, but I saw the I stockings after he was out of ray house, I am sure—I also saw a jacket in the policeman's possession—that was the property of John Thomas, who was a lodger in my house at that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Williams, and live in James-place, Stepney-causeway, in the hamlet of Ratcliffe, in Stepney parish. On the 13th of October I was sitting at my tea—I was called out by my next-door neighbor, and went to the door—I saw the prisoner, in a ruffians sort of way, having a neighbor's little boy by his two arms, inside his door—he was threatening him that he would beat him I and ill use him—I asked the boy what he had been doing to the man—the boy, in a flood of tears cried and said, "Nothing, Mrs. Williams"—the prisoner said he would do for the boy, and said he had been making noise—I turned round and said, "Fetch his father and mother"—on my saying that, the prisoner made use of a very bad expression—he called me a b----b----, and jumped out of his house, and said he would make father and mother of me—he ran out of his own house, and knocked me down with his fist—he struck me about the head and face—one blow knocked me down—he hit me on the face with his list, and then kicked me on the head, and in different parts of my body—he struck me three or four times with his fist after I was down—my eyes struck fire—there was like sparks of fire came out of my eyes—he kicked me either three or row times, I cannot say which—he kicked me on the back of my neck, make shoulder, and right arm, and on my head—and he kicked me in * * * *—he tore my petticoats all off, every string, even to my pocket—I lost 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was rolled up in a bit of white paper—I had wounds from the kicking and beating—the surgeon attended me eight days—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Cook, and live in Devonshire-place, Paddington, with my brother, Henry Edmonds. The prisoner was his servant for three months—on Thursday, the 25th of September, I missed some shifts—the washerwoman said she thought we should find them in the prisoner's box—I proposed to search her box—she said the washerwoman should not do it—Mrs. Edmonds asked if she would allow her to do it—she said, "Yes"—she took the key from her bosom, unlocked it, and put some of her clothes over a small shawl of Mrs. Edmonds's—we found in the box a shawl, a pair of gloves, an apron, a handkerchief, and a piece of muslin, of Mrs. Edmonds's—the prisoner then said we must have placed them there—my stocking were found in her box—she had worn them, and locked them up In her box—she said she thought one of the children had placed the apron there—she said the shawl her own but I knew it was not—it belongs to Mrs. Edmonds—the child had stained it with currants when she wore in—the stockings and beads belong to me—they correspond exactly with what I have at home—she said she knew nothing about the gloves at all.</p>

On the night of the 24th of December, 1834, the warehouse, which is part of the premises, was made safe in the usual way—it is in the parish of Hillingdon, near Uxbridge, in Middlesex—on the 25th of December I came down, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, and found tie warehouse broken open—the pane of glass was broken in the window, which would admit the hand of a man to undo the fastening of the casement, an might arm be put in, and the goods which were within reach taken out I found the casement unfastened—there was not room for a person to get"—the goods had been stored away on shelves in the warehouse—I missed a considerable number of tea-trays and waiters—about thirty in all—can not tell how many of each—fifteen waiters and four trays have been found, and were shown me by Birch and Arnold.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a haberdasher, and live in Church-line, Whitechapel.

                  </hi>. I am the son of Robert Wagstaff, a farmer at West Ham. Chilvers was my father's carter—I thought it necessary to watch him, and went to the premises of Mr. Young, in Mile-end-road, on the 28th of September, and about four o'clock that afternoon I saw Chilvers drive my father's team into the yard—he got on the wagon, and took off two bags, one containing about two bushels of chaff, the other about half a bushel of corn—he was to leave my father's house about one o'clock in the night, on the 27th, for London, and did so—he should have fed the horses in the market in London—he had about six bushels of mixed corn allowed him to feed them—he should have given them the chaff and corn mixed in London—we always give them a bushel of clear corn and six bushels of chaff—they mix it themselves—they generally get home about five o'clock in the afternoon—I saw him do this, and I saw the ostler, Davison, take it off the wagon from him, and deposit it in to stable close by—he emptied the bags, and returned again, locked the door, and put the key into his pocket—the prisoner Chilvers then turned round and drove home, without eating or drinking in me premises—the horses had nothing to eat but a mouthful of hay which he picked up—they ought not to have eaten there—I then went and gave the ostler into custody—he denied all knowledge of it—the policeman demanded the key—he refused it, but after all he took it out of hw I pocket and unlocked the stable—we there found the corn and chaff—I have compared the corn with my own, and believe it to be the same, and the chaff also.</p>

About half-past nine o'clock on the night of the 11th of October I heard a noise in the lane—I went to my window and heard the deceased man call to somebody—I saw him—I had not seen any one else before I saw him—I cannot remember what I heard him say—I saw him on this side of the bar, nearest to my own house—he was standing still—I con<lb/>tioned to look at him, and he stood for some minutes—he was talking all the time—the soldiers were talking to him, I suppose, but I did not see the soldiers—I heard Chaplin talking to somebody across the bar—I could tell by their voices, that there were two persons—I heard a person sound a bayonet against the fence, saying, "If you come here I will do for you"—it is a wooden fence, on the right-hand side coming from the field, in the lane beyond the bar—I cannot say who it was said that, but it was a man's voice—I did not see the person who used the expression—after that expression was used they still continued talking for about a minute—Chaplin was still standing where he was—I heard the bayonet sounded again against the fence—I did not notice the words that were used, but the young man, Henry Hartley, came out of his house at the second sound of the bayonet—on his coming out I saw Chaplin get under the rail, and shortly after lost sight of him—I then heard Chaplin say he would fight them both—I saw several persons before I heard that, but who they Were I do not know—they were standing on this side of the rails—after heating Chaplin say this I heard nothing more till I heard him say, "I am stab<lb/>bed; he said he would do it"—I had heard a scuffle before that, but I cannot tell more—I ran down stairs and found Chaplin lying on the ground.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an Inspector of the S division of police. I was on duty at the station-house when the prisoner and Richard Smith were brought therein custody—Richard had a belt and bayonet-scabbard on but the prisoner had no belt, nor any side-arms at all—they were both drunk—the prisoner much more so than his brother—I said to the pri<lb/>soner, "Where are your side-arms?"—he said, I am discharged—I have been discharged to-day"—Bowes was in the room at the time, and about that time he produced the bayonet, and handed it to me—I examined it and observed there were marks of blood on it, and other marks, as if it, had gone through hands in the struggle, the perspiration of bands being on it—the marks of blood might be made by it being suddenly drawn through the hand, and cutting the hand—I produce the bayonet, and have had it ever since—I desired Richard Smith to take his side-arms off, which he did—he had his belt on with the scabbard, without the bayonet—this is the belt and scabbard, and this is the bayonet—(<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—Richard Smith said it was his bayonet—I observed the prisoner's face and saw blood on it, but whether it came from the mouth or nose I could not say—it was on the left side of his face, between the nose and mouth—I afterwards went to Mr. Lord's surgery, and found James Chaplin lying on the floor—I ordered that he should be removed to the University College Hospital—next day I took the prisoner and Richard Smith to the hospital, and found Chaplin there—there were the house-surgeon and two or three other persons in the room—the moment he sat the prisoner enter the room, he said, "That is the man"—this appeared to be addressed to the house-surgeon, and I asked the house-surgeon, "What did he say, Sir?"—all this was loud enough for the prisoner to bear—the prisoner had then sat himself down on a chair in the room—I was standing by the deceased's bedside, and so was the surgeon—that was about two, or hardly three yards from the prisoner—it was a very small room—there was but one bed in the ward—I do not think the prisoner had sat down at the time the remark was made—but he was sitting down when I spoke to the house-surgeon—in my opinion, he was not more than three yards from the deceased at the time he made the remark—he was in the room and in sight of the deceased—he was near enough to hear what the de<lb/>ceased said—I asked the surgeon what he had said—I had heard what he said—the surgeon said, "He said that is the man"—at the same time the deceased motioned with his head towards the prisoner—he motioned when he used the words first, not when the surgeon spoke—I stated what</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183710230115"/>
               <p>I had brought him there for—when Mr. Watts told me what he understood I the deceased to say, I said to the deceased, "What did you say?" and he repeated the words, "That is the man," motioning towards the prisoner—the prisoner did not say a word during the whole time—Chaplin ap<lb/>peared to be in a state of great exhaustion, but perfectly sensible—he repeated "That is the man," I said, "Well, what of him?"—he re<lb/>plied, "That is the man that stabbed me"—I then told him I was not going to ask him any questions, but I had been sent by the Magistrates with the two prisoners, in order that he might point out which was one and the other, in order that he might identify which of them it was, if either of them, when the Magistrate came to take his deposition—that most likely the Magistrate would be there by and by, to ask him some questions—I did not say to take his deposition—I then said, "Now this is George," pointing to George; "and this is Richard; when the Magistrate comes, you will recollect which is which"—he again motioned with hit head towards George, and said, "That is the man that stabbed me"—I then took the prisoners away, and sent them to Clerkenwell—he repeated the words again, I believe—I know he repeated the word "stab" two or three times, but I said nothing further to him, seeing he was in such a weak state—I afterwards met Mr. Gregorie, at the hospital, and we had an interview with the deceased—the prisoner was not there—the deceased said several times that he thought he should get better, in consequence of which Mr. Gregorie did not take his deposition, although the chief clerk attended for that purpose.</p>

I was in the mews at the end of Church-lane on the night this happened—I had been talking to Hayes, the groom, who has been examined—I saw the soldiers come up and inquire their way, and saw them go the way they were directed, and heard them thank Hayes for telling them the way—I saw Chaplin come down the mews towards where Hayes was—he must have seen the two soldiers going out of the mews—they went up to go to St. John's-wood, through the bar—I did not see the deceased follow them—I did not notice his going, but the soldiers had not been gone above two minutes when we heard a noise, and Hayes said, "There is something of a <hi rend="italic">row,</hi> a fight"—Chaplin went in the direction the soldiers had gone—I did not notice whether he turned to the bar or not—I am certain no longer than two minutes elapsed after the soldiers left before I heard the noise—I went up on hearing the noise—when we came up to the top, Chaplin came meeting us, and said, "I am stabbed, I am stabbed"—I had got to the top of the mews then, close to the bar—he was coming down Field's-place, saying, "I am stabbed"—I then went in pursuit of the persons—the witness Bowes went with me—he went on first—I should say he was a dozen yards before me—I was there the whole time that Bowes was, till the men were secured and brought into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you hear either of the prisoners threaten to kill Bowes, or did you see either of them flourish a bayonet, or any thing of the kind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not—I only heard the prisoner say he had done nothing—he had not the bayonet in his hand—I did not notice it—Bowes said he had got it, but I never saw it till I got to the station-house—I noticed the prisoner's face when I got to the station-house—it was very bloody, and his clothes were all bloody, and his hand—I noticed his hand particularly at Marylebone-office next day, and it seemed to be cut in a shocking manner in the palm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you and Bowes the first two that went in pursuit? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> 1 cannot say that—a young man named Hartly went with me, and when we got up to these men we both fell down together,—a young man named Manning went with us—Bowes was not before me—I was before him—I got hold of the prisoner, and we fell down together—at that time Bowes came up, and tripped him up a second time, and I fell down with him again—he had got up and went a little distance further—he ran a little, but could not very well, as he was so tipsy—he ran a very little distance, and when Bowes came up, he fell on him and wrenched the bayonet from his hand, and said he had got the bayonet—Bowes was along with the other soldier—I think I first saw Bowes in the field-lane—we all ran together from the field-lane—the other soldier, who Bowes was with, was behind, I think, but in the scuffle with this man I did not notice the other—Bowes, I, and the prisoner were all down together—I think Bowes had been with the other before, while I was along with the prisoner, and then he came up, but being engaged with this man I did not notice—I did not see the bayonet at all—the soldiers were running.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183710230119"/>
               <p>through the next paling, near the Conduit—some call it Shepherd's-fields—when we got into Field-lane, Bowes was before me—we started as one party, he being first—when we got through the bar, he was scuffling with one man, and I pursued on to the other—I had Bowes in my sight when he scuffled with the first man, but I did not see all that passed between them, as I went after this one, leaving Bowes behind with the brother—Bowes, Hartley, and two others, came up directly after I had stopped the prisoner—I did not hear the brother threaten to do any thing to Bowes—the prisoner did not threaten me when I got up to him, nor offer to assault me with the bayonet, nor did he do or say any thing of the sort to Bowes in my hearing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Wilton-crescent, Belgrave-square. In consequence of instructions I examined the hands of lie prisoner on Tuesday last—I found the appearance of recent wounds——there were three on the left hand, and one on the right—I have seen many wounds inflicted by military weapons, but have not treated them myself—I should judge the instrument that inflicted those wounds must have been very similar to a bayonet, as the shape of the wounds was nearly triangular—two of the edges were a little excavated, and the third a straight line—they corresponded with the outline of a bayonet</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it possible for such wounds to be inflicted by merely struggling with the edge of this, or having it merely drawn through the hands? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—I could not very well judge of the degree of force with which the instrument must have been applied to the part—I exa<lb/>mined the prisoner's back, and it was one uniform bruise—that had been inflicted probably some days before, but I cannot say whether ten days or a fortnight—I should say it was at the same time as the wounds on the bands—I did not see the body of the deceased—I have heard the de<lb/>scription of the wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you, or not, form any judgment whether a wound penetrating such an immense depth into the body of the deceased would be the result of a thrust, or of a heavy body falling on the instrument? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not judge without seeing the wound—it would require very great force to inflict such a wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the size of the wound in the prisoner's hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It occupied the front surface of the two joints of the middle finger; and the one in the centre of the right hand might be as large as two-thirds of a sixpence—about the size of a fourpenny-piece—there were three on the left hand and one on the right—two on the left hand, and the one on the right Had the same appearance—they were of a triangular shape, about the circumference of a fourpenny-piece, or rather larger probably—they were punctured wounds—they could not be made with the mere point of a bayonet—it must have penetrated to a certain extent—I should think about two-thirds of an inch—there were two wounds on the middle finger of the left hand, and one on the little finger; arid the other wound was in the palm of the right hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the wound in the palm of the right hand larger or smaller than those on the fingers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Rather larger—the natural formation of the hand and the bone would prevent a thrust penetrating to any great depth—a thrust might be made, and warded off with the hand, without making more penetration—it depends on the degree of resistance it meets with—the bone would be likely to prevent its going very far in. <hi rend="smallCaps">CHARLES LORD</hi>.

               <p>was brought to my surgery, and I examined the wound—I did not see the trace of any blood—I was struck to see so great an absence of bleeding externally—I did not see the prisoner that evening—if he had blood about his clothes and person, I am of opinion it could not have proceeded from the deceased's wound—it was in the lower part of the abdomen—I was not present at the early part of the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I did not see the body till after the integuments had been removed—the wound proceeded back out at the sacrum—it did not perforate the pelvis—that is, it did not come out at the hip—the wound passed nearly straight backward, rather obliquely inward—I should consider it had penetrated about three or four inches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. TAYLOR</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> I examined the body after death—I should think the instrument had penetrated between eight and ten inches into the body—it was an oblique wound—I should think it must have required very great force indeed to penetrate the body in that part to that extent I should think it would require much greater force than the ordinary thrust or stab of a man scarcely able to stand from the effects of liquor—I hardly think the bayonet would have taken the direction it did if the body of the man had fallen on it—it would require great force to inflict the wound, but I cannot imagine any position in which Chaplin could fall to have caused the instrument to take that direction—it is possible it might be done by the whole weight of his body being thrown on it in the struggle, bat I do not think it probable—I think an ordinary thrust would hardly account for a wound of such depth—it must be given with great force.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing the weight of the body of the man having the instrument in his hand, and being unable to sustain himself, would that account for the depth of the wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the additional weight of the body might.</p>

                  </hi>. I live servant with Mr. John Bartie of Gloucester-place. About half-past eight o'clock in the morning of the 22nd of Oc<lb/>tober, I heard the key of the clock fall off the chimney-piece in the hall where the clock is kept—I was in the kitchen—I ran up stairs, and saw the key and the clock were gone—I ran out, and saw the prisoner Brown at the top of Gloucester-place, and Pace was running in the field—I had seen them together about twenty minutes before, loitering about I pursued, and called, "Stop thief"—they neither of them had the clock then—I saw them taken into custody—they had jumped over the paling to get the clock—the prisoners were taken in about half an hour—the clock was taken up in the road that they ran—I am sure I saw them before, and when I saw them taken I was sure they were the same—there were four of them in all—a man with two children, who was crossing the field, picked up the clock—the one that had it must have thrown it into a ditch—I saw a man with a basket running before me, but he is not here—I lost I sight of him—this is my master's clock—there was some dirt on it I believe.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabman, and live in Rawstorne-street, St. John-street-road.

On Saturday night, the 14th of October, the two prisoners came to our shop—I was standing by the side of the counter—Harris came and spoke to me—I saw Mary Wilkins go out of the shop—I immediately went after her, and brought her back—I took her down to the end of the shop, and there told her she had got a habit-shirt belonging to me—the said, "I will swear I have not"—I said I was certain she had, and I would send for a policeman; upon which she immediately took a habit-shirt from under her shawl, and said, "I have nothing but a habit-shirt which I have purchased"—she had purchased one of Harris, and some flowers, but that was then on the counter—the policeman came, and I gave her into custody—the screamed most violently—the one she purchased was similar to this.</p>

On the 17th of October, the prisoner went into the shop—(I think I have seen him before as a customer)—I was in the cart at the door—there were four people in the shop at the counter—I went in and saw the prisoner cover down the lid of his basket—I saw there was more than one brush in it—he went out—I went out and saw him at the end of Seymour-street—he went on to Dorset-street—I still pursued, and he ran off—I gained on him and he threw the brushes down—I pursued him to Shouldham-street and there collared him—he said it was not him—I said it was—he made an excuse to go into a public-house—I said he should not—he got from me and went into a public-house, and a man, who I thought was outside our door when he went in, put his hand to my chest and prevented me going in—I looked through and saw the prisoner going out at the other door—I got away, pursued him and took him—I was then in Seymour-place—the policeman came up and took him.</p>

                  </hi>. I belong to the North of Ireland, but have been latterly in America, in the cloth business. I arrived in this country on the 6th of October—I was living at No. 20, King-street, Tower-hill—on the evening of the 12th I was standing at St. Katharine's Docks for nearly two hours—I had been drinking at three public-houses—I believe I met with the prisoners about eight o'clock that night—I saw Donahoo first opposite St. Katharine Dock gate—I knew nothing of him before—he said he was a sailor formerly, and was one at that time, but had been out of employment—he spoke to me first—he said he was in need on some trifling assistance, and said, "Will you be so kind as to treat me?"—I said, "Yes, I never saw a sailor who I was not willing to treat or assist"—the prisoner Kellett was quite <hi rend="italic">handy</hi> while I was talking to him, and he came forwards—I cannot say whether I spoke to him first, or he to me, but he was on my right band, and I said there was no sailor or soldier who I would not willingly treat—(he is a soldier)—they walked with me into a public-house opposite the Dock gate, but before that the female prisoner came up, and Donahoo introduced her as his wife, and said, would I be willing to treat his wife?—I said, "Yes, I will"s—we all went into a public-house opposite, and had something to drink, which I paid for—we staid there two hours, to the best of my knowledge, and then went to another public-house in the same street—we all went in, and had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183710230168"/>
               <p>something to drink, which I paid for, and remained there nearly two hours to the best of my knowledge—we then went to a third public-house not far off—all the prisoners were in company with me—I treated them again there, and remained there, I dare say, nearly two hours—after that we came out, and I proposed to go to my residence—Donahoo said, as I was so kind to them he wished me to go and take a cup of tea with him and his wife, and invited the soldier also—I begged to be excused, saying I had a coffee-house where I boarded, but he insisted that I should follow, and with great reluctance I consented, and we all four walked away together—it was then about half-past four o'clock in the morning—when I first met the prisoners I was neither drunk nor sober—I had taken some ale and porter—I was capable of understanding what I was about—I consider I was more sober at half-past four o'clock, when I agreed to go home to tea with them, than I was before—as capable of knowing myself as when I met with them—I did not drink much at the three public-houses—Donahoo did not say where he lived—he said it was convenient—I went with them into Angel-alley, Whitechapel—it is a lonely place—there was a wall on the left side—when I got within three feet of the further end of the alley, Donahoo took hold of me by the collar with both hands, and put me down on my back by the collar, against the wall of the alley—he put me com<lb/>pletely down on the flags, with my hat right up against the wall—he did not say any thing at that time—the prisoner Kellett was standing within two paces of us, and the woman within three paces—neither of them said a word—Donahoo put both his knees on my chest, put his fingers or thumb on each side of my neck, and squeezed my throat, so that I could not speak—he took one of his hands away, and then I had liberty to speak, and said, "Gentlemen, for God's sake, save my life, and take all I have"—Donahoo said nothing to that, but held me by the neck with one hand, and put his other to my fob—I caught hold of my seal and held it fast, and he tore the fob away and took my watch—here is the tear it made—the fob was torn out—the ribbon broke, I held the seal and ring, and he got the watch—he then put his hand to my vest—I cannot say whether it was the right or left hand—I cannot say whether it was the same hand as he took the watch with—his hand did not depart from it throat till the watch was taken from my pocket, and the money from it vest—I am positive of that—he took a snuff-box from my vest, which had fifty-two sovereigns in it—I had also two sovereigns in a purse, besides, at the time I first met them—I changed one sovereign at the first public house, as my silver was expended—when I was in the first public-house I took my box out, took the lid off, and closed it again, and pot it into my pocket, but took no money out of it—I turned my back to ray company at the bar, as I did not wish them to know what I had in it—I know it had spent none of that money—I cannot say whether the prisoners saw the box at that time—I only looked at it, shut it, and put it into my pocket again—I had my back to them, therefore I thought they did not see it—I did not take the box out after that at all—after Donahoo took the box out of my pocket, he liberated me—he got off me, and as soon as I got on my feet, I got away as quick as I could, leaving them all three together behind me—I cannot say how long exactly T was in the alley—the other prisoners did not say or do any thing to me while Donahoo was taking the money—when he first seized hold of me, the other two were standing close by, and I saw them within a few inches of the same ground when I went away—as soon as I got into the street, I saw three or four men, and went</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183710230169"/>
               <p>right forward among them, and told them I had been robbed—one of them called a policeman, who came, and I told him what had happened—about two or three hours after, I went to the station-house, and saw the three prisoners there in custody, and identified them as the persons who had been with me—I saw my watch at the office the same morning, but I have serer found my sovereigns.</p>

Q.</hi> Who was in our company when we first met? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can only speak to you and your wife—I saw several other persons, but cannot tell who they were—any you introduced to me as friends I treated—I treated all the concern—I did not swear at the office that I met the soldier first—I said I met the sailor and the soldier about the same time—I cannot say which I spoke to first, but I believe it was the sailor—I do not recollect meeting three dragoons after coming out of the first public-house—I have no doubt I treated a waterman—I recollect three police<lb/>men being in the same public-house with us—I have no doubt of that, and one of them called me aside, and gave me a warning not to be in your company any longer—I do not recollect the policemen going with us to endeavour to get us admittance into any public-houses that were shut—I recollect treating the policemen—I ordered a treat to them, and paid for them, but I cannot say what they had—I may have treated three girls with three glasses of ale in the same house—any you introduced to me I said I would treat, but I do not recollect treating the three girls—it may have been so—the female prisoner was in our company from the first starting to the last, that I am positive of.</p>

Last Friday week I landed at the St. Katha<lb/>rine's Docks, from America—I met the prisoner Kellett, the soldier, Bear the gate of St. Katharine's Docks yesterday morning about half past four o'clock—I treated him at three different public-houses—the sailor prisoner I saw about twenty minutes after I saw the soldier—the tailor represented the woman prisoner as his wife—I treated them then—then walked in company with them some distance—they brought me into an alley or lane—the sailor put me up against the wall in this alley, and then he put me down and put his knee on my chest—he put hit thumbs or his fingers under my chin to choke me—I had a watch in my pocket at the same time, and he put his hand in and tore my fob out, the best part of it, and took the watch out of it—then he put his hand into my waistcoat pocket and took out a snuff-box containing fifty-two sovereigns in gold—I said, "Gentlemen, save my life and take all I have"—the soldier was within two paces of the sailor, and the woman about three, standing by at the same time—the soldier did not put hands to me in no way—I then ran out of the alley as quick as I could—I do not know where the sailor and the other went to—I saw the consta<lb/>ble now present (Richard Thompson) soon after I got out of the alley—I know I had my money safe not twenty minutes before 1 was robbed—my waistcoat pocket was torn as well as my fob—that was done by the sailor in taking my snuff box.</p>

About nine o'clock, on the morn<lb/>ing of the 13th, I met the prisoner Picton in Cable-street—I followed her to Mr. Ramsden's, the pawnbroker's, and asked her if she had pawned her husband's watch—she said, "Yes"—I said, "Where?"—she said, "In Ratcliffe-highway"—I asked her for the duplicate—she said, "Why, to tell you the truth, I have not pawned it at all, I have sold it right out, for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—she took me to Findley's shop, in Ratc<lb/>liffe-highway, and said, "Come with me, I will show you; I don't we, it is my husband's watch"—I asked her where her husband was—she said he was drinking at a house in East Smithfield—I did not ask his name—she took me to Findley's. and I saw the watch there—she saw it, and said, "There is the watch"—I took her to the sta<lb/>tion-house—she gave up 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and said she had lent 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to another woman, who was at the station-house, aid that woman gave up 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

In conse<lb/>quence of what I saw in the Hue and Cry I went, on Sunday evening, the 1st of October, and found the prisoner at a public-house—I examined his hand, and found a mark in it, as described in the Hue and Cry—he told me his right name after some hesitation—I took him into a private room and told him I wanted him for robbing his master of a sum of money—he made no answer, but was quite sullen—I told him to turn out his pockets—he produced several articles on the table—I said to him, "Give me the watch you have got in your pocket;" and he handed the watch I now produce—I said, "That is your master's watch, is it not?" and he said "Yes, it is—he appeared quite sober—he appeared to be fumbling about his side-pocket—I told him I thought him a bad hand at searching pockets, and I must come and assist him—I was in the act of getting up (being on the opposite side of the table,) and going over to him, when I saw him draw a pistol from his left-hand coat pocket—I immediately rushed on him and threw him across a chair—he said, "Stand off, stand off!" that was after he produced the pistol—I seized him by the right hand—he held the pistol in his left; and in making a catch at his hand I caught hold of a water<lb/>man's hand, who was standing there; and during that time the pistol went off—I judge it was intended to be pointed at me—it went off, and passed my head and the head of the waterman, who dropped his head, and said "Oh Lord!"—it was a percussion pistol—the pieces of the cap flew over my face, and I think the powder came in my face, for I was quite stunned with it—the charge lodged over the mantel-piece—it was a ball—I wrenched the pistol out of his hand; and my son, who sat opposite, said, "Father he has got another pistol"—I immediately drew it out of his pocket—both were double-barrelled pistols, and the three barrels were all loaded with ball, besides the one discharged—they were all capped and cocked—I found 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him—I asked him what he had done with the seal—he said he had given it to a girl, whom he described—I found she was a girl of the town from Portsmouth, and I got the seal from her—I asked him what he had done with the gold—he said he had spent it—he told me his master's cash-box was in the corn-bin—I took him before the Magis<lb/>trate afterwards, and brought him to London.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> At the time the pistol was fired, had you got him forced down in the chair? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had—I should rather think that prevented him from raising the pistol—it was done all in a moment—he drew the pistol before he said "Stand off"—after he was taken he behaved very well, and cried like a child.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watch and clock-manufacturer, and silversmith, and live in Tottenham-court-road. On the night of the 21st of September, the prisoner Wells came to my shop, about half past nine o'clock, and pro<lb/>duced a watch, and asked if I would purchase a metal watch—I asked the price—he said 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I opened it, and found it was a gold one, and had the Hall mark—I asked him if it was his own—he said it was, and that it did belong to his grandfather—I went in, and informed Mrs. Keyzor, then came out, and asked his name—he said he had been to my shop a few days be<lb/>fore, and sold me some coin, and I had his name—I opened my books—he pointed to his name, and I found he had sold me some old coin for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and given his address, "10, College-street, Camden-town"—I said if his address was all right, I would purchase it, but I should go with him to see if it was right—I went behind the counter, and put my hat and coat on, and he ran off—I ran after him through different streets—I offered some boys 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to catch him—they ran and caught him—I came up, and he said, "Take me to the station-house"—a policeman came up—I gave him in charge, and ordered him to take him to the station-house while I went borne to put my coat on—when I went to the station-house the prisoner seeded very much agitated, and wished the office to be cleared of all stran<lb/>gers—he then said that he bad been innocently brought into it, and was very sorry for it, and that he had a sister who lived at a watch-maker's at Is<lb/>lington, who he believed had stolen the watch, for he had had suspicion of it; and that every knock that came to the door, he was afraid somebody was coming, and he had advised his sister to part with it; and that there were two more watches which he had pawned, one at Rid path's, at Somers-town, aid the other at Camden-town, he begged the policeman to go to his wife and ask her to give up the duplicates.</p>

                  </hi>. I am proprietor of a large dairy at Islington, formerly Laycock's. The prisoner was in my employ as book-keeper—it was his duty to keep the books—and after that, his duty to receive the money and hand it over to the cashier, and day by day to square his accounts—I found him de<lb/>ficient in his accounts in the early part of last June—I was induced, in conse<lb/>quence of the respectability of his friends, and the urgent requests they made me, to pass it over—about a fortnight after that detection he returned to my employment, and took the same place as book-keeper—an alteration was made in the regulations with respect to the money—the prisoner said, to prevent the possibility of his doing wrong, he should always call the cashier to receive money, as he would not even venture to touch it—I replied that it was a very excellent resolution he had formed, and I had no doubt, if he adhered to it, he would be restored to society and respectability, which was my sincere desire—he was in my service on the 9th and 15th of September last—he has never accounted to me for the sum of 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as received on the 9th from David Wiseman, or 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 15th of Sep<lb/>tember from Evan Lewis—he absconded on the 15th, and I did not see him again till he was in custody.</p>

I have known the prisoner about five years—he came to our house on the 10th of August, 1836, between eight and nine o'clock, to see if there was any job wanting to be done—he is a carpenter—I had a box, which had something the matter with the lock—it contained</p>

               <p>twenty sovereigns, in my purse—I saw it two or three days before he came to me—I had not lost the key, only I was turning it, and it would not open—I gave it him to open—he took something out of his pocket to I open it—I left him for a few minutes in the kitchen opening it, while I went to answer the door—on my return I met him coming up stairs—he said nothing to me, but went out—when I went down I found the box open, and the money and purse gone—I have lost it entirely; nobody else could have taken it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the house of Mr. Henry Davidson, in Bruton-street, Berkeley-square, in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square. The prisoner came on trial to Mr. Davidson as groom, a few days before the 24th of April—I was the head groom until about ten days ago—all the property stated in the indictment is mine, and was taken out of the room over the stable—the prisoner slept there two or three nights—I went out and returned in half an hour—I missed the things at half-past six o'clock in the evening—the prisoner said he was going to his father, who had a job for him, and if he did not get the job, he should return again—he did not return—this was after the things were missed—I went to his father next morning and made inquiry, and then gave information to the police—the coat he had on when he was apprehended is mine—I never permitted him to take my property at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wholesale druggist, and live in Finsbury-circus. The prisoners were both in my service, and I believe are husband and wife—about a quarter-past eleven o'clock on the night of the 1st of October, I went out—a friend had dined with me, and I accompa<lb/>nied him part of his way home—I took with me a patent latch key—I returned about twelve o'clock, and let myself in—I made the door fast in<lb/>side, as I always do—it was bolted and chained, and could not be opened from the outside by a skeleton key—I retired to bed—I had a particular wooden snuff-box, which I took out with me that night, and on returning home I put it on the mantel-shelf in my dining room, with two other silver snuff-boxes—I cannot be certain whether I saw the other two when I put it down—they are usually there, and I missed nothing—the male prisoner had the charge of my plate, and the key of my plate chest—next morning, about eight o'clock, I awoke, and the male prisoner came into my room, and said, "The plate is all gone, and the snuff-boxes are all gone"—I went down stairs, and saw the female prisoner, who appeared very agitated, and crying—she said she had picked up a telescope on the stair-case—I went down stairs to the butler's pantry, with the two prisoners, and the male pri<lb/>soner said the plate drawer had been found open, and the plate was gone—some of the plate had been in use at tea time, the night before—I sent the man for a constable—one came, and two other officers were called in—a search was made, but nothing was discovered—the plate chest was kept in the attic—I went up, and examined it with an inventory, and missed the plate stated, and also the wooden snuff-box, which I had put on the mantel-shelf—I something was afterwards said by the female prisoner—Reynolds, another servant, was present at the time, and I rather think the male prisoner was sufficiently near to overhear her, but I cannot answer to that.</p>

On the 28th of October, Bonnell came to my house and gave an order for 12cwt. of glue, to be sent to No. 21, New Church-street, Lisson-grove—I did not know him before—he said he should pay 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash and the remainder within the month—he referred me to Mr. Good, of Banner-street, St. Luke's—my partner Mr. Raymont went to make inquiry, and in consequence of that the goods were supplied—he said he should want more glue—the value of the 12cwt. was I believe 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on the following day a person of the name of Clark came to the factory, he brought 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Bonnell, and said he was his traveller—he said he travelled for other people, as one commission alone would not pay him in London—the goods were sent in pursuance of the order—on the 12th of November, Clark came to the factory again and produced a letter—he never left it at all—it was addressed to Clark from Bonnell—I did not read the whole of it—Clark pointed out what referred to the glue—I read what he pointed out—as far as I recollect, the contents were, that Bonnell had sold 10cwt. more glue in the country, and that he wished to have the dark glue—he said it would suit the country market best—Clark I asked me to have it ready for him that afternoon, and said he would come for it himself at the time—I said it should be ready—he went away and came about an hour before the time mentioned, and brought Isaac Anns, and a horse and cart, on which was the name of Sarah Martin, Wheat Sheaf-yard, Farringdon-street—the glue was packed in bag and delivered to him—he and Anns went away with it—there was 10cwt.—on the 9th of November Clark came again and produced this letter (No. 1,)—(<hi rend="italic">Seethe letter No.</hi> 1, <hi rend="italic">page</hi> 1000)—and told me that the glue was to be sent to Lisson-grove immediately—I did not refuse the order that time—after he left I turned to Bonnell's account, and in conse<lb/>quence of the state of that account I determined not to execute the whole I of the order—we sent 5cwt. to Lisson-grove, with a view of getting the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after that we received a caution from a gentleman named Sewell—in consequence of which I went to the house of the defendant Davis, in Brick-lane, the next day, after I had sent the 5cwt of glue—I believe it was sent the same day the order was given—this is the entry in our day-book—I copied it from it—I have no doubt I entered it myself—when I go to Davis's I saw the very 5cwt. of glue that I had sent to Bonnell by Clark's direction—(I took no further steps until the credit I usually gave, had expired—the amount then due was I believe 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I never got that paid from Bonnell—I never could find him)—I waited a considerable, tune in Davis's shop—he was engaged with a person—it was a chandler's shop—I asked Davis if he was a buyer of glue—he said he was not—he said he had bought some glue, or I made the observation that he had some glue there—he said he had bought it—I said, "Yes, you have bought it either from Clark or Bonnell"—he said he had bought it from neither—I do not know any thing further that I said—something further passed.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not give this reason for calling at his shop, that a person at Paddington had sent circular letters to the glue manufacturers in Bermond<lb/>sey, respecting Bonnell, cautioning them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think I did—I cannot swear I did not—I was aware that such letters had been sent, but I have no recollection of having such a conversation—I was with him but a very short time—I had one of the letters at that time—I had not then been to Paddington, to the person by whom they were written, and did not tell Davis so—I will not swear it, but I believe I had not—it was within a day or two that I went there—I told him it was in consequence of the information that the writer's servant had watched the glue to his shop, that I called on him to ask for an explanation—I heard from the writer that he had sent his servant, who watched it—I do not know that I said the writer's servant, but Sewell's servant—Sewell had not told me that, but he had written—I cannot recollect whether I saw Sewell before I saw Davis—I believe I went to Paddington on that day, but that was after I had been to Davis—I will not swear that I did not go before—I never went before or since that time to Davis's shop, and held any communication with him—I left the glue behind—I did not write down the address of the person who gave Bonnell a character before I left the shop.</p>

               <p>—not of that parcel of glue—it was of the last parcel—I am not aware the horse was ill at all—I told the carman as an excuse for not delivering the 20cwt., to say that the horse was ill, hut nothing had been said about the horse being ill before the third parcel—we did not get the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that was to be paid—the 5 cwt. was delivered in New Church-street—I have issued a writ against Bonnell for the amount due—after I had been to Davis I caused Clark to be taken into custody—I charged him with having obtain<lb/>ed these goods by forged orders, but not in the name of Bonnell—he was tried and acquitted.</p>

                  </hi>. I have known Mr. and Mrs. Davis for ten years—I was never regularly in his employ—I have been in the habit of selling goods for him and portering, for the last five years—I had no connexion or participation with him—if I sold any thing I had a commission, but no profit—I have known Mr. Bonnell two years, or two years and a half, by his coming to Davis—I never knew him before—I believe the first time that he came he sold some shirt-buttons in grosses—I believe Bonnell did not keep a shop, he was travelling—the buttons ran from 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to a guinea—I have seen him there almost every week, with haberdashery, cheese<lb/>mongery, paper, grocery, and bottled ale—various persons bought tthese things—Mills was Mr. Davis's carman upon pretty nearly all occasions—I remember Bonnell going with ale to Ascott Heath races—I believe Davis took it—Bonnell went to live at Paddington, I understand—he had taken a shop to open in the general line in Church-street, Paddington, but I never was there—I remember about the 2nd or 3rd of November last year, Clark coming there—I never knew him till I saw him with Mr. Bon<lb/>nell, about six months before—he kept a public-house in St. John-street—after that he let that house to Mr. Bonnell, and I believe the ale they took to Ascot Heath came from that house—I saw Bonnell come to Davis with a van full of ale—Clark and Bonnell were always partners together in busi<lb/>ness, as I have seen them divide the money after they went oat—I remember some glue coming to Davis—I cannot say the day, but it was just at dusk—I believe it was half a ton—it was not brought by Mills—I do not know the man who brought it—I saw the cart—I did not go out, but when Clark got out of the cart, he came in, and Mrs. Davis said, "Well, Clark, you have got it, then?"—he said, "Yes, I have; I am just the boy to fetch, if I go after it, I am sure to get it"—Mrs. Davis said, "What carman have you got?"—he said, "I have got a new carman"—she said, "I wish you had had our old carman, because we can put some dependence in him, I don't like new carmen, we had better had the old one, as he would never <hi rend="italic">split</hi>"—Mr. Davis was behind the counter at this time—he made some observation himself—Clark said, there was no matter about that—Mrs. Davis said, "You have not brought it directly from the glue man, have you?"—he said, "Yes; what odds is it?"—she said, "We have got into some trouble before, and you had better have gone round with it"—Clark said, "O, never mind; I took care there was nobody <hi rend="italic">touted</hi> us"—Mr. Davis said, "It is no odds, Clark, whatever; what you bring here, I will buy of you, bring what you like, I don't care where you get it"—the carman then put the goods down by the side of the counter—Davis said, "Clark, I believe I have got no money to-night"—he said, "Never mind;</p>

               <p>Bonnell and I will be here in the morning, that will do"—Clark and Bon<lb/>nell came the next morning, I believe, about ten o'clock—some mention was made about the glue, and Davis said he thought they had given too much for it—some more conversation took place—Davis proceeded to pay—I saw some sovereigns—I believe he said he had given 48<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt.—he paid the money—Bonnell, I, and Clark, went to the Coach and Horses, and several more persons, who were in the habit of selling goods to Davis—there was something had to drink, and Clark said, "I suppose you have got the money?"—Bonnell said, "Yes;" and took it out of his pocket, and laid it on the counter, and they proceeded to divide it—I came out—I had a glass of gin—in answer to the observation about too much, Bonnell said, "I think there is a sacrifice enough as it is"—Davis said, "You talk as though you were going to pay for it; it is all profit to you"—while they were in the house, there was some conversation respecting the glue—I said it was enough to give any person the yellow jaundice, seeing so much gold—Mr. Bonnell said, "We have got 200 more of them at home"—I did not see any receipt given—I think, nine or ten days after, in the morn<lb/>ing, a cart came with some glue, but a smaller quantity—I understood it was a quarter of a ton—there was half a ton the time before—it was unloaded and brought to Davis's shop—the cart did not come to the shop—it stopped two doors off—a man brought it up, and put it down by the side of the counter—it was in the same sort of bag that the half ton was in—I saw Bon<lb/>nell and Clark half an hour afterwards, with Davis—there was conversation about the glue, and Davis said he would not give such a price as he did be<lb/>fore—he proceeded to pay him for the glue, and I think some other things which he had before—I believe it was carpet-bags, but I cannot say—I do not know how long before they had been brought—I did not see them—Mr. Davis said, "I may as well pay you"—I believe it was 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw a £10 note and some sovereigns—Davis took that out of his cash-box—he went over to the public-house again—Bonnell and Clark and I went with five or six more dealers that I knew—we then all went to the public-house—it was said there was more glue coming, and then it would be over, as all the fat would be in the fire—Clark said, "We have done pretty tidy with him, but he can afford to lose it, as he is worth from five to ten thousand pounds"—after Clark was given in charge I went to Union Hall, and saw him—I was sent by Mr. Davis—he was remanded, and a summons issued against Mr. Davis for his apprehension—I came back and told him of it—Clark said he was astonished that Bonnell did not come forward, whatever he had done, he had acted fairly and honestly, and he expected he would come forward and pay his share of the expenses—Mr. Davis did not appear to the summons—I went and brought him word that there was another summons—he said he would not appear to any sum<lb/>mons—I went again, and the Magistrate issued a warrant against him—I went and told him—he put on his hat, and said, "I will not be at home all night"—he went afterwards and met the officer, and surrendered—he was discharged, and Clark held to bail—I have heard Bonnell and Clark say that they paid some money—Clark told me that he took 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. Harrison—I was here when Clark was tried—he was acquitted—I remember Bonnell and Clark bringing some stationery to Davis before this transaction of the glue—there was writing-paper, account-books, copy-books, ledgers, day-books, wax and wafers—Bonnell was living at that time in Pad<lb/>dington, I understand—the things were brought sometimes in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—some<lb/>times in a cart, and sometimes under their arm—Clark and Bonnell used to</p>

About a quarter past three o'clock in the morning of the 5th of October I saw the prisoner at Chadwell in Barking parish—he had a quantity of oats in a sack—I went across to him and asked what he had got there—he said, "Some oats"—I said, "What are you going to do with them?"—he said, "I brought them from master's stable for the van to take up"—I said, "Whose van?"—he said, "My master's, Thomas French"—I said, "Did your master give you orders to take the oats?"—he said, Yes he did"—I said, Does your master drive the van"—he said he did—I said should remain with him until I ascertained the truth—before French came he said it was not his master, but his brother who drove the van, and he had ordered him to take the oats to feed the horses—when Robert French</p>

I know the prisoner Matthews by having a horse from him about ten years ago—I went to his place and killed it—I have seen him since then, and have had transactions in business with him, but that was my first acquaintance with him—on Saturday, the 7th of October, he brought a black mare to my house, near upon seven o'clock in the even<lb/>ing—he came to my gate with it, and asked me to buy it—I asked him how much—he said 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I got a light and looked round the horse, and asked him where he brought it from—he said he had come from Squire Fuller's, at Beckenham, and had brought it from there—that he came from there—his expression was, "<hi rend="italic">It</hi> came from there"—he said he wanted it killed, and to have the tail cut off, which must go back—he went behind the mare, and said, "You must cut the tail off about here," pointing to the place—he said one of Mr. Fuller's men was coming to his house for the tail, next Sunday week—I looked round the mare—she appeared very fleshy, and had a rowel in the side as if it was under a doctor—it appeared too good to kill, as I thought—I told him I had my suspicion, and should stop the mare, and take her to the station-house, and he had better come too—he said he would—I took the mare to the station-house, and told the Inspector I had suspicion it was stolen—I left it there—I saw her after<lb/>wards at Woolwich, in possession of Mr. Strother, and am confident it was the same mare.</p>

On Wednesday morning, the 11th of October, from information I received, about six I o'clock, I went to Plumstead Manor-way, in Kent, and saw the prisoner Smith nearly at the bottom of what they call the short Manor-way, stand<lb/>ing alongside a brown gelding—I clapped my hand on his shoulder, and told him to consider himself my prisoner—he said he was very glad of it—I conveyed him to the cage, and have had the horse in my possession ever since—it is here now—it has been claimed by Lewis, of Woolwich.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Deer, a boot and shoe maker, in Nelson-street, Greenwich. On the 21st of September, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was in the shop with Penniall—the prisoner was there, and asked for a bottle of blacking—I have heard Penniall's evidence—it is quite correct—the prisoner is the man—Penniall gave me the half-sovereign—I looked at it and put it into the till—I had no other there—I am quite sure I gave her back the same.</p>

On the 21st of September I met Mr. Deer and Penniall, and went with them to the Buffalo's Head and saw the prisoner—he had a guard-chain round his neck, a mourning ring on his finger, and spectacles in his pocket—his shoes were very dirty and he had a mark under his eye, as if he had had a black eye—I received from Mr. Deer a piece of coin, which I have marked—I searched the prisoner, but found no other bad money on him—I found one half-crown on him.</p>

On Thursday evening, the 21st of September, the prisoner came into the Coach and Horses in the Market-place, which is about twenty yards from Mr. Deer's—it was about twenty minutes to eight o'clock—he came in with a pair of blue steel spectacles on, and asked the landlady to oblige him with a sovereign for silver—I saw her give him a sovereign, and she took up the silver—there were two half-crowns—I am perfectly satisfied he is the person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Thomas Poile. I had his child in my arms in Great Suffolk-street, Borough, on the 20th of Sep<lb/>tember—her name is Martha Poile—she was twelve months old last Au<lb/>gust—she had a coral necklace on her neck—I was coming home from the Borough, and was just by Mr. Lloyd's, the carpenter's gate, when all at once. I felt something shoved against me—I turned my head round to see what it was, and the prisoner had got the necklace in his hand—he had got it off, and ran down John-street—I never saw him before, but I am certain he is the person—I cried out "Stop thief"—he was followed, and a young man ran after him, but came back again, as he had left his shop—there was no one with the prisoner when he took the necklace, but there were two more on the opposite side of the way, who had been in company with him, and one of them was taken—I did not see them speak together.</p>

I was just coming again "—I answered that I had not got the money, I could not get the two sovereigns, but I had brought him all I could—I did not say how much it was—Redshaw said, "I must have it, for I am going to the west end, and have got to be there by seven o'clock, and I cannot lose that for you"—he then said he would not take any money unless I had got the two sove<lb/>reigns—I said, "You had better take what I have got, for I cannot get any more"—I had two marked shillings in my pocket at the time—at that moment Page came up, and said to Redshaw, <hi rend="italic">"Bill</hi> and took hold of his arm—they left me directly, and began to walk down Prince's-square—I did not hear what more was said—I had come with the policemen from the station-house to the square—the policemen were within sight of Page at the time—I had come with them to the end of the square, and then we parted—they were in sight of Redshaw when I first saw him, but he could not see them—they were on the opposite side of the way, in Kennington-road, out of Redshaw's sight—they could see him, for they were watching for him—I do not think he could see them—he was not looking that way I—he was paying attention to what I was saying—I did not see Page at that time, but when he came up and touched Redshaw on the shoulder—I suppose he had seen the policemen then, but I cannot say whether he had—I walked close behind him and Redshaw, when they walked away, and said, "You had better take the money"—I had not said what money I had—Redshaw said, "No, I will not take it now; you shall hear from me again soon"—I then gave a signal, by taking off my hat, which had been agreed on, and the policeman came and took them both into custody—when he took them I said Page was not the one, meaning he was not the one that had spoken to me—the policeman said, "I must take them both to the station-house," and then I gave them both in dirge—I had met Redshaw and the other man in Blackfriars-road on the 12th—I did not owe that man any money—I never had any transaction with him—I never made an agreement to pay Redshaw any money that I owed that man—they never said any thing to me about my owing him any money—they and that man's name was Denton—I never owed a person of that name</p>

The prisoners lodged with me between three and four months—on Satur<lb/>day, the 14th of October, Redshaw left my house about three o'clock, or a little after, to the best of my recollection—I do not recollect whether Page went out with him—I do not think he did—I did not see Redshaw again till he was in custody—I do not know what time Page left—I do not re<lb/>collect seeing him since between two and three o'clock—I think I saw him between two and three o'clock—we generally dined together between twelve and one o'clock—I think he dined with me that day—I do not know the exact time he left my house, but I believe it was between two and three o'clock—I will not be certain whether the prisoners left together—I do not recollect seeing them both go out together—I saw Redshaw go out of the parlour—Page was not in the parlour at that time—I cannot say how long he had left it—it might be half an hour—they both lived toge<lb/>ther, and were on friendly terms—they did not go out much after they came to my house—they sometimes went out together—neither of the pri<lb/>soners have directed me to make any application to the prosecutor since they have been in custody—I have seen the prosecutor, and spoken to him—I did not see him after I had seen the prisoners—I have not seen them all the week since last Monday, at the Hall, and I had not spoken to the prosecutor then—whatever I said to the prosecutor was out of my own head.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to one of the surgeons of Guy's Hospital. I saw the deceased when he was brought there on the morning of the 9th of October, about ten o'clock—he appeared in a state of stupor—that might arise from drunkenness, or the joint effect of a blow and drunkenness—I afterwards observed a slight external bruise on his left eye—he recovered</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183710230237"/>
               <p>from his stupefaction partially—he became much worse afterwards, and then insensible, and was so up to the time of his death, which took place on the 25th of October—I have examined the body since death—the vessels of the brain had burst, both those between the skull and the brain, and also those in the brain itself—between the skull and brain there might be a tea-poonful of blood, and in the substance of the brain a large clot of blood, which would half fill a common tea-cup, and there was a fracture about an inch and a half long on the right side—the immediate cause of death was the extravasated blood, which arose from the rupture of the vessels—if he had received a blow and fell on the curb-stone, that would account for the state in which I found the head—all the parts of the brain were in a healthy state except those in contact with the blood—it was a recent disease.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having heard that he was in a state of considerable intoxication when he received the blow and fell on the curb, and seeing the state of stupe<lb/>faction in which you found him, are those causes together sufficient to have caused death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the appearances were not those of ordinary apo<lb/>plexy arising from drunkenness—there must have been external violence to produce the appearances I saw.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Death was occasioned evidently by pressure of blood on the brain from a ruptured vessel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—excitement or drunkenness may rupture vessels—it does so in apoplexy, if the coat of a vessel happens to be thin and defective—his partially recovering and getting vorse again did not indicate a second rupture of the brain—the first state of insensibility was not caused by the pressure, but by the shock or blow—if the vessel had burst in consequence of drunkenness, he would not have recovered in the way he did—I think the spoonful of blood and the half tea-cup full, were caused by a rupture at the same time—it is not at all uncommon for persons receiving a blow to remain in a state of stupor for twenty-four hours, from the effect of the blow alone, without any pressure of blood being thrown out—I attribute the first symptoms to the direct shock of the nervous system.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Green-street, Blackfriars-road. The pri<lb/>soner came to me on the 20th of October with a black mare-cob, about fourteen hands high—he asked if I would buy it—I knew him before, and directly he came in I desired my man to shut the gate—I asked him where he brought it from—he said his brother had sent him to sell it—I asked what he wanted for it—he said 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked him his brother's name—he said he lived at No. 1, Devonshire-place, Kennington-cross, and his name was Matthews—I said, "What is your name? "—he said, "Gale"—I said, "How comes your brother's name Matthews?"—he said, "He has been married lately, and that alters his name "—I said, "No, it does not; I shall stop you, and send to know if it is true"—he said, "Don't stop me; you may keep the pony, and I won't tell my brother where it is"—I sent my man to Mr. Matthews, who came and owned it—I asked him, in the prisoner's presence, if he was his brother; and he said he had never seen him before.</p>

                  </hi>. At the time in question I kept the Griffin, in Church-street, in the Borough—I now live at Notting-hill. On the 25th of September I was sitting in the bar-parlour, taking wine with a friend—the prisoner and his brother stood at the bar—they had been in the house all the evening, I believe—I invited them to take a glass of wine—they came and sat down and drank—my friend left while they sat with me—my attention was called to a disturbance at the bar, and I left the prisoner and his brother in the parlour—I took my watch, ring, and a bag, containing the money stated, and gave them to my wife, who took them into the bar parlour—I turned the parties out of the house who made the disturbance, and then returned, and sat down with the prisoner and his brother—they left between one and two o'clock—there had been no<lb/>body in the bar but them and my wife—the prisoner sat by the side of the drawers—nobody could go to them without his seeing them—shortly after they were gone the bag of money was missing from the drawer—my watch and ring were there—among the half-sovereigns I lost there was one which I had rubbed on the rim, and I should know it among a hundred—I have since seen one produced by the constable, and am confident it is the same—I selected it from nine others at the office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watch manufacturer, and live in High-street, Borough. On the 26th of last July I went to the prisoner's counting-house, No. 24, Lime-street—he said he wanted some flat silver watches, to show to a friend of his in Liverpool, to see if they would suit the American market—I said I had not got any ready to send out for samples, but he should have some next Saturday—I could not get them ready then—the prisoner called on me on the Monday following—I said I could not get the watches ready, and I bad sent him a note to that effect—he said he had not received it—he then said, "Let me see the watches"—I did so, and he said, "I will take them as they are"—they were not in a fit state to send out for samples, and I told him so—he said his friend was a dealer in watches, and was a judge, and, of course, he did not expect new watches to look like those which I only sent for samples—upon that representation I delivered him three watches—he asked me to let him have them for eight or ten days—I said he might have them fourteen days, and then I was to have them back—I considered I had only lent them to him as samples, for fourteen days—they were to come back if approved, to make some of the same sort by—they were not in a state to be sold, neither as samples or otherwise—they required cleaning up—the silver dials wanted cleaning—they were not in a fit state even for samples, but he pressed so hard on me—he said if they suited, he would give me an order for fifteen or twenty dozen—I said they were to be returned in four<lb/>teen days, to a day—I particularly stated that—three of them were worth 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—finding they did not come back, about three weeks after, I went to the prisoner's counting house, and asked him if the watches had come back, and whether they suited—he said they had not come back, but they would be back in a few days, but they did not answer, they were too dear—he read a part of a letter to me in the German language, and it appeared to me to be his own hand-writing; it was written on another letter—it was never intended that the prisoner or his friend should become the purchaser of these particular watches—they were to be returned at all events, whether approved of or not as a pattern to make others by, if I got the order—he only said, "I want these watches as samples for my friend, I have not any interest in them "—these arc two of the watches—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—the third has not been found.</p>

(I have kept her there out of charity)—he prisoner used to come to her once in six months sometimes, and very likely has been away, twelve months—I remember her leaving to go to France—she left some furniture, and before she left, charged me to let no one have it without her orders, and in her presence—some time after, the prisoner came in with the key, as usual, and <hi rend="italic">bolted</hi> up stairs with authority—he was there all night, and he took away the furniture constantly—there not a time that he went without some—we went up stairs to secure the property, and found the key was gone and the door locked, and he came with the key—when the prosecutrix left she said, "I have left the key in the door"—we went up, and it was gone, and he was off to Paris—it was from his producing the key that we supposed he had authority to take the things—when I found he had taken many things, and was about to take more, I prevented him—when the prosecutrix returned in February she came to my house in a most distressing situation—she was delivered there, and there she lay, and had no means to support the child—she was obliged to sell her things to pay her passage over—she was able to get up about three months after her confinement—when she went into the room she made a complaint to me of the loss of her property.</p>

"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Have you ever been there before? "—he said, "Yes, five times"—I asked what he had taken out then—he pulled out 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from his pocket, and said that was it—he had been with me a year and a half, and I had a good opinion of him.</p>
