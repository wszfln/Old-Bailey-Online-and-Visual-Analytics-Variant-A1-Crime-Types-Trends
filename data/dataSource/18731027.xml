I put the coat on, and made a small parcel of the other things, put them in a bag and left it at the Feathers. I called for it next morning, and the landlord said he had given it to the police. I could not get any information about Jones. I met Evans, and was going with her to the Feathers to ask what I had better do, and the policeman took me in charge. If I had known them to be stolen I had the whole of Wednesday to escape. I had been wearing the coat for three days in the neighbourhood where it was stolen.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187310270015"/>
               <p>here was also a shop in Cirencester Place—I am not aware that the prisoner kept it—I supplied that shop with goods—the name is Mrs. West, she is paying us off by instalments now—I do not know that the prisoner had anything more to do with that shop than taking orders there—there was another shop in Noel Street, Berwick Street, but the prisoner had nothing to do with that—I took the shop and put Smith into it, I managed it myself entirely till I sold it—the prisoner had not to pay the wages of the assistants and porters when I was out of town—I always paid them before I left—I went to Aldershot twice with the prisoner, and I have to to pay the hotel expenses now—he did not ask me for money to pay the hotel expenses, and I did not say "You can get some money from some one in the morning, get Mr. Riser to cash it"—this is the first I have heard of it—Mr. Riser is the landlord—the prisoner had money in his pocket which he got from oar customers on the Monday—he collected from our customers on the Monday, and we went into the country on Tuesday—I have been pressing him for cash for nine months—I do not know that in order to give me cash he borrowed money of our customers, there was no necessity—he sent us cash from time to time by post—I did not ask him whether he could manage 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by June 1st—he did not borrow 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for me from a customer on the eve of the Derby, nor did he represent that he had done so—if I wanted money I should take it from my own cash-box—he did not get an accommodation bill for 129<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., nor did I pay it into the London and Westminster Bank; that was not an accommodation bill, it was money owed by his brother-in-law, St. Aubyn, for goods delivered, and also money which I had lent to the prisoner—I have his book showing the money lent to him, and he gave an I O U to my father, which was returned on his giving us a bill—I think I returned him one I O U, and my father the other—his brother-in-law gave the bill, the prisoner had not to pay it, but he did pay it with our money—the bill was dishonoured and we gave it to the prisoner to take to his brother-in-law—he did not do so, but collected the money from our customers and paid it into the London and West<lb/>minster Bank—I don't think he met the bill with a penny of his own money—there was not an open account between us—I do not know that 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of that 126<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was drawn out-from the prisoner's own account at the Union Bank of London—I was not aware that he allowed for over charges.—we had a customer named Baden—I am not aware that the prisoner allowed him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. overcharge on one occasion—if it was allowed, it will appear in my books—they are all balanced and I do not get any allowance here for that amount—here is only 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. discount—I do not find any overcharge in Bufferings' account—I will not say that no allowance has been made, but I will say that none Ought to have been made—Crook's account was closed on January 15th—I don't know why—I did not find that the prisoner was out in his accounts about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have been round with him to the customers many times, and I think I went round with him in June, "this year—I did not ask him to make out a book with the account, and I don't know that he did—I gave him in custody on July 3rd—I did not ascertain that he had been making large allowances to the customers when I went round to them, but it was ascertained at the Police Court, I was present—he told me he had made out a book with this account, but I did not know it—I went with him <hi rend="italic">to</hi> see his sister, he told me he was 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out, and we told him he could not stop with us unless we had some security, and he offered us a bill of sale on his</p>

               <p>furniture for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if he stopped with us—we took the bill of sale, and his sister said that she would be responsible for 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and her husband for 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and her husband wrote to say so—there was a bond to secure the bill of sale, but not faithfully to serve us—I did not believe at that time that he was thousands out—I believed him to be an honest man, and only thought he had got wrong—my father would not accept his brother-in-law in any amount—I am not a partner, I manage the business for my father—the prisoner suggested to give us the security of a bill of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on a legacy of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. wrong, and we would not keep him with us unless we had security—the bill of sale was on 30th May, but we applied for further security on account of the heavy amounts the prisoner was receiving, and I didn't think it was enough—I never found out the other amounts till he was given in custody—I had not been round to the customers before my father wrote this letter of 9th June, not with the intention of finding out any<lb/>thing against the prisoner, but I may have been with him to obtain an order—I think I went round to Aldershot with him, but not for the purpose of ascertaining the amounts he received—we never made him responsible for dishonoured cheques, nor had he to sue in his own name for one received from one of our customers—I have heard of no dishonoured cheques but his own, if there were any I should take them on myself—I did not tell him that he must borrow 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cash, and I would transfer the bill of sale—we had a customer named Atkins—I did not charge the prisoner with a dis<lb/>honoured cheque of Atkins for 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Atkins's was a bad debt of 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and we took his business in Vauxhall Street for it—I have sold the shop, and received the money—I have not asked the prisoner to furnish me with a book referring to the overcharges—there ought not to be overcharges—we said "Show us the overcharges"—he said "I will" and in the meantime I went out and found out that there were so many other accounts that we gave him in custody—I have never seen this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the case has been adjourned for a month, and you have had the opportunity of inspecting our books, but you have not done so.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>). No one has inspected the books, although the case was adjourned for the purpose—they have always been ready for inspection—the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. advanced to the prisoner does not refer to any of these accounts—I do not think 1, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. will cover the deficiency that I have discovered at present—there ought not to be any overcharge, because the invoices I sent out were exactly in accordance with what the prisoner gave me as the prices quoted to my customers.</p>

On 3rd October I went to 90, Lower Thames Street, and found Mr. Gazelee's office in disorder—this portion of a key was given to me, and also a broken pick-lock, similar to what was found at the prisoner's lodging—six desks were forced open, and the marks on them corresponded with this screw-driver, found in the prisoner's box—I was with Inspector Harnett on the evening of the 6th, when we searched the prisoner's lodging, and found in his box this bunch of keys, one of which corresponds with the piece broken into the office door—I found the broken pick-lock on the first floor; that is Mr. Kacine's office—the prisoner must have concealed himself on the premises—the door stands open all day.</p>

I am an engraver at 13, Leicester Street, Regent Street—I remember the prisoner calling on me—he was with me four times, and during those four times he brought me different portions of an Austrian bank-note—the first time he came he said "I want you to do some work for me"—he produced a half-sheet of foolscap paper, on which was fastened three pieces of paper separately, a square piece in the centre, and two small ovals on each side—he said it was for his brother in Hungaria, who had coal mines, and they were what his brother had sent over to him to be engraved—he wanted it done exactly as he had got them on the paper—I said "Then you want a <hi rend="italic">fac simile</hi>"—he did not seem to understand the term, and I said "You want it engraved exactly as it is here"—he said "Yes"—he laid down before me this little piece with the figure ten on it, and this small piece with the letter X on it—I saw at once they were cut from a bank-note.

I am not so deaf as my master—I heard what passed between him and the prisoner—when I went in I saw the prisoner there with Mr. Murray, and he was giving Mr. Murray an order to engrave these three portions of a note—they were to be engraved on one plate, and they were pasted in the way he told us we were to put them on the plate and do them exactly as they were there, not alter them in the least respect—Mr. Murray asked him who he was doing it for, and he said he was doing it for his brother in Hungaria, who had a great deal to do in that way, and if we did that nicely and gave him satisfaction he would bring us some more work to do—he left, promising to come next morning—he came again next day about 5 o'clock—I was there, and Mr. Murray also—the prisoner brought some more pieces of paper and said he wished to have them engraved—Mr. Murray said he would do it for him—the prisoner then asked him what would be the cost of it—Mr. Murray said he could not tell him exactly, he thought it would be about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner said he thought that was a great deal, but Mr. Murray told him he</p>

               <p>could not do it for less, and the prisoner agreed to give him that price for it—this is the plate he brought on that occasion, also this piece of paper with the number "10" and the Roman figure "X"—Mr. Murray asked him what they belonged to, and he said he would give further directions, he would let that be for the present—he stayed about two hours on that occasion—it was some time before we could understand him—Mr. Murray said he would go on with the first part and let the other bide for the present—he left, promising to call the next evening—he came again the next day and brought this steel-plate and this piece of paper with the Arms of Austria on it—he asked Mr. Murray whether he would be able to engrave that—Mr. Murray said he would, and the prisoner told him to do so—Mr. Murray asked him what it belonged to, whether it belonged to the first part—the prisoner said "No "at first, but Mr. Murray asked him again and he said "Yes "it did—Mr. Murray took up the pieces and put them together and asked whether they all belonged to one note, and the prisoner said it did—Mr. Murray said "Am I to engrave it altogether? and the prisoner said he was to do so—he took this plate out of his pocket in the course of the conversation—he said he had had it engraved, but it would not do; it was not like the pieces he gave us—he pointed out that the—scroll work was not carved in a proper manner quite as it was on the piece he gave us to copy from—and he asked us whether we could alter" the plate—Mr. Murray told him he could not do that, and then he asked Mr. Murray to engrave a new plate and he agreed to do so, and the prisoner pointed out very particularly that Mr. Murray was not to make the same blunders in the new plate as there were in that—he went away then—this is the plate that Mr. Murrav began upon—there is no engraving on it, but there is some drawing which was to be engraved—the prisoner asked Mr. Murray on the Wednesday after he had given the further instructions for the engraving of the plate, whether he could print ten or twenty thousand impressions from the plate—Mr. Murray remarked that that was a very large number, and what was he going to do with them—he said he should be able to make one or two thousand pounds by the transaction, and if we executed plates as he wished it to be done, we should have half of what he made.</p>

I live at 14, Savile Row, and am a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons—I examined the defendant on 5th June, 1872, at Battersea, in the presence of Mr. Savery, Mr. Heath, Mr. Marsh, and Mr. Edgcumbe—I have heard Mr. Heath's evidence as to the back, and agree with it entirely, that it is the result of cupping and blistering, and that the malformation'had existed for many years—it certainly could not have been the result of the railway accident—the whole upper portion of the spine was curved uniformly backwards, and the ribs projected unnaturally, there was undue rigidity of the muscles—all those facts are perfectly con<lb/>sistent with the projection being one of very long standing, and not consist<lb/>ent with any recent accident—I examined him again on the 5th June, 1873, with the other gentlemen—I agree with what Mr. Heath has said with regard to the bladder, and so on—he was described as suffering from incontinence of urine, the result of a paralytic condition of the bladder—and as I never saw such a case in a man who was walking about, I desired to examine it by passing a catheter, but that was refused—the external appearance of the parts was perfectly natural and healthy—if there had been that kind of incontinence that he alleged, the appearances would not have been the same—Dr. Edgcumbe advised him not to allow my examina<lb/>tion, simply because he had passed a catheter before, and he had not found any stricture, and it would be rather doubting his statement, and also it might give him pain—it does give pain—he passed water twice in my pre<lb/>sence, twice, about one oz. and a quarter each time—if his bladder had been paralyzed and empty that would have been utterly impossible—it required expulsive power.</p>

I reside at 24, Brunswick Square, and am a Doctor of Medicine—when the prisoner was last examined by all the doctors he passed water with the greatest difficulty—I have several times tested his water, and thought it very unhealthy—I did not observe the bedclothes wet, but I heard about it—I have noticed an unpeasant odour about his clothes, and in consequence recommended him to wear a urinal—I found, on examination, the urethraquite free from disease—I introduced the catheter twice—there was partial paralysis of the bladder—I did not see him until six weeks after the alleged accident, and he complained of inability to</p>

               <p>control the functions of the bladder—I believed that arose from the acci<lb/>dent, otherwise I should not have continued to attend him—I have no doubt the inflammation of the back was the result of the accident, but with regard to the swelling underneath the inflammation, my opinion was un<lb/>questionably influenced by the statement of the prisoner and his wife—the accident might have caused it—loss <hi rend="italic">of</hi> power of controlling the functions of the bladder unquestionably indicates mischief to the spine—there was a slight curvature of the spine, but it was of a lateral nature—the prisoner had a serious relapse the beginning of this year, the only new feature being a severe inflammation about the bone—I could not connect this with the accident, but the state <hi rend="italic">of</hi> health in which he was might have induced a recurrence of any tendency to inflammation about the bone—I did not see any affection of the bone soon after I was called in—if he had another relapse it might be more severe than the former one—he requested another physician should be called in, and Doctor Kellett was called in—I called on him at all times and without notice, and always found him in bed<lb/>that is to say within a week or two of his going to the sea-side—the last time I called on him, I' think, was on the 27th or 28th of July—when he was recovering I occasionally found him out of bed, but I always saw him in his room—I understood he had been confined to his bed six weeks before I was called in—I never saw anything about him to lead me to suspect that he indulged in drinking—very likely I should have dis<lb/>covered it if he had—in conjunction with the other doctors I leeched, cupped, and blistered him, and he said the treatment was always accom<lb/>panied with relief—I made a joint report with Dr. Marsh—I recollect attending while he was at Harwich—he complained then very much of his water, but I did not test it—on the 3rd of May, 1872, I met Dr. Cooper, Dr. Marsh, and Mr. Webb—after I had described his symptoms and my treatment, Dr. Cooper said he thoroughly endorsed all I had done—it was ultimately proposed by Dr. Cooper and myself that the matter should be settled by an arbitrator, subject to the approbation of Mr. Webb, his solicitor—several months passed away without the negotiations for an arbitration coming to anything—I recollect meeting Dr. Cooper on the platform at Paddington, and having our usual friendly conversation—I said I was surprised to find that the Company had put in a plea that the prisoner was not in the train, and Dr. Cooper laughed in a good natured way and said "You know we do not admit anything, we dispute every<lb/>thing;" and then he laughingly said "He was in the train sure enough"—of course Dr. Cooper did not speak from his own knowledge—I happened to mention that circumstance to the prisoner, and hence it is that I am obliged to reveal it now, though it was said to me as one gentleman speaking to another—I find, upon looking at my notes, it was about nine weeks he was confined to his bed in Mawbey Street—during the trial at Westminster there was an accident in Court, some of the ceiling falling down, and the prisoner swooned and had to be taken out and laid upon the floor of Westminster Hall, and have stimulants and water thrown <hi rend="italic">over</hi> him—he certainly looked during his examination very ill—I cannot speak to the fact of his head being affected during the time he was under exami<lb/>nation, but he complained to me of his memory being affected—I cannot say whether he was in Court during any of the time <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the Company's witnesses being examined, but I think it was whilst they were being examined that the glass fell down, at any rate it was at the commencement</p>

               <p>of the Company's defence—I was prosecuted in this case for conspiracy, and the charge was withdrawn—during the visit of the doctors the first time my impression was that he could not move his legs freely, but he could to some extent, which is very common in these cases of paralysis not being complete—it was more of an impending paralysis than actual paralysis, as I have stated in my report—I saw his child down at Harwich, in a perambulator—the first time I went to Harwich, the prisoner was not in—the child is a healthy child, and a healthy child is certainly <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi> evidence of healthy parents.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. M. WILLIAMS</hi>. From the first time I saw him up to the trial I implicitly believed the statements he made to me, as to his symptoms and as to the injuries he had received—if I had known there had been a lump before the alleged accident, I should have modified my report considerably—I did not know he had tumbled down the area steps the night before, but I have heard a good deal about it since—he did not mention to me at any time that he had suffered from inflammation of the bladder—I introduced the catheter to ascertain the condition of his urethra—he did not mention to me at any time that he had been attended by Dr. Evans—I heard him say that he had had rheumatism several years before—upon my second visit to Harwich I should think I talked to him fifteen or twenty minutes, but I did not upon that occasion make any medical examination—I entirely relied upon what he told me of his symp<lb/>toms, and upon that I formed my opinion.</p>

When I first went to see the prisoner I was by myself, and I was refused admittance—I did not say that the Company wanted to settle the case, and that the case was at the Company's fingers'-ends, nor any words to that effect—I did not say I should go back with a fool's errand—I said I had: come to report upon the case for the Company, and I thought it would be bringing me a long way for nothing, to send me back again and have to do the journey again—I was told the reason of my being refused admittance was, that the prisoner had been told not to see me unless his medical man was present—I do not remember saying to Dr. Edgcumbe "I endorse your opinion"—I do not recollect stating to Dr. Edgcumbe what Dr. Edgcumbe has stated I did—I did not express any opinion that he was in the train, because I knew it was doubtful at the time—Dr. Edgcumbe called upon me on several occasions about the matter, and my opinion was, it being a medical question, it would be much better that it should be tried before medical men—I should have agreed to an arbitration if I knew he was not in the train; that is to say, I should have been willing to leave the whole question to arbitration—I named an umpire, Mr. Sedgwick Saunders.</p>

I examined the defendant on the second occasion, in June of this year, in conjunction with Mr. Bar<lb/>nard Holt, Mr. Savery, and Mr. Heath—I did not believe that the lump on his back could by possibility have been produced by the acci<lb/>dent—I believe the apparent loss of power in the limbs and tendency of the spine to be grossly exaggerated by the patient, and in my opinion the cause <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the apparent soreness or inflammation on the exterior <hi rend="italic">of the</hi> hump or lump, was produced by the irritation ensuing from the treatment he had received, that treatment consisting of rubbing stimulating lotions, in cupping, blistering, and soon—I did not find that he could move his legs actively</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that there was no evidence to support the indictment. Firstly, with regard to the Counts for false pretences, it was necessary that a false pretence should have some effect on the mind of the person to whom it was made, otherwise it was how offence: that although the defendant wrote to tlie prosecutrix, saying</hi>, "<hi rend="italic">The three shares were offered to me in vne lot, and I thought myself fortunate in securing them for you, and I have no doubt you will ratify what I have done, "that did not appear to have had any effect upon her mind to induce her to part with her money, because she said</hi> "<hi rend="italic">The reason I sent the extra money was because I believed he had purchased three Bonds instead of two, and I was satisfied if he thought it was for my advantage;" therefore the false pretence was not sustained in any one particular. Second y; the indictment was framed under</hi> 24 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 25 <hi rend="italic">Vic., c.</hi> 96, <hi rend="italic">sec.</hi> 75, <hi rend="italic">which enacted that</hi> "<hi rend="italic">Whoever is entrusted as a broker, or attorney, or other agent, with a direction in writing to apply, pay, or deliver such security, or the proceeds, or part of the proceeds, due, and shall, in violation of good faith, and contrary to the terms of such direction, convert the same to his own use and benefit, Sec, shall be guilty of a misdemeanour?' The "direction in writing" must specify the use that the defendant was to put the money to, and this the prosecutrix's letter did not do, her cheque was drawn to Mr. Y. Christian, or order, and if there was any direction at all, it was to pay himself for the shares purchased by him; and there was a further argument with respect to the cheque for 2891., which did not represent any particular transaction, but was only drawn to balance the account between the prosecutrix and the defendant.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">contended that as the defendant's letter stated that he had been offered three Bonds in one lot, and that persons had refused to sell him two, both which statements were untrue, both those were false pretences; and that, as to the cheque for 2891., that was to be added to Use balance in the defendant's hands to liquidate his claims upon the prosecutrix, and that the defendant had not applied that cheque to liquidate his claims upon her, because he had not delivered the Bonds to her which she intended the cheque to pay for, and that as a proof that he was acting as the prosecutrix's agent, he stated that the Bonds were for a widow lady, although no name was mentioned.</hi>

I am a shoemaker, at 37, Mitre Street, Aldgate—I have a workshop on tne ground floor—on the 9th of this month, I was working there; about 5 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came and spoke to me in a most familiar way as if he had known me all his days—he said "Shopmate, how are you?"—he was an entire stranger to me—he said "How is business?—I looked about as I rather suspected the man—perhaps I told him how I was off for work—"Have you got a job?" said he—"Not more than I can do myself," and I turned to take a little article off a shelf when I immediately missed the shoes and the prisoner, too—the shoes were at the doorway, hanging near where the prisoner was—I called out to him to stop—he was running away—I ran after him and overtook him at Smith's Buildings, and saw the shoes lying close to the pavement—when I got there I found them in the hands of George Howell, a carman, who stopped him—the prisoner said nothing, but he tried to trip the police and the man that took hold of him—I charged him with stealing the shoes, he said nothing.</p>

I knew him long before Major Fitagerald"—I thought it was a very extraordinary statement for a customer to make, and I have not mentioned it to anyone till now—one day I saw her, and she gave her orders very distinctly, and a day or two afterwards she said "Keally I don't know what it was I said to you, for my head has been so turned from the effects of the return of that Indian fever, that I don't know what I said to you."</p>

                  </hi>, M. D. I live at Marlborough, and am one of the medical gentlemen at Marlborough College—I first became acquainted with Mrs. Fitzgerald about the 14th, 15th, or 16th March, 1870—at that time her two half brothers were students at the College—the younger one, Herbert Steele, was lying dangerously ill of scarlet fever—he brought it to the school, and she came for the purpose of nursing him—I saw her the day of her arrival, she looked so ill that I asked if she was well—she said she had come home from India to recruit, after suffering the most severe attack of Indian fever—she said she had constant headaches on the least exertion, and could not attend very well to things, and was apt to be somewhat confused and muddled—the elder boy was taken ill soon after her arrival at Marlborough, and she was constantly attending the two boys, especially the elder, of whom she was most intensely fond—she was most unremitting in her attentions to him, but he was not ill when she arrived—he sickened soon after her arrival, and then her sorrow and grief was increased to such a degree that I thought she would be ill—the elder boy died after four days' illness—she was then in such a state, that I thought she was on the verge of a very severe illness, but she kept up to nurse the younger boy, who survived his elder brother nearly a fortnight—the younger one died on 14th April, the elder on 22nd March—she sat up with the younger boy, and I frequently sat up with her, and I saw her both by day and night, and her state was then such as I have had to designate erectomania, which is a mental disease, analogous with pyromania and kleptomania, that means the concentration of all the powers upon one object—it may be an object of great esteem, great love, but that taking</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187310270069"/>
               <p>possession of the mind is as much a mental disease as kleptomania or pyromania, and other manias which I do not choose to mention—she went to the funeral, and afterwards on going to the inn where she was staying, she was found lying on the hearthrug, senseless, without a fire—she was got on to a sofa, and eveutually got to bed—I was sent for afterwards, and found her in a state of absolute prostration and delirium—I did not think at the first sight of her that she was actually in danger, because then the delirium under which she laboured had more the character of the delirium of mania than the delirium of disease: the delirium of mania is not a necessary fatal affection, but the delirium of disease is generally indicative of such a failing in the powers of life, that the prolongation of life is decreased—I continued to attend her from that time until 16th April—I was afraid she had disease of the brain; two things were open, one that she might lose her life, and the other her reason—I may explain that the delirium and the disease are two different things, but what struck me then was, that she might be suffering from a latent disease of the brain—she was delirious, as far as I can remember, four or five days, but on or about the third day of her delirium, most intense diphtheria set in; she could not swallow, and her neck was swollen—as she was getting a little better, she was so prostrate she could not get up, and her state of mind was most unsatisfactory; imagining that she was holding conversation with Charley, who was the eldest boy—on 16th April, she went to her brother at Weymouth—I had her under my direct eye for about a month, and the whole of these horrible events occurred within that space of time—when she left she still exhibited symptoms of that erectomania.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The shape which the delirium took Mrs. Fitzgerald led me to the conclusion that she had latent disease of the brain—one particular thing was the state of her pulse and the symptoms generally, and the knowledge that this Indian fever does affect the brain, because that is a well-known fact—I know Dr. Tuke very well by name—if there is any branch of human disease upon which it is more difficult to form an opinion, without doubt it is with reference to this disease of the mind—I did not see anything that led me to believe she was a kleptomaniac, but I know that persons in her state have become so—she sat up a good many nights with the two boys—she did not have an attack of scarlet fever—scarlet fever does not begin with delirium; Mrs. Fitzgerald's attacks did—my impression is that it was symptomatic of mental disease, aggravated by tremendous worry.</p>

I am a tailor, and live at 103, High Street, Kingsland—on Friday, the 19th instant, about 10. 40, I shut up the house before going to bed—the cloth and other articles were all safe then—I was aroused about 4. 45 in the morning, and on going down stairs I found the house had been broken into, and I missed 170 yards of cloth and other articles, to the value of nearly 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there had been a ladder in the next garden the night before, and in the morning that ladder was in the area, pushed up against the back-parlour window; that window was shut the night before, but I don't know whether it was fastened—I found it closed in the morning, but that was the way the thieves had got in—the parlour was all in confusion—I sent for the police—these two pieces of cloth produced are mine, I can speak positively to them, and they were safe overnight—two waistcoats, a writing-desk, a jacket, and other things were found in my garden—this pair of trousers produced by Briden are mine—I had worn them two or three times, the buttons have my name upon them—this waistcoat had only been brought home on the Friday, and had not been sent home; the binding has been chipped and a few other things done to it to make it appear old, but I am quite sure of it.</p>

About 9.30 on Saturday 27th I went to the prisoner Green's house, with detectives Briden and Smith—I told him that I had received information that he had been buying stolen property—he said "No, nothing of the kind, you are quite at liberty to look over my place if you like"—I searched the place—I found this piece of 4 yards of cloth in this green bag—he said he had bought it to make himself a suit of clothes, and he had had it some time—I also found a seal<lb/>skin waistcoat, two or three other pieces of cloth, three leathern leggings, and other things—the clock was up stairs in a cupboard, on the top shelf-Green said he had had it four or five years; it was an old relic belonging to his father-in-law, who had been dead some time, and he begged me not to take it away—it has since been identified—I took Green into custody.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the Prisoner</hi>). I was carman to Messrs. Harris &amp; Son, soap manufacturers, of 5, Gloucester Street, Curtain Road, for six or seven years—the prisoner Yeatts was in the soap cutting-room—it was part of my duty to go out with the cart to deliver soap—the cart has two black horses, and Harris's name is on it—I took with me invoices and a list of the places I was to call at and the quantity I was to deliver—on a Tuesday I took a load of soap from Harris &amp; Son's—I was to deliver two tons and a half—it is usual to deliver an extra quantity, 3 lbs. to every 5 cwt—there were nine boxes and one orange case—I went with that load to Pears', at Isleworth, and left a portion of the soap there, with the invoice—I did not go in, and do not know whether it was weighed there—I delivered the nine boxes, and kept back the orange case, which contained 1 cwt., or 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2 cwt.—that was after dinner—I had called at the Red Cow as I went down, but saw no one in particular—I called there again as I went back—I <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> into the yard aft usual, and went and had my tea, and saw the two ostlers, Smith and Frogley—(Yeatts was with me, he had joined me in Piccadilly in the morning, and went with me to Pears &amp; Ca)—I told Smith what I had got, and asked him whether he would buy it—Frogley was then outside—I believe Smith wanted to know how I got it, whether it was stolen—I believe I said no, it was some I had got returned—after a deal of talking, he said that he would buy it of me—it was some time before we could agree about the price; he did not know and I did not know, and last of all we agreed for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a bar, and I took it out of the van and took it into a shed on the right side of the yard—Smith was present and I believe Frogley, too—I cannot say how many bars there were, but there were from thirty to thirty-eight to a cwt—Smith paid me the money—Yeatts was then inside the public-house—I delivered all I had kept back from Pears &amp; Co.'s, and then went home—on the next Tuesday, 2nd September, I had another load of 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2 tons to deliver at Pears &amp; Co. 's,—there were nine cases and two orange cases—I kept back half or three-quarters of a that of that, stopped At the Red Cow both ways, and saw Smith and Frogley—I told them I had got some more soap, and they said that they did not know what to do with it, but just before I came away they said that they would at the same price—both others took it out of the cart, and I believe Smith paid the money that day, but I won't swear it—the soap was put into the same shed—both these deliveries were primrose soap—on 16th September had 3 cwt. of skin soap to deliver at Golden Square—I don't know whether I had the ordinary excess—I kept back four bars of red soap, took it to the Red Cow at Hammersmith, and sold it to Smith—he gave me the</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business with my father as soap manufacturers, at 5, Gloucester Street, Curtain Road—Yeatts has been in our service three years, and as weigher about twelve months—Spalding was our carman—we received information, and took certain precautions—it was Yeatts's duty to weigh the soap which was sent out, and to see it delivered into the van for the carman to take out—he weighed from this book (produced), and the next morning, when the van was loaded, he ought to check the lot with Burgess, the foreman—the carman also had a list handed to him of the customers he was to go to—Yeatts was responsible for the correctness of the weights—on 26th August Burgess made a communication to me in reference to Yeatts's absence from work; Yeatts should have weighed the day before for Spalding to deliver on the 26th—there should have been an addition of, 30 lbs. to the two tons and a half; it is our custom to allow that when a large order is given—we called in the assistance of detective officers, and on September 2nd a second parcel of soap was sent to Messrs. Pears—another communication was made to me about that lot, and on 18th September, in consequence of something the police told me, I called Yeatts into the counting-house, and had a conversation with him—he made a communication to me—Spalding had been called in first, and he also made a communication—in consequence of what they said they were given in custody, and I went with a detective to the Red Cow, Hammersmith, and saw Smith and Frogley down the yard, both standing together—Alday told them they were both charged with receiving soap from a carman, who was in custody, and that he should take them in custody on that charge—they said that they knew nothing about it, and offered to allow the police to search their premises—one of them produced the key of the coach-house, on the right side of the door, and said that that was in their occupation, and that the rest and the stable was in the occupation of Lucas Brothers—the detective told them who I was—Alday said that he had seen the van and a pair of black horses drive into the yard—the police searched the coach-house and one side of the yard, and found nothing—they did not</p>

               <p>interfere with the other side of the yard at that time—Frogley and Smith were then taken in custody—we afterwards went to Smith's house at Hammersmith; his wife is a laundress, and I noticed that the place was used as a laundry, there was a tub there with some clothes in it—a portion of a bar of soap was discovered before I was admitted to the house; we make similar soap to that, but I do not think we had supplied any of it to Messrs. Pears—it was not the kind of soap used for washing clothes—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a portion of it—it is not the kind of soap I should expect to find in the house of people in that class of life; it is the best curd, which is expensive—we should expect to find mottled soap in a laundress's possession, in fact there was a small piece, wet, lying by the tub, which Mrs. Smith had been using—on leaving there we went to Frogley's mother's house—she keeps a laundry, and a number of women were there—I did not go inside the house, only inside the door—I went from there to Hayden's shop; it is a small chandler's or general shop, at the bottom of the garden of the Red Cow—some bars of the best yellow soap were in the window; the best primrose soap, very fine, and the same kind which we had been supplying to Messrs. Pears &amp; Co. just before, and the same character and class of soap which we were searching for—I went into the shop and asked Hayden to let me look at the soap; he took a bar from the window, looked at it, showed it to me, and asked me if it was good soap—I said "Very good"—presently we got it all out of the window, and he said "Is that your soapf—I said "It looks very much like it," and asked him if that was all he had got—he said "Yes"—the detective pointed to a bar on a shelf behind Hayden, and asked him to let him look at that; he did so, and it had our stamp on it—he was asked if he had any invoice—he said "No"—I said "Where did you purchase it?"—he said "Of a man at the Red Oow," and that he gave 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a bar for it two or three days previously—he was asked again if he had any more—he said "No"—I asked him if he had any mottled soap—he said "No"—I said "It is a very strange thing for you, in the very midst of London, to have no mottled soap, only primrose soap"—he said that he had out the last mottled soap that day—the detectives searched the place, and found four bars of red soap, which we call skin soap, under the counter—twenty-two bars of yellow were found in the window; the whole of that found in the window was unstamped; there was no red soap in the window—the skin soap was not stamped, but I identified that because very few makers make it—I identify a portion of a boil of soap which we only cut up on 15th September, the Monday previous, and sent out on the 16th—the soap found under the counter he said he bought of an elderly man two or three days previously; he did not say where—the primrose soap weighs about 3 lbs. per bar, and is worth a fraction under 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a bar wholesale, and the skin soap 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a bar.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer S</hi>). On 2nd September, in consequence of a comunication Messrs. Harris made to me, I watched the cart driven by spalding, as he was leaving the premises—he went to the Red Cow, Hammersmith; I saw Frogley and Smith outside there—I followed the van to Isleworth, and saw it go into the yard—I afterwards saw Spalding come out, and on his way back he called at Mr. Ray's, at Brentford—he then went to the Red Cow again, drove into the yard and stopped on the left hand side—it is the next building to the Red Cow, there is stabling there, and a trough outside for horses—he stopped there some time—the other prisoners were outside—I saw spalding come out at 5.45—he spoke to Smith and Frogley outside, and Frogley went into the house and came out directly—Spalding soon afterwards drove away with the van, which had been in the yard, I should think, two hours—a man named Payne was with me, not a constable—I did not see Yeatts that day—I followed the van home—the yard gates were open—on the 16th I went to the Red Cow, and saw Frogley standing outside—Payne ran across to me, I sent him back—I walked some little distance up the road—Payne came up to me and was about to communicate with me when Frogley came up; Payne went across the road and bought a penny loaf—I told Payne to go back; Forgley then came and looked me in the face and went back to where Payne was, and Payne came back and made a communication to me—I also saw Smith outside the house—I went round the back way and met Detective West, and saw Frogely drove away—I said that we were two police officers, and I did not wish then to criminate themselves in any way—I then asked them if they had bought any soap of Mr. Harris's carman—they said "No"—I said "The carman and Henry Spalding are in custody, did not you purchase and receive some soap of them on the 2nd instant, from a van with two black horses, which backed up against the gates of the coach-house? "—they denied all knowledge of it and said "We have so many vans call here in the course of the day that we cannot remember"—Smith said to Frogley "<hi rend="italic">Jack, open the gates</hi>"—Frogley undid the door with a key, and we went in and searched the coach-house, but found nothing relating to the charge—I asked Smith if that was all the stable they had—he said "Yes, that one on the other side belongs to Mr. Lucas, the railway contractor"—I took them in custody, and afterwards went to Smith's house, his wife was ironing, and I saw some wash tubs in the rear of the house—Smith gave me the address at Hammersmith Station—I searched the house and found this piece of curd soap in a cupboard in the parlour—no washing was going on, but she takes in washing I believe, I saw an enormous lot of things hanging on a line—Frogley gave me his address at the station—I went</p>

               <p>there, there was a deal of laundry going on, five women were washing—I searched and found about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2lb. of mottled soap—Hay den's shop is just at the rear of the Red Cow, in Church Lane—I went there and saw a quantity of soap in the window—I asked for it, twenty bars were taken from the window and the prosecutor identified it—I asked Hayden how he accounted for them—he hesitated some time and then said that he purchased it of the ostlers at the Rod Cow, a fortnight or three weeks ago, and the bar with the prosecutor's name on it at the same time—he said that he offered 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a bar, then 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and gave 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked if he had more—he said "No"—I took him in custody and searched his place, but found nothing—after he had for the second time denied having any more soap in the house, I saw West find four bars more under the counter—on the way from Hammersmith Station to Old Street Station he Said "Did not I say I gave 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a bar for the soap?"—I said "You, did"—he said "I gave 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4 for it"—I asked him if he had any receipts or invoices—he said "No."</p>

I am porter to Mrs. Watkins—two baskets of goods and an invoice were given to me by Miss Hindley to take to 61, Old Broad Street—I went and found a refreshment bar there—it was about 2.30 or 2. 40 in the afternoon—I saw a girl about fourteen—I waited about half an hour, and the prisoner came in, she said "Are you the young man who has brought the goods?—I said "Yes I am"—she took the goods out of the basket and handed them to her daughter, who took them up stairs—I handed the prisoner the invoice, and said I had orders to receive the money or take the goods back—she said "I see there is a receipt stamp on the bill, but it is not receipted"—I said "No, I will receipt the bill when You have paid me the money"—she said "I think you had better take the invoice back, and bring it again in half an hour, and also some boxes that were ordered"—I said "You will excuse me, but my orders were to receive the money or take the goods back"—she then said "You had better wait till my husband comes in"—I waited about 20 minutes or half an hour when rather a tall fair man came in and spoke to the prisoner, and then he said to me "Oh, young man, you don't seem inclined to leave the goods, it will be all right, I will go and get a cheque, and send it on in half an hour"—I said I had orders not to leave the goods without the money, therefore I would rather wait there for the cheque or the money—he said "Well, if you don't seem inclined to leave, I will go and get a cheque and bring it on here in half an hour"—he went away—it was then about 4. 40 or nearly 5 o'clock—the prisoner was still there, I waited till about 7 o'clock, but the man did not come back—I said to the prisoner several times "The gentleman does not seem to come with the cheque, I would rather take the goods back, and bring them in the morning"—she said "I thought my husband would have been back before this; you had better wait a little longer"—I waited about ten minutes, and then I said "I see the money is not forthcoming; I am determined to have the goods and bring them in the morning"—she said "You can't do that,</p>

               <p>for I have sent them on to my house at Walthamstow"—I said "What right have you to send the goods away while I am waiting here for the money? how have they gone?"—she said that was best known to herself—I said I had better wait a few minutes longer, and she said "I shall turn the light out, and go and see if he has got the cheque"—the light was turned out, and I was left in darkness, and I left, thinking I should be locked up in the place all night—I did not consent to part with the goods at all—the same evening I went with Mrs. Watkins to the Shoreditch Low Level Station, and saw the prisoner with the same man who said he would go and get the cheque—Mrs. Watkins demanded the money or her goods back—the prisoner said "It is a fine thing to be put down as a thief on the platform; give me into custody"—I caught hold of the parcel that the man had who was with her—he wanted to know what right I had to do that—I said "I want to know whether this is a part of the goods"—he tore the paper, and I believe it contained two or three old dresses, not any of our goods—he said "Are you satisfied?"—I said "I am quite satisfied they are not our goods, and therefore I can't detain them"—and they descended the stairs hastily, and were gone—I attended before the Magistrate next day, Friday—the goods were afterwards shown to me at Guildhall on the first examination, except one mantle, which I saw on the second examination.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been in Mrs. Watkins's employ about six months—I generally take things out to persons when they are sent—the place I went to was one room in the basement of 61, Old Broad Street, with a chemist's shop above it—there are two staircases to the house, but they did not both come into the room where I was—Mrs. Summers was behind the bar when the tall fair man came in—Mrs. Watkins did not tell me there was a mantle ordered which had not been sent—the goods I had were 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I was to receive that or take the goods back.</p>

I am a milliner, at 3 and 4, Norton Folgate—I went to the Shoreditch Station at 11 o'clock, and before that Mrs. Summers was a stranger to me—next day, Wednesday, I went to 61, Old Broad Street—I remained there till 1 o'clock, and afterwards from 2 till 5 o'clock—it is a cellar, and the gas had been out off—five men came down for half a pint of ale during the whole time I was there, and one for a cup of tea, and I also saw rather a tall fair man—I did not see Mrs. Summers at all, nor my goods—I consulted a solicitor, and went to Guildhall, and obtained a warrant—I afterwards saw the goods, and they were given up to me by order of the Magistrate, and have since been sold.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I took a bill with me to 61, Old Broad Street—I did not present it—I put it iu my newspaper, and it was stolen, at least, I missed it after the fair man had gone—Miss Hindley put a stamp in the envelope, and the envelope and stamp disappeared—I did not miss anything else—the bill was in the envelope—I put them on the table at which I was sitting—I did not see anyone take them—I did not say anything about this at the Police Court—I told my solicitor when I saw the second bill that it must have been stolen—I missed it when the fair man had gone—I was going to demand the goods, and Miss Hindley said "Perhaps you would like a bill?" and she gave me one—I did not take anybody to carry my goods back—I will swear that I did not take the bill with the intention of giving it to Mrs. Summers, and I will swear that I don't know how it went out of my possession—I saw it before the man came in, and while he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187310270083"/>
               <p>was talking to me and telling me he would give me a cheque, and I said I must have either the goods or the money—I missed it immediately he left the room—I told him I thought he had taken it, and the next day he called to say he was not Mrs. Summers's husband at all—I saw the man open the parcel at the Shoreditch Station the day before I went to Broad Street, but there was nothing of mine—mine is principally a ready-money trade, but if we send goods home and have no reference, we always expect the money, and the porter has general orders not to leave the goods—I believe that all the goods were sent that were ordered—the order was complete.</p>

The night was quite dark, so I was not able to see anyone. I got in bed again and hearkened to see could I hear anyone a second time. I fancied I heard someone in the street. I took my revolver and fired it in the centre of the street three times, and I heard five or six men running as hard as their legs could carry them. At the same time I heard someone in the next house, and they had, I believe, some kind of chemical stuff and I felt my senses almost gone. I looked out of the window again to Bee was it the man outside, but I could not see anyone, the night was so dark. I got into bed again and put the revolver under my head for fear of anyone coming near me, and I fell asleep with the revolver under my head, for fear of being murdered. The following day I took a walk round the East India Dock, in search of employment; I left the East India Dock and came on the other side of the water; I got in company of two men as I fancied to be secretaries of the Ship Building Society, and I left them near Mr. Penn's, the engineers, as they were going forward to Woolwich. I went forward to the Victoria ship breaking yard, and after waiting there about half an hour I came in contact with this man here (Mr. Brown) I asked him the way to London Bridge, and at the same time if there was any ship building yard on the way. He turned up his nose and said 'You had better go back again to the Victoria ship building</p>

On the night of 19th April, at 11.30 p. m., I was on duty in plain clothes in Cook's Road, Kennington Park—I saw three men standing at a corner—I knew them all, the prisoner is one of them—when I first saw them he was twenty yards from the others—I kept them in sight some time—a constable came up, the prisoner then walked to the other two, and they walked in the same direction as the constable was coming from—after the constable disappeared they came back to where they first'stood, and at 12. 20 they turned into Doddington Grove—I had been in a doorway and they could not see me—I went to the corner of Doddington Grove, peeped round, and saw the prisoner on top of a wall, and the others standing at a gate which was shut and leads through the wall—I heard a whistle and the other two ran away—the prisoner jumped off the wall and tried to get away, but before he could recover himself I knocked him against the wall and broke his hat—I said "What are you doing here?"—he made no reply—I said "I shall take you in custody for loitering here for the purpose of committing a felony"—he was very violent and said "No bleeding Ham shall take me," he knew me—he struggled about twenty yards round the corner into Cook's Road—when I tried to peg him on the fence, to get better hold of him, but found it was a wooden fence, not iron—I got him against the fence, tight, and made him groan—he said "It is no use, I will go quietly with you"—I then let go his right-arm and took hold of his left sleeve to get better hold of him—I heard him grate his teeth, and at the same time he raised his right-arm up with something shining in his hand—I put up my hand to save my face, and the knife went into my knuckles—my hand bled a great deal, but I did not give way till his coat gave way, and he left it in my hand—I am sure he is the man—I had known him along time, my hand was badly cut—I went to the doctor and was off duty nearly a month.</p>
