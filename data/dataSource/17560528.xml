            . I am cooper to Mess. Cousemaker and Co. who serve the prosecutor with beer. I was starting beer in this store-cellar on the 18th of March, and found several of the butts were peg'd clandestinely, the beer was much of it gone. I started two barrels of beer into four butts, to fill them up again; the next day I went there again, and found the butts had been peg'd again afresh; I then look'd about, and found the broken place where the persons had got into the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. How much of the beer was missing?</p>
               <p>Edwards. I can't tell; but I found out of two butts there were near 18 gallons missing in two days time; which were two of the butts that I had fill'd up.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the care of the cellar?</p>
               <p>Edwards. Either Mr. Cumberledge or I always kept the key of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the place that was broke open.</p>
               <p>Edwards. On the Saturday night the 19th of March, Mr. Cumberledge and I went into the cellar together, and found a board broke up in the floor over it, and laid down in its place, but not fasten'd. I got some nails, and nail'd it down.</p>

               <p>Q. When?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I believe it was in February when the board over the cellar was broke open; I don't know exactly the time.</p>

               <p>Q. How did you get at the beer?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I tap'd one of the butts with a gimblet, and drew it off into a little brass kettle.</p>
               <p>Q. Which did you deliver it to?</p>

               <p>Q. How many times might you fill it that night?</p>

               <p>Taylor. I did, in about two or three days after.</p>

               <p>Taylor. Rivers and Dobins were then in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. How much liquor might you draw at that time?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Much about the same quantity as we did before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the board loose then?</p>
               <p>Taylor. It was, we only laid it down.</p>

               <p>Taylor. No, they did not; I went down and drew the beer, and deliver'd it to them, and they emptied it into another thing.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times might you go down?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I believe I went down six or seven times, and drew near the same quantity cach time. We had an iron pot to put it into, that would hold about five quarts.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times did you fill that in a night?</p>
               <p>Taylor. We fill'd it twice in a night.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the other three prisoners with you there at any time?</p>
               <p>Taylor. They were all of them drinking with us there at different times; and they all saw the beer deliver'd up. Burch and Yates have been down in the cellar and drawn beer themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. How often did they go down.</p>
               <p>Taylor. Yates went down twice, and Burch might go down six or seven times; they both deliver'd up beer as I had done; and after we had done, we laid the board down again in the same manner as before.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the five prisoners and you all there at one time?</p>
               <p>Taylor. No, we never were.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other of the prisoners down in the cellar?</p>
               <p>Taylor. No. Sawyer once tried to go down, but could not; but there were two pots of beer drawn that night, and he drank part of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much do you think you drank in the whole?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I think there might be a butt and a half drank and wasted in the whole.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. I was at justice Carkass's, when the evidence and all the prisoners (except Dobins ) were there, he was ill in the Infirmary at that time. They were charged with robbing the cellar of beer; they all own'd to the drinking part of the beer, and that they knew it was stolen. Taylor said then he thought there were two butts and a half drank, I said it was impossible it could be by six men in five weeks time; he said there was some wasted; after that he swore to a butt and a half.</p>

            . I am constable; I carried Dobins before the justice; he was charged with going down into the cellar, and stealing of beer; he confess'd it, and said he could not deny but that he went down into the cellar.</p>
               <p>Yates's defence. I was going down the street. Taylor call'd me and ask'd me if I would drink, he had got a full-pot of beer on a chest of drawers; so I went in and drank some, and we had three fullpots, but I knew not where it came from.</p>
               <p>Rivers's defence. I went up to my quarters and received my money, Dobins was with me. We brought some bread and cheese with us, Taylor was drunk on the bed; he said he was glad we had got some bread and cheese, for he would help us to some beer, which he did.</p>
               <p>Sawyer's defence. After Dobins was in the hospital he wanted me to go and lodge with him. I went with him, and drank part of a pot of beer. In two or three days after I went there, and drank part of a pot more with him.</p>
               <p>Burch's defence. I went into Taylor's room and enquired for Dobins; then he ask'd me to lodge with him. I went with him, he had some beer in a cupboard; he said he had had a friend with him overnight, and it was dead in the pot.</p>
               <p>Dobins's defence. I lodg'd with Taylor. Rivers and I went up to my quarters to receive my money. I found at my return Taylor drunk in bed; he said as you have got some bread and cheese, I'll take care you shall have some beer; he had beer by the bed-side, and we drank some of it.</p>

               <p>Ricciarelli. I am. I lost a pair of muslin ruffles, a gold ring set with 15 diamonds, and an amethyst ring. On missing the rings, I taxed the prisoner with taking them. He said he had them in his pocket, and took them out and delivered them to me; then charging him with taking my shirts, he owned he had taken and pawn'd them. We sent accordingly, and the pawnbroker produced them; (the rings produced in court, and deposed to.) I carried the prisoner before a magistrate, where he confessed the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the prisoner directions to pawn the shirts?</p>
               <p>Ricciarelli. No, I never order'd him to carry any thing to pawn; I once gave him two louisd'ors to change, which he did, and I had them back again.</p>

             my shepherd came and told me of it. The prisoners live about a mile from where I live; they are butchers, and live together. I mistrusting them sent for a shoulder of mutton, in order that my shepherd might see whether they had got the sheep, and enquire if either of them were gone to Uxbridge-market, in order to follow them, and see of they had carry'd the skin there to sell. He went, and did not return till he had been at Uxbridge-market, and brought the skin with him; ( produced in court, and deposed to by the mark I. S. and the trade mark produced with which it was Branded.) They both were taken up, and before the justice they both confessed stealing of the sheep out of my field between 8 and 9 o'clock, and that they carry'd it home and kill'd it.</p>

            . I missed this waistcoat; and my husband and I went to enquired at the pawnbrokers; then Mrs. Roberts, said the prisoner had pawn'd the waistcoat there, and took it out in about five minutes after. The girl's mother was sent for; she came, and brought her key; saying she had got it under lock and key; so a woman took the key; and brought it. The flat iron was pawned at Mrs. Roberts's, by the prisoner, where I found it. We took up the girl, and before justice Welch she confessed she saw ply husband go out; and went to his lodgings and took the waistcoat and flat iron away.</p>

I said I would give none: he said I was a very unkind father. He then sent for me to know what I designed to do; I said nothing at all, and hid him go about his business. Then he came and served a warrant on me; I had heard of it and had superseded it, and shew'd it to the constable.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see her do it?</p>
               <p>Richards. I can't say I saw her. I saw her hand come from my pocket; but can't say what she took out, for I did not know how much money I had in my pocket; her hand was clinch'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she take so much as a shillings from you?</p>
               <p>Richards. I know it was something above a shillings. I can swear I lost that. Then I went out and call'd the watchman, and he came. I went back with him to the door, which I found lock'd. I put my foot against it, and broke it open; there sat the 2 prisoners. I gave the watchman charge of them, he took them into custody, and they were sent to the compter. The next morning they were carried before my Lord-mayor, and I was bound over to prosecute.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they confess any thing?</p>
               <p>Richards. No, they pretended over-night that I had cut off their capuchines.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask them to go with you, or did they ask you ?</p>
               <p>Richards. I believe we were all consenting.</p>

There was a very large box which he took care to send from my country house to a house in Piccadilly. I got a warrant to search that box but it was gone then; upon which we open'd another little box of his (he was by at the time) there were 2 handkerchiefs, a towel, napkin, and other things (produced in court.) This napkin is part of a set. The towel has my mark on it U 12. There are 2 pocket handkerchiefs, which I put out of my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175605280008"/> pocket a day or a before. The leather garters are what I used to do up my boots with. The 3 brass sockets are mine. As to the candles, I do not swear to them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say at the opening of his box?</p>
               <p>Underhill. At first he said there was nothing but what was his own.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether I did not offer master the garters 3 or 4 days before, and he desired me to put them by?</p>
               <p>Underhill. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you leave Warwickshire ?</p>
               <p>Underhill. I left it at Christmas last.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not customary for your servants to have napkins to clean their plate?</p>
               <p>Underhill. Yes, proper plate cloths, but not such as these.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner trusted with your plate?</p>
               <p>Underhill. Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your ever find any of that missing ?</p>
               <p>Underhill. No, he dealt in smaller things.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he things deliver'd to him as your butler, to have in his custody?</p>
               <p>Underhill. He had.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he an opportunity to have made his escape, the day he was taken, if he had been so minded?</p>
               <p>Underhill. He had. I believe; but I suppose he did not care to go without his wages.</p>

            . I live almost facing Mrs. Alcock. I was standing at my door between seven and eight o'clock to the best of my knowledge, on the 20th of March. I saw a parcel of boys run across the way, and heard some glass break. I saw Mrs. Alcock's young man open her door, and then a man darted over the way to me; he had something white in his hand; as he ran, it drew after him, and he drop'd it in the channel. After he had got about half a dozen yards from me, he turn'd about, and walked gently by me; and when he had past me about half a score yards, there was a cry of stop thief. I said that was the man, and pointed to him, upon which they took him.</p>

I ran forwards, and saw a man take out some printed linen through the square that was broke; the handkerchiefs, that lay on the piece, drop'd in the pathway; the man ran cross the street, and I after him: and when I had got almost to him, near the channel, he drop'd the printed linen; I took it up and brought it back, and then ran back again and call'd out stop thief.

               <p>Q. What part of the shop did they lie in?</p>
               <p>Reeve. The lawn and 3 pair of stockings were at one of the windows; and the waistcoat piece, capuchine, and many stockings at the other window I lost all the stockings at that window, except one single stocking.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you miss them ?</p>
               <p>Reeve. I missed them in about 3 minutes after. I had just come into the shop, shut the door, and gone backwards. I looked, and saw the shop door open. I went in, and missed the things. About an hour after I went to justice Fielding, and told him the affair, who had some suspicion of the prisoner Cane being at the head of it, and he desired me to seek for him, and bring him before him; directing me to enquire in Chick-Lane of people that bought stolen goods, to see if I could find mine. I went but found none of mine. I had a man with me who had some knowledge of Cane, so we went in search of him, and found him at the One-Tun in George Alley. Cane went out of the tap room into a little parlour, and made his escape over a wall. I went and told justice Fielding we had seen him, and how he got from us, who order'd his men to be diligent in searching for him; and they took him and Williams in a day or two afterwards. They were brought chither, and I was sent for; but they confessed nothing and they were set at liberty. Then Cole and Roberts were suspected to be the people that rob'd me. Some time after this a man belonging to New-Prison came into my shop, and ask'd me if I had been rob'd. I said yes, and told him in what manner. Then he told me he thought if Cole could be taken he would squeak. He was soon taken and discover'd the rest, and it here to give evidence. The 2 prisoners were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175605280012"/> taken, and Cane was carried before justice St. Lawrence, who was about to admit him an evidence against Cole. The justice pointed to me, and ask'd him if he knew me. He said yes, and there he acknowledg'd he was concern'd with the other prisoner and Cole in robbing me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say of what ?</p>
               <p>Reeve. I had mention'd the goods. He said of the goods I had lost. Justice Welch wrote an order for Cane to be brought before him, after Cole was taken. I went with the messenger to Bridewell. Cane there discover'd the taking our stockings, the lawn, and other things which I had lost. He said there were 10 pair of stockings and an odd one.</p>
               <p>Q. What might these goods be worth ?</p>
               <p>Reeve. They lay me in 5 l. and upwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Williams confess any thing ?</p>
               <p>Reeve. Williams confessed at the Bear in Bow-Street, that he was concern'd in the robbery with Cane and Cole. I ask'd him the particulars, and he acknowledg'd every thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you an account of the manner in which it was done?</p>
               <p>Reeve. No, he did not.</p>

             and I, were all coming along Theobalds-Row together, and saw the prosecutor's shop without a light in it. Cane went in, and took out a capuchine, and a parcel of stockings; then Roberts and Williams went in, and took out some lawn and other things. I stood by the step of the door, and took them of them. There were 19 pair of stockings and an odd one, a capuchin, a piece of lawn, and a black piece of stuff to make a waistcoat. We carried them into George Alley, and look'd them over; then we went to Alexander the Jew, and sold them to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does he live?</p>
               <p>Cole. In Hounsditch.</p>

               <p>Cole. We sold the stockings for 18 pence per pair, the capuchine for 9 shillings, the piece of lawn for half a crown, and the waistcoat piece for half a crown. I was taken up, and the justice made me evidence, because I was the first that confessed. Cane was taken before justice St. Lawrence.</p>

               <p>Thomas Tolley. On the 5th of February, about five in the evening, I had just been selling a pair of silk stockings, and not having time to tie the rest up, I put a string about them, and laid them at the end of the counter; this was on a Thursday. We did not miss them till the Saturday following, when I went round amongst the pawnbrokers, but could not find them. I went and told justice Fielding the case, who advised me to put it in the papers, with five guineas reward, which I did. When Cane and Williams were taken up, justice Fielding sent for me. I went, but they would not own any thing of taking the stockings. I proffer'd Cane, that if he was concern'd, and would own it, I would get him to be admitted an evidence if possible, and likewise give him two guineas. He would not own any thing of it, so they were discharged. After this, Cole was taken, who directly own'd the thing, and said Cane and Roberts were concerned with him in taking them, before justice Fielding and justice Welch. Then Cane and Williams were taken up again, and I went to Cane in Tothillfields bridewell, where he told me he put several pair into his breeches, and gave the rest to his companions, which were two dozen, and that he himself took them out of my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how many pair he put into his breeches ?</p>
               <p>Tolley. No, he did not. He said he fill'd his breeches as full as he could. I missed 8 or 9 pair more than the 2 dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say from what part of the counter he took them?</p>
               <p>Tolley. He said he took them from the farther end of the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what was done with them?</p>
               <p>Tolley. He said he sold them to

               <p>Q. What were they worth?</p>
               <p>Tolley. Some cost me 15 shillings per pair out of my pocket. The cheapest cost me above 10 shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find them again?</p>
               <p>Tolley. No, I never did. I search'd the Jew's apartment and was told he was gone into the country, selling of goods.</p>

               <p>Q. What shop do you keep ?</p>
               <p>E. Wagstaff. I keep a haberdasher's shop. I missed the things mentioned in the indictment the minute they were gone out. Cane staid longer in the shop than the other did. Upon missing the goods I pursued, and Cane was taken; the other was out of fight, so got off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them take any thing?</p>
               <p>E. Wagstaff. I saw the other person (not Cane) sambling at his breeches, and I mistrusted him. Then he pull'd out his own handkerchief, and I took no other notice of him. Cole the evidence was taken up that same night. I never found the handkerchiefs again.</p>

            . I lived with Mrs. Williams at the time. On the 13th of February last I was at work behind the counter, when two men came in, a tall one and a short one. [Note, The prisoner and the evidence were such, the prisoner the tallest.] I believe the prisoner is the man that asked me to shew him some ribband. I arose up from behind the counter to shew him some. They bought none, but assoon as they were gone out of the shop I missed a piece of sattin, of about 10 yards, which when they came in lay on the counter before me. I acquainted the prosecutrix's brother of it, and what sort of men had been there, but we never heard any more of it.</p>

            . I can only say there were two such men came into the shop, to buy ribbands, on the 13th of February, and that the prisoner at the bar was one of them, for he looked earnestly at me, and I particularly observed him, and also saw the sattin on the counter a very little time before they came in, but I went out of the shop before they did.</p>

On the 21st of April I had a coat lying on a chest in the middle of my shop; and it was missing between one and two o'clock in the day. I did not see it taken; but the prisoner and that were brought into my shop. I took her before an alderman at Guildhall, and there swore to my coat. She said she took it in order to go and tell it for my wife.</p>

               <p>Maddin. No, there was not. I never saw her before to my knowledge.</p>

            . I live opposite to the prosecutor. I saw the prisoner come out at his door with a coat, but did not see her take it. Mrs. Maddin came out and ask'd her what she had been doing. She said she was going to sell the coat for her; and I heard her say before the alderman she did not intend to steal the coat, but was going to sell into a man that was gone down the lane; at another time she said some body in the shop had told her the price of the coat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I came to buy that coat for my husband, with some stockings and shirts, for he is going to Gibrakar; I had bought one before of a Jew; and I went to the door to call a friend to look at this in the light because the shop was dark.</p>

            . On the 28th of February last the prisoner came to my house, and said he had got a cow to kill, and that he would bring her on the morrow about eleven or twelve o'clock; but on the Monday morning following, between five and six o'clock, he brought this bullock (it was a black bullock with a little white on the tip of the tail, two clips under the teat on the thigh, and one upon the rump ) he desired me to kill it directly, to cleave it down, and then quarter and weigh it, for there was a great wager laid about it; he said he must make haste to Smithfield, and went away. Upon seeing no country mark upon it, I mistrusted it was not honestly come by, and went to Smithfield to enquire if any body had lost a bullock, when Mr. Ireland said he had. Mr. Jefferson went with me, and said it was the bullock he had lost. The prisoner having said he would come soon to see it weigh'd, Mr. Jefferson staid, and in about a quarter of an hour after the prisoner came. He said, have you kill'd the bullock? I said, no. He said how long will it be first? I said stay a little, and took hold of him. Then we asked him how he came by that bullock, and he said another man hired him for 1 s. 6 d. to bring it to me to be kill'd. We took him before the justice, and there he said he brought it through Islington turnpike that morning between five and six o'clock.</p>

            , being all officers, had warrants for impressing disorderly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175605280016"/> men. On the 22d of March we went into Cable-Street. We did not see any houses of ill same open till we came to the last house of that sort; I made a stop at the door, and thought I heard somebody coming from the back room to the door, and the bolt and lock drawn back. A woman open'd the door and look'd out. I put in my staff, and she scream'd out. I saw a couple of lads in the room, who got up and ran to the left hand, open'd a door, and went in there. I went after them; where I found a necessary house, and a hole that a man might get into the vault. I put my staff down, then look'd, and found the 2 prisoners. I order'd them out, and they came up. I saw something look red, and got it up. They said, it did not belong to them. Then I ask'd the people of the house if it was theirs. They said, no. I secured them in the watch house, and carried the parcel with me. The next morning came justice Fielding's men, who had got a warrant for 6 men. They desir'd me to let them see the 2 lads we had got. One of them said, these are not the men we want, but they are 2 notorious thieves; let's take out the little one (which was Shilock) and examine him. We did so, and he would not confess for a long time. He said, if you don't confess and impeach Watts, he will impeach you, for he transported his wife, and had like to have done the same by his mother a little time ago. Then the prisoner said he stole the parcel, which were handkerchiefs, in Wapping, at Execution-Dock, and that there was another parcel in the place where he was taken, which the gentlemen did not see. Then I took him before justice Pell, and told his worship what the lad had inform'd me of. The justice desir'd us to go back, and see for the other parcel. We went, and Shilock with us. He went down into the place, and brought a parcel of handkerchiefs, 10 of them blue and white. We went to the justice's with them; then Shilock confessed he had been in company with the prisoner Watts about a month, and that they had committed several robberies, and had rob'd Mrs. Griffith's shop at Execution-Dock of 14 handkerchiefs. The justice desir'd we would take him with us, to shew us the shop. When we came there Mrs. Griffith was crying. We ask'd her what she had lost; she said some handkerchiefs. Shilock confessed also at the justice's that they rob'd Mrs. Jones. We took him there by his direction, and ask'd her if she had been rob'd. Her daughter told us they had lost a great many handkerchiefs some time ago. I ask'd if they had lost any within 8 or 10 days. She said no, at first. Then Mrs. Jones was call'd down, who said she had lost some handkerchiefs out of the window, or else they were sold. The boy said they stole a piece of 8 handkerchiefs. Then the daughter said she missed them, but her mother being ill she did not tell her of them, for fear of disturbing her. Then the boy shew'd us how he drew back the window shutter, putting in a hooked stick at a hole in the window. Then we took the boy to the justice again. Mrs. Jones went with us; there was also Mrs. Griffith. Then both the prisoners confessed the 2 robberies. The confession was taken in writing, and sign'd by the 2 prisoners and the justice. It was read in court, to the following purport:</p>

            's property.) I went to his house, and ask'd for him. His wife was out. She came in, and the prisoner said he thought that the boy came honestly by them. She went and took the things out of a chest; he was in the room at the time she delivered them to me. I think he said he gave half a crown for the dessart spoons, and 8 d. and 6 d. a piece for the others.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they worth each?</p>
               <p>Brown. The dessart spoons are worth about 6 s. each, and the others about 18 d. each.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make a demand of any money?</p>
               <p>Brown. No, he did not. The boy was there at the time. He said the first thing he brought there was in order to buy a pair of buckles. The prisoner is a shoe-maker, or cobler; his wife keeps a cutler's shop, and sells buckles and sticks. The boy and he were examin'd before the justice, where the boy confessed the stealing and he the buying of the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he knew them to be stolen?</p>

               <p>Mrs. Colier. On the 9th of February the prisoner brought this silver cream pot (producing one) to my house, to pawn. I said if she would bring me another piece of plate with the same arms, if it was but a tea-spoon, she should have it again; or else I should stop it; that she said she could easily do. Then she said, don't you know me? I said, I have seen you before, but you will give me leave to stop it. It being too late in the evening, when it came into my hand, to put it into the Daily-Advertiser; I said to her, I shall put you to two shillings expence; she said she did not care if it was six. She said, do you know Mr. Jennings the sadler? I said, yes, he is a very honest man, and if he comes and says it is your's, you shall have it again. Two days after my lady Milbank advertised it. I sent word, and my lady's servant came and brought a tea pot with the same arms on it; and I deliver'd it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the prisoner again?</p>

            . I am servant to my lady Milbank. On the 9th of February this pot was taken out of our house, with four tea spoons and a pair of sugar tongs, my lady's property. There was a woman on that day came and enquired for Mrs. Green. I order'd her to go down into her room, which she did, and Mrs. Green came to her. I took but little notice of her, and can't be sure that the prisoner is the woman. When she went out, she said it is most sad weather. About an hour after the footman came, and said the things were taken away. When the prisoner was before the justice she denied being the person.</p>

               <p>Ann Green. I believe the prisoner to be the person that came to my lady Milbank's; but she is differently dressed to what she was then.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen her before?</p>
               <p>A. Green. I had, three or four times, when she came from Mrs. Brown's with messages to me; and I have seen her there. On the 9th of February, about two o'clock, I was call'd down from my lady's dressing room by the last witness to her, I verily believe. She said she came from Mrs. Brown, to measure a hoop of my lady's, which Mrs. Brown had made, saying a lady was to have one made in the same manner. I told her to go into my room. I believe the cream pot was there then, but I had not the care of it. Then I went up stairs and brought the hoop down, and she measured it; after that, she desired to see a smaller hoop; I went up again, and sent one down by my lady's chamber maid, but she returned, and said there was no woman there. In about an hour after the footman came and ask'd me if I knew where the cream pot was; then, as the woman went away without her errand, I mistrusted she had taken it; then I sent to Mrs. Brown's, and her servant came and let me know she had been discharged from her service about thirteen or fourteen months, and that she was a very idle person. The prisoner own'd before the justice, that she had seen me when she lived with Mrs. Brown.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know nothing of what is laid to my charge.</p>

               <p>Mr. Dowdesly. Before I came up to London in last December, Mr. Buckle desir'd me to obtain the purchase of a commission for his son, and to assist him in it. Accordingly I came to town, and proceeded in the purchase of a commission in my lord Albemarle's dragoons. The father return'd the money to me to purchase it, and to fit his son out. The commission was bought, and he was sent up to London. Accordingly to his father's desire, I took him a lodging in my neighbourhood at the prisoner Venables's house, as I always intended he should make my house his home. I live in Conduit street, and Venables lives in Pauling-street, near Madox-street.</p>

            . I know the prisoner at the bar. I lodge near his house, on the same side of the way, and Mrs. Venables at the time this accident happened lay with me, on account of a terrible quarrel her husband and she had the Sunday was sennight before, which was owing to a frank that she had given away. She and her husband had half a dozen each, and she gave away one of his instead of her own. On Wednesday the 21st of April she got up in the morning, and said she was going into the city to Mr. Legalee's a cork merchant, with whom her husband traded, to get an execution in favour of her against her husband. She said he beat her so often she never could live with him, and this was to secure him, and put another man in possession of the goods. She left our house about 9 in the morning, and between 7 and 8 in the evening Mr. Buckle sent Mr. Venables's eldest son to our house, for me to go and make his bed. I ask'd the child whether his father or mother were at home. He said, no; I believe it might be then about a quarter before 8. I had been washing all day, and was starching my cloaths. I sent my duty to him, and said I would come as soon as I had wash'd my hands, and went in about 4 minutes after. Mr. Buckle let me in, and I went to making his bed directly. He had pull'd of his regimentals, had put on a plain suit of cloaths, and was putting his regimentals away. When he had done, he sat down in a chair. At the same time a young man brought a pot of beer from the Black Lion, which I found he had order'd before I went in. The little boy took it of the drawer and gave it to Mr. Buckle, and he return'd the money; to the drawer never came into the room. It was set upon a mahogany table that stood by the fire, and he sat down by it. Mr. Buckle used to sup there, and ask'd me if I knew where Mrs. Venables was. I told him she acquainted us at breakfast time, that she would go to Mr. Legalee's to get the execution put in force against her husband. He said Mr. Venables had inform'd him he had an arrest or write sent him in the morning, and he said rather than he should suffer he would pay the 15 l. for him. And he also said she ask'd him to lend her some money in the morning, and he said he wou'd not without asking her husband's leave; which he did, and he bid him lend her half a crown, but he pull'd out 4 s. and gave it her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that for lodging or was it lent ?</p>
               <p>M. Main. That I can't say indeed; he said he never lent her any before. By this time I had made his bed, and he then desir'd me to drink. I refused, and said I did not chuse to drink between meals. He said he had sent for it on purpose, so I did drink two or three times. He desir'd me to sit down. I said, Mrs. Ward (where I liv'd) was very ill, and I must go home and put the children to bed, but if he wanted any thing for supper I'd come over again and do it. He ask'd me if I could come in ten minutes. I said I could not promise in just ten minutes time, but as soon as ever I had done I'd come again. He made a scruple whether I would come or not, and said, will you come again? I said, yes to be sure I will. Then he said he would consider what to have for supper. He desired me to come again two or three times, and said he would have new cheese and bread and butter and radishes. This he said in the passage, when he let me out. He had the candle in his hand at the time, and ask'd me again on the step of the door. I said, yes Sir, and went home; I believe it was about twenty minutes past eight. As soon as I went in, I saw Mrs. Venables was come back, sitting by the table with a handkerchief on her arm, with some flounders which she said she had brought from Billingsgate. She ask'd me where I had been. I said, to make Mr. Buckle's bed. She gave herself a turn, and said, she supposed I had been kissing and mousting with the captain. I gave her a look in an angry way, and ask'd her what she meant by that, and she ask'd me in a laughing way what he gave me. I told her he had sent for a pot of beer before I went in, and I had drank twice of it, and that I was to go again as soon as I could, to get him some supper. She said she would go and drink some of the beer, and do what he had to do<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175605280020"/> herself. I said I believed it was drank. She said, giving herself a fling, she would go and crack a pot with him. I said, she might go if she thought proper. She pull'd her handkerchief from her arm, and shewed me fifteen flounders, saying they cost a groat. She laid them down, and said they were for her, Mrs. Ward's and my supper, and went directly; I don't think our talk lasted above ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she bid you call her when they were ready ?</p>
               <p>M. Main. No; I put some water on the fire to boil the fish, and staid till a quarter before ten. I then went and knock'd at Mr. Venables's door, wondering at her staying so long, for she had never staid so long there before, since her husband and she had quarrel'd. I judged her husband was not at home, that she was sitting with the captain, and that he being at supper might ask her to eat and drink with him. I knock'd twice at the door, and nobody coming to answer me, I went home, took the water off the fire, and eat a bit of cold sparib for my supper. Just as the watch went eleven I went again, and knock'd at the door, when I saw a light in the dining-room, but could not tell who was there. Seeing the light move, I look'd through the key-hole, and saw Mr. Venables coming down stairs with a candle in his hand. Not expecting to see him, I had a little terror upon me, but did not go away; so he open'd the door, and spoke to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the cause of that terror you mention'd?</p>
               <p>M. Main. Because she had told me such a character of him, as a villain, blood thirsty man, and the like. He asked me what I wanted, and I told him I wanted Mrs. Venables to come to bed. He said she was not up stairs, nor in the house, by G - d; those were his words. He then asked me when I saw her. I told him she went from our house about nine in the morning, was at home again before eight, and went out about half an hour after. He then desired I would go to the Black-Lion, and ask for her. I went, and they told me she was not there, nor had been there all day. He staid at the door with a candle in his hand till I came back, which was I believe in about four minutes. He asked me if she was there. I said no, neither had she been there all that day. Then he made use of this expression, '' She is a vile good for nothing woman,'' or to that purpose; he d - 'd her, and said she had been contriving mischief against him some time, and he believed she had been that day to have the execution brought. I bid him good night, and he wish'd me the same. He then went in, and lock'd and bolted the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive any thing of his being in a passion?</p>
               <p>M. Main. He was all of a tremble; his hands and head shew'd him to be in a great passion. I went home directly after I heard the flip lock and bolt go, and sat myself down by the fire-side to wait for her, for she knew Mrs. Ward's time to go to bed was at eleven o'clock; and as near as I can guess it might then be about a quarter of an hour after, when I heard a terrible noise in the street, which I knew to be Mr. Venables's tongue. I jump'd up, ran out at the door directly, and saw him stand at his door with his wife's stays in his hands. He held them up with both hands, having hold on the two strings that come over the shoulder, and swore he had catch'd the b - h in bed with the gentleman, in the fact. I saw Mr. Buckle come down the steps from the door, with his shirt all bloody, at the time; he was only in his shirt and night-cap, and his hands were like pressing one another on the place where he was cut cross the belly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say where he found the stays?</p>
               <p>M. Main. He said he found them in the captain's room, but did not say where abouts. I knowing it was the captain, call'd to Mr. Venables and said what have you done, the captain is all over blood. He said, let him go, let him go.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the captain hear this?</p>
               <p>M. Main. I believe he did; the captain came to our door, we had a lamp there, and he made a full stop. I said, pray captain Buckle step in here; he stood still, and said, No, no, I am undone, I am a dead man. Venables kept swearing all the while at his door. The captain went about a yard and a half from our door, and turn'd himself about. I thought he was giddy, and ask'd him to come in again. Then he went into Madox-street. The next of my seeing him was about twenty yards from the corner, down on the pav'd-stones. I ran to see him, and saw what a condition he was in. There were about half a dozen people with him then. Having left our door open, I return'd back, and saw the stays were laid by a stable door that joins to our house. Mr. Venables made off, and I went and pick'd up the stays.</p>

            . I rem ember the time this unhappy accident happen'd; first of all I heard a groaning, about twenty minutes after eleven o'clock; I live in Madox-Street. I went down stairs, and had no light; there were two gentlemen on the farther side the deceased, who was sitting in his shirt very bloody, with his two hands cross each other; a gentlemen stoop'd down, and ask'd him if he had been a be; with Mr. Venables's wife, and he said no; who that gentleman was, I do not know. Then the gentleman said, who did this? he answered, Venables, Venables.</p>

            . I saw Mr. Buckle in the street, when this unhappy accident happen'd. I asked him who wounded him; he said, Venables; another gentleman said, was you in bed with his wife? he said, no, and seem'd to be sensible; this was about half an hour after eleven.</p>

            . As I was going home with a candle and lanthorn, I heard a watchman say a man was laying in the street, whether he came out of a window or no he could not tell. I ran up with my light, and saw a gentleman laying down. I staid I believe two or three minute; there were a great many people about him. I ask'd him who stab'd him; he said Venables. Somebody directly said, what was you in bed with his wife? he made no answer at all, but turn'd upon his left arm, with his face toward the sky; I thought he was dying that instant. I never heard him speak a word more. I was terrified at the sight of him, and went away directly.</p>

            . I live and lodge in a stable in the same street. I was just got into bed, and put my candle out, when I heard a man call out murder. I look'd out at the window, and saw a man in his shirt and night-cap, a little way from Mr. Venables's house. He came a little nearer, and call'd out again he was murder'd. He came up to our stable-door, and said he could not tell what to do, he was murder'd. After that Venables's came out of his house, and said he had catch'd the man in the very fact, he catch'd him in bed with his wife, bring me a candle, and insisted upon having it: his wife came in the mean time and bolted the door upon him.</p>

            . I wash for my living; being late at work between eleven and twelve o'clock that night, I heard murder call'd in the inside of Venables's house; the door was shut then. I made a stop for some trifle of time, and heard Mr. Venables say, bring me a light, bring me a light. I said you shall have no light of mine, call the watch. I saw something white, and presently the gentleman ran out in only his shirt and cap; he ran to the stable door, and turn'd about, and said he was murder'd. Soon after Venables ran over to me with his wife's stay: in his hand, and wanted the candle, I call'd out watch, murder. He insisted upon a light from another woman, she said it's not my light; a woman said, will nobody take in that gentleman, that calls, out murder with such dismal cries and groans. I went to him, seeing some gentlemen come about him; they ask'd where he came from. I said, I frequently saw him go in at Mr. Venables's with his regimentals on. I return'd, fearing my room should be strip'd, as I had left my door open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Mr. Venables say any thing about his wife and Mr. Buckle?</p>
               <p>A. Timms. I heard Mr. Venables say he was in bed with his wife.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ford. I am a surgeon, and attended Mr. Buckle. I came to him that night he died, betwixt eleven and twelve. He died of the wound he had receiv'd, about an hour after I came to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoners's defence. I had been over at the Angel. I went about seven in the evening after I had made Mr. Buckle's fire. When I went out I left my three children at home, and told them where I was going to I staid till between ten and eleven. I came home, and having a key to the door, I open'd it very gently; there is a large mat lying in the passage. I shut the door, and as I went along I thought I heard my wife's voice in the back-parlour. I was almost sure it was she. I went down stairs into the kitchen, and struck a light. I was so fluster'd when I gave my evidence before the coroner, that I said I did not go up stairs; but I did go up, I went into the dining room, shut the window shutters, and then came down stairs again.

             knock'd at the door. I open'd it, and she ask'd for Mrs. Venables. I said I knew nothing of her, she was not there. She said, I'll go and see for her. I believe I said, see at the Black-Lion. She came back and said she was not there. Then I shut the door, and stood in the passage; I then went towards the back parlour door, and thought I heard her again. I walk'd towards the street door, and open'd it, and went again to the back parlour door; I was quite convinc'd at last that I heard her, I attempted to turn the knob of the door, and found it wou'd not open. I knock'd at the door with my finger, and said, Mr. Buckle, Mr. Buckle, I want to speak with you. No, answer. I had the candlestick in my hand. I put my shoulder against the door with all the force I cou'd, and burst it open, and went immediately up to the bed, where I saw Mr. Buckle upon my wife in the bed naked (as I am to appear before God, it is truth) I pull'd out my knife and gave a blow, but I was so confused I did not know whether it was her or him that I hit, till he cried out, oh, oh. He was a worthy gentleman. I wou'd have gone through the world to have serv'd him; I always spoke well of him to every body. Somebody had wrote a scandalous letter against him to his relations; and Mr. Dowdesly's servant can tell, if he pleases, I always justified him, and said the accusations were false.</p>

            . Some body had wrote a scandalous letter to Mr. Buckle's friends, acquainting them that he kept very bad hours, and drank and lived a very bad life in town, I believe they had mention'd whoring. Mr. Venables meeting me near St. George's church, said, he was very sorry they should accuse him of those things, and said all they accused him of was false; that he could justify him himself, for that he lived soberly, and had been very regular ever since he came into his house. </p>

On the 20th of October last Mr. Tew came in at the Three Compasses; he asked me if I knew a watch-maker that wore his own hair tied behind. Mrs. Harrison said, do you not know his name? He said he did not; nor did he say what he wanted him for; then he went out. Soon after he returned again, and asked for one Baynham. We said he was not there; then he went out again. He came several times that day (that Baynham with his hair tied behind is my first cousin) Mrs. Harrison said, that man, meaning Tew, came about a rape; which she heard was mentioned at justice Cox's to have been committed at her house. I then went down to Brook's-Market to my cousin, and told him that a lawyer had came about a rape said to have been committed at the Compasses, and that it had been talk'd of at justice Cox's, and the lawyer inquired for him; he said he knew nothing of it, and that they could do nothing to him; he then came with me to the Three Compasses, and had some oisters and beer. Then Mr. Tew came in again, and said is Mr. Baynham here? yes, says I, my name is Baynham, what do you want with me? says he, you are not the person I want; he then said if I would stay a little while, he would soon put an end to it, to clear me, and save himself the trouble of coming again. Accordingly I staid: I think, but am not certain, that Raminger came with Tew; he went out, I think, and return'd; I know he brought

She pointed to me directly; after that, Raminger said I'll go and fetch the other girl; no, no, said I, you shall not go by yourself, let some body go with you; then one Watkins, a friend of mine, went with him (I can't find him now, or I would have had him here.)

Then said they let her sit down; she did, next to Broadbent, and did not speak for a great while, only looked upon one and another. (There were a great many people in the house.) I saw Hannet stoop down to buckle her shoe, and I heard words pass between her and Broadbent; she would not mention any body then, but got up on her feet; we all got out of the box, and I stood by the fire. She went to Raminger, by the cellar stairs, and there were some words past; said he, is that the man, pointion to one and another; is that the man with a pot in his hand (one had a pot in his hand) I observed Raminger and Tew were together by the cellar stairs when Hannet pointed to me.</p>

At last she came and touch'd me; then Raminger collar'd me directly, and said her was a constable, and left me in Mr. Tew's care, till such time as he got a warrant. When he came back with the warrant, he collar'd me, and took me to St. Martin's Round-house, where I lay all night, and from thence to justice Cox's; after which I took my trial here.</p>

               <p>Baynham. I believe 25 minutes.</p>

That Broadbent did not examine the other people at all, but directly pointed to him, which he believed was with directions, Mr. Tew having hold of her under each arm at the time; but did not see Mr. Tew give her any directions. That when Hannet came in, he push'd him into a box, and sat down by him. That if he had spoke when Broadbent and Hannet were whispering, Hannet would have thought Broadbent had fixed upon him; and as it would have been a direction to her, was the cause why he did not attempt to hinder it. That it was Mr. Raminger that said, let her sit down and rest herself. That there were five or six people in the room.</p>

            . I went to live servant with the prisoner the Tuesday before Whitsuntide last; and staid there something above five months. I had given warning to go away, but could not get my wages; he used me but indifferently towards the latter part of my time, for he turned me out of his house at twelve o'clock at night, two days before my month's warning was up. He said the girls had told him I had rob'd him. I wonder'd what there was that I could rob him of, he having but very little. I desired he would lock me up in any room in his house, and not turn me out at that time of night; he then repeated my robbing of him, and said he had promised the girls I should go out that night. I said I had no money; then he gave me a shilling, and I went up to the Round-house. In the morning I went to him again for my wages; then he said there was a rape committed, and began to accuse me with he knew not what, and kept me a prisoner in his own house, without a warrant. He then took out a warrant, and carried me before justice Cox.</p>

               <p>S. Clifton. Almost 3 l. I had had a shilling at a time two or three times. When I came before the justice there was a robbery laid to my charge. I was carried to St. Martin's Round-house that night. The next day he charged me with the robbery and two rapes on Broadbent and Hannet; they were both there. I said to them, I have been as good as a mother to you, consider what you are going to do; the girls said they had been out with me, the same as they swore on the trial afterwards.

             in my life; the first time I saw him was in Newgate; where Mr. Tew came to see me, and sent for me down. I said, Sir, I don't know you; he said no, I suppose not; he ask'd me to drink a glass, and said he came from Wiesenthall. I said what will you please to have with me? He then said here is a rape committed, and as you certainly are concern'd, you must find the man; said I, you may be the man for what I know, for I never knew a man that did such a thing. He said it should be the worse for me, if I did not tell who the man was. I said, if there is never a man found till I find one, you will never have the man. Then I went up stairs aga in to my apartment; and soon after a soldier (named Jones) a country-man of mine, came with a full-pot of beer, to see me; then came Mr. Tew and took him up for the man that ravish'd the girls. This was all the same day.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in Newgate then?</p>
               <p>S. Clifton. I believe I had been there about nine days. I never was out of St. Clement's-Lane, where I lived, on the 6th of July; it was Sunday, and I was ironing all that day. I remember I had a pewter dish and six plates, which we had borrowed at the White-Hart, in the lane, and I carried it home that day, and was there when the two girls came with a great nosegay, between eight and nine o'clock. I had been at Mrs. Harrison's about three times during the time I lived with the prisoner; she and I were old acquaintance in the country, and she had been at the prisoner's house, and gave the girls some money to be good, and mind their business. Broadbent once went with me to her house to borrow some china; but I never was up stairs, or knew where the stair-case was, in my life. When I went home with the girls that Sunday night from the White-Hart, my master was sitting with his right leg across his left, at the end of the table; he asked Broadbent and Hannet how they came to stay so long; they said they had brought him a nosegay, and were tired. I cut them their supper, and they went to bed; he had nine apprentices, and these were two of them. I had one of the apprentices with me, named Ann Forbes, and my master's daughter, when the others called on me coming home.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any quarrel with your master before he suspected himself to be rob'd ?</p>
               <p>S. Clifton. Yes, a great many. One was, he was poor, and wanting an usurer, he sent me out to see for one. When I returned, there were two or three Germans (his countrymen) in the kitchen; they had been playing with the girls, and had dirtied the kitchen. I said, no such things should be while I was there. My master the next morning ask'd me whether I was master, or he. My master had sent me to South-Audley-Street, to inquire after one Brailey, a woman whose character I found to be very bad; and he set me to watch if such a woman came about his house at nights. I once saw an old woman, and looked out of the window, but she was not so tall as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175605280026"/> her in South-Audley-Street. He sent me to Mr. Williams, at Mr. Cox's, to desire he would be so good as to come up and examine the girls, saying, he fear'd they were naughty girls; he bid me tell him he would not be against making him a present of a pair of ruffles. These I took to be all shams, for he had hardly any thing to be rob'd of; I went to Mr. Williams, and he seemed not to be willing to come. I said to him, I wished I was out from amongst them; he said then, why don't you go away? I said, because he owes me wages; he then said, why don't you arrest him?</p>
               <p>Q. What is a pair of Dresden ruffles worth?</p>
               <p>S. Clifton. I don't know; I sold a pair once for a woman for 14 s. Mr. Williams and another gentleman did come; at that time there was not a charge laid against me for a rape or robbery either. Mr. Williams examined the girls; and the next day it was that I was turned out of the house, and carried before justice Cox; where the two girls charged me with a rape, the same which they did in court; there I was call'd old b - ch and old b - wd, I don't know that any body missed calling me somewhat; the justice said I was a bad woman, and I was not permitted to speak for myself. When I was at the justice's, my master was there, who said he was a piece of a doctor himself, and insisted upon going up to examine the girls, and he and a woman went up. Mr. Williams said, when I was going to bridewell, it was hard for a woman to go there without money in her pocket; and my master gave me four or five shillings. Mr. Tew was there. Then Mr. Cox did insist upon my having my wages, but he never paid me till I got an order from the court; for he never intended to have paid me till after I was hang'd, I suppose. My master once had some friends on board a ship, and he and his sister went there to see them. The next morning I sent Broadbent to her master's door for a candle; she came running back again, and said, my master hath got a woman in bed with him. Then I went in, and found it was his sister, and her cloaths were lying by.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever observe any familiarity between your master and any of the girls?</p>
               <p>S. Clifton. No, I did not.</p>

He then ask'd me if I was a lawyer, I said yes; he said to the man that keeps the taphouse, I order you to keep this man, I will swear that is the man that was concern'd with Mrs. Clifton. I was detain'd there about three hours and a half, in the taphouse. He returned in about two hours, and brought a constable to take me to the Compter. Then Clifton's master (as they told me) and a little girl came; the little girl said she never saw me in her life. Then I ask'd the master if he ever saw me before; he said no. Then I was let go about my business.</p>

I was sitting at work in the shop five pair of stairs high, and heard him call Rachel. I made no answer. One of my mistresses said, your master calls you.

This little room was quite backwards, I went through a large room to it. I said, Sir, what are you going to do to me? no harm, says he, and laid me down on the bed, and got upon me, without saying any more to me, and lay with me. While he was upon me his daughter came up and knock'd at the door, and wanted money for butter. He went out to her, and half way down stairs, and gave her some money. He had lock'd me in. I tried to get out, and could not. He came again, and got upon me. This was all against my will.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever lay with you after that?</p>

He used to take up the girls petticoats, and whip their backsides sadly. I went up to my work crying, with a penny in my hand which he gave me. I shew'd it to one of my mistresses, who ask'd me what I cry'd for. I did not tell her then. Presently in came

             master had used me ill. She ask'd me how, and I told her all. I was not well after it, it hurt me very much. Soon after, as we were going down to dinner, I took them all into our bed room, and made it known to every one of them; there were nine of us. They would hardly believe it; so as we were going by the door I took two of them in, and shew'd them the bed, where master had serv'd me so. They all came in, I believe one after another. After this, master proposed to me to swear it against Clifton and another. This was on a Friday. I remember, that afternoon Mr. Williams (who is Mr. Cox's clerk) was sent for. When I came into the parlour, he ask'd me who was the man that had lain with me, for master had been and told the justice two of the girls had been lain with, and that there was also a robbery committed, and somebody had lain with me, but he could not find the man out. He had bid me say so too; I was very much afraid of him, and dared not do but as he bid me. We went the next day to Mr. Cox's, and he wanted me to swear a robbery against Clifton. After this, when we were to go about the rape, he bid me stick close to it and not say he had lain with me, but it was a tall pock-frecken man. He did not mention his hair then. I ask'd him if I must swear. He said, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you where you was to swear you was lain with?</p>
               <p>R. Hannet. No, after we had been examined before justice Cox, he talk'd to me again; he bid me six upon the Three-Compasses in Little Wild-street, because he used to borrow all his china at that house when his company came.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever been there?</p>
               <p>R. Hannet. No, but Broadbent had. After we had been at the Three-Compasses, he would talk to us both together; and he used to set

I went into one room and Broadbent into the other. At that time we agreed upon the room where there was a bed. We had seen the curtains.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body advise you to six upon that room?</p>

I sat a good while before I did. I believe he saw her pull my sleeve, because he spake about it at justice Cox's, and Mr. Raminger said it was no such thing. Mr. Raminger ask'd me if the man was in company. At first I was afraid to speak, and did not for a good while; at last I fix'd upon Baynham.</p>
               <p>Q. How was you sure that was the same man you should fix upon?</p>
               <p>R. Hannet. Because I saw him go out of the box, and go to the fire-side; after that we went to justice Cox's, but he was a bed. So we went the next day, when my master bid me stick close to it. I believe Raminger had told him what had happen'd at the Three Compasses; they used to talk German together, and my master laughed that night, and told his sister I had pitch'd upon a pick-house taylor. I had a good mind once before the justice to tell the truth, when Baynham down'd on his knees, and said you know I am not the man that lay with you; but master look'd hard at me, and

             pull'd me by the sleeve. The justice took us up stairs, and said he would do all he could, to see whether we would own it, because the man said he was innocent; he ask'd us if we were sure he was the man; we both said yes. I was at one end of the room, when he examined her at the other. We stood to it. After this my master kept us very close, he did not let us go out of his house, but when he was with us, till we came to the Old-Bailey; he told me I should go before a heap of gentlemen at the Old Bailey, and I must swear there what I had sworn before justice Cox, and at Hick's-Hall, where I swore that Baynham had committed a rape upon us, and Clinton had hold of our legs; my master ask'd me when I came out what I said, and what I swore, which was the same as that at the Old-Bailey. That morning, before we came out, he took Broadbent and me into our room, where we all lay; he first examined her, and she came even; he then examined me, but I did not come even; then he huffed us sadly, and we were afraid we were going to be kill'd; he then said for God's sake don't lay any thing to my charge, for if you do, it will bring me into trouble; and as we were walking along, he bid me not to hammer, stammer, but speak the truth, for else they would be clear'd, and we should suffer; this was as we were coming out of the Baptist-Head, near the Old-Bailey gate, just as a man had came and said our trial was coming on.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he mean by the truth?</p>
               <p>R. Hannet. That was, what we had said already; and when I came here, I swore the same I did at Hick's-Hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any remorse of conscience while the two prisoners were upon their trial for their lives ?</p>
               <p>R. Hannet. I was sadly affrighted. I thought to myself I would say what was the truth. Broadbent and I quarrel'd sadly. I wanted her to own the truth at the Baptist-Head; she said her master would kill her if she did. I said it was better for her to be kill'd than to take two innocent lives away, I'll not take their lives away; she said you had better do it, no body will know any thing of the matter. There was a midwife near us, she that search'd us along with my master at justice Cox's, who said, what is that you will not take away?

               <p>Q. What did they say to it?</p>

Not till two or three days after I had been first at justice Cox's; then it was given out that somebody had lain with me; and he bid me lay it to a pock-frecken'd tall man, and not upon him. Mr. Tew took Broadbent, and Mr. Raminger took me to the Three Compasses, first to six upon the room.</p>

               <p>Q. Had any body bid you and Broadbent six upon one of the two rooms at the Three Compasses ?</p>
               <p>R. Hannet. Master bid us say we were lain with up stairs, in a room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did justice Cox desire you by all means to speak the truth?</p>
               <p>R. Hannet. He did, over and over, and said if I swore false, I should go to the Devil.</p>
               <p>Council for Prosecution. Which was you most afraid of, your master or the Devil?</p>
               <p>R. Hannet. I fear'd my master most.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Harrison. There was a piece of evidence came out from this witness unexpectedly; do you remember this girl coming to your house with Mr. Tew and Mr. Raminger, before they were brought to find out the man that ravish'd them?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Harrison. The first time Mr. Tew and Mr. Raminger came by themselves, and told me that two girls had sworn a rape to have been committed at our house, in a room where was green furniture, and that Clifton brought them there. I said, if you bring the girls, they will find themselves mistaken in the house. So they did bring the girls a day or two after, and went up stairs into the room; but my curtains are blue. This I believe to be two or three days before they came and fix'd upon Baynham. I went to justice Cox's when Baynham was taken up. The girls there said, I was the person that brought the pot of beer up. The justice asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175605280030"/> if I could recollect where I was; then I said I was at a Chrillening that day, and I got a certificate of the child's being christen'd at that time.</p>

             and I went for some flowers to Putney, on the 6th of July; we set out before dinner, and I believe staid there till between four and five in the evening, and it was duskish when we got to Clement's-Lane.

            . We said we were very dry, and call'd for a pint of beer; we drank it, and went home together. This house was not above five or six doors from my master's house, but on the other side of the way. When we got home my master ask'd us what made us be so late. We said we staid a little later than ordinary because it rain'd; I told him we were just come from Putney.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any quarrel betwixt Clifton and your master at that time?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. I can't tell whether it was that week, or the week before that they quarrel'd; my master had been rude. I went one morning into the parlour where my master lay; there was his sister in the bed by him; I told Clifton of it, and she gave warning, and said she would not stay; then my master did not like her, and said he would do her an injury some time or another; and said he had rather see the Devil than see her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she ever hear him say so?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. I don't know whether she did, but I heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. How had your master behaved to you before this time?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. He behaved pretty well before then; but when Clifton gave warning, he persuaded us to it. Clifton said she could not bear to be in the house, because there was such rudeness done in it?</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you had been at Putney did you hear of Clifton's taking away goods?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. It was about a week after; he said that was to turn her away. We were to say that she made us steal things.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you particularly mention'd as one of the persons that was to charge Clifton ?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. Master desired me to steal them, and lay it on Clifton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, according to what your master desired, hide or take away any of these things ?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. At first he took and bid some of the things himself, behind a barrel in the beer-cellar, which was a napkin; and Hannet found it. We did not see him put it there, we only imagined he put it there himself. Neither of us had taken a pin's point from him, and I believe Clifton never did.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was it that she was turn'd out of doors?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. I believe it was on a Tuesday. She return'd the next day for her wages, and what things she had left, when he accused her of stealing his things, and making us steal his things to ruin him, and said she should be taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention any thing of a rape then ?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. I don't know that he talk'd any thing of a rape then; he took her up, and she was carried before justice Cox.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the first time after she was turn'd out of doors, that you heard of a rape being committed upon you?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. Master took me down out of the shop, and ask'd me if ever any body lay with me. I told him no.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. This was a day or two after Clifton was turn'd out of doors.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any reason why he suspected any man might have lain with you ?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. He ask'd me first; he said if there has not, then you shall lie with me to night. I said, I never was in any man's company in my life. That was to be the rape; and he would lay it to Clifton and a man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention at that time the man he intended to accuse?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. He said, I'll take up Clifton for it, and a man named Baynham.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Baynham at that time?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. No, I did not. I had never seen him with my eyes, or heard of him till master mentioned him. Then he said he'd call Rachel down, after he had done with me, and make her do the same; he put his hands down my bosom: this was in the morning. I was sent up stairs, and I believe he did call Rachel down; she went down I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing more pass that day about his intention to charge Baynham and Clifton ?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. He said he would do so, and swore to it. He ask'd me if I knew any house thereabouts. I said no, except Mr. Harrison's; then said he, that is the house, if you know no other; he said some more words, which I have forgot now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he talk with Hannet that day?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175605280031"/>E. Broadbent. No, not in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he oblige you to go to bed with him that night?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. No, Rachel was lain with first, and I remember afterwards she came up crying with a penny in her hand. I ask'd her what was the matter. She said, I'll tell you by and bye, and told us she was ruin'd for ever. Presently after my mistress went down, and she told us every thing. The night after this, because I would not lie with him, he threaten'd that I should go to Newgate for stealing things. I kneel'd down and cry'd, and said I hoped he would forgive me for what I had done. He sent his sisters and Rachel to bed after supper, about nine or ten o'clock, then took me in his lap, and said he would make me go to bed with him, and kissed me. Then he fetch'd a bed down into the two pair of stairs room, and said to the girls that lay with me, you shall not lie with her any longer, for you will make her as wicked as yourselves. He made me undress myself, and then tied a handkerchief about my mouth. I said, pray Sir don't, for you'll ruin me for ever. He said I shall not hurt you, I will do you no harm.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you call out?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. He had lock'd the door, there were three of them; this was in his own chamber. After this he took me under my arms, push'd me into bed, and lay with me most part of the night. Then he got the other bed out it is a German bed, one over another; and laid it in the fore room, where I lay till mistress came and call'd me.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this was it that he began to talk with you about the rape?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. He talk'd to me about it every day, and bid me not to forget a word, and be sure not to backen it; and he told me once that two lawyers, Mr. Tew and Mr. Raminger, were gone to seek after this man, that they were gone to the Three-Compasses in Little-Wild-Street, and if they came for me, I was to say the man was in the tap-room; and if there was a tall man named Baynham there, wearing his own hair and a blue coat, I was to take him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say John or

                  </persName>
            ?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. No, he did not say either; he told me very often to say that he was a tall thin man, pitted with the small-pox, and I must say he had his own hair on when he ravish'd me. Raminger and Tew return'd, and said they believ'd they had found him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you to go and shew them the house that the rape was supposed to be committed in?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. Yes, I did, on a Monday. He had told me any home that I knew, and I said, I knew none but the Compasses. Then he said six upon that. I shewed them the house. Hannet was not with me then.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you shew'd Raminger and Tew the Compasses, did Hannet come there ?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. No, not the first time. I shewed them the house, the entry and stairs, as I stood at the step of the door. Hannet went with me and them the second time, when I went into the fore room above stairs, and Hannet into the back room. Mrs. Harrison open'd the back room door with a key, where we saw the bed. We said that was the room, that there were green curtains to the bed and window, and that the bed was removed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever been in that room before then?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. No, never in my life. After that, I was brought by Mr. Raminger to that house, in order to fix upon somebody. I believe this was a night or two after.</p>
               <p>Q. What instructions did your master give you, or did he give you any, in order to fix upon the man?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. That day he had been out, I know not where. When he came home he call'd me into his room, and said, you are going I believe to the Three-Compasses, to take up the man that did the rape.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention the word rape?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. He said, that say with me. Said he, there is a man in a blue coat, a tall man, named Baynham, pitted with the small-pox; you are to take him up.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go thither, in order to fix upon the man?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. It was after we had left work, at 9 o'clock. When Raminger brought me in, Tew was sitting or standing by a man. I look'd round, and saw there was never a man there but he that was tail and thin, and I took him for the same man that master gave a description of.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say for himself, when you had fix 'd upon him?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. He ask'd me if ever I saw him in my life, and whether he ever lay with me. I said yes, he was the man. There were a great many people in the tap-house at the time; but I had never seen Baynham before in my life. When

             came, she look'd affrighted, trembled, and stared about. I believe Mr. Raminger brought her in. Mr. Tew and Mr. Raminger were going to take me out of the tap-room, but Baynham and all the company said, it was not fair to take the girls out. Mr. Tew was going to speak to me, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175605280032"/> stoop'd down, when they all said, let the man have fair play.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you, when he was going to speak to you?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. I was just at the tap room door. Hannet was desired to look about, and see if she knew the man. She look'd very hard about her, and came into the box where I was; and then attempted to buckle her shoe. I was by her, and gave her a pull by the sleeve of her gown, pointing with my other hand under the table to the man who sat in the box by the fire side.</p>
               <p>Q. Could she see you point?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. I can't tell that. It was a great while before she fix'd upon Baynham. She was frighted, and ran backwards and forwards; the tears were in her eyes, and they asked what was the matter. Mr. Raminger I believe was by me, and Mr. Tew and she were by the bar, when sh e fix'd upon the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after you gave her the pull before she fix'd upon the man?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. It was about a quarter of an hour after. The people would not let her and I be together, saying it was not fair; but I kept looking at the man, and looking at her. She trembled every limb of her, and cry'd. After she fix'd upon him, he was taken into custody, and carried to the watch-house; we went before justice Cox the next day, where I said he was the man that ravish'd me. In the morning before we went before the justice, my master told me not to seem to be frighted, saying, if I cried it would shew me guilty.</p>
               <p>Q. Guilty of what?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. It would shew that he was not the man; and then they will ask you, said he, and you will confess he is not, so I shall be brought into trouble. After this he never let a day pass but he bid me keep to the truth, and that if I did not stick to it he would murder me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he call the truth?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. That was, what I had said before I must stick to.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you, before you went to Hicks's hall to find the bill, what would become of this man?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. He said he believed it would hang him, but said he you shall never want, I will take care of you. After that I went before the grand jury and was sworn, where I said the same that I did afterwards in this court, that one Baynham was the person who ravish'd me, and that 
               <persName id="t17560528-45-person408">

             stood at the feet of the bed and held my legs. He gave me directions to be sure to stick to it, and to say that Clifton put us on to ruin our master. He said, I have not money to pay her her wages, and if she is not hang'd for this I'll take care to transport or murder her. I remember I was at the Baptist head, near the Old-Bailey gate, before the trial came on, and that going from thence to come to this court he said, Mind, Betty, say nothing but the truth, stand to the truth; meaning, that which we had sworn to before. He said the same to Rachel, and told me at home he would mention this to me at the Baptist-head; he said, speak the truth, and consider what you are going to do, or else you will be hang'd, looking very down. That very morning he called me down stairs, and asked me whether I could say what he had taught me, and bid me tell it over. I tried, but could not say it right; then, said he, you will cast yourself and me too.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you fail in of your lesson ?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. I said the man had a red cap on, and I was to have said a white one.</p>
               <p>Q. Was what you mention'd here at the trial the same as he bid you say?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. It was. He said, if they ask you whether or no he had a wig on, say you saw him pull off no wig, but he put on a cap over his hair or wig; tho' I have now forgot some words he told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that which you swore here true or false?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. It was all false.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Hannet say her conscience was very uneasy at coming to swear against two innocent persons?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. She did. As she was standing on the stone steps belonging to this court (the tears being in her eyes) she said, Bet, I am frighted within me for going to swear against these poor innocent persons. I said, Rachel, we can't help it, stand to it, stand to it, or else we shall be hang'd; this was before we gave our evidence.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Hannet at any time tell you her master lay with her?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. She told me and the other girls of it the very day he lay with her.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. When Clifton left the house, how long was it before you went to justice Cox's?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. It was a day or two after.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard any thing of charging her with this rape before you went to the justice's?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175605280033"/>E. Broadbent. My master told me of it, I can't tell whether he told Hannet or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him what a rape was?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. I ask'd him what he meant by lying with a man, and he said, if you don't know you shall lie with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him to explain the meaning of a rape ?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. No, I did not; but he said that lying with and debauching a person that had never been lain with before, was a rape.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after Hannet had been lain with that he was concern'd with you?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. I believe it was the night after.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did the justice speak to first, Hannet or you?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. I believe it was me; he said, Are this man and woman innocent or guilty? This was the time when Baynham was taken up, not the first time I went to the justice in order to charge Clifton with thieving.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the rape to be introduced there, as it was not the charge you went to make?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. I can't tell, I believe my master told that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know your master go to the Three Compasses?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever been up stairs there before you went with Mr. Tew?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any thing of the situation of the house ?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. I went there once with Clifton, who said she had a friend lived there; she also went thither with me for some china.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you imagine you could punish your master, if he used you ill in lying with you?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. I did not think of that then.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason could he give for a white cap more than a red one?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. I said it was a red cap, which he said was wrong, and that if I said so in court they would condemn him and me too.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mr. Tew and Mr. Raminger carried you out of the house, to go to the Three Compasses, what did they say to you?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. They asked me if I could find out the house, and I said, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any mark being left on your linen, by your master's using you ill?</p>
               <p>E. Broadbent. Yes, there were marks. I was examined by a midwife, and by my master, who when we were going up stairs told Mr. Cox he was a surgeon, and asked leave to go up with us. The midwife said, if that is not the man that is below, speak, and tell the truth. I said I had. She said I had been pressed upon by a man, and said the same by

               <p>Mr. Ford. After the trial of Baynham and Clifton, the court suspecting there was a perjury, ordered these two girls to two separate compters; the morning after I had directions from many of the magistrates to do the best of my endeavours to find it out; to which purpose I sent for the keeper of Wood-street compter, and made use of a pious fraud in order to come at the truth. I desired the keeper who had Hannet in his custody, to acquaint her that Broadbent had discovered the whole truth. I went after that to her in the compter. She fell on her knees, and said she was ready to discover the truth, and gave an account which took up about three quarters of an hour; having received that from her, I came from thence to this court, which was sitting; my Lord-mayor went into the next room, and Broadbent was sent for; as soon as she came into the room, in order that she might discover the truth, I desired

            . I am turn'd of thirteen years of age. I remember the day after Clifton was turn'd away. Hannet went down stairs, and came up again with a penny in her hand, crying sadly, and sold us what master had done to her.</p>

               <p>E. Crosier. He lay with her; and my master beat<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175605280035"/> me up and down, because I would not swear against Clifton.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you to swear?</p>
               <p>E. Crosier. To swear I thieved by her orders; and to say what they were to say upon the trial.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they to swear?</p>
               <p>E. Crosier. They told me they were to swear falsly.</p>

            . I was employ'd by Mr. Raminger to enquire into this matter. I don't know that I ever had seen the prisoner then. Mr. Raminger told me these girls had rob'd him of thread and things; and he beg'd I would be concern'd, and go to the justice about it. He said a woman had been committed upon suspicion of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Tew. I believe it was about the 15th of October. When I came there, I heard a good deal about it; I can't charge my memory to say they were brought up at that time; but some days after there was a discovery that a woman had enticed the girls to these facts, and she had committed a rape. Upon my going there, the girls Broadbent and Hannet were examined one by one, Mr. Raminger was with me; the girls told their story, and what a number of things they had been assisting in to rob their master, and in throwing them ou t at the window. I went then to justice Cox's, and told him the affair, and he was clear of opinion there were a robbery and rape committed. I ask'd the girls, and they said they knew the house where they were debauched; and told how they had been at Putney, and call'd in at an alehouse in Clement's-Lane, and were taken from thence by Clifton. I took two persons with me to the Three Compasses, and ask'd the woman if she knew the girls; she said no; one of them said to her, Madam, you know me very well, for I have been here for cups and saucers, and you brought beer to us up stairs, when we were here. The girls went up stairs, and said there were five girls in the room at the time; they look'd at the curtains, and said they were sure that was the room. The man I found had been described before justice Cox. We ask'd the people if they knew any such person. That very man was there. Broadbent said upon seeing him, that is the man that committed the rape upon me. I said, that man's circumstance does not appear to be capable of giving you money; she had told me, that he had given money to her and Mrs. Clifton too. At last they began to threaten me, and I began to think my life was not safe, because I had heard a great deal of the people before.</p>
               <p>Court. There has been inquiry made, and Harrison and his wife bear good characters.</p>
               <p>Tew. I never believ'd Baynham committed the rape. After that the girl and the man sat down; then Hannet came and sat herself down by Broadbent. I observ'd one to stoop, and said, what are you at? then Taylor (one that went with us) got between them, and after a considerable time the girl said, that is the man. I desir'd him before justice Cox to give an account where he was at that time. He at last fell down on his knees to the girls, and said, consider my youth. The girls said, you are the man.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you imagine the girl's intention was by stooping down?</p>
               <p>Tew. I thought it was to give the other intimation of whom she had pitch'd upon.</p>
               <p>Council. Then upon the improbability of the story you thought Baynham was an innocent man?</p>
               <p>Tew. I told Baynham's friends that I thought him innocent. After that they told an account of one Jones a soldier, who came there and whistled, and that they threw things out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you still think the man innocent or guilty?</p>
               <p>Tew. Upon my word, I as much believe him innocent as I myself am innocent.</p>

            ) whether you did not charge him with committing the rape?</p>
               <p>Tew. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. to Jones. Is this the man that charged you in Newgate with committing a rape, and kept you two hours and a half till he brought a warrant?</p>
               <p>Jones. This is the man.</p>
               <p>Justice Cox deposed, the girls and Baynham were before him, that he examin'd the girls above two hours; that he took them separate from each other, and did all in his power to come at the truth; and that the rape was attended with such unaccountable circumstances, that he could not give into it; but upon their positive swearing he did commit Baynham and Clifton, and that he granted a warrant against Jones the soldier for a robbery, or receiving goods knowing them to have been stolen.</p>

               <p>Mr. Williams. In the beginning of October last Mrs. Clifton came to me, and said, her master owed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175605280036"/> her some money, and she did not know how to get it. I ask'd her the sum. She said about forty shillings. I said, the best way for you is to take out an action in the Marshalsea-Court. Said she, I'll go and do it, or they will do something against me. After that the prosecutor came, and said the girls spoilt his thread, and did things wrong, and desir'd (as I bound them all to him) I would call in. I said, the first time I came that way I would. I did call, and told Broadbent and Hannet that their master complain'd of their spoiling his thread, and with being guilty of some little pilfering tricks. The girls owned they had taken a tablecloth and other things, and threw them out at the window to Clifton. Then I advised the master to take Clifton up, and he applied to Mr. Cox for a warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they impeach any body else ?</p>
               <p>Williams. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first hear of the rape?</p>
               <p>Williams. I first heard of that upon hearing of the felony.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you hear it of first?</p>
               <p>Williams. It came from the girls I imagine, but I can't be particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear of the rape at the time you was at the prosecutor's house?</p>
               <p>Williams. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a warrant being granted against a soldier, upon the information of the girls?</p>

            . I remember this soldier (meaning Jones ) was stop'd in Newgate by Mr. Tew, I believe it was concerning the children; he accused him of committing a rape. He charg'd me with him, and I told him I had no right to keep him a prisoner without a warrant. Said he, be it at your peril to let him go. I went to Mr. Newman, and ask'd him what I had best to do; he went with me to the soldier who was in the lodge, and ask'd him if he was willing to stay of his own accord. Said he, that I will; I will stay, for they are mistaken in the man; I have a brother very much like myself. After that Tew went away, and brought a girl. She look'd at him, and said, this is not the man. I saw no warrant at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Newman. About the month of November, Mr. Tew came to me in the office of Newgate, and said, there was a person in the lodge against whom he had a warrant for a felony, and shew'd it to me. I look'd at it, and said, I did not think he had any right to detain the man, it being a warrant to apprehend him in Middlesex. He insisted he should be kept there, till he went to my Lord-mayor and got one. I said to the soldier, tho' they charge you with felony, you are no prisoner of our's, unless you are willing to stay of your own accord. I went to ask advice about it, and when I came back, Tew came with the girl, who said she did not know him, and he went about his business.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Tew. Did not you go to Mr. alderman Dickinson, to get the warrant back'd?</p>
               <p>Tew. I did; it was for receiving of goods knowing them to have been stolen.</p>

            . I remember there was a charge against Clifton about a robbery by the prisoner, and I recommended him to go and tell the affair to justice Cox. We went together, but Mr. Cox was not at home. We then went to one of Mrs. Clifton's acquaintance, for him to come and speak to the girls. He came, and the girls were examin'd. The girls own'd the robbery, and that Clifton had receiv'd the things out at the window.</p>

               <p>Mr. Dowse. The prisoner once came to me about a robbery said to be done by Mrs. Clifton, who was an acquaintance of mine originally, when she kept a cook's shop in the Haymarket. I went to him about eight o'clock in the morning, and two or three of the children were examined. One whose name was Bolteram said, she threw things out at the window. I heard the prisoner often bid them be cautions how they swore, telling them the danger<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175605280037"/> of forswearing themselves. Broadbent said that one watch'd, while the other threw things out at the window to Clifton.</p>
               <p>Ephemia Wiesentball. I am sister to the prisoner, and lived with him at the time these things happen'd. I know there was neither lock nor key to the door where he lay; the outward door to the other room had a lock to it, but the key was broke. I heard him tell these two girls, that if they would speak the truth he would forgive them. They said they stole the things, and threw them out at the window; and they asked his pardon.</p>

               <p>Q. Speak it in your own language.</p>
               <p>E. Wiesenthall. I should like better to speak it to a woman; it is not fit to be mention'd in the hearing of a man.</p>

They said, I might have it all in one if I pleased, and ask'd how I wou'd have it made. I said, as they pleased, for I had never seen a banker's bill. It was made, and I paid down 70 l. I think I had seven shillings in change, the money being all in guineas. They ask'd me where I had the money. I said, I had kept it by me some time; it was black. They said, they wonder'd I should keep it so; it had been quilted up in the lining of an old waistcoat, lining upon lineing, and look'd with a mean pospect; I brought it so to London, having work'd very hard for it, and hardly spent an idle penny. The note was made payable to me only, dated April 19, 1754. The note produced. This is the unhappy piece of paper; it is but a little piece, but it has been very trouble some to me. I had my every day cloaths on when I came home with it, and when I went to bed I put it into my waistcoat pocket in my box, amongst all my other cloaths; the box was corded, the lock being spoilt. On the 29th of April, about nine o'clock, master Goodwin was at the Nag's-Head with

             took the note, Daniel and I were contesting at that time. He charg'd me with making one of Mr. Goodwin's bills for 5 l. a 7 l. I said, take me to Mr. Goodwin's don't rob me. When they had got the note, away they all went, and left the box and other things. I was very sorrowful, knowing my note was in bad hands. I took my box, and carried it to Mr. Harmans's house. I went to justice St. Lawrence several times on this affair. The justice said, they were a set of villains, and what they had swore against me he believed was entirely false, for one Hambelton Gilboy, a companion of the prisoners, had sworn I had forged a hand writing upon a lottery ticket. They have been ever charging me with something or another, with stealing and carrying away rum and brandy from my master, and selling it amongst them for three shillings and six pence a gallon. Some time after this, the two Dogorties came and took me by the collar in Mr. Harman's distill-house, and said they wou'd take me to gaol. Master ask'd them what was the matter ? They said they were officers. I stood crying under their hands, and said, carry me to what gaol you will, but bring me my bill. A neighbour came in. I said, these men have got a 70 l. banker's bill of mine. They pretended they had ball'd me for a forgery upon a lottery ticket. I went to Mr. Child the banker's shop on the Saturday after I was rob'd, and met with the person that made out the bill. He told me that a man of fortune had demanded the money upon the bill, who told him he had siez'd upon my goods and chattels, and had kept me out of gaol. I told him I did not owe any man a farthing in the world, that I had lost my bill, and hoped he would stop it if it came, and the man that brought it. I was afraid to say I had been rob'd of it, being told that if I did they wou'd fly o ver to Holland with it. In the mean time the prisoners issued out several warrants against me, and took me before justice St. Lawrence, and I was committed the 16th of April. They swore they would send my soul and body to damnation. I have been in gaol almost ever since. There came two gentlemen to the prison from the banker, and said, these men were going to oblige their master to pay the money. I said, for God's sake don't let them have it. They said, will you be at the expence of stopping the note. I said, they had ruin'd me. I was very poor, and could not do any thing. They shook their heads and said, they pity'd me, and it was a very villainous affair they believ'd.</p>

             did.</p>
               <p>Q. For what?</p>
               <p>Hopster. For forging a 5 l. bill of my master's for goods, to 7 l. to defraud them as they pretended of 40 s. but I did not do any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What justice was this before?</p>
               <p>Hopster. Justice St. Lawrence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you charged before the justice with having forged, or upon suspicion of having forged any part of a lottery ticket?</p>
               <p>Hopster. I was charged with that, but they could not make it appear. Gilboy charged me with making the figure 8 into a 9, with intent to defraud his majesty. The ticket was 1258, a 10 l. prize. It was one of my own, I had two tickets; the other was 1259. When he said I had made the 8 a 9, the justice put on his spectacles, and said it was a 9. I then put my hand in my pocket, and produced the other ticket, which was the 9, but Gilboy made a firm affidavit that I had alter'd it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you or was you not upon that charge of the forgery'd ?</p>
               <p>Hopster. No, not upon the forgery of the figure; I contradicted that, by shewing the other which was a 9.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was this Hambleton Gilboy ?</p>
               <p>Hopster. He was a stout jolly-fresh-colour'd man, an acquaintance of theirs; he did not look like a rouge if he was one.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175605280039"/>Q. Did not you enter into recognizance for your own appearance?</p>
               <p>Hopster. No, I did so to prosecure Benjamin Delahay. who was charg'd with a conspiracy, with intent to cheat one of his majesty's subjects of 6 l. 10 s. Hambleton Gilboy was his bail.</p>

               <p>Q. Whether or no you gave bail for your own appearance?</p>
               <p>Hopster. I am certain there was no forgery appear'd against me; there was such a pretence, and Daniel Dogorty and

               <p>Hopster. About 80 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean they were bound in 80 l. or you in 80 l.?</p>
               <p>Hopster. There was something mention'd about 80 l. I did not read it.</p>

               <p>Daniel Dogorty's defence. I was committed by Justice St. Lawrence till a re-hearing, and then Hopster acknowledged himself perjured before many men of credit. I never gave an oath against him. The justice bound me and five or six more of good character over to prosecute. Hopster deposited this note in my hands as a security for being bound for him for a forgery, before justice St. Lawrence. I gave full value for the note, and was almost a year out of it before I could get it again. I borrow'd some money on the note, and laid it out for his use, by his special orders. I'll make it appear I served the man; and here are men will prove he offer'd money to swear against me. This is the 5th or 6th action he has brought against me for my own money; he brought an action of trover, and I was obliged to lay in a spunging-house; I stood the action in the King's Bench till it was tried and nonsuited; and he brought two others in the Marshal's Court.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175605280040"/> The note was above eat up before I recovered a farthing.
