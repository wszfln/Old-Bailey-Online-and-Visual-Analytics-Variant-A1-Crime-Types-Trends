            . I am wife to the prosecutor. I was going up, on that Saturday night, to make my beds, and the prisoner was coming down stairs with a bundle of cloaths under her arm. This was a little after ten at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she lodge with you?</p>
               <p>E. Fear. No. I had seen her come in and out to one of my lodgers, named Renton. I lighted her down, and let her go out. Then I went upstairs and push'd my room door open, and saw my bed strip'd. I ran down, and took her in the street, and brought her back. She then laid the goods down upon the stairs, the same as mentioned in the indictment. (Produced in court, and deposed to.) I sent for a constable, and she was committed.</p>

He had got eleven fowls and two geese. I took him before the justice. Going along he said, he'd give me and my partner a shilling and all the fowls to let him go: but we would not. Then he ran from us, and we after him, took him again, and carried him before justice Bulstrode.</p>

            . I cannot swear to the gentleman's face, he was walking just by the chapple upon the paved stones at St. James's, on his majesty's birth day about two o'clock; there were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175702230006"/> South, Elgrove, Brown and his wife, and a Jew, I don't know his name: South faced the gentleman, and gave him some pushes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this gentleman, do you know him? ( meaning the prosecutor)</p>
               <p>Yates. I believe that is the gentleman South fell down and a chairman took him up. Elgrove took a watch out of the gentleman's pocket and gave it to Brown, and Brown gave it to Gorman who ran away with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body pursue him?</p>
               <p>Yates. No, nobody at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it deliver'd by Brown?</p>
               <p>Yates. I saw it delivered by Brown to Gorman, and I saw it taken by Elgrove out of the gentleman's pocket. I think this is the gentleman and I think the gentleman gave a blow in the crowd. I saw Gorman the next day and told him I heard it was worth sixty or seventy guineas; he said it was going to be sold, and he should have his share to a halfpenny; in about two or three days after that, he told me it was sold for 6 six-and thirty-shilling-pieces, and he had one of them. I never heard any thing more of it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any share of the money?</p>
               <p>Yates. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Where can you suppose it to have been taken from you?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I suppose it to be taken near the chapple door on the paved stones.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember giving a shove?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There were two or three women and a man that fell down; they crowded me very much and I push'd him backwards, it was rather a shove than a blow; a chairman took him up.</p>
               <p>Yates. The crowd was great, and Gorman was on the outside ready for running.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the watch?</p>
               <p>Yates. I saw no more than the chain, which I think was gold; to the best of my knowledge there were either two or three seals.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was a gold chain, and three seals to it.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. What day of the month was the king's birth day?</p>
               <p>Yates. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. What day of the week?</p>
               <p>Yates. I did not take particular notice of that.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What is the value of the watch ?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. About eighty guineas.</p>
               <p>Yates. The prisoner told me the chain was gold. I told him I had a right to something out of it; he said no, I had not, for the Covent-garden company did not allow any such thing. I said I stood close by and gave assistance in the thrust.</p>
               <p>Q. Explain that?</p>
               <p>Yates. I was not one of their gang.</p>

            . There was one South and a woman, and another man, who that man was I can't tell; when I saw a crowd I desired them to stand by and let my master the prosecutor ) come along. When my master was in a passion one of them fell down before him; we got through and put my master in the chair. Some time after he missed his watch, when I said it must be taken at that time. Then we went to justice Fielding's. I mentioned South's name and he was sent for, but he denied it.</p>

            . I was in Monmouth street; there was Mrs. Walker coming along, who said to me, I have just pyked it now. I asked her how Mr. Walker did; she said, he is not in town.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she mean by that?</p>
               <p>Yates. That was, getting away as fast as she could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prosecutor there?</p>
               <p>Yates. To the best of my knowledge I did. She held the watch up, and I saw it in her hand with one seal and one key, whether it was gold or Pinchbeck I know not. She was seen to go in at Mr. Reason's. I saw a mob there, but did not see her go in.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she to shew you it?</p>
               <p>Yates. Because I knew her and she me.</p>

            . The prisoner came into my house for a penny-worth of beer the 26th of Jan. about eleven at night. I have known her three years. She sat down by the fire to warm herself. I went up to bed and left my wife and this little girl the evidence here with her. The large spoon was then in the bar; the little one in a corner cupboard in the kitchen. I was called up in about ten minutes after, and my wife told me the prisoner had taken a spoon. She accused the prisoner with it. The prisoner said she knew nothing of it, making use of a great deal of ill language. I was tying my garter up by the fire and saw part of the great spoon lying among the ashes. I took it up, and put the poker in the ashes to see for the teaspoon, and found the cotton handkerchief and the tea-spoon there; then I charged a constable with her, and she was committed.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor; after my master was gone to bed, the prisoner sent me into the kitchen to get some butter, and when I was coming back into the tap room, I saw the prisoner in the bar, with her hand up to the cupboard. I had been gone about three minutes. I had put the large spoon there but a little before my mistress went up stairs. When she came down, I called her on one side and told her what I had seen. She went to the cupboard and missed the table spoon. Then my mistress asked her about it, but she denied it. Then I called my master, who came down. The prisoner had seen me put the tea-spoon that afternoon into a cupboard in the kitchen, so we went to look for that, and that was gone also. When she went before the justice, he asked her if she had been guilty of any thing before. She said no, she never was before that time. I saw the spoons and handkerchief found in the ashes. The spoons and handkerchief produced in court and deposed to.</p>

She said, she was. I asked her if she had seen such a coat, describing it. She said, she had seen a person cheapening such a one. I wanted to see what she had in her apron, and there I found my coat.

               <p>Q. Had he any thing in his hand?</p>
               <p>Witherby. He had a pistol in his hand. I saw it. I could see a great way off, it was so light. I told him I had no money about me. He said, d - n you, you have. I said again, I had not. Then he said, d - n you, walk away, and take no notice, for if you do I'll blow your brains out. I said, Sir, your Servant. Then I went to the centinel, that was standing very near, and told him of it, and asked him if he did not hear him speak to me. He said, no, he did not. I wanted him to pursue him. He said, he dared not go from his post, and asked why I did not call to him at the time. I said, I dared not for fear he should have done me a mischief. He said, he would give the watch word. I went from him to the centinel, at the stable-yard. He asked me who came there. I said, a friend, did you see a young man come this way with a white coat. He said there were so many went in and out there that he could not tell. Then I told him such a man had put a pistol to my head, and offered to rob me, and I did not think he was got out of the Park yet. He said, the gates are all lock'd, he cannot get out except he comes by this way, or the horse-guards. I had hardly done speaking when the prisoner came. The centinel asked who came there, and he said a friend. I took hold of him (knowing him to be the same person that had stop'd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175702230009"/> me) to him, you are the man that wanted she just now. While the centinel had hold I took a pistol out of his pocket; after which he bid me give it him again, that he might blow his own brains out. When the file of musqueteers came to relieve the guard, they took him to the guard-room, and the next morning he was carried before justice Fielding; where I swore he was the same man that attacked me. I am certain he is the same person. He denied the fact. Mr. Fielding asked him how the pistol came to be loaded. He said, he could not tell that it was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The justice gave him and the soldiers money to take my life away.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The justice asked me if I had any money to carry on the prosecution. I told him I had not. Then he gave me a guinea, and the two soldiers half a guinea each.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you observe whether the prisoner had but one eye?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not so much observe his face then.</p>

            . I said he was not within, but if he had any thing to say to him he might communicate it to me, and I would acquaint him with it. He went away, and in a very few minutes returned, and without any ceremony came up to the table where I sat, threw down the candle from the table, and put the light out. He then offered a paper, which I suppose was to amuse me while he seized me. He seized me, and demanded my watch and money; which I told him he should have, and gave him the watch, which was a gold one, in a shagreen case, with a cornelian seal to it. I gave him a guinea in gold, three or four shillings in silver, an old shilling, and a square piece of silver, with the marshal De Surely's name on it. Then he threatened greatly what he'd do, if I attempted to hinder his getting off. He went then out at the door, and I bolted it after him, and call'd out thieves, and I believe murder, and every thing I could, to induce people to stop him; but upon hearing no more of him I went to justice Fielding, and described his person. The description was thus: '' A young man, middle size, slender, with something '' remarkable on his face, either a scald or '' small-pox, or other distemper or accident, his '' face being very red.'' * I saw him at justice Fielding's five weeks and a day afterwards. He was taken up by a pawnbroker, in attempting to pawn this watch.</p>
               <p> * The prisoner answered all the descriptions, except that of his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe it to be the same person that came the second time?</p>
               <p>Harper. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him then?</p>
               <p>Harper. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Harper. Yes, I did, very well. He was an apprentice part of his time to a stationer, that is employed to write for me.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he disguised?</p>
               <p>Harper. From what I observed since, I believe he was. I believe he had some skin or paint put over the lower part of his face.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you think with regard to his voice?</p>
               <p>Harper. I can't say I could believe it to be his, or any other particular person's voice.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live at the corner of Russel-Court. On the 21st of January, about eight in the evening, or a little after, the prisoner brought a watch to me to pawn. (Produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor to be the same watch he delivered to the person who demanded it, the 28th of December, &amp;c.) I was in the parlour, and saw the watch delivered to the boy. The prisoner wanted three guineas and a half upon it. I said to the boy bring the book, that is, a book in which we set all the watches down we find advertised to be stolen. There I saw, Lost a gold watch, a shagreen case, name

He said, it was his father's, that he was dead, and his mother had given it to him. I said, here is a watch advertised like this, but no number; this may not be the watch, but it is described very nearly. Then he said, I'll call to morrow morning. I said, it is but a little way to go to enquire, you may as well go with me now. He was going out, and I laid hold on his coat. He said, don't hold me. Going to justice Fielding's, where it was advertised, I took hold of him, and we went hand in hand. About fifty or sixty yards before we got there, he got away from me, about four or five yards. I said, this does not look well to want to run away. Then he said, I beg you will not take me to justice Fielding. I took him there, and the justice sent for Mr. Harper, who came, and swore to the watch in the prisoner's presence. Mr. Fielding asked the prisoner where he had the watch. He said, the person he had it of should be nameless, for reasons best known to himself.</p>

               <p>I bought this watch. I'll read a paper how I came by it. (He reads a paper as follows:) '' I '' happened to go to Johnson's coffee-house, in '' Johnson's-Court, Charing Cross, on Friday the '' 17th of January, 1757, in the morning about '' eleven o'clock, where a person sitting opposite '' to me happen'd to read an advertisement of a '' person on Snow-Hill, or Ludgate-Hill, I can't '' say which, giving the full value for any thing '' that was pledged. He said, he thought a watch '' and such things were unnecessary on board a '' ship, and therefore would dispose of them at the '' aforesaid place. I said, I believed they would '' never advance so much money by half, as the '' commodity was worth, and that it was better '' to sell them outright; for as he was going on '' ship board he could not take them out again '' before the time was past, in which they were '' to be redeemed; then they would be unavoidably '' lost. He seem'd to acquiesce to what I said, '' and immediately pull'd out a watch from his '' pocket, and shew'd it me. I said, I am no '' judge, but if we could agree about the price, I '' would buy it of him; so I gave him a written '' direction where to find me, which was at Mr. '' Boyden's, in Plough Court, Fetter-Lane. He '' came to me the Sunday following, and left me '' the watch; saying, he would call again at night. '' He accordingly came, and took the watch '' with him. I put on a pair of shoes, and went '' to him immediately where he ordered, which '' was at the Black-Raven, Fetter-Lane, just '' opposite. I paid him 4 l. 10 s. there for it. I '' have a receipt here to produce for the money. '' That is the same watch which I offered to '' pawn. The name of the person I bought it '' of was John Green. I believe he is now at sea. '' I never saw him before, or since. I have fourteen '' or fifteen persons here to my character.''</p>

               <p>Boyden. No, I know nothing of his acquaintance. I serv'd my time to the same gentleman that he did part of his. I had employed him about a fortnight before he was taken up, and he behaved extremely well. I look upon him to be a very sober, diligent, honest man. I remember I had been out and heard of this robbery, and when I came home I told him of it, and he seem'd to be very much surprised at it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you be sure whether he was in your house all that night, the time of the robbery?</p>
               <p>Boyden. No, I cannot. He wrote by his own choice that night, but whether all night, I can't say. One Sunday I had been to take a walk, and when I came back the prisoner had been writing some skins for me. There hung a yellow watch by him. I asked him what watch that was. He said a young man had lent it to him to write by.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you leave any body at home?</p>
               <p>M. Moss. I left a young woman there, and desired her when she went out to lock the door, and leave the key in a certain place in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been gone from home?</p>
               <p>M. Moss. I believe I was gone about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour. I asked the prisoner what he did there. He said with some fighting speech, what is that to you. My neighbour said, he has strip'd your room. He ran down the court. I pursued him, and called stop thief. Two men stop'd him, and brought him to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your street door shut or open?</p>
               <p>M. Moss. It was open. The young woman said before the Lord-mayor, she locked my room door when she went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is she?</p>
               <p>M. Moss. She is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose?</p>
               <p>M. Moss. The following things, which we found upon the prisoner, a white gown, a silk gown, a stuff gown, a pair of stays, a shirt, a neckcloth, 6 tea-spoons, 2 table spoons, and a milk pot. He said he would give me all my things if I would let him go, he beg'd for mercy on his knees. I asked him how he got into the room, he said, with his own keys; he had several keys found upon him.</p>
               <p>Five keys and two long spike nails produced in court. These I saw found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you try to see if any of them would fit your lock?</p>
               <p>M. Moss. I did not try them, he wanted to conceal these keys under my bed.</p>

When I came back, I was told they had found the keys; we took him to the Mansion-house and delivered him into Mr. Nash's custody. Upon the woman's saying where she ordered her key to be left, he said he open'd the door with her key.</p>
               <p>Q to M. Moss. Where did you find your key?</p>
               <p>M. Moss. I found it on the ground afterwards by the bed. It appeared my door had been wrench'd, there was a mark made seemingly with one of these nails.</p>
               <p>Q to Nash. Did that mark seem to have been fresh done?</p>

I had lost some trifling things before, upon which I ordered the prisoner to be turned away. I having known her some time, and had a good character with her, my wife let her be at our house, to lie with my daughter. She having been at our house the day the things were lost, for some linen of her own, and I having a suspicion of her, took her up. She confessed the fact, and carried me to the place where she had broke the tea-chest open, and threw it into a horse-pond, and the people of the place had taken it out, returned it to me, and a guinea that stuck in a crack, which the prisoner did not see.</p>

            . I live in Pepper-Alley, have known the prisoner several years, and have bought several things of him. He brought this tea kettle and plates to my house, and said his wife was dead, that he was going to sea, and he had rather bring them to me than any body else. He was a master baker in the Borough. I bought these things of him.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. This tea-kettle and these plates are my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My brother-in-law is the man that prosecutes me, and this certainly is done out of spight. I was going to work in the morning, and met a soldier with a bundle on his head. I had seen him at Windsor. He asked me to go in and drink. He said, he had got a few things to dispose of, and I could sell them better than he. As far as I can understand, he was at my brother's house all that day.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did a soldier come to your house that day?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There was a man came in a soldier's dress. He came from Blackwall, with a message from a taylor. He said, he believed the sailor to be my brother-in-law. When he went away, he went out at one door, and I at the other. When my wife and I came home we found the key in the door, and we missed the things mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave the key in the door at going out?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That was left over the street-door for me. The soldier did not see the key laid there. Here is one that can prove the soldier did not take the things away.</p>

               <p>George Warren. On the 28th of last month being Friday, betwixt twelve and one o'clock, I went to Mr. Cecil's chambers in the Temple. Mr. Wilson his clerk informed me he was not there, and ask'd me if I had any particular business with him. I told him I believed he could do the business as well. It is only to lay two informations against a man that had been very troublesome in the country. Mr. Cecil is solicitor to the association of gentlemen for the preservation of the game. Mr. Wilson told me he did not recollect me. I told him I had not given in my subscription myself, but I would shew him Mr. Cecil's last receipt. I pull'd out a little red pocket book, in which was the receipt for the subscription money, and shewed it him. Then I put it in again and pull'd out the two informations. After I had finished my business with him, I went and walk'd in the Park, and then home; then I dressed myself and went to the play. At the play I missed my pocket book, which I recollected I had left at Mr. Cecil's.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Warren. I live in Grosvenor street I came immediately home and wrote to Mr. Cecil, that I had left my pocket book and a stick in his room, and desired he'd send some careful person early in the morning to look for it, before the maid had been in it, and I would be with him punctually at ten. I call'd upon him at the time appointed next morning, and he return'd the stick to me, but said he saw nothing of the pocket book, and said he had search'd the room very carefully. I went from thence immediately to the Bank to stop the 300 l. note, being the only one of the three that I could recollect. (They were all in my pocket book.) In my return home I call'd at Mr. Cecil's again, he was not then in his chambers, but Mr. Wilson was. I told him I thought it was very odd they did not see my pocket book. He said I don't remember you had a pocket book here. I said, Sir, to convince you I had a pocket book, do you remember my shewing you the receipt for the association subscription. Said he, now I do remember that you pull'd out a little red pocket book; from thence I went home and endeavoured to find out the numbers of the other two notes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the number to the 300 l. note?</p>
               <p>Warren. That was 104; as soon as I had learn'd the number of one of them, which I imagined I had from Mr. Shad a jeweller (this was the 25 l. note.) I advertised that and the 300 l. note, and the other the number forgot. I think in a day or two after this Mr. Cecil's clerk came to me with a letter that he had receiv'd from the prisoner at the bar. The purport of which was, '' That he was going abroad, and was sorry he '' could not bring the key of the chamber himself, '' being in such a hurry.''</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Warren. He was another clerk in the office. I told Mr. Wilson when I return'd from the Bank, that I had stopt the payment of the 300 l. note; at that time I said to him, if you remember, there was a person writing at the other end of the room, (which was the prisoner at the bar). I went immediately with Mr. Wilson to Mr. Fielding, who<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175702230015"/> examined the porter who brought the key and letter from the prisoner Hardwidge; from which we had great grounds to suspect the prisoner. Then Mr. Fielding proceeded in a very judicious manner, and the prisoner was apprehended in a day or two after at Windsor. There was found upon him 200 l. in bank notes, some money, a watch and some silver spoons, which the justice return'd to me; there was likewise some money found upon Woods, who was taken with him.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you be certain you did not drop the pocket book upon the stairs, after you had been in the room?</p>
               <p>Warren. I am positive I left it in the office, and I shew'd Mr. Wilson how I left it upon the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was sitting at the table when you put it down there?</p>
               <p>Warren. Mr. Wilson was, and the prisoner Hardwidge was sitting at a desk at the upper end of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he stir from his seat when you was there?</p>
               <p>Warren. No, he did not, I saw so little of him that I thought him to be a boy.</p>
               <p>Q. If any body had come there and Mr. Wilson continued there, was it possible any body could come and take it without his seeing them take it?</p>
               <p>Warren. Yes, because I put it behind the desk.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Cecil; on the 28th of January between twelve and one, capt. Warren came to his chambers; I and the prisoner Hardwidge were there; he produced two informations to me, which he said he had of his steward in the country. On my looking them over I found I could not bring any action upon them, because they were out of time. Then the captain put them into his pocket book again; we had some discourse how they should be drawn in case the steward should find any others. Then he produced me a receipt for his last year's subscription, and in a little time after he went away, I can't charge my memory with the pocket book at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was it?</p>
               <p>Wilson. It was on a Friday, and Mr. Cecil was attending the house of lords. When he came in the morning he produced a letter from capt. Warren, wherein he said he left a book upon the desk. About half an hour past nine on Monday morning, a porter came to our chambers with a letter and the key of the chamber.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whose writing it was?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I have it here, I know it to be the prisoner's writing. The contents were to this purport.</p>

            ; and by that means on Tuesday morning the prisoner was taken. The justice examin'd him; he said, he found a pocket-book upon the stair-case, in which was contain'd a 300 l. bank note, that he took it out and burnt the book. He denied there being any other note; but upon Mr. Fielding's telling him it was much better to tell the truth, as it was an offence of a high nature, he own'd the other two notes, and that he had chang'd them, but where I cannot tell now.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing with relation to any knowledge Hardwidge has of Woods?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Woods has come to our chambers several times to him, but not lately.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time?</p>
               <p>Wilson. The last time was about a month ago; he ask'd for Hardwidge, but he was not there at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they used to converse together?</p>
               <p>Wilson. They had, but they hardly continued together above five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Who quitted the chamber first, Hardwidge or you, that day Mr. Warren was there?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Mr. Hardwidge did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come near your desk, before he went away?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I don't know that he did.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had, should you have seen him?</p>
               <p>Wilson. No doubt but I should.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175702230016"/>Q. Was it possible for him to have taken the book away from the desk, and you not have seen him?</p>
               <p>Wilson. He goes away to dinner at one, and returns at three; and I go at two, and return at four; he might have come and taken away the book at three, when I was gone; he had a key of the chambers.</p>
               <p>Q to prosecutor. Where did you lay the book?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I laid it down on the table behind the desk where Mr. Wilson sat, near the window.</p>
               <p>Q to Wilson. Could the prisoner, when he sat at his desk, see any thing upon that table, or the desk?</p>
               <p>Wilson. A person might see the desk, but not that part towards the window.</p>
               <p>Q to prosecutor. Did you put it under any paper out of sight?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, I did not, but I put it on that part near the window.</p>
               <p>Q to Wilson. What time did you return to the chambers that afternoon?</p>
               <p>Wilson. At four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not the prisoner have been at the door when you was absent, without your knowledge?</p>
               <p>Wilson. He might.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The prisoner acknowledg'd before the justice he had been to the door, and he found the book on the stairs at three o'clock, that it was so dark that he could not distinguish what it was at first, and he return'd without going in.</p>
               <p>Q to Wilson. Did you see the book on the staircase when you went away at two o'clock?</p>
               <p>Wilson. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a very dark stair-case?</p>
               <p>Wilson. It is.</p>
               <p>Q to prosecutor. Were there any other things in your pocket book?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There were two or three other little promisory notes from people that I had lent a little money to, and a card with some message upon it, a letter, and some trifling things.</p>
               <p>Q to Wilson. How long has the prisoner been with Mr. Cecil?</p>
               <p>Wilson. He has been there above two years.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his general character ?</p>
               <p>Wilson. He has as fair a character as any in England, no man a better.</p>

            . The two prisoners at the bar came to my shop in Newport-alley. (I am a leather-seller ) on the 29th of January between eleven and twelve o'clock. Woods ask'd to see some goods; he was a customer to me before.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he?</p>
               <p>Remey. He is a leather breeches-maker. I shew'd him some, and he ask'd to see a pretty large quantity of good s.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he used to buy such quantities ?</p>
               <p>Remey. No, he used to buy smaller quantities; he is what we call a chamber master. I ask'd him if he was going to set up; he told me he was. I ask'd where; he said he believ'd at Windsor; he said, the person's master that was then with him had lent him 40 l. to buy goods with. After Woods had look'd over several goods, Hardwidge said see what these goods come to, for we are to lay out no more than 40 l by my master's order. So I took a pen and ink, and just rough cast them up; they came to 38 l. and upwards; upon which Hardwidge told Woods that was near the sum his master order'd him to lay out, and he would have him look at no more. Woods comply'd with it; then they tender'd me a bank note of 300 l. to change, to take my money, and order'd me to make a bill of parcels and a receipt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the number of the note?</p>
               <p>Remey. I did, it was 104.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them tender'd the note?</p>
               <p>Remey. Woods did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he receive it of the other prisoner?</p>
               <p>Remey. No, not in my sight. Hardwidge desired I would not give them all the change in cash, for his master desir'd to have a note. Then I laid down a note for 200 l. and another for 50 l. and 50 l. in cash; it was taken up by Hardwidge from off the counter, who took up the receipt also, and said he'd go and shew his master what money he had laid out, and went away and left Woods to pack up the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you who his master was?</p>
               <p>Remey. He did, and spelt the name to me Wm. Goats, Esq; he said, he liv'd at Windsor. That I wrote on the back of the note. I carried it to the Bank; the entering clerk is here to whom I shew'd it.</p>
               <p>The note produced in court, and read.</p>
               <p>No. 104. Wrote on the back of it Esquire Goats, Jan. 29, 1757.</p>

               <p>On the 28th of January, about half an hour after two o'clock, going to my master's chambers, on the second pair of stairs I pick'd up a letter-case. I directly returned to my lodgings. I looked in it, and found three bank notes; one for 300 l. one 30 l. and one for 25 l. One of them Mr. Woods and I changed at the leatherseller's. There were some notes advertised in some paper, but they were quite different from what I found. Mr. Warren says in the Advertiser for the 1st of February, he lost two; one of 300 l. No. 1041. The No. I found was 104. The two other notes I found, one was No. 33, and the other 3, D. The captain says he lost a pocket book, but I found a letter case. I never was near Mr. Wilson's desk from the time the captain was in the chambers, nor was the captain near mine.</p>
               <p>Woods's Defence.</p>
               <p>Hardwidge and I have been acquainted four or five years. I was at his wife's room. He came in with this letter case, and said, he had found it upon Mr. Cecil's stair-case. We went to Ludgate-Hill, and there changed a small note, to pay a small debt which I owed at Windsor. Then he changed the 30 l. note in St. Paul's Church-Yard, at a silver-smith's. After that, he consented to give me 40 l. to put me into a way of business, I having fail'd a little before. I told him I thought that would not be enough, and said, if he would give me 50 l. I would change the note. Then he gave me 10 l. more. I know no farther than that the thing was found. I intended to settle at Windsor, and went there to ask several people for their custom.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you use to keep the till lock'd?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I did always.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your till?</p>
               <p>Nichols. It was in the bar, betwixt the publick room and the back room. I went backwards to serve a man with a bushel of coals (the prisoner was sitting by the fire in the tap-room ) and when I came back again, I asked him if any body had been there. He said, nobody at all. I had bolted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175702230018"/> the bar door as I went out. Then I went and look'd in my till, and found but nine shillings and six-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the till lock'd when you returned ?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before had you seen the money ?</p>
               <p>Nichols. About a quarter of an hour before. He said he was going upon guard. He went away, and returned, seemingly in liquor. The next morning he got up as soon as I opened the house. I had a suspicion of him the day before. There was a woman came in for half a peck of coals. I left him by the fire side again, bolted the bar door, and took the key and put it in the back room upon the table, as I had done the day before. As soon as the woman came backwards, I bid her go to the shed. I returned directly to the back door, and heard the prisoner in the bar. He was feeling with one hand, to see if the till was open, and with the other feeling for the key. I said, so Paul, are you the person that has rob'd me all this time ? He said, no master; I never rob'd you in all my life time. I said, what business have you to come here to the till? Then he would not speak, so I sent for a constable. He said, '' Master, '' if you will let me go upon my guard, I'll pay '' you so much a week out of my pay.''</p>
               <p>Q. Waat sum did he mention?</p>
               <p>Nichols. He did not mention any sum?</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say for what ?</p>

               <p>Nichols. No. We took him to justice Carkess's, and he was not up. Then we went to the Two-Brewers, in Strutton's-Ground. There the justice's clerk desired him to go along with me into the back room, if he did not care to speak before the people. There he said, he believed he did not rob me of above 17 s. I said, I believe I have missed more than that. He said, he rob'd me four times. I asked him how much he took at a time. He said, to the best of his knowledge, the first time he took 4 s. the next time 2 s. 6 d. the next 6 s. 6 d. and the last time 4 s. that was the day before.</p>

               <p>Pratt. I can't say he apply'd particularly to me, there were three of us in the office when he came.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he come with?</p>
               <p>Pratt. He came with Mr. Lind the broker.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make the letter of attorney?</p>
               <p>Pratt. No, it was made by another in the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Look upon the date of this letter of attorney, he takes it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Pratt. This is dated the 29th of March 1756.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the second time of the prisoner's coming after it was fill'd up?</p>
               <p>Pratt. No doubt but he staid and took it with him, when it was made.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there ready printed blanks?</p>
               <p>Pratt. There are, which we keep on purpose by us.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that in your hand one of your letters of attorney?</p>

               <p>Pratt. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it deliver'd to him?</p>
               <p>Pratt. It was in the office, I know nothing of the returning it after that. The application to us must be in the month of April, because this is dated the 29th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you date them the day they come for them?</p>
               <p>Pratt. It very often is done, and very often left undone; I apprehend this was fill'd up at the same time, it being the same hand-writing, and it appears to me it was in March he came first.</p>

             did; he came into the office along with Mr. Lind, and apply'd for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual in your office, when letters are apply'd for, to fill them up in the office?</p>
               <p>Ryder. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the course of the office in regard to their being attested?</p>
               <p>Ryder. They are attested by the minister of the parish where the party lives, and the two churchwardens; or two justices of the peace, that is an order we have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the person take away the letter of attorney who came for it at the same time ?</p>
               <p>Ryder. I really believe he did, because we seldom let them lie with us; in general they wait and take them away with them.</p>
               <p>Q. What becomes of those letters of attorney when the transfer is made under them?</p>
               <p>Ryder. We file them up, where we may have recourse to them at once, upon any account.</p>
               <p>Q. By what method do you proceed with them?</p>
               <p>Ryder. We have a committee of clerks to see whether they have varied by their hand-writing, or whether properly attested, before the letter is made use of.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Ryder. By finding out the hand of the proprietor (if he has accepted the stock) for he must have accepted the stock before he can transfer it, and that is in our book.</p>
               <p>Q. What care was taken with regard to this letter?</p>
               <p>Ryder. (Looks at it) This was allow'd by comparing the transfer with it, and being well known to Mr. Lind.</p>
               <p>Q. How d o you know that?</p>
               <p>Ryder. It is so express'd in writing; there is an examination made the day before, and if there is sufficient evidence, the thing is done.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Who apply'd to you for this letter of attorney?</p>
               <p>Ryder. I really can't tell. I made all the three out, but don't know the persons; we have so many come of that sort of business, I can't recollect them all.</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. When were the other two made out?</p>

            . I AM one of the committee for passing letters of attorney. They all must be passed by three of the clerks.</p>
               <p>Q. What method do you take in order thereto?</p>
               <p>Anderson. There are two or three methods, as by comparing of hands by the transfer book, or by having a person of credit that knows the party; these are the two usual methods.</p>
               <p>Q. Look upon this letter of attorney ?</p>
               <p>Anderson. (He takes it in his hand.) Here is my name, of my own signing, upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that put to it for?</p>
               <p>Anderson. In order for this man to transfer the stock.</p>
               <p>Q. In what method was that judged of, in order to pass it?</p>
               <p>Anderson. It was by the hand-writing being compared with the transfer name, and the person well known to Mr. Lind the broker. The pass of it is my hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who produced the letter, in order to be passed?</p>
               <p>Anderson. I can give no positive answer to that. We found it ready in the room to pass. The person that might be the attorney brings it in, and desired it may be passed; that is the customary way.</p>

               <p>Lind. No, nothing at all in March, to take the letter of attorney out. On the 8th of April last he met me at the South-sea house, about twelve o'clock, and brought a power of attorney, and said he had a power of attorney to sell 500 l. of his uncle's old South-sea annuities.</p>

               <p>Lind. I never look'd at it. It is not my business.

I went to a person and said, a friend of mine has a power of attorney to sell 500 l. of old South-sea annuities. I went with the prisoner into the office, and saw him leave the letter of attorney, and after that it passed by the clerks of the company, who compare them, to see if they are forged, or the like.

               <p>Green. It is here Edward Green, rector.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Green. I am vicar of the parish of Harbourn.</p>

               <p>Green. More than twenty-four years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the other two names that purport to be churchwardens.</p>
               <p>Green. I know neither of them. There have been no churchwardens of those names in my time.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Green. I generally enter the names of the churchwardens in the book myself upon Easter-day, which is the time of electing churchwardens in that parish.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect who were churchwardens the time of the date on the letter of attorney, which is 1755?</p>
               <p>Green. The churchwardens in the year 1755 are churchwardens in the year 1756; for they are so till the other churchwardens that succeed them are sworn into the office.

               <p>Richards. It is not at all like his hand-writing. Some part of it is something imitating his writing.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of it is not like his hand writing?</p>
               <p>Richards. The first E next to the letter B is not like his; he never makes such an S as this at the end of Hughes.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at this letter of attorney, he takes it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Atkins. I was a witness to this, I saw his uncle and Mr. Harris execute it in the prisoner's house. Mr. Brown was another witness to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Brown. I have known him almost ever since he has been in trade, which is about twelve years; I never heard any thing amiss of him.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his general character?</p>
               <p>Brown. The character that I have heard is a very good one, I never heard to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Mr. Heath. I have known him ten or eleven years, I never heard any otherwise than a good character of him.</p>

            , and I carried it by turns.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take it from?</p>
               <p>Blail. From that wharf call'd Hay's and Cox's formerly, out of a warehouse; two stood without while the other went in. The prisoner weigh'd it and gave us half a guinea for it; we asked him if he would have any more, and he bid us take care of ourselves. We went about three days after and took a couple more from the same place; he weigh'd them and gave us 20 s. for them; they weigh'd a hundred wt. each. He asked us if we had any more, and bid us take care of ourselves, and bring some more. Dove and I went and took one bag more; two days after that, at about three in the afternoon, we carried it to the prisoner, and gave us 9 s. for it. We asked him if he would have any more; he said, we might bring another bag if we would; he always caution'd us to take care of ourselves; we went down again and got two bags more in about a week after, which we carried to the prisoner, and he gave us 18 s. for them.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever tell him where you brought them from?</p>
               <p>Blail. No, never. Then we asked him if he would have any more. He said, we might bring another if we would, and ordered us to take care of ourselves. About three days after that Dove and I went down, and the warehouse was stop'd up with butter, so that we could not come at the ginger. We took a firkin of butter away, carried it to the prisoner, and sold it to him for half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever mentioned any thing of butter to him before?</p>
               <p>Blail. No, we had not. We asked him if he would have any more things, if we could get them. He said, yes; but bid us take care of ourselves. About six weeks after we got into another warehouse, belonging to the same people, and took out two bags of ginger.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hargrove. How were they marked in that warehouse ?</p>
               <p>Hargrove. They were not mark'd like the others. These I have brought here were out of the same warehouse which I suppose the butter was taken from; but there is butter in both warehouses.</p>
               <p>Blail. The two warehouses both join together; one is a long one, and the other is a little one. We took all but two out of the little warehouse.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175702230027"/> The prisoner gave us 19 s. for the two last I mentioned. We asked him if we should bring him some more. He said, we might if we would, but we must take care of ourselves. Then we all three of us went down to the long warehouse, and took three bags out, and sold them to the prisoner for 30 s. We went a little after to get another, and I was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. How many bags of ginger did you take in all ?</p>
               <p>Blail. We took eleven in all.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the marks upon these bags ?</p>
               <p>Blail. If I see them I do. (He looks at the two bags.) These are two of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Which warehouse did these come out of?</p>
               <p>Blail. These came out of the long warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hargrove. What is the value of this ginger?</p>
               <p>Hargrove. It is worth something better than 30 s. per cwt.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hargrove. Which warehouse contains the bags of this mark?</p>
               <p>Hargrove. The long warehouse.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to carry the first bag to the prisoner's house?</p>
               <p>Blail. I went first to ask him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of the marks of each bag ?</p>
               <p>Blail. I did; as we took them out.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see these bags before ?</p>
               <p>Blail. I saw them last the 17th of this month.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hargrove. Did you lose any butter ?</p>

               <p>Hargrove. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. to Charlton. Do you remember losing any butter?</p>
               <p>Charlton. There was butter put into this warehouse in a hurry, and it lay so as we could not come at the ginger sometimes without removing it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Charlton. Did you mention the losing of butter before the grand jury, in Surry ?</p>

               <p>Foster. No, I did not till he got into the shed. I put it through a crack towards him; then he came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not your drawing your sword the occasion of his running away?</p>
               <p>Foster. No. It was not drawn a minute.</p>

            . On the 9th of February. I went with Mr. Charlton to justice Fielding's. The prisoner was then in custody in Mr. Fielding's house. He ordered a search warrant. I went with the constable, Mr. Charlton, and another person, in order to search his house; and in a back room, in a closet on the left hand. I found two bags turn'd the wrong side outwards. These are the two bags here produced. We carried them to the justice. He said, we must keep them in our custody. The prisoner said his girl bought them of an old cloaths woman.</p>
               <p>Q. What girl was that?</p>
               <p>Keep. It is his daughter. I examined the bags in Mr. Charlton's long warehouse. There are the very same marks on these.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any ginger?</p>
               <p>Keep. No, none at all. The bags smelt very strong of ginger.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not the bags found upon a parcel of old bags ?</p>
               <p>Keep. No, they were not. There were some foul linen, a coat, and a waistcoat, in the same closet.</p>

               <p>I know nothing at all of buying any thing they accuse me of. My little girl bought the two bags of a woman, that said she found them in the street, and she put them by to put dirty cloaths in.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175702230028"/>E. Steel. His wife buys old cloaths, and he has bought a great many old rags of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at any time, and when, sell any rags to him?</p>
               <p>E. Steel. I have sold rags five or six years, and I have sold rags upwards of three years to them both. I hardly sold him any thing else, except odd things, which you properly call hand-stuff. Sometimes I have found pieces of old bags, like unto this here. (Looking on one of the two found at the prisoner's house.) I never sold him any bags at all, except what I found in the street. I did pick up two little ones, that I sold him, for which I had no more than three halfpence. I think they were something finer than these are. They weighed two pounds and a half. They were wrapped together in a lump. I never opened them any farther than to see they were bags.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you pick them up ?</p>
               <p>E. Steel. They lay as close as close could be to a door in the Strand, betwixt Somerset-house and the new church.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any mark they had ?</p>
               <p>E. Steel. No. I put them all of a lump together in my pocket apron, and went and sold them directly to his daughter, before any of the other people were up.</p>

            . I carry butter out three days in a week, and Elizabeth Steel and I have commonly a pint of purl together in a morning. We are what you may call poverty struck, and have no money. I'll tell the truth, that is best. I can't say whether it is a month, or more than three weeks, ago, that Steel pick'd up two bags and put them into her pocket apron. She said here is as much as will fetch us a morning's draught. She and, I went together to the prisoner's house. She sold them to his little girl for three halfpence, so we put a halfpenny to it, and had a pint of purl.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body by at the time ?</p>
               <p>S. Durkin. Yes, there was Charles, a soldier. He is quarter'd upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they weigh?</p>
               <p>S. Durkin. They weighed two pounds and a half. It was what she call'd hand-stuff.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know them to be bags?</p>
               <p>S. Durkin. Because I saw they were sew'd up, at the bottom, and one was thicker than the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them open'd?</p>
               <p>S. Durkin. How open'd? I saw her take them up, and put them into her pocket. They were open'd at the rag shed.</p>
               <p>Q. Who open'd them?</p>
               <p>S. Durkin. She did. You know she could not help opening them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her open them?</p>
               <p>S. Durkin. I did not see her open them.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you did not see they were bags.</p>
               <p>S. Durkin. I was very well assured they were bags.</p>
               <p>Q. What marks had they upon them?</p>
               <p>S. Durkin. I believe I could tell them again if I saw them. I believe they were black marks.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the bags made of linen or woollen?</p>
               <p>S. Durkin. Neither one nor t'other I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they made of?</p>
               <p>S. Durkin. I really can't say.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they made of leather?</p>
               <p>S. Durkin. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then tell the court what they were made of.</p>
               <p>S. Durkin. I believe they were made of such stuff that the packthread is made of, indeed.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever get it again?</p>
               <p>Banti. Yes. Justice Fielding advertised it the day after, who got it, and gave it to me again with the chain and seals, and the boy belonging to the master of the New-prison gave me the ring.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you saw the prisoner at the bar in the chapel?</p>
               <p>Banti. I saw her when she took my watch, for she was then before me. When I was going up towards the altar, to hear a little better, she presented herself before me. She put her hand to my pocket, and I felt it going. I put my hand down, and immediately missed it. I called out immediately, I had lost my watch. She was going away, and I after her as fast as I could; but the people crouded me, and prevented my going so fast as I would.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her from that time to the time Mr. Fielding gave you the watch?</p>

               <p>Banti. As I was going after her she fell down, a little way from the door, and a gentleman took her up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she immediately searched?</p>

               <p>Q. Was any thing found upon her?</p>
               <p>Banti. No. The time I was going after her in the chapel, there was a man got betwixt her and me, who prevented my taking her.</p>

               <p>I was in the chapel to hear prayers. There were a vast croud of people. A gentleman spoke in French watch, watch. A gentleman took and brought me into a long room up one pair of stairs. I was searched by two women. An English gentleman told me this man had lost his watch, and charged me with it. Then I was brought to the constable's house, and searched by his wife. Then to the Round house, and there searched again. I was strip'd naked to my shift. Then I was brought to Mr. Fielding's, and his maid searched me in a back place. I know no more of the watch than the child unborn. I had no cloak nor capuchin on.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Had she no cloak on?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. When I first saw her she had a capuchin or cardinal on; but when she fell down she drop'd it, and after that disowned it.</p>

             is my apprentice.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Seymore. I am a watchmaker; on the 11th of February he was going out to see his brother. I call'd him back, and said, take one of these watches (being winding some up) in your pocket, and bring it to time; it was to be deliver'd on the Monday following. He took it, it was a new one; he had another watch, belonging to a gentleman in Cloth-fair, to mend, a job of his own, which I allow him, to encourage him in his business; about six in the evening he returned home. He went up stairs and desired I'd go up with him. Then he told me justice Keeling desired to see me the next morning. I went, the two prisoners at the bar were there. After my servant was examin'd, then Marsh was brought in. Marsh said, they being four in company, observ'd my servant coming out of the Halfmoon passage into King-street, they saw him pulling out two watches, and one of them step'd up to him and ask'd if that watch was to be sold, or not; my servant answer'd yes, he had two to dispose of; the other ask'd him whether they were second-hand, or new ones.</p>
               <p>Q. What did your servant say to this?</p>
               <p>Seymore. He quite disown'd it, and said it was false. After that Harris was had in, who desired he might be admitted an evidence; it growing towards dinner time, Mr. Keeling desired they might be had down to Bridewell, and Harris brought again at four o'clock. Harris said he was ready then, and pull'd out a sheet of paper with I believe twenty or thirty robberies on it. At four o'clock I attended again, with my apprentice; when Harris told the justice, my apprentice offer'd the watch for sale, as Marsh had said before. Then the justice's clerk look'd my apprentice in the face, and said, Mr. Hughes, consider what an oath is, here are two young fellows brought upon a capita affair; it is a weighty thing, consider the oath you have taken, and answer me one or two questions I shall ask you.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Harris present at this time?</p>
               <p>Seymore. He was. The clerk said, did you offer to sell the watch, or deliver it into either of their hands. He then declared word for word what he said before. Harris was struck dumb directly, and wanted to be admited an evidence; but Mr. Keeling said to him, you equivocate in your account, I will not take your evidence. Harris said, if you will admit me, I'll tell the truth. The justice said; you have equivocated in this affair, how can I believe you if you drop your account thus. There was a gentleman along with the justice desired to hear his story. Then Harris said there were four of them together; they saw my apprentice come out of the Half-moon passage, and saw him pull two watches out of his pocket, and the man that robb'd him clap'd his hand to his breast and said d - n your limbs, if we don't rob you of them.</p>

            . On the fast-day about four o'clock I was coming by the end of Charterhouse-lane, to go into Long-lane. I heard the young man here charge Marsh with robbing him of his watch. I said to Marsh, you rascal give the man his watch. He said I have not got it; he pull'd one out of his pocket and said is this it? Hughes answer'd that is not mine, mine is a new one. I insisted upon Marsh's going along with me, unless he'd give him his watch; and as I was bringing him down by the end of the lane, there came a gentleman in a blue-grey coat, and said, there was a companion of that man's he believ'd ran up the Cross-keys inn-yard, in St. John's-street. I had got Marsh by the collar leading him along. I left Marsh in the care of others, and said I'd go and search the stables; we went into the yard, but Harris was got behind the gate on the inside; and when we went in, he went out. He ran up into Charterhouse-lane, somebody told us they saw him. I went up the lane, and met a porter with him. Then we took them both to justice Keeling. There I heard Harris own the robbery, and also told who were in company with him.</p>

            . I live in Charter-house-lane; on the fast-day between three and four o'clock I was sitting in my house, in Charterhouse-lane, with my family, and my little boy reading to me. I heard somebody come blundering in at the door; he seem'd to fall down; my wife got up and open'd the kitchen door. There was Harris, who forced himself into the kitchen, shut the door fast, and got his hand upon the lock, and said there were rogues; my wife said what rogues; he said rogues. I was then very ill, but I got up from my chair, and insisted upon knowing what he meant. He held the door fast. I being constable, pull'd out a drawer about five or six inches, and took out my short staff, and said, I am an officer, and insist upon your going out of my house. When I got out into the passage. I saw four or five men standing; I said to them what do you want; they said there is a man run up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175702230032"/> here that has stole a watch. I said, I have got him in my house, come in, and assist me. When I return'd back into my kitchen, the drawer that I had pull'd out a little, was then wide open. I saw my wife holding a watch up by a cat-gut string. Harris said, what do you come after me for, I know nothing of the watch. I order'd a porter to lay hold of him; he did, and took him away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before justice Keeling, when the prisoners were examin'd?</p>

I am wife to the last evidence, my husband was very ill sitting by the fire, and a little boy about eleven years old was reading to us; presently I heard a noise at the back door, and the prisoner came tumbling in; I went and asked him what was the matter, but he made no answer, and then shut the door, and said there were rogues. I said what rogues; he said rogues. My husband said, is it a press-gang, and said he'd see what rogues they were. He insisted upon my husband's not going out at the door, and had his hand on the lock, and said neither of us should go out; my husband said he was an officer, and insisted upon going out of his own house, and went to look for his short staff in a dresser-drawer; he did not put in the drawer after. I gave the prisoner a push, and my husband got out at the back-door. I look'd out at the door, and the prisoner was behind me. I heard something knock against the side of the drawer that was left open. I turn'd about to the prisoner and said, I hope you have not put any thing there; I put my hand in the drawer, and found a new watch under some rags that were there. I had not seen it but the cat-gut hung over the side of the drawer. My husband call'd a porter to assist him, and I deliver'd the watch to the porter.</p>

            . I am a porter. On the 11th of February as I was coming down Charterhouse-lane I met Harris running as hard as he could run, and hearing the people call out a thief, I turn'd and ran after him. He ran up a passage, and into the constable's house, but I was not soon enough to take hold of him. Presently Mr. South open'd the door and gave me charge of him; and his wife put this watch into my hand, which is produced here. I took him to justice Keeling, with other assistance.</p>
               <p>Q to Hughes. Look at this watch.</p>
               <p>Hughes. This is the very watch that was taken out of my hand at that time.</p>

               <p>Seymore. It is my property. I deliver'd it to Hughes that day.</p>

               <p>Marsh's Defence.</p>
               <p>We were going to Rag-fair in order to go to sea; going through the Half-moon tavern, we overtook that young man with two watches in his hand. We asked him if they were for sale, and he said yes; he offer'd the old one, but said if you don't like that here's a new one; and he proposed to go into several public houses with us. We walk'd on to Porters-block, but went into no public house. He had the watch in his hand, and gave it me; then he had it again, and said if you have a mind to have it, look at it. I had no intent to do any thing of that kind; but one of them took it and ran away.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer. On the 25th of January there had been a pot of hot brought to a place where we were at work, near <placeName id="t17570223-32-crimeloc181">Philpot-Lane</placeName>

Then the deceased took and drank it with his fellow labourers. When we came into the Cow and Calf alehouse in East-Cheap, at dinner time, there was a dispute among the labourers in the kitchen, who should pay for it. I was sitting in the fore parlour, and heard Powel say, he knew nobody that ought to pay for it more than Lenard, for nobody made themselves so busy about it was he did. I hearing words amongst them went into the kitchen. Just as I got there Lenard was got out at the door into the yard, in order to fight Powel, saying, come out, come out. I stop'd him, and ask'd him whether he was the person that ordered that pot of hot in my name or not. He said, it was not he. Powel was sitting in the kitchen. Then I went into the parlour again, and all was quiet for six or seven minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Powel say any thing?</p>
               <p>Edgerton. No, I did not at that time. After a little time I was told they were going out into the yard to fight. I went out there, and saw the prisoner and the deceased boxing over a screen. Presently they both, seemingly by consent, laid their hands to the screen, and put it aside. The deceased was in buff as it is called, and Powel with his coat button'd up, and his apron about him. They fought so some time. They closed, and Lenard got Powel's back to the window, and broke several panes of glass. After that they had about two falls. I took Powel up twice while he had his cloaths on. After this Powel drew back, finding Lenard a sufficient match for him, and strip'd into buff. Then there were not I believe above four or five blows past before Lenard drop'd down, which was, I think, from a blow. They were both striking, but I can't say I had my eye on them, so as to see it was from any particular blow. Powel did not fall after he strip'd. Lenard never spake more, but was dead; there seem'd no appearance of life in him. Powel desired he might be got up. The man that went to help him up said, he would not fight any more.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the pavement?</p>
               <p>Edgerton. It was paved with broad stones.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the deceased fall?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175702230034"/>Edgerton. He fell side ways, and turn'd himself on his face on the stones.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the blow seem to light?</p>
               <p>Edgerton. On his temple. When Powel found the other would fight no more he went to wash himself in the kitchen. Presently he heard he was dead, at which he appeared much concerned.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not the fall on the stone, contribute to the blow on the temple?</p>
               <p>Edgerton. It might.</p>

            . I was one of the workmen, and was in the tap-house when the prisoner and deceased began to fall out. Lenard began to make a noise in the house. Powel said, you make more noise than all the labourers in the work. Words arose. The deceased got up, and bid Powel turn out. Powel got up. I stop'd him, and Edgerton stop'd the deceased. After that they were at peace five or six minutes. The deceased then said to Powel, '' You are no more a freeman '' than I am, and if you do not take great care '' you shall go and serve your time over again.'' Powel said, '' You had better hold your tongue, '' or worse will come of it.'' Then the deceased got up, flung down his hat, strip'd, and out into the yard he went, and bid Powel follow him. Powel staid behind to tie his handkerchief about his head, then went after him; but I never went out of the house, I only look'd through the window. Sometimes I could see, and sometimes not, the people crouded so. When Powel came in, he ordered Mrs. Ewin to send the deceased a dram of the best gin she had in the house; saying, '' Though I have beat the man I'll send him a '' glass of gin.'' They brought him water to wash himself, and while he was putting his things on, there came word that Lenard was dead. He went out and cried, and came in crying; his heart was too full to speak much. I did not hear him speak all dinner time after.</p>

            . I was in the house when the quarrel first began, about a pot of hot. The deceased pull'd off his hat and cloaths to fight Powel. Powel first said it was not worth his while to fight with him. Lenard abused him very much, but I did not see them fight; I did not got out.</p>

            . There was a difference between the prisoner and the deceased, about a pot of hot. Lenard pull'd off his cloaths in order to fight. Powel said but little then. They were at peace for some time. Then words arose again. The deceased said, d - n his body, he'd fight him, and would lick him if he could. Then Powel said, if he'd go into the yard, he would follow him. I saw them fight in the yard, but I am but little judge of it. I was not in the yard when Lenard fell the last time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was at work when Lenard brought a pot of hot upon the scaffold. He set it down and said, d - n the hot and Edgerton too; d - n my eyes if I don't drink it, and pay for it when I have done. Soon after the clock struck twelve, our dinner time. I was the first of the bricklayers that got into the alehouse. The person that keeps it said to me, who is to pay for that pot of hot? I said, Lenard said he'd take and drink it, and I knew none more fit to pay for it, than he that drank it. In the mean time Lenard came in and said, d - n your eyes, you are a liar. Said I, it does not look well of you to give me the lie. He with another wicked expression said he'd fight me. The maid that stood by me said, don't put yourself in a passion. I said, I did not think it worth my while to daub my fingers about him. I had a piece of cold roast pork, and call'd for a pint of beer. As I was eating my dinner he kept bringing my name up, and pull'd off his cloaths to fight me. After I had dined I said, it is a strange thing you can't be quiet, and let me alone. He said, d - n your eyes, I'll fight you. Then I said, I'll have a blow or two with you; so I tied my handkerchief about my head, that he should not lay hold of my hair; I never pull'd off my cloaths. He was naked. We had a great many blows, and two or three falls. The last fall that was given, he gave me. We fell both together. My handkerchief was got off my head. He got his hands in my hair, and beat my head against the stones. I found myself very faint, so immediately drew back, in order to take my cloaths off. We had I believe about four blows after, and I believe with one of the blows that I struck him, he fell down on one side, and turned upon his face. I said to the man that helped him up, what do you let him lie there for? He said, Lenard will not fight any more. Mr. Edgerton said to me go in, and put your cloaths on. I went into the kitchen, and got a bason of water, in order to wash myself before I put my cloaths on. Word was brought that he was dead. I said, God forbid! I went out immediately, and took him up in my arms, and desired, for God sake, they would fetch some doctor, and bring him something to drink. The maid said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175702230035"/> there were three or four people gone for a person to bleed him. I held him in my arms, till with grief I was ready to drop. Then somebody took my place, and I went into the house. I made no attempt to go away, knowing there was no animosity on my side.</p>

               <p>BRACHYGRAPHY: OR, SHORT-WRITING Made easy to the meanest Capacity:</p>
               <p>The Persons, Moods and Tenses, being comprized in such a Manner, that little more than the Knowledge of the Alphabet is required to the writing Hundreds of Sentences in less Time than spoken.</p>
               <p>The whole is founded on so just a Plan, that it is wrote with greater Expedition than any yet invented, and likewise may be read with the greatest Ease.</p>
               <p>Improved (after upwards of Thirty Years Practice and Experience)</p>
               <p>By T. GURNEY, Writer of these Proceedings.</p>
               <p>N. B. The Book is a sufficient Instructor of itself; but if any Difficulty should arise, the Purchaser, by applying to the Author, may depend upon all proper Assistance, without any further Expence.</p>
               <p>Note, As SHORT HAND is a Mystery to Thousands, and a bad Method requires almost as much Time to forget, as to learn a good one; it will be necessary for all who would attain to the Knowledge of the Beauty and Usefulness of the Art, to enquire</p>
               <p>Whether the Author has, or has not given public Proof of the Merit of his Book.</p>
               <p>Whether any have learn'd it that are capable of taking down a Speech or Sermon verbatim the time it is speaking, and can read it with ease at any distance of Time. It shall be to such (and not to nameless Infants, to be found we know not where) that I shall refer any Gentleman (who will call upon me) for Satisfaction as to the Reputation of mine.</p>
