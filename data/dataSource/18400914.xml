On Tuesday, the 25th of August, I was on duty at the corner of King's Head-court, Shoe-lane, and saw the prisoner and prosecutor—the prosecu<lb/>tor said, "I give this woman in charge for robbing me of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in country Bank-notes"—I took her in charge—when we got about half-way down Harp-alley, I observed her shift about a good deal, and the wanted to walk by herself—all of a sudden she turned round and said, "I shall fetch the woman of the house"—she leant herself forward and pulled up her clothes, as it were—I had some suspicion, pushed her aside, and there lay the notes—the prosecutor was about two yards to the left of her at the time, on the other side of the gutter—I was between them—he had not gone over the spot where the notes were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you walking all close together? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> All three abreast—I had hold of the prisoner by the left arm—she had only her right hand at liberty—it was a dry starlight night—I cannot say whether there was any moon—the prisoner said, "How could I have secreted these notes when I was searched twice?"—I dare say the prosecutor was within hearing at that time—we were all three abreast—he made no answer to it.</p>

               <p>from him these notes—(<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—I asked the prosecutor if he had any private mark by which he could recognize them as his pro<lb/>perty—he said no; that he received them from various country banks, and he believed the largest number was from the Norwich bank—he said he be<lb/>lieved the sum total was 190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in tens and fives—they are tens and fives, and they amount to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a captain in the army, and am barrack-master of St. James's. I have the superintendence of the Wellington barracks—Sir Rufane Shawe Donkin, Knt., James Whitley Deans Dundas, Esq., and the Hon. George Anson, are the board officers—the prisoner, Knight, was superior barrack-serjeant—there were ordinary barrack-sergeants under him, of whom Allcock was one—on the 1st of July a contract was made with Messrs. Cory for coals—it was my practice to send a written order to the contractors for coals which were wanted for the public service—I allowed no one to apply to the contractor without my written order, which was the contractor's authority to supply the quantity there stated—it was Knight's duty to see that the quantity ordered was properly delivered—Allcock assist<lb/>ed, if he had no other duty—there was no necessity for more than one—Knight might receive and check the quantity himself, or desire Allcock to do it, or if Allcock was doing it, Knight might send him away and do it himself—this is the order which I sent to Messrs. Cory, on the 11th of July——(<hi rend="italic">The order was dated</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th July, desiring Messrs. Cory to send, on the</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">th, to the Wellington barracks twenty-four tons of coals, for the</hi> 3<hi rend="italic">rd battalion of Grenadier Guards, and twelve tons to go into the barrack-masters store</hi>)—it would be the duty of Knight or Allcock, whichever attended to the receipt of the coals, to receive the tickets sent with them, to see that the quantity mentioned in the tickets was received, and to file the tickets in my office—the account is made up quarterly from the tickets, and I give a certificate for the quantity so certified as having been re<lb/>ceived—these tickets (<hi rend="italic">producing some</hi>) refer to that order of the 15th July—I keep a double entry of these things, one in a private book and the other in a public book, in which entries are made by Knight in the office—that entry—(<hi rend="italic">referring to it</hi>)—represents the coals ordered on the 15th to amount to twenty-four tons, received for the use of 3rd battalion of Grenadier Guards, and twelve tons as received into my store.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184009140011"/>
               <p>—I told Allcock that he was to superintend the delivery of coals from the commencement of July—I gave him a written order to that effect—I told him he was to be present at the receipt of all coals, candles, wood, and straw, commencing on the 1st of July—that was to enable Knight to attend more to my books—he had before that occasionally attended to the delivery of coals, not always—if Allcock was otherwise engaged, he might attend—if Allcock could attend Knight need not be present, but he could send Allcock away to any other duty, and attend himself—one or the other must see them delivered—I have been barrack-master at the Wellington barracks about four years and a half, and have known Knight during that time—he always gave me every satisfaction before—I had no fault to find with him—he was there before me—we occasionally take stock of what remains in the barrack-master's store—no deficiency has ever been dis<lb/>covered—there has sometimes been a surplus in some trifling articles.</p>

                  </hi>, Jun. I am in partnership with my father, as coal-merchants, and carry on business at Barge-house Wharf, Lambeth. On the 11th of July Allcock came to me with this order for twenty-four and twelve tons of coals, at 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a ton—he came into the counting-house, closed the door, and said that a saving could be effected; that, instead of twenty-four tons, we need only send twenty, and instead of twelve, eight; but that we should send the tickets for the twenty-four and the twelve tons, and that receipts would be given us for those quantities—our suspi<lb/>cions had been excited before this, and I was instructed by my father, in case a proposal of this sort was made, to dissemble my feelings, that we might expose them—I therefore told Allcock that he must see my father—he said nothing further to me about money—I said as little to him as I could.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Cory. I was on the premises on the 13th of July—Knight and Allcock came there together, and asked for Mr. Cory the elder—I told them he was at the market—Allcock said, in Knight's presence, that there were coals to go to the Wellington Bar<lb/>racks, that they should not want so many as were ordered, and he asked me if I thought Mr. Cory would give them the money for the coals that they did not want—I said I thought he would not—Allcock said 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton was what they expected—they were there about a quarter of an hour—Allcock said he was barrack-sergeant, and Knight was his superior, and that it was usual for other contractors to do so—I referred them to Mr. Cory, and said he would be back by half-past four o'clock—they waited till he came—I did not hear what passed between them—I afterwards received instructions from Mr. Cory how to act, and next afternoon Allcock came to the counting-house, and took two tickets from me for four tons each—Mr. Cory had told me he was coming for them, and to give them to him—Allcock told me he had come for the tickets—the delivery took place on the 15th—twenty tons were sent for the troops, and eight tons for the barrack-master's store, and I sent tickets corresponding with that quantity—in the afternoon, after the delivery, the prisoners came to the counting-house both together—Knight said he had come to give the</p>

               <p>receipt for the coals—I took a piece of paper and wrote a receipt, which he signed in my presence—this is it—Allcock said nothing—he stood by—(<hi rend="italic">this receipt was signed, "James Knight, superior barrack-sergeant" and acknowledged the delivery of twenty-four and twelve tons of coals</hi>)—after Knight had signed it, they still waited about, and did not seem disposed to go—I asked them if they expected the money—they both said, "Yes"—I said I thought it would be time enough to pay them when we received the money—they said they had given the receipt, and every thing would be right—I still declined to pay them, and said I must consult Mr. Cory before I could do so; upon which, Knight said Allcock should come over next day—they then went—next day Allcock came, and I then paid him 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in doing that, and every thing else, I acted under Mr. Cory's directions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was this the first contract Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am a partner with my son. We had the contract in question—on the afternoon of the 13th of July Allcock called on me, and said he was aware that contracts were taken at a low price, and therefore it would, no doubt, be acceptable to us to make a saving—he then stated that he had brought two orders, one for twenty-four, the other, for twelve tons, and out of those two a saving could be effected of four tons on each, and they should expect an allowance for the coals not delivered—he did say who he meant by <hi rend="italic">they</hi>—he said former contractors had done the same thing—I told him I must take time to consider of it, and he might see me next day—I had suspicions, and appeared to humor the thing—I felt I had no other course to pursue, as an honest man—I had had no commu<lb/>nication with Government about it at that time—he seemed alarmed, and said he hoped, if I did not consent, that I would not expose him—Mr. Hawes, M. P. for Lambeth, lives next door to me—I went to him, and communicated what had passed—I had appointed for Allcock to come next afternoon, which he did, and I consented to his proposition—I stated that I thought he wanted a very large proportion of the benefit arising from it—he wanted 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton—he observed, "Oh, but you save the cartage on the coals you don't deliver," which had never occurred to me, and I thought it very ingenious of him—the cartage would be 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton—I think that was all that passed—I let the coals be delivered according to their desire—I was authorized to do so, and I gave instruc<lb/>tions to Mr. Park how to act.</p>

I was walking with the prosecutrix—the prisoner ran against her, and struck her with a stick—I could not see what sort of a stick it was, it was done so momentary—I laid hold of him, and tried to get the stick—I did not notice it, but I had hold of it several times—we wrestled together, and fell on the ground—I was on the ground five or six or seven minutes—he got up and got away from me—a female held my hands, and tried to rescue him from me—he got up—I do not know whether he ran or not, but the moment I got up I ran towards where he went, and found him in the policeman's hands, I should think twenty-eight or twenty-nine yards from where it happened—it was gas-light, I could see the prisoner clearly—I had never seen him before—I did not notice the stick in the struggle.</p>

I was on duty on the night of the 24th of August, about half-past twelve o'clock, and heard loud screams of "Murder" and "Police"—I went up—the prisoner came towards me, and wished to give Burkitt in charge for assaulting him—he was very drunk, and very greatly excited too—the prosecutrix came up, and gave him in charge for assaulting her—she was bleeding very much at the side of her head—I took the prisoner to the station-house—he was charged with striking the prosecutrix—he said Burkitt had struck him first—I kept the prisoner at the station-house till next morning—while he was there, this stick was brought to the station-house—I showed it to him at Worship-street, and he said it was his—I have the prosecu<lb/>trix's</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 61, Upper Seymour-street, Portman-square, in the parish of St. Marylebone. The prisoner Bugler was my butler and footman in June last, and had been in my service some time—early in this year I had a 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank-note—my banker's book was enclosed in this paper, sealed up, and I placed the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in the fold of the paper—I cannot remember when it was—it was probably four or five months from this time—the note was quite concealed from any body but myself—a person lifting the parcel up had an opportunity of seeing the note without breaking the seal—I wrote on the cover the number of the note—it is here in pencil—I put it into a drawer in my bed-room, which is over the back room—I keep waste paper and articles of no value in that drawer—I called it a litter drawer—it was not locked—on the 13th of July I had occasion to look for my banker's book—I had often looked at the parcel, but not opened it, but I had satisfied myself that the note was there about a fortnight or three weeks before the 13th of July—on the 13th of July I opened the parcel, and found the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was gone—I made a commu<lb/>nication to the Bank of England—I had written the letter "M" on the note—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it corresponds with the number on the envelope, and has my initial "M" on it—Mrs. Martin is in the habit of seeing a great many female acquaintances on Sunday, and did so on the 28th of June—at the time of receiving the ladies it was Bugler's duty to be in the hall or library adjoining from two till six o'clock—his duty was in the lower part of the house—he could have no duty to perform which would require him to go into my bed-room at that time—if my slippers had been in my bed-room, it was the duty of the housemaid to fetch them down, not his—I went out on Sunday, the 28th of June, be<lb/>tween two and three o'clock, to take a walk, and was gone between two and three hours.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the housemaids in the prosecutor's ser<lb/>vice. In June last, Bugler was the footman—Bathgate used to come to the house to see him—I came into the service on the 9th of April, the last time, and within about six weeks I saw Bathgate coming to visit Bugler—he used to come two or three times a week—he did not come for two months before Bugler was taken into custody—mistress was in the habit of seeing visitors on Sunday—I recollect the last Sunday in June, (the 28th,) very well—master went out about two o'clock—the other housemaid went out at the same time as master, and the cook was out all the morning—Bugler and I were the only servants in the house—mistress was at home—two or three visitors came in between two and three o'clock—I had occasion to go up stairs to my master's bed-room—it was not particularly in my care—the other housemaid has the care of it as well, but Bugler had nothing to do with it—I went up to make the bed about five minutes after master was gone out—the bed-room is over the back drawing-room—I made the bed and came down—I brought down the slippers, and put them in the library—I went up stairs almost directly afterwards with a jug of water, and saw Bugler coming down on the upper stairs, between the bed-room and drawing-room—he bad no business at all up those stairs at that time—I said, "Where the deuce have you been, Bugler?"—he said, "For the slippers"—I told him I had brought them down—he was in a tremble, I recollect, and when he came down into the dining-room I asked him what was the matter with him, as he appeared very ill—he said he was ill, and asked me to fetch him some spirits, but I did not—he stopped in the dining-room a very short time, and then went down stairs—from the dining-room window I can see the area steps—after he had gone down I was at the dining-room window, and saw Bugler let Bathgate out—up to that time I did not know that Bathgate was in the house—I had not let him in—I saw him come out of the area—Bugler let him out at the area gate with the key—he unlocked it—they spoke to one another before they parted—Bugler came back to me in the dining-room, and said, <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>

               <p>(meaning Bathgate) had been again bothering him for some money—on the following Wednesday night, I was ironing in the kitchen, and heard a ring at the bell—I went into the area and found Bugler at the gate, or I should have gone up to answer the gate—Bathgate was outside the gate—they were talking—Bathgate appeared to be tipsy—I went back to the kitchen—Bugler returned to the kitchen in about five minutes, and said, <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi> was quite tipsy, and he had come for some money, but he should come again next morning, and that he was going into the country to see his wife—I never saw him again till I saw him in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stable-keeper, and live in Ely-mews, Ely-place, Holborn. I have known Bathgate since 1822—I saw him in June last at my place—I cannot tell about what time in the month it was—it must have been, I think, the latter end—he came to me, and said he should want me in the course of two or three days—I asked what for—he told me he wanted me to take a note to the Bank of England, to get change for a 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank-note—I asked him whether it was a just, honest note—he said yes, it was—nothing was said about where it was—two or three days after<lb/>wards he came to the stable, and showed me a 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—he asked me whether I would go and get it changed—he said nothing as to where he got it—I Was before the Magistrate about this—(<hi rend="italic">looking at his deposition</hi>)—I cannot read without my glasses—he did not say any thing when he brought it, or before he brought it, as to where it came from, or was to come from.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he say any thing about a drawer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said there was a drawer up stairs, where there was a 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—that was three or four days before I saw the note—it was not the first time he came to me, I believe it was the second—it was before he brought it—he said it was to be got at, that he could take and get it in five or ten minutes' notice—he came and showed me the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note three or four days afterwards—when he brought it he said he wanted me to get change for it at the Bank of England—I told him no, I would have nothing to do with it, I had been in town thirty-two years—he said, "You are an old fool, and will never do yourself any good"—he went away—in an hour and a half I saw him again—he brought a bit of a note for me to take to a man in Barbican, to get the change of a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, where he had bought a Macintosh coat—I went to the house, and saw the man there, and gave him the note—he looked at me, and sent a boy with me with the change, instead of giving it to me—the boy did not give</p>

               <p>Bathgate the change in my presence—I found Bathgate in the mews, and called him out of the stable, but did not see the boy speak to him—I did not see the boy go away—after that Bathgate asked me how I was getting on—I said, very poorly, and things were very bad with me; and he gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for going with the note—he went up stairs at my place—I had a box there, which I gave him, as he said he wanted a box—I did not see him take it away, or put any thing into it—I then went a public-house, and when I returned Bathgate was gone, and the box also—this is the box—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I kept the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note about a week, and changed it at Spiller's—I think I saw him write my name on it—I have changed notes there before—(<hi rend="italic">looking at</hi> No. 1313)—I see "Gardner, Ely-mews," written on this, and "4—7—40, J. H. S."—no doubt that is what Spiller wrote when I paid him the note—I have no doubt this is the note I paid him—I never knew Mr. Martin, nor where he lived—I never heard the name of Mr. Martin mentioned in any conversation I had with Bath<lb/>gate—(<hi rend="italic">looking at his deposition</hi>)—Bathgate told me he could get the note by a person who cleaned boots and shoes outside the door, but he never had access to the house—he never mentioned Mr. Martin's name—I never knew Mr. Martin's name till after I was taken to Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>

On the 22nd of August I saw a crowd in Long-acre—I took the prisoner into custody—he was walking away from Mr. Martin's towards the eastward—a person in the crowd said it was a pity he should be allowed to go away, as he had been murdering the boy—we had a little tussle together at first—he had his hands in his pocket—I took them out, thinking he might have some instrument there—he then said to me, "I know you very well, and will go quietly along with you; I have done very wrong, I am free to confess it; I meant for three days to murder him, and thank God I have not killed him"—he said he had deprived him of his bread—I cautioned him against making use of such words, and asked if he had not been drinking—he denied that he had, and repeated the same words again six or seven times—it was about nine o'clock in the morning—I received this instrument from some person at the station-house—the pri<lb/>soner said when he saw it, "Ah, that is it."</p>

On Saturday, the 22nd of August, Hood was brought to me about nine, o'clock in the morning—I examined his left arm, and found three punc<lb/>tured wounds, about half an inch deep—they were such wounds as the instrument produced would make—I do not think they will at all impair the action of the arm—they were healed within ten days or a fortnight—I believe he can use his arm as well as before.</p>

BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I understood you to call yourself Mrs. Ivers, are you married? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not—I never have been—I call myself Miss Ivers—I keep the house, and have two lodgers sometimes—they are not always women of the town—I have had a respectable lodger there about two years ago, a gentleman—he was not a friend of a female lodger—he remained there for some months—he was a foreign gentleman, and his name was Mr. Stone—he paid me his rent—Miss Wilson and Miss Thompson were my lodgers at that time—Miss Thompson is living there still—she is not here, that I see—I have no reason to believe that she is—I went home after one o'clock—I had not been to the theatre—I had been out walking—I had gone out after nine o'clock—I had been walking part of the time, and standing talking to a lady friend, and part of the time takine a glass of wine, one glass or more, probably two—I had not taken enough to do me harm—I had been down Regent-street—I do not know the name of the wine vaults—they were on the right-hand side—I went in there about ten o'clock—I remained there a quarter of an hour with a lady friend, no one else—I did not converse with any one else—I asked for the wine, I forget what wine it was—it was not a bottle—I asked for a glass of wine—the landlord might have spoken to me, no one else—I laid down on the sofa because I was fatigued—I seldom visit wine vaults.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an old soldier, and lodge at the Blue Anchor, in York-street, Westminster—I am a pensioner at Chelsea Hospital—on Saturday night, the 29th of August, I was at the corner of Tothill-street, and saw four young men in company—the prisoner was one of them—I heard one say, "What have you <hi rend="italic">made?</hi>"—the prisoner said, "I have made this here," (drawing a watch out of his trowsers pocket,) the other remarked, "A very good day's work"—in consequence of that I followed them about a hundred yards, saw a constable and told him of it—we fol<lb/>lowed them through the churchyard, and sent another to cut off their retreat—they were all secured and taken to the station-house—I attended at the police-office on Monday, and saw Julia Murphy there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable.

               <p>—I asked who of—he refused to tell, and said he would satisfy the Magis<lb/>trate—I asked his own name—he gave his own name and address correctly, "51, Marsham-street, Westminster"—he was not locked up, as his name and address was correct—he came to the police-office at Queen-square, on Monday, to claim the watch—Murphy was there, she saw it in my hand, and said it was her mistress's watch—I then secured the prisoner and took him before the Magistrate, and as soon as she saw him, she identified him as having been at her mistress's house—he was among other persons—she immediately tapped me on the shoulder, pointed him out, and said "That is the man there"—I believe what he said before the Magistrate was not taken down, but I will not swear it.</p>

                  </hi>. On 15th of August, I was living as servant to Miss Ivers—Miss Thompson lodged there, and came home about half-past eleven at night, with a person—the prisoner is the person, I am certain—I had seen him there once before—on the Saturday night I saw him in her room—I was three or four minutes in the room with him and Miss Thomp<lb/>son, and had an opportunity of looking at him—I was there when my mis<lb/>tress came home—the prisoner had not left the house then—I am quite sure he did not go out till half-past one o'clock—I did not let him out, but I did not lie down before half-past one, and he could not have gone out before that without my knowledge—in the course of the night, I was called up by a policeman, who said the street door was open—I did not tell my mistress of that—next morning I heard of the watch being stolen, and was sent away—on the Saturday night, a week after, I was taken up on suspicion, and was discharged—I was afterwards at the Police-office on the 31st, about a friend of mine who was taken up for being drunk—I saw one policeman showing the watch to another—I immediately said, "That is my mistress's watch"—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is it, and the chain I am sure is mistress's—I asked the policeman if there was not a small chain to it, and found there was—I was afterwards taken into the office, where there were several people standing, and the instant I saw the prisoner, I recognized him as having visited Miss Thompson—I am quite sure of him.</p>

In consequence of information from Fowler I went up to the prisoner's bed-room—(he slept on the premises)—I found him there, and charged him with having stolen three dozen of stockings—he denied it—another porter was then in the room—I desired him to leave, and I then told the prisoner it was no use his denying it, as I had a witness who saw him do it—he then said, if I would go down stairs, he would give them to me—I went with him to the back kitchen—he there put his hand into a box containing waste paper, took out two parcels, and gave them to me—one was in a white paper, and the other in a blueish paper—he said, "There they are sir"—I sent for an officer—these are the parcels—I can identify them by the marks on the wrappers—they contain silk stockings.</p>

On Tuesday, the 18th of August, the prisoner asked me to go with him to his landlord's house, at No. 8, Gower-place, where he said he had a job, to put up some gutters and pipes—I saw him take from my master's ware-house four lengths of pipe, and two lengths of gutter—he took nothing else then—I saw him take the elbow in the morning—I did not see him take any thing else that day—after he had put these pipes and gutters up,</p>

               <p>he told me, if Mr. Jack should ask me about it, to say he had three lengths of pipe, and 1 length of gutter.</p>

On Monday night, the 31st of August, about twelve o'clock, I met the prisoner Jones on the City-road bridge—she said she had travelled some distance, and was fatigued and thirsty,—she asked me to treat her with a pint of beer, and said that in the first turning to the left over the bridge there was a public-house, and asked if I would go there—I said I had no objection, but I would not go out of my road—finding there was no public-house, I did not go down the turning a great distance, but told her I would give her a penny—I had my purse in my right-hand browsers pocket—there was a half-sovereign, six half-crowns four shillings, and a sixpence in it—I was looking for the penny, when she put her hand into my pocket and took out my purse with its contents—I am quite sure she</p>

I was in Lamb's Conduit-street, on the 29th of August, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, and saw the prisoner in that street—my attention was attracted by seeing him at a shutter there, the bolt of which I had found loose about a week before—i did not see him doing any thing with the bolt, but having found it loose just before, and knowing that he had just inspected it, I was induced to watch him—I followed him to Chapel-street, and saw him go into the doorway of Mr. Hicks's house, No. 2—I stationed myself in Mr. Hayward's doorway, nearly opposite, and saw the prisoner's arm in motion, as if he was wrenching something off Mr. Hicks's door, as if he was twisting something round—I watched him for about five minutes altogether—he came out of the doorway, and cried the hour, "Past twelve o'clock"—I believe he is a private watchman—he then went back again, and I observed him wrenching at the doorway again—he left the doorway shortly after again, and I went to it, and ascertained that the brass knob, which I bad seen safe shortly after twelve o'clock, was gone—I followed the prisoner, and overtook him in Chapel-street—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Jack,</hi> what have you done with that knob?"—he is known among us by the name of Jack—he ordered me to stand off, and then raised his stick, and attempted to strike me on the side of my head—I caught the blow on my arm, and told him I should search him—he again told me to stand off—I said if he did not submit to be searched, I should take him to the station-house—I laid hold of him, and I believe I unbuttoned one button of his great coat, but he unbuttoned two or three more, took the knob out, and threw it on the ground from the bosom of his great coat—I am not certain whe<lb/>ther he had a pocket in that great coat or not, but he took it from the bosom—he made some observation, which I do not exactly recollect, but I think it was, "There, take it," or something of that kind—I sprang my rattle, and Frier, another policeman, came up, and we took the prisoner to the station-house—when Friday came, the prisoner said he had not touched the knob for the night—on my return from the station-house I rang at Mr. Hicks's bell, but it was not answered—on the following morning, about nine o'clock, I gave information to Mr. Hicks—I got a nut-screw from the house, and it fits the knob—on our way to the station-house the pri<lb/>soner said he knew the knob to be safe at ten o'clock, which he had pre<lb/>viously denied any knowledge of.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you never said, "There is a b——d old watchman down the bottom of the street, I will roll him in the kennel before the night is over, and will have him off the beat if possible; there are two or three on the look-out for him, and he shall not be on the beat another week?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never said that—part of your statement is correct—I have said, "There is an old watchman down here, who has been a great deal of trouble to us, obstructing us in our duty," but I have said, "He is too old and insignifi<lb/>cant, he is not worth more trouble about him, I shall roll him in the kennel"—I never said there were two or three on the look-out for him—I have said, "We are on the look-out," but never mentioned two or three—we had received orders to look out for him—I said it was likely he would not be on the beat another week; and I will state what induced me to say so: about ten days before the knob was missed there were two bolts missed from the shutters of Mr. Hay ward's shop; I gave information to the sergeant that these bolts were gone, and he was impressed with an idea that the prisoner had taken them, because from the manner I go round my beat it is almost impossible for a man to go into Chapel-street, and be there two minutes, without my knowledge; the sergeant went and searched the prisoner very slightly, and afterwards in coming down the street I heard him in conversation with a bricklayer, who, I believe, lives in Robert-street, and he told the bricklayer that the sergeant was a d—fool, for he had the knobs in his pocket all the while he was searching him, and if he had searched him properly he would have found them—he was not taken before a Magistrate on that charge, because we did not find them—he was not taken before Mr. Rogers at Hatton-garden, nor did Mr. Rogers reprimand the police for it, to my knowledge—I do not know Mr. Rogers—I should not say that the prisoner had reason to know we were watching him—private persons are not to know the orders we have from our superior officers—it is not to be expected if a thief knows I am to watch him, that he will commit a robbery on my beat—I do not know Mr. Tyler—I have seen the name—I recollect two or three gentlemen speaking to me once, whether Mr. Tyler was one of them I do not know—I do not recollect his saying to me that I seemed to be a very young man for a policeman—I will not swear he did not say so—I might have answered, "I look younger than I really am"—I do not know whether I said, "I am a foreigner, a Spaniard, but it is not generally known, or I suppose I should not be in the police"—I will not swear whether I did or not—I do not know a Mr. Wilson—I know there is a gentleman of that name in Chapel-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Biggins (who mar<lb/>ried my mother) in Tom'ngton-place, St. Pancras. The prisoner is my brother, and lived in the same house. On Sunday, the 6th of September, about half-past two, we were at dinner—the prisoner was sitting at the table at the opposite corner to me—he took up a tumbler, and threw it at my head—I had said nothing to induce him to do so—I saw him take it up, and turned my head—it hit me on the right side of my head—after that I saw him take up a knife off the table—I then ran out of the room—my head was bleeding—MR. Hunter, the surgeon, dressed it—my brother had told me, about eight o'clock the night before, that he would murder me—I had given him no provocation to throw the tumbler at me—the tumbler was broken by the blow, and cut me—I had not said a word to him the night before when he said he would murder me—he was not in a passion, he was in earnest—I was not good friends with him—he had used me bad, and I ran away for two days before, and kept from home.</p>

                  </hi>. I married Mrs. Hollingsworth. I am a clerk in the City—I was at dinner on Sunday, the 6th of September—the prisoner came down from the bed-room to dinner in a suppressed agitated manner, with his lips clenched, and his countenance grinning as if he wished to con<lb/>ceal his agitation—he had not sat down five minutes before he took up the tumbler and threw it at his brother's head, with all his might, and he began to rave about murder and revenge—he vowed he would have his revenge while one of the family were left—he did not say for what—he then seized the carving-knife—I immediately rushed on him and seized both his hands, and his other brother disarmed him; his mother, in trying to seize the knife, had it drawn through her fingers, and she rushed out of the room—his brother Joseph assisted in detaining him—I thought he was going to stab his brother—there was no cause of quarrel—the prisoner is a medical stu<lb/>dent—I moved to this house in consequence of his not being satisfied where I lived, and that he might be near the London University—I have known him nearly four years—I always thought him half-mad, but am most de<lb/>cidedly of opinion that he is deranged now—I do not think he was of sound mind at the time he took the tumbler up—I offered him liberal terms to prevent this coming into Court, and he said he would rather it came into Court—he talked of going to church and addressing the congre<lb/>gation about me—he once held a knife to his throat, and threatened to cut it when we came from church—he once threw up the window and called the police, and said he would go to prison—I called a surgeon in on one occasion—he was apprenticed to Mr. Rayner, of Uxbridge—three weeks ago last Sunday, he said his mother must take a post-chaise and bring him to London—on the 5th of September the younger brother slept out from fear of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Hart-street, Bloomsbury. On Sunday, the 6th of September, I went to Mr. Biggins's house, and examined the prosecutor's head—I found a contused wound on the right side of the head—the hair was saturated with blood, and the collar of his shirt deeply stained with blood—it was a wound very likely to be inflicted with a tumbler, if he turned his head to avoid the blow coming in front—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184009140071"/>
               <p>I did not consider it a dangerous wound, being superficial—I saw the pri<lb/>soner on that occasion, and from what he said I can form a judgment of his state of mind—I can only judge of what he said from the evidence of other parties—I judged from what I saw of him—I consider his state of mind to be insane, with lucid intervals—I think him insane at that time—I asked him his motive for having attacked his brother in this atrocious way—he was dogged, and would give no answer, but said he would go to prison—I reasoned with him, whether it would not be better to remain in his father's house and behave better in future—he disclaimed all idea of good behaviour, saying he would do the same thing over and over again, and wished to go to prison—his look was not furious, but it was the look of an insane man, to my judgment—I have seen insane persons—he had that peculiar look which is indescribable, a coward-like quivering of the lip, and his face effused with blood—I was sent for by his parents again, to inquire if he would ask forgiveness, and engage that he would not attempt the same again, and they would provide for him to reside at my house—he refused—I saw him also in the hall, and again asked him to promise to behave better, and come and live with me, and give me a pledge that he would never attempt such things—he said, "No, I will give no pledge whatever—I will give no promise—I will do it again and again"—his mother said, "Will you give Mr. Hunter any pledge that you won't do it again?"—he said, "No, I will give no pledge, I will do it again and again, I will go to prison"—this makes me feel that he is labouring under a blind influence, which he considers he has no power to counteract, and that he is morally not guilty, because he says, "I cannot help it."</p>

I have known the pri<lb/>soner since 1838—I attended him when at school at Uxbridge—he is now about 21 or 22 years old—he was apprenticed to me—I attended him while at school for an affection of the brain of so violent a character, that I would not take the responsibility on my own shoulders, and urged the master to send him home instantly—I imagined he would have a brain fever—that is a disease which very often leaves a permanent affection on the mind—people do not recover their mind at all sometimes after brain fever—it was a very violent brain fever—he was then 13 or 14—it was a surprise to me that he recovered—he was apprenticed to me about six months ago or more, with the sole view that his education should be gone through with at Univer<lb/>sity College—it was a matter of convenience for him that he was appren<lb/>ticed to me, that he might effect his studies at the College—he was not to serve me as an apprentice for my convenience—I had him down at Ux<lb/>bridge in July—he left me, I think, in August—he was not with me more than a fortnight—he was occasionally at my house—I noticed that he was in a very excited, nervous, irritable state—I could not account for his con<lb/>duct—it appeared extraordinary to a degree—I formed an opinion as to the state of his mind-that he is occasionally out of his mind—perhaps I should mention that he always entertained the greatest affection for his brother, and it is a mark of insanity that that affection should turn to the most entire hatred.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Daniel Neale, and live in Walt<lb/>ham-place, Whitechapel. The prisoner is my husband's mother. On the 1st of September, I was at my husband's sister's house in King-street, Wapping—the prisoner and her sister came up to my place afterwards, and brought my husband with them—as I went up stairs the three of them attacked me together on the stairs, and I got cut in the left hand—I do not know which of them did it—I cannot swear the prisoner did it—she had threatened me about a fortnight or three weeks ago, but she was drunk at the time—she is an old woman, and I do not wish to injure her—I was not much hurt—the three of them beat me together—I cannot say of one more than another—she can understand English, but cannot speak it.</p>

I and my daughter were in Chapel-street last Sunday evening—I felt something at my pocket, felt, and missed my handkerchief, which was safe seven or eight minutes before—I immediately turned round, laid hold of the prisoner, and accused him of having it—he denied it, but I saw it tucked under his arm—he said, "Don't hold me so tightly"—I said I was determined to give him into cus<lb/>tody—I knew that if I let him go he would have slipped off his jacket and got away—he then gave himself a twist, and dropped the handkerchief—my daughter took it up.</p>

On the 31st of August she was not at home, and I got tea myself—while I was at tea, I ordered her to bring up the spoons, and they were gone—I went down into the kitchen, and said I was determined to have them—she then said she had pawned three, and she gave me the du<lb/>plicates—I went to the closet and found there were nine missing—I went to Mr. Edwards, in Hoxton, where the duplicates led me—I there found nine spoons, two sheets, a shirt, and a handkerchief—these are the articles—the sheets are marked with my name and also the spoons.</p>

Lowther as a sweep,)—he said he had been told yesterday' to come—I told him I had heard nothing of it, and he could not sweep the chimney then, as I was going to bring in breakfast—he said, "Very well," and, as he turned his bag on one side, I perceived a hole in it, and something white shining through it—I asked what he had got in his bag—he said soot—I told him it was not soot, there was something white shining through a hole in the bag—he said sometimes pieces of white paper got in with the soot—he threw his bag over his shoulder—I per<lb/>ceived something more, shining white, and asked him again what he had got in his bag—he said, "If you think there is any thing wrong in my bag I will leave it"—I wished him to leave it—he was walking on all the time of this conversation, and I followed him through the servants' hall to the area—he told me he would leave the bag in the dust-hole—I followed him to the dust-hole—he left the bag there, went up the area steps, and went away with the sweep's brush in his hand—I then went to the bag, opened it, and took out a towel which laid on the op—it was marked "L. No. 24"—I knew it was my master's—finding my master's property was in the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a smith, and live at No. 14, Clark's-buildings, Broad-street, Bloomsbury. I know the prisoner—he is a sweep—I have known him eighteen months—I remember the night of Wednes<lb/>day, the 2nd of September—I was at the Mogul public-house, in Drury-lane—there was a concert there that evening—I was there with the pri<lb/>soner and a friend of the name of Owen—when we parted that night Owen said he had a two years' engagement at Manchester, and we should not see him for a good while, for if it suited him, he should stay there; and he said, "You may as well come to the Spread Eagle to-morrow morning, and see me off"—we went the next morning to the Spread Eagle, Gracechurch-street, a little after seven o'clock, and Owen went off by the conveyance to the railway about twenty minutes after seven o'clock—after he was gone we met Mr. Russell, who formerly kept the Antelope public-house—that was about half-past seven o'clock—he said, "There you are"—(he knew us from using his house)—he said, "It is a nasty morning, will you take a drop of any thing to drink?"—we said we did not mind—he said, "I have got a friend here not far off," and Mr. Rus<lb/>sell, the prisoner, and I all went to Mr. East's, at the White Hart tap,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184009140081"/>
               <p>Liverpool-street, Bishopsgate—we had something to drink, and staid there, as near as I can guess, an hoar, or it might be above an hour, and it was half-past seven o'clock when we got there—the prisoner and I came out—we left Mr. Russell—the prisoner and I went on towards the west end—we had something to drink once or twice in going along—we went on to a coffee-shop, and there we had breakfast—I parted with the prisoner about ten o'clock—I went to the police-office, but Mr. Robinson said I should not be heard.</p>

On the 7th or 8th of April I received a letter, purporting to come from the prisoner, in consequence of which I sent a written answer—MR. Bird was at that time out of town—he returned on the 8th of April—on Thursday, the 9th, I went to the prisoner's house, in Spencer-street, Clerkenwell, between ten and eleven o'clock, and took with me half-a-dozen gold watches—he selected two, and said he wanted them for a customer, he would show them to him, and give me an answer in the afternoon—I cannot be positive whether he said the time, but I think he said about two o'clock—he did not return an answer that afternoon—I called that evening, but did not see him—the day alter he called at the counting-house and saw Mr. Bird, and asked permission to keep them till Monday—he said the customer had seen them, but as they were for his wife he wished her to see them, and he was to return them on Monday, at two o'clock—he said they were in the country—on the Monday afternoon I called, and did not see him—he was denied—I called twice, and the third time I called they said he was not at home—I said I would see Mrs. Evered, then the prisoner came, and asked me to walk up stairs—I went up with him, and asked him if he had got the watches—he said no, but he would write by the mail, and send it in a parcel, it being too late to send a letter—on the Tuesday the watches were applied for again—MR. Bird called on him once or twice, but did not see him, but left a message with his wife, and that produced a note—MR. Bird and myself both went on the 15th, but we have never got them back.</p>

My sister, Eliza Dickinson, brought up the prisoner, and he sat down in a chair in her room, where I was—the watch was over the mantel-shelf—my sister went out, and in about two minutes the prisoner asked me for a light—I got him one, and met him about half-way across the room—he smoked his pipe for about three minutes—he then shook up his pocket, and said, "Let me see if I have got any change"—he pulled out of his pocket a band which goes round a hat—he said, "Is this any use?"—I said, "Yes, a little"—my little brother had it, and tied it round his head—the pri<lb/>soner then said, "Do you like apples?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I will go and buy you some"—he then went down, and did not return—I missed the watch directly he was gone, and when my brother came home, I sent him to my sister—no one but the prisoner had been in the room.</p>

I have lived at Portsmouth, but not for some years—I boarded at Mr. Mills's, No. 67, Hatton-garden, for a month—I afterwards went to live in Hatfield-street, Blackfriars-road—I was going to the house of Dr. Rigby, in Spring-gardens, on a Saturday, I think it was the 29th of August—I was standing at the end of Stamford-street—my niece stopped me, on account of a horse, from crossing, but a person came to me and for<lb/>cibly led me across the way—I have lost my sight—he then kept my arm, and said he was going my way and would direct me—I had not told him I was going to Dr. Rigby's—I asked who and what he was, whether he was a po<lb/>liceman, I wished to know who was assisting me—he said he had lost one eye, that he had been blind, and felt so much afflicted at seeing a person in the same situation, that he had offered to assist me—my niece is only thirteen years old, and was afraid to say any thing—I asked him how he got his living—he said he worked at the Bolt-in-Tun inn, at the Portsmouth coach—I said, "Oh, we are going down by that coach"—he said he was the Ports<lb/>mouth coachman—I said I had a trunk at Hatton-garden—he said he should drive the coach, and should think it no trouble to take my luggage, whatever it was—I said it was very little, that it was at my landlady's, in Hatfield-street—he inquired the nature of it—I asked if he was a porter, and if he had a ticket—he said, at his house they did not wear tickets—I said my trunk was at the house in Hatton-garden—he asked if I would allow him to fetch the luggage from Hatton-garden, as it would be more convenient to have it together, and convey it to Hatfield-street, but I de<lb/>clined allowing him—I had said that my niece was very small, and I wished them to take her at half price—he said he could arrange that, for, if he was not the proprietor, he was connected with the coach—he went as far as Dr. Rigby's with roe, and said, if I would allow him, he would see us back again, but my niece said he was dirtily dressed, on my asking her, and I asked Dr. Rigby's servant to send him away when he came to fetch us—when I got to Hatfield-street I told ray landlady what had oc<lb/>curred, and not to let him see me—he came there, and she sent him away—he came a second time, wishing to see me—I heard him tell the land-lady he wished to see me, as he had brought a receipt for the payment of the fare—it was the same voice—I did not exactly hear what he said, I paid very little attention to what he said—he pressed for the whole fare—I said I had a friend opposite the Bolt-in-Tun, and he would arrange about the fare—he asked me repeatedly on the road before, to give him the money, and at the house he said he could not book the place without the fare—I knew by his voice he was the same person who spoke to me in the morning—he asked the landlady to sign some paper to say he had been, and asked how to spell my name, as he should look foolish in book<lb/>ing the places without knowing that—she gave him a pen and ink, but we told him we did not wish him to book the places, and he went away—he asked the landlady to write something, and she did write something, I understand, and she read it afterwards—it stated that we did not know what day we should go, but it might be Sunday—I have only been a short time from abroad.</p>

               <p>she said she had bought them at different times—that was in reference to the jewellery—I took up the dial of a watch, and said, "Did you ever see the watch belonging to this?"—she said, "No, I never did, that belonged to my grandmother, and has been gone many years"—I took up some mourning ear-drops and rings—she said, "They are what I had for my poor mother when she died;" here is more than one suit of mourning jewellery—I said, "Here is a mourning ring, what is there on it?"—she said she had forgotten—there is an inscription on it, "Elizabeth Taylor"—I took her in charge, and ordered her to be locked up—I then called the male prisoner into the station-house, and asked him his name, and where he came from—he said he came from Westminster—I forget the name he gave—it was not his right name—I said, "What are you?"—he said he worked at a wine-merchant's—I asked his master's name—he did not choose to say—I said, "Where does he live?"—he said, "I might as well tell you his name as where he lives"—I said, "Where is the woman that was with you yesterday?"—he said he had left her in bed at the King's Head—I said, "Is she your wife?"—he said, "Yes, I have been married to her these four years"—I heard his brother and father say, in his presence, that they were not married, and the female prisoner said she was not married, the female prisoner said that evening that there were handbills out about the trunk that was lost in London, that while she was in at a pawnbroker's to pledge a scarf, she saw the policeman come in with a handbill, and she saw it was about a trunk—that she went back to the male prisoner, and told him of it, and they directly left and went to Green-wich, and then on board a Gravesend steam-packet to Gravesend—I went to the west end to see if I could get a hand-bill, which I did, and gave information at No. 67, Hatton-garden, and on returning home the female wished to say something to me—she said, "It is no use, I may as well tell the truth"—I said, "I don't wish to hear any thing"—she said, "I had rather tell you"—I said, "I will give you pen and paper, and you can write what you like"—I went to her in about an hour—she said she had written a line or two, but was so agitated she could not write more, but would tell me the pawnbrokers' where the property was—she named seve<lb/>ral at Greenwich, Pimlico, Tothill-street, and various places—I went to the pawnbrokers', and found the property, as she said—she said the trunk was brought home by Phillips on the Saturday night, and was in his room, at No. 20, Ann-street, Westminster—I went there, and found this trunk in the room, under the bed—these papers were in it—she mentioned pawning three gowns at Jones's, near the Queen's palace, Pimlico; and at Denman's, a coral necklace and scarf; and about four doors from there, a silver ink-stand, two forks, and a table-spoon—she said they had destroyed all the duplicates, and could not give a better account of the pawnbrokers—oppo<lb/>site Astley's theatre, she said, was a cloak, a shawl, and two large night-gowns, for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and near the College, at Greenwich, two silver salt-stands, for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I found, on inquiry according to those directions, the things she had mentioned, except that Denman's was Debenham's—I had made her no promise or threat in the least—here are the few lines she wrote.</p>
