C.; one had a ring and the letter W., and a spot on the hip. Lamb's were marked on the shoulder, and one had a little pitch on the head. - I saw them afterwards, on Friday, the 24th, at the shop of Goodwin, a butcher, in Tothill-street, Westminster - I can swear the five are master's, and the other two are marked the same as Lamb's. The gate of the field was not locked, but was fastened with a spring latch. I have seen Royal Keates before, at Southall market.</p>

I delivered to Durley one hundred and six sheep last Wednesday fortnight, near the Red Lion public-house, Southall; seventy-eight belonged to Mr. Welch, and twenty-eight to Mr. Lamb; I assisted in taking them out of the pens - seven were missed on Thursday, and on the Friday I saw seven at Goodwin's; that was two days after I delivered them to Durley; I knew them again - five belonged to Mr. Welch, and two to Lamb; they were part of what I had delivered to Durley - I knew them by the marks, which I had particularly noticed - one was marked between the ears, and had a C. on the hip - one had a dot on the loin, and M. C. on the hip - one, a W. in a circle - two were marked across the shoulder; they were Lamb's; and two were marked on the near side.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On Thursday, the 23d of November, at ten minutes past two o'clock in the morning, I saw the two prisoners on the road leading from Barnes-common; I did not know them before, but am certain of them; they were coming towards Putney, with seven sheep; I stopped them, and asked where they were going with the sheep at such an unusual hour; they said they were going over Vauxhall-bridge, to Vauxhall-row; I asked if they had any ticket, to show to that effect - Royal Keates said No; I then asked where he brought the sheep from; he said from a grazier's at Windsor-park, that a countryman came out, and gave him the sheep at ten o'clock at night; I said, "Did you take no note down for the sheep?" he said, No, but Mr. Mills had purchased them some time ago; I asked what he was - he said he was a drover; I asked where his badge was - he said he had left it at home; he walked on a little way, and then said he had pawned his badge for 1s.; I asked William Keates what he knew about the sheep - he said his brother had spoken to him on the Wednesday, to go down into the country with him to fetch the sheep - that he went down with his brother by the coach, to Brentford, and being tired he stopped at the Castle public-house, at Brentford - that his brother left him, and returned in an hour and three-quarters, with seven sheep; I said it was impossible he could go to Windsor, fetch<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070004"/>the sheep, and return in an hour and three-quarters; he then said he knew nothing about it, it certainly was impossible for him to go to Windsor and return in that time. Royal Keates said three of the sheep were marked W. B. - I let them go on, but kept close to them, and followed them over Putney-bridge, leading towards the King's-road - I followed them five miles in all, and at half-past five o'clock, as it was getting day-light, I looked at the sheep, and said, "I don't see any W. B.;" there was no such mark; both the prisoners said, I might depend upon it all was right - that Mr. Mills had sent them to Windsor for the sheep - that Mills was a butcher, living in Vauxhall-row, over Vauxhall-bridge. I told Young, my partner, to remain with the prisoners and the sheep, which he did, while I went to Vauxhall-row; I knocked at Mills' door, and heard a man's voice within answer me, but I did not see him - I returned, and told Young, in the prisoners' presence, that Mills had sent nobody after any sheep, and therefore I should take them both into custody; on searching William Keates I found a key in his pocket, which I afterwards found belonged to a little shop in Vauxhall-row, four doors from Mr. Mills' - I put the prisoners into the watch-house, and the sheep into the pound at Rochester-row.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. They did not offer to run away? A. No; William Keates was rather getting off - he was stepping aside, to go off, but I collared and handcuffed him - he had not ran off.</p>

            . I am an officer, and was with Warren. We first saw the prisoners about ten minutes after two o'clock, on Thursday morning, the 23d of November, near Barnes-common, on the road leading towards Putney, with seven sheep; we stopped them, and asked where they were going with them; they said to take them over Vauxhall-bridge, to Mr. Mills, who had bought them some time before, and he had sent them to Windsor for them, and had given them 5s. to fetch them - that they met a man near Windsor-park, with the sheep, about ten o'clock; they said Mills was a butcher living in Vauxhall-row, on the other side Vauxhall-bridge; we asked if they had any note with the sheep; Royal said No; I asked if there were any marks on them - he said there was W. B. on three - it was too dark for as to see whether they were marked; they turned over the bridge, and we followed them to the King's-road, and at daylight we looked and could see no mark like W. B.; they went on then. Near Vauxhall-bridge we stopped them, and I detained them while Warren went over the bridge to Mills - he returned, and told me, in their presence, that Mills had not sent anywhere for any sheep; we then handcuffed William Keates, and drove the sheep into the pound; on the road, as we were taking the prisoners to the watch-house (we did not hold out either threat or promise to them), Royal Keates said, "To tell the truth, the sheep are stolen;" I told him I did not wish to hear any thing, if he had any thing to say to state it to the Magistrate; I then went to Mr. Goodwin's, in Tothill-street, Westminster, and, with his permission, I put the sheep into his stable; I put a mark on them, and they are the same that we took from the prisoners; I went frequently to see the sheep while they were there; they were killed by Goodwin. I took the skins into my possession, and have kept them ever since; I have them here. William Keates said nothing to me.</p>

C. - one with the letter W. in a circle, and two with large strokes on the side - I knew them by those marks, and had seen them on the Wednesday before, at Southall-market - they were consigned to me for sale.</p>

               <p>ROYAL KEATE'S Defence. I had been to Windsor, and on the road I happened to pick up these seven sheep in the middle of the road, between ten and eleven o'clock at night - at that time of night I did not know what to do with them; I went through Brentford, over Kew-bridge, and the officer stopped me at Barnes-common, with them, and asked where I was going; I said to Mr. Mills, over Vauxhall - they cross-questioned me so, I did not know what to say, but afterwards I said I found them, and was going to take them there, to be owned, and if they were not owned at the market I was going to advertise them. I lived close by Mills, and knew no other place to put them; immediately afterwards, as they were locking me up, one of the officers said, "You had better say whether you did take them or not?" I said I did not - he said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070005"/>"You had better tell me, and deliver yourself up, and I will see what I can do for you;" I said I had not stolen them, but picked them up on the road; my friends did not expect my trial to come on till to-morrow, and are not here.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM KEATE's Defence. My brother asked me to help him drive some sheep; I said, Yes, having nothing to do, and we rode down to the Castle public-house; I stopped there, saying I should go no further, it being late - he was gone about an hour and three quarters, and came back with seven sheep; he said he was going to take them to Mr. Mills; I did not ask where he got them, nor did he tell me. After our first hearing, Warren said,"You had better tell me the truth, and I will try and get you through it" - I said I knew nothing of it at all. I could have an excellent character - I have had a great deal of property in my care, to take to Goldsmith's-hall, from Mr. Thompson, of Air-street, Piccadilly.</p>

            . I live in Grenville-street, Somer's-town, and am a constable of the night. I did not know the prisoners before this circumstance. On the 15th of November, about half-past two o'clock in the morning, I was on duty at Kentish-town - one of our watchmen came and gave me information; I went, and saw the prisoners in a field, at the back of Mr. Samson's house, which is in the parish of St. Pancras; I got into the field within fifteen or twenty yards of them - they were walking slowly down by the side of the hedge; there is no foot-path there; I met them, and presenting my pistol at them, said, if they did not stop, I should fire; they stopped directly. It was a moonlight night; I told them we did not like persons hanging about the fields at that time in the morning. I took them to Kentish-town watch-house; I had no previous acquaintance with them. I found, as I went to the watch-house, that Arnold had a great coat on his back, under his own coat; I found a wet table-cloth in his hat, a pair of boy's gloves, and a pair of worsted stockings; I think they were also in his hat. I searched the field twenty minutes afterwards, and found a book.</p>

            . I am servant at Mr. Samson's.

S.; I have known them about three months, and often brushed them; I saw them safe about seven o'clock on Tuesday morning, the 14th, in the school-room.</p>
               <p>RICHARD DEYKIN re-examined. I saw the prisoners in the field which belongs to Mr. Samson, and adjoins his house; they might be one hundred yards from the school-room; I went to the house as soon as I could get in, which was about five o'clock in the morning; I could find no marks of violence on the window or door; I do not know whether the door was shut, as the watchman, who is not here, went in before me.</p>

               <p>ARNOLD'S Defence. On the week before this happened I was working with my father at Barnet - he told me to come to him on Wednesday, and he would give me more work; I met this prisoner in Tottenham Court-road, by accident - he asked where I was going - I said to Barnet, and he said he was going that way; we went together; I got over the gate, to go there for a necessary purpose, and saw three or four men; I called him over, pointed them out, and said, "They have dropped something" - he said,"Oh! let them go about their business;" I picked up a coat - it was a wet night, and I put it on; this young man picked up the other coats, and carried them.</p>

I gave the watchman a knife, who cut the rope; I went out, found a hole in the window, and missed a gold watch, two gilt ones, and a gilt case, which I had seen safe three minutes before - the hole was scarcely big enough for a person to get his hand in - it was jaggy - it was plate-glass: I could not tell what it had been broken with, but should think with a hammer - the glass is so very thick, it must have been done with some instrument; a person would certainly cut his hand by putting it through - the fragments of the glass were inside the window. The watches and case are worth 25l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Had you left your boy in the shop? A. Yes, it was his duty to remain there- he alarmed me. I have occasionally seen the prisoners opposite the house - the gold watch was about eleven inches from the hole, and the others about eight.</p>

            . I am near thirteen years old. On Saturday, the 25th of November, just as it had struck six o'clock, I was alone in the shop: it was dark - I heard a noise, and thought it was some children playing at the door; I went to the door - there was nothing the matter with it then: I saw nobody there - I shut the door, and was going to put some coals on the fire; I then heard a very great noise, like a large piece of timber falling - I ran to the door, and found it was fastened with a cord; the handle was tied to the kitchen bars - I could see nobody in the street - I called out, and Mr. Dunn came down. I had seen the watches safe three minutes before; the window was then safe - I saw a gold watch, two gilt ones, and a silver gilt case; they were gone: when I heard the noise, I got outside, and found a hole in the window; a person could hardly get his hand through the hole - the gilt case was about an inch from the hole, two watches were about eight inches, and the gold one about eleven - the hole was large enough for a watch to be got through. When I first heard the noise, I was in the shop putting coals on the fire - I am sure the shop-door was shut.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you lived with Mr. Dunn? A. A year and a half. There was a lamp burning in the shop - I found the window broken about a minute and a half after I heard the noise at the door - there is a glass case to the window - I think if a hand had been put through the hole, it must have been cut - the watches had no chains to them - there was a great alarm when we got the door open, and a good many people collected: I saw no girl outside who spoke to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How high was the hole from the watches? A. Three or four inches from the bottom of the pane.</p>

            . About six o'clock, on the 25th of November, I saw the three prisoners at Mr. Dunn's window, and in a few minutes I saw Freestone take a string out of Garland's pocket, and give it to Court, who tied it to the knocker or knob of Mr. Dunn's door, and then to the scraper - they then all stood round the window - I was coming across the road, and heard Dunn's window smash; I got across, and the three prisoners came against me, and pushed me rather aside - they ran down Britannia-row; I saw nothing in their hands; I saw them all three together about an hour afterwards, just by Mr. Rhodes' farm, which is about a quarter of an hour's walk; they asked me if I had heard of the watches being stolen- I said, "Yes, I have, and you have got them;" Freestone told me not to say any thing about them; I said I would not; they wished me good night, and we parted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who do you live with now? A. With my parents - my father is a watchman and special constable - his beat is in the Lower-road, a good way from Dunn's. I knew the prisoners before as neighbours, but never had any talk with them, except saying "How do you do?" I had not seen them that night till they had committed the robbery - I have been at home one year and a half, and was in service before that - I had gone out for some tea and sugar for my mother; I stopped opposite Dunn's house a quarter of an hour, while the prisoners were lurking about - I was going to get some meat when they said this to me - I saw Court tie the door - when they ran away, I went straight home, without going into Dunn's: I never went to tell Dunn of it - I told my mother of it that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you remain there to see the thing out? A. I had been waiting so long, I wanted to get home - they were running away when I went away - I told nobody till I got home; I was offended at their pushing against me.</p>

On the 25th of November, I was near Dunn's house when the alarm of robbery was given - I saw one man run away, whom I should know again; it was neither of the prisoners - I saw Freestone in Taddy's-rents half an hour after the robbery, but not earlier - Taddy's-rents is about fifty yards from Dunn's house; I was not there when Cope was - I saw all the prisoners there about seven o'clock.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. When you went to the door, the two persons were just turning from the window? A. Yes; I did not lose sight of them for a moment - I was very near them, and am sure he is one of them.</p>

No; there is a great thoroughfare across the street, but not by this door - he was taken six or eight yards round the corner - they went a few paces gently till Mrs. Tuck called Stop thief! and then they ran - she came out directly the smash was made - nobody else was within twenty yards of the shop - nothing was found on him - I saw nothing fall from him - I think he might have thrown property away without my seeing him - I did not notice his hand throwing any thing away or hear any thing fall - I never expressed a doubt about his identity to the Magistrate, or to anybody.</p>

            . I live at No. 22, St. Martin's-court, and am shopman to a grocer. On the 25th of November, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I heard Mrs. Tuck hallooing, Stop thief! our shop is twelve or fourteen yards from hers - I went out, and saw the prisoner run by the door - I saw Fox apprehend him about six yards from our door; as soon as he was stopped, I saw him throw out his right-hand as if he threw something away; but I did not hear any thing fall - there was some wood and rubbish about there, as they were building a house - in the situation he was then, what he threw away might fall on that rubbish - I saw a man stoop and apparently pick something up off that rubbish; I looked for that man soon after, and he was missing - he had passed our door after the prisoner running, and two more followed him - he asked what was the matter, and then went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many persons were running? A. The prisoner and two more - nobody else, except myself and Mrs. Tuck - the prisoner and two more ran before me - I did not know Mills before - I thought the man had picked something up, and when inquiry was made for the property, I said it was picked up by a gentleman - I looked for him, and he was missing - the rubbish has been searched, but nothing found - I do not swear that the prisoner threw any thing away - if metal had fallen on the stones it would have sounded - there were no bricks there - it was the rubbish of a house which was repairing - I did not attempt to take the man whom I thought picked something up - I know nothing about the prisoner.</p>

            . I live at No. 10, Bedford-court, Chandos-street - I am a labourer - I open and shut Tuck's shop. On the night in question, between five and six o'clock, I was in the narrow part of the court, going to shut up the shop, and heard Mrs. Tuck cry, Stop thief! I immediately came in contact with the prisoner, who was running towards me, and secured him - he said he had been doing nothing, and desired me to let him go - I saw his right hand move, but for what purpose I cannot say - I heard nothing fall; the rubbish might prevent that; several other persons were there assisting in securing him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many did you see running? A. I cannot say; several were running, but the prisoner was foremost, and two others ran a little way behind him; the rubbish might prevent my hearing any thing fall - I should think I must have heard if any thing had fallen.</p>

I heard nothing, but saw two persons pass me and cross the road - it being cold, I was rubbing my hands, neither running nor walking - Mrs. Tuck sung out, Stop thief! and Fox stopped me; this gentleman came and held my hand, and said, "I will see that you throw nothing away;" they took me back - I made no resistance - Mrs. Tuck gave quite a different account before the Magistrate - she said she could not swear I broke the window, but that I was near it; I have worked with my father and mother ever since I was seven years old; I had been to see my aunt in Vere-street, and was returning.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

            . I live in the Commercial-road - I am an officer, and attend at the Custom-house. On the morning of the 23d of November, in consequence of information, I went up St. Dunstan's-hill, and saw the prisoner with an ingot of lead concealed under his apron; he was putting it on his shoulder; I asked where he was taking it - he said to Mr. Piper, of Tower-street, but he was going in a contrary direction: I said he must return with me to the Custom-house - he at first refused, but at last consented; I took him back, and asked where he got it; he said a man gave it to him in the street; Mr. Piper's people were at work at the Custom-house, and said in his presence, that they had not sent him with it; I took him to the Compter. I found the door of a room on the first floor in the Custom-house, broken open, where there were eighty-seven ingots of lead, correspond with this, in size and make - it is marked W. T. Mr. Taylor saw it at the Mansion-house.</p>

            . I am a patrol, and was with Tomkins - I took the prisoner in the court, and asked what he had got - he said, "Some wrappers" - I asked if they belonged to him; he said they did - I asked if they were his perquisites; he said they were - I asked how long he had had them as perquisites; he said about six months - I took him a little way, and said I did not believe his statement, and asked who he lived with - he said, with Messrs. Davidson and Perks, of Star-court - I said I should send for Mr. Davidson, as I thought it was a robbery - he immediately asked what Mr. Davidson would say if he came - I said I could not tell; he then said they were his master's property, and not his - he said he would give me the whole of it, if I would let him go - I refused, and took him into Hayter's - I found a purse containing two sovereigns and 5s. 6d. on him - I went to Mr. Davidson, who saw the wrappers and claimed them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you a City constable? A. I am a ward-officer, and have been ten months in office.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070011"/>I thought it my duty to question him - it was not with a view to convict him; but if the property was his own, he had a right to go about his business - he said they were his perquisites at first, but I doubted that, and questioned him to judge whether I was right in detaining him - I did not say that what he said would be given in evidence - he gave no account before the Magistrate, that I heard, but said he deferred it till he came here; no witnesses were offered in my presence - I and Tomkins were close together.</p>
               <p>MR. DAVIDSON. I have examined the wrappers; they are mine; they are not allowed as perquisites - the prisoner never understood so, for they are always made into bags again - they are my sole property; Mr. Perks has been dead four years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had the prisoner been with you? A. Four years and a half. Wrappers of this description are made into bags, and there is also a common sort, which the people make the bags of; they are all made up into two sorts of bags, new and old - this was all good, and was packed up to be sent to the workhouse next day, to be made into bags, and the prisoner would have to deliver it out. I have two apprentices - they were not examined before the Magistrate - thread-leish is used in making harness - the greater part of this is excellent wrappering, and would all make good bags - I never allowed any thing of the sort as perquisites, nor has it ever been claimed - it has never been considered that damaged wrappers are perquisites.</p>

            . I am warehouseman to Mr. Davidson, and have been so for three years and a half; the prisoner was porter there all that time; he slept in the house, but was not boarded. When the officers gave me information, I went with them to his father's house - they searched three boxes which stood in the fire-place, and found this property; the keys found on the prisoner opened the boxes - in one of them was found a silk damask shawl, worth 10s., which had never been worn - it has no private mark, but corresponds with similar articles in Mr. Davidson's possession; the prisoner was not present - in the same box were three leather wrappers, which came from a silk throwster whose initials were on them - the same person supplies other people, but these wrappers had been missed, and the prisoner was asked several times if he had returned them to the throwster; he said he had - I asked him myself if he had returned them, and he said he had; this was at least six months before - there were seven silk handkerchiefs in the same box, which I believe to be Mr. Davidson's - there is the mark where the ticket had been gummed on them - they were folded in a paper, with the mark of our house; it is in the hand-writing of the manufacturer - a crape scarf was found in another room in a drawer which was not locked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The constable produced the keys which opened the box? A. Yes, the prisoner was in custody at the time - he did not lodge at his father's. When goods are sold, we seldom take the ticket off; it seldom comes off, unless it has not been sufficiently gummed, and then it would not leave the gum mark which is on these handkerchiefs.</p>

            . I attended this search, and opened three or four boxes with some keys which I found on the prisoner; one box containing the property was opened by one of these keys - he did not know I was going to search his father's house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Which is the key that opened the box? A. One key opened all the boxes - I cannot say which; I found three of the keys in the prisoner's cupboard at his master's house - I do not conceive them to be common keys.</p>
               <p>MR. DAVIDSON. The goods produced are such as I have in my possession; I never sold the prisoner or his father any thing of the sort - his father sells wood about the street - these were my property, but may have been sold.</p>

I said, in Stevens' presence, that he had robbed me of my purse - he asked how I could think of any such thing - I said, "I felt your hand go into my pocket and come out" - he kept abusing me, and I went away to the watch-house.</p>

I am as innocent as a child.</p>

I had often heard them quarrel, and did not think it necessary to interfere, as their quarrels were very frequent; I could not judge who provoked the quarrel, it was before I got upstairs; she always appeared to me to be a woman of easy temper, from what I heard of conversation which has passed, when I have been in my room. I got up at seven o'clock on Sunday morning, and heard the prisoner walking in the room and talking to himself, which was cus<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070013"/>tomary; I went out about half-past ten o'clock without seeing him; I returned at eight, went to bed at half-past eight, and hearing a noise, I suppose he was in the room, but I cannot say; on the Monday morning I got up between seven and eight o'clock; I heard him walking in the room; he went out two or three times, locking his door after him, and came in again - I went out, and did not return till ten o'clock at night; I heard nobody that night; about a quarter to seven, on Tuesday morning, Mrs. Jay, the landlady, called me down-stairs; I was then getting up, and heard Robinson and Jay come up-stairs- Robinson went into the prisoner's room and called out,"O, there she lays!" I went in afterwards, and saw two chairs placed at the side of the room, with a sack hung over the backs, and then I beheld the body of the woman laying on the floor at full length against the wall, at the side of the door; I suppose it was three yards from where I heard the fall; it laid on the right side, and a deal of blood appeared to flow from the head; a flannel, or dishcloth laid under her head to sod the blood up; she appeared very much bruised on both temples, and looked very black on the neek; and from the door, to the place where the body lay, there appeared blood; there was also blood against the wall; I am certain I heard her fall against the door, as the lock made a noise; and after that fall I heard nothing more from the woman; I heard no other blow afterwards; there are only two rooms on the floor.</p>

I knew nothing of this affair till the Sunday morning; I saw the prisoner between nine and ten o'clock; he brought a flat-iron down to my room, which I had sent my son up for; I asked where his wife was; he said she had been out all night, and was gone to her brother's; that he was going to dine at his son's at Hampstead, and had got a piece of pork and some French beans, which he would sell me cheap; I said I was provided, and did not buy it; he went up, and brought down the beans, and asked if I would accept of them, which I did; he went up-stairs again, and afterwards went out; I believe he was out all day, for I was at home all day; I saw him between six and seven o'clock on Sunday night going up-stairs; and heard him moving about in his room on the Monday morning; I went out about nine o'clock that morning, and did not see him afterwards; I went into the room on Tuesday morning, about seven o'clock, in consequence of what I heard from Mrs. Jay; I went up to call Thomas, but instead of knocking at his door, I put my elbow against Ambrose's, and it opened; I held the door in my hand, put my head in, and saw a bonnet and shawl on a table; I saw nobody in the room; I went down and told Mr. Jay I thought all was not right; we went up into the room; I turned round, and behind the door stood a table cross-ways, and a sack over two chairs, and there I saw the body laying straight; Jay fetched Barnsley, the beadle; I went up again with them; I know nothing more.</p>

            . I am surgeon, and live in Hatton-garden. On Tuesday, the 12th of September, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was called to see this body; it lay in the room, with one chair placed at the head and another at the feet, and a sack hanging from one chair to the other, before the body - there appeared a great many bruises about the head, face, and temples, and some small ones on the body - some were recent, and others appeared old - those on the head appeared recent; there were several on the back part of the head; they were bruises, but I cannot say whether they were inflicted by blows or falls, one is as likely as the other - a person receiving a blow, or push, and falling against a hard substance, might occasion them; or falling down and moving about afterwards. I examined the head and found no wound in the scalp, or fracture in the bone; there was no blood from any wound, but a morbid fluid appeared to have run from the nose and mouth, but that had flowed since death - it certainly might be the effect of a violent blow beating the body down and stunning it - it might be occasioned by a fall as well as a blow; I could find no mark of any particular blow, for the face was discoloured, both from bruises and dissolution; I opened the head, there was no fracture.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you open the head? A. On the same day - we found some extravasated blood between the scalp and the pericranium; on removing the skull-cap or bone, we found a quantity of extravasated blood on the brain, and some on the ventricles of the brain also; we thought that sufficient to cause death; and, in my opinion, the extravasation was caused from ruptures in the blood vessels of the brain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. The fluid you saw on the floor, might have passed from the mouth and nose after dissolution? A. Yes, as it generally does; it is called dead purges by the common people - a discharge from the mouth. In cases of apoplexy the extravasated blood will in some cases flow from the small vessels; persons who are in the habit of drinking a great deal, or have a full habit of body, are subject to apoplexy.</p>

            . I did not live in this house. On Tuesday, at two o'clock, I went down to No. 4, Lilley-street, to see Mrs. Jay. I went up in the deceased's room, with Read, the officer, of Hatton-garden. I saw the deceased laying on her right side, between sacks. I did not see the prisoner - this was before the Magistrate came; the body had not been touched. I washed the body - she was very much bruised about the head, body, and shoulders; there was a piece out of her arm, and marks of teeth on her left arm; it appeared to be a fresh mark - there were bruises, as if she had been beaten with a rope or stick, all about her arms, shoulders, and body; there was a piece of flesh out of her left thigh; I could not tell whether it was bit or not - it was about as large as a shilling; I did not look whether there were marks of teeth there; it might have been the mark of rats, but I could not tell. I went up with the surgeon. I washed her with soap and water.</p>
               <p>MR. SHEPHERD re-examined. I observed these marks, and it appeared as if rats had been at her - this is no uncommon occurence; there was a case the other day, when a rat was obliged to be killed - it got up the body.</p>

I asked him, when he awoke in the morning whether he found her there - he said that when he awoke he found that she was gone; I said, "Where was she gone?" he said he found she was dead - he said he stopped in the room from Saturday night till Monday night; he told me, on taking him to Clerkenwell prison, that he had been trying to make away with himself two or three times, but he could not do it - he knew he should be hung.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (Written.) I had lived with the deceased for above eight years; at times she was in the habit of getting most beastly drunk - she was then very abusive and violent in her temper; to procure drink she would take my wearing-apparel and articles of trade, and pawn them. I very often wanted her to leave me, and from time to time changed my lodging, but she found me out, and when drunk she would insist on living with me, and was very abusive, accusing me of being connected with other women, of being diseased and lousy; she died on a Saturday night - on the evening of that day I went out, and bought a piece of pork for our Sunday's dinner; when I returned home she was out; she shortly after returned home; I told her I had bought a piece of pork, on which she said that I had been out with other women, and they might cook the pork, for she would not - this caused words and a quarrel, and the deceased coming up to me, I gave her a push; she fell, and her head struck against the door; I thought she was in liquor, and, expecting more abuse, I went to bed; on the following morning, when I got up, I found her dead - I was much alarmed, and not knowing what to do I concealed the body with the bed-clothes, and on the Monday morning I left my home; although this circumstance may appear most strange, and I must admit it is; yet, in my distressed state of mind, I knew not what to do, and I do most solemnly declare, before my God and you, that what I have stated is true.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. France, the landlord of the Portland Arms public-house, Great Mary-le-bone-street. I have known Henry Tyers for two or three years - he was four years and a half old. I know the prisoner Hill. On the <rs id="t18261207-17-cd102" type="crimeDate">29th of November</rs>

                        targets="t18261207-17-off101 t18261207-17-cd102"/> I went to him between three and four o'clock, at General Clinton's stable - I went to take a quartern of gin to him - I will not say that Mr. or Mrs. France ordered me to go; the gin was ordered by Hill; on getting to the mews I found the prisoner and the child (Tyers) there - Ancliffe was cleaning bridle bits, and the child was playing about; I poured out a glass of gin, and gave it to Hill; he drank it, and I then poured out a glass for Ancliffe, and he drank it; there was a small portion left at the bottom of the measure, about the third of a half-quartern, so small a portion I scarce knew that there was any left - Hill said,"Bill, do you take away the gin to drink?" I poured it out in the glass, and the child drank it; the glass was nothing like full; if the glass had been twice filled the two prisoners would have drank the quartern - it was about a third of being full. I asked the child if he would have any gin, and he answered, Yes - I gave it to him, and he drank it; Ancliffe was dressing a horse when I first went- Hill ordered me to bring another quartern, and I did so; I returned immediately - I had to go about one hundred yards, and was not long gone; when I got back I poured out a glass as before, and gave it to Hill; I then poured out another, and gave it to Ancliffe, and they drank it - there was nearly the same portion left as before, and the child was asked, either by me or Hill, whether he would drink it, and he again said Yes - I then poured it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070015"/>out - it was near the same fulness; the child drank it. Hill then said, "Bill, bring another quartern;" I fulfilled the order, and went back again; I disposed of it as before, to Hill and Ancliffe; the child was asked, as before, by me or Hill; I cannot swear that the child answered Yes - the child took the remainder of the third quartern out of my hands. I went away after this - the three quarterns were paid for by Hill - I had the money each time. I did not take any more that afternoon; I saw the child after that - he came up to France's for another quartern; I saw him at the bar - he ordered it to go down; it was carried by William Garratt, my fellow-servant; I never saw the child after he ordered the fourth quartern. On neither of these occasions did I see the child's father with the coachman. When the deceased came to order the fourth quartern he did not seem affected by the gin he had drank; Mrs. France said to the child, "I hope you have not been drinking gin?" he said he had been having a little; she asked him how old he was; he said three years and a half; the gin was sent in an Imperial measure.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Hill is servant to General Clinton? A. Yes - he was not wet that I know of; he was cleaning bits and bridles; he took no further notice of what was going on - it was the same with Ancliffe - he was cleaning horses; I suppose it was five minutes after the third quartern that I saw the child. It was I who first asked the child to have the gin - Ancliffe never proposed it.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. France. I was employed to carry some gin to Mary-le-bone-mews, about four o'clock - I took a quartern; I was present when the child, Tyers, ordered it; we went both together - when we got to the mews I saw the prisoners - I said to Hill, "Here is a quartern of gin;" I poured it out and filled the glass - I gave it to Hill, and he gave it to the child; he asked the child if he would have any - the child said Yes, and drank it all - the whole glass; upon the child saying Yes, Hill gave it to him; Hill drank a trifle out of the second glass; I then filled it up again: the second glass is the quartern. When I filled up the second glass again Hill gave it to the child. I do not know that he said any thing, but merely gave it to him - the child drank it; when I had disposed of it, Hill ordered a further quartern, and I fetched it; I asked if he would pay for it; Ancliffe had no share or part in that - I shaped it out in the same way as the other - the glasses were not quite full; I do not know that at this time he said any thing to the child; I am sure the child drank the glass; the other part was poured out into the glass, but I cannot say whether Hill or the child drank it - I mean the last glass of the second quartern which I took; I think the child drank the first glass I poured out; I do not know that the last was given to the child; the child got a little out of the second quartern - to the best of my knowledge Hill drank the first glass; Hill paid for both quarterns - I went away. It appeared as if the child had drank more than sufficient; he rolled about, and fell down - it appeared to be in misery, and could not help itself - it fell down before the mother came in, and laid on the ground; no person attempted to assist or take it up; its mother called, "Henry" in the stable - he was laying about the middle, and said, "Yes, mother." The father came in - the prisoners were there at the time; the mother said, "What have you been giving the child, some gin?" they made no answer at first; there was then a conversation between her and the prisoners - Hill spoke first. The father began to swear and say, "What have you given the child gin for?" Hill said he did not care a d-n for Mr. or Mrs. Tyers. The mother took the child out of the stable; when she took him up in her arms he cried; I do not know what was said by Hill at the time, but he used abusive language; I do not remember any thing more: I do not know that Hill said any more. I had seen the lad before that day; during the time I was there Ancliffe did not say any thing that I know of; I did not see that he shared any part of the gin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When the mother called out, the child answered immediately? A. Yes- it was then able to say, "Yes, mother;" during the time he gave him the gin the child said very little. He remained stupid and confused, as if he had been drinking a good deal.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who appeared stupid? A. Hill. I had seen Hill before this - he appeared more stupid than usual that night, as if he had been affected with liquor.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live at No. 7, Great Mary-le-bone-street. I was called in to visit the child about seven o'clock in the evening - I found it in a kind of stupor; it had very much the appearance of a person having taken a large quantity of liquor; the arms and limbs were contracted; they hung down, and there appeared a sort of listlessness about the child; the pupils of the eyes were contracted - the appearance was that of a person who had taken a quantity of narcotic drink; I could not tell what it was. The effects of gin upon the human constitution would act as a narcotic. The child attempted to vomit; he appeared evidently dying, and there were symptoms of blood in the head; I stopped with him half an hour - I had no previous knowledge of it; I saw it three times within an hour or an hour and a half; I stopped about twenty minutes each time; when I left the third time I said it would not live many minutes, I smelt the liquor ejected, and it smelt strong of liquor; excess of liquor will destroy a child, or any person; this appears to be the cause of the child's death; I know what a quartern of gin contains - half a quartern would not kill the child.</p>

            . I was in East-street about half-past six o'clock, when the accident happened - I saw the cart coming at a very moderate pace; it was not gallopping, I am sure - the prisoner's horse was inclining towards the curb; I saw the child against the kennel; the wheel went over its body; it got up again, and the hind part of the cart knocked it down again; it then ran into a man's arms, and a woman took it away.</p>
               <p>Q. The accident happened instantaneously? A. Yes, I heard the prisoner cry out, and saw him backing the cart - I cannot say whether the wheel went over by his backing. The prisoner was anxious about the child, and said he would pay all expenses - he said, "Will not the child be better at home?" the doctor said it would be better to take it to the hospital. The Coroner's Jury returned a verdict of Accidental Death, and I consider it purely accidental - I swear the horse did not gallop.</p>

I am a porter, and was in East-street at the time of the accident - I saw the prisoner coming with his cart, and heard him halloo out - the child was getting up after the cart went over it - by the exertion of the prisoner in pulling back the horse, the cart went over the child; it got up, and ran into my arms - the mother came and said, "Oh! it is my child!" upon my oath, it was purely an accident.</p>

            . I live at No. 98, Long-alley, Finsbury. On the 26th of February, a few minutes before seven o'clock, I was informed of this robbery at Emmens' house, which is in the City, and in the parish of St. Botolph without, Bishopsgate; I went to the spot, and as I turned the corner of the street, I saw two persons, who saw me and knew me; they came towards me - I knew them, and they passed me; they were coming in a direction from the house - I then went towards Emmens' house; I looked towards the shutter and saw a light in the parlour, which is Perkins' room; the street-door was open - I went into the passage, pushed against the parlour-door, and said, "Halloo, who is here?" a person said, "It is me, Sir;" he peeped out into the passage, and drew the parlour-door too; he came into the passage - I made a grasp at him, and caught hold of him; but the passage was dark and I could not see his features at that time; it was too dark; I continued my hold of him till we got into the middle of the street, and there we had a struggle; I was ill at the time; he twisted his head under my arm, left his hat with me, and got away.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were struggling with him in the middle of the street, was there a gas-light to enable you to distinguish his features? A. There was; I am certain of his person - it was the prisoner; I have known him ten years, and recognized him as soon as I saw his features; I declare positively he is the person - I did not see him again till I found him in Clerkenwell prison, about three weeks ago; I was certain he was the same person; I am quite sure of him - on going into the prosecutrix's room I found all the clothes taken out of the drawers, and in the street-door I found a skeleton key, which I produce; it is exactly in the same state now - it has been strained in getting it out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to swear you took the key out of the hole in that state? A. Yes, I do; it was with great difficulty we got it out - we strained it in doing so; it has not been at all altered since - I was not more than five minutes struggling with him - I am sure it was not ten - it was at least five - it was about five, I cannot speak to a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. If any one has sworn from the time the man came out of the house till you and he went in again it was not more than a minute, is that truth? A. It was five minutes from the time he came out of the room, till he got from me; if anybody has said it was not a minute, it is not true, but they might err - I say it must have taken nearly five minutes - I would not tell an untruth - the other men were tried in the New Court; I was examined and swore to the other men, for I knew them well before.</p>
               <p>Q. You must have been a little agitated when you were struggling? A. I was not frightened; I had an abscess in my neck, or he would not have got from me; I saw his face, but not all the time; it was five minutes after we left the parlour that he got from me - he twisted from me in a moment; I do not know that I ever experienced such a dexterous act; he kept struggling all the time; I had him by the collar, but he twisted under my arm and got away; it is a common way of getting off, but it was never done to me before; he did not throw me down.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You gave evidence against two other persons; did you state them to be at some distance, or at the house? A. At a distance.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to JANE PERKINS. Q. You left home between twelve and one o'clock? A. Yes; it is the dwelling-house of John Emmens; he has no servant; he was out at the time with his wife and three children at the Tabernacle, which is a place of worship; I cannot tell whether any of them were in the house after I left; he has no servant; I saw them that night; nobody but myself has a key of the parlour-door to my knowledge.</p>

He says he had hold of me five minutes, and has known me ten years; if so, why not mention my name; nobody ever came to my father's house till the Tuesday evening; I have been in the parish of St. Luke ten months - besides, that man is not fit to have his oath taken; he is a Deist, I understand.</p>
               <p>JURY to WALTON. Q. Did you know where the prisoner lived? A. Yes; and I put a watchman in at the window to search after him, thinking he was there, and another officer put a watchman in at the window to look for him; we have been searching for him ever since.</p>

               <p>FRANCIS BRENTNELL. I live at Derby, and am clerk to a person there. I was in town, and lodged in Oxford-court, Cannon-street. On the 30th of November, about half-past eleven o'clock, I was going through a court from Cornhill to Lombard-street; I had left home about half an hour - my handkerchief was then safe; I felt nothing, but an officer came and asked if I had missed my handkerchief; I felt, and missed it from my outside coat pocket- I saw it in his possession; I saw him lay hold of the prisoners immediately afterwards - they were in company together; he charged them with taking it; I did not hear<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070018"/>what they said - they were quite strangers to me; it is a silk handkerchief, and worth 2s.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoners in company together in Cheapside; I watched them, and when they got into Cornhill they went up to Mr. Brentnell - he went through Pope's Head-alley; Mullins was nearest to him, but they were in company; they turned into <placeName id="t18261207-21-crimeloc120">Pope's Head-alley</placeName>

I then saw Morland take a handkerchief from his breast, and put into his hat; I seized them both, and took the handkerchief from his hat, and Mr. Brentnell claimed it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>MULLINs' Defence. I went to work that morning; my sister asked me to go and see another sister, who was lying-in at Whitechapel; I did not know my way, and asked this boy to show me - I lost him, and went back to look after him - he told me the way, and I was going when the officer took me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Whose property were they? A. Edmund Taylor's. I was christened by the name of Henry William, but go by the name of William only; the prisoner came behind me - I could not see him well then - he ran away directly the bag was taken, and I went up the court after him - he was stopped almost directly; I did not see his face till he was stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say that night, that the prisoner took the bag, and the other held you? A. I believe I did, but he is the one who held my shoulders; the one who took the bag had a fustian jacket on; I went into a newspaper-shop directly he was taken. I believe I said there that he was the man who took the bag. I turned round, and saw him take his hands off my shoulder.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you to say he took the bag if he held your shoulder? A. I am sure he held my shoulder while the one in the fustian jacket took the bag.</p>

            . I am a plumber, and live in Greystoke-place, Fetter-lane. I was coming down Johnson's-court, towards Fleet-street, and heard the boy cry out - I saw the prisoner running from the boy, towards me - he was pushing himself out from the mob, and met me on the steps of Johnson's-court; the boy cried out, as if he was hurt; I laid hold of the prisoner - the boy immediately accused him of being the thief; he said he was not the person, but the man who had committed the act had run up the court; I saw nobody running up the court - if there had been, I must have seen them; I went into the newspaper-shop with the boy, but did not hear what account he gave there. An officer was sent for, who took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner said he was not the person? A. Yes. The boy did not say whether he had seen his face; he said one held him, and the other took the bag. I heard him say the prisoner was the thief - that was all.</p>

            . I am a bookseller, and live in Wych-street. I was going towards Temple-bar, and met the prisoner and another person coming towards me, arm-in-arm, just about Johnson's-court; I was about four yards from the court - they were coming towards Fleet-market, meeting the boy - when they got opposite to me they turned back again, and I saw the prisoner go behind the boy, leaning over his shoulder - the boy had a kind of parcel; he hallooed out directly, and I saw the prisoner and another one leaning over him - the other made off, up Johnson's-court; the prisoner was up to the top of the steps, and Taplin stopped him; I am sure he is one of them: I did not see the parcel taken, but the other ran up the court with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then it is true that the one who took the parcel ran up the court? A. Yes; the prisoner said, "There goes the man who has got the property, up the court," but I know he was in company with that man; Taplin was coming down the court - it was a dark court; the man had very likely passed him - I went into the newspaper-shop, and said the prisoner was the man who was leaning over the boy's shoulder. The constable was in the shop. I am sure I accused him of being the man; I was loaded with goods; I did not go to Guildhall the next morning; both the persons leaned over the boy's shoulder, and were both behind him; I had never seen the prisoner before; there was a mob after the boy hallooed out. Taylor was not in the newspaper-shop; the master of the shop asked if anybody knew about the business; I did not go forward, as the prisoner was being searched, and he was writing a parcel of names down. I told the master of the shop afterwards that I had seen it; it was in Flemming's Express-office; the prisoner was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070019"/>in the shop when I said I had seen them arm-in-arm, and had seen it done.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear the boy say, in the shop, who took the bag? A. No. There was a boy said something about the prisoner not taking it; I did not hear any-body say the prisoner was not the man, but that might be said. I did not observe Dunbar in the shop, but I was not sent for till afterwards, and I dare say there were twenty people there.</p>

I had just left my situation in Duncan-place, Leicester-square - I went to lodge at Mr. Rochester's on the 13th of October, and did not know either of the prisoners before that; Barrett lodged there, and I put my trunk into her room, it contained the articles stated in the indictment - it was not locked; I did not know her before, but my fellow-servant had recommended me to lodge there; I would not have taken 50l. for my property. I went there on the 13th, but did not miss all the property till the 16th. O'Bryan was there on the 13th, when I went in; she was also there on the 14th and 15th. On Monday night, the 16th, I gave charge of Barrett - she was searched at the watch-house, but nothing was found on her; I was taking her gown off her on Sunday night, in her own room, and a duplicate of some of my property dropped from her. On the 17th I saw the officer find a silk handkerchief, locked up in her box, and my gold ear-rings were found on the mantelpiece. I saw O'Bryan on Sunday night, in St. Martin's-lane, opposite Chandos-street, with my bonnet and whittle on; the whittle was taken from the box, but not the bonnet; I found a brooch in her pocket when she was searched.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you not very intimate with them? A. No; I never gave them any thing to pawn; a man named Basterfield came to visit me there; I represented him as my brother, but he was not so, and that Barrett knew; I did not wish every one to be as wise as myself; no other man visited me till after I lost my property - then my fellow-servant came; I was never intoxicated; I did not have warning to leave the house. A watch was found at a pawnbroker's, which I claimed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not a lady come forward, and swear it was her watch, and that she had sent her son to pawn it? A. Yes; I could not give the number of it, and Mr. Halls, the Magistrate asked me to open it, but I was not able to do so, being flurried. I told him I had opened it but twice; I did nearly open it, but I was all in a tremble - it was given to the lady, because she gave the number, and I could not- she appeared like a poor, working woman; I had bought it three years ago, at a watchmaker's at Charing-cross - I do not know his name; Mr. Rigby now lives at the shop - I gave 10l. for it - I was house-maid at an hotel in Spring-gardens at that time. I never wound it up, for I was not in the habit of using it; I bought it because I was going out one Sunday, and wished to be back to my time - I did not wind it up after I first had it - my mistress has seen me with it, and offered to come, but the Magistrate did not wish to see her, as she could not identify it; I described the inside works to Mr. Halls, but there were three of the boy's friends to swear against me - Mr. Halls told me to bring somebody else to identify it, but the family I lived with are gone to Spain - the boy had been stopped when he offered it in pawn, and the mother swore it was hers, and she had sent him to pawn it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever said you had no charge to make against Barrett, calling her the little b-b? A. Never, nor did I ever use such words; I know Mary Brian by sight; I never told her I had nothing to allege against Barrett - I gave an alarm in the house on the 16th, that I had lost my property - Barrett was taken that day in her own room, and O'Bryan on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you lose from your trunk a watch worth 6l.? A. Yes, and all the other articles stated in the indictment. I never allowed either of them to take the things to pawn them, or to wear them - they were quite strangers - I believe the watch now to be mine, and it had a key like mine to it.</p>

            . I am the officer. The Magistrate sent me on Tuesday to search Barrett's lodging, and in her box I found a silk handkerchief, which the prosecutrix<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070020"/>claims, and half a sovereign - I found a pair of gold earrings in a goblet on the mantel-piece; I was informed of the watch being stopped at Queen-square, and I took her there; she described it to Pople, who had it in his possession - the boys who had offered it in pawn were remanded until Saturday, and then sent to Bow-street - the watch was brought there, and she described to the Magistrate the mark of a snake inside the cap, which the woman could not do - she also knew the key, and the string attached to it; she described it before she saw it, but she did not know the number; the number was on the face - it appeared to be a poor tradesman's wife who claimed it. When I apprehended O'Bryan, I found on her the gold setting of a cornelian brooch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you before Mr. Halls? A. Yes; she told him of the mark inside the watch, and she opened the glass cover, but could not open the inner case- I believe the watch now to be hers.</p>
               <p>AMELIA MATTHEWS. I believe the setting of this brooch to be mine - the handkerchief, gown, and shift, are mine; also this silk dress; here is the gown I took off Barrett's back.</p>
               <p>BARRATT's Defence. She told me she had only two shifts, but she had stolen a pair of sheets from her mistress to make herself some - she asked me to cook a dinner on Sunday for some friends of hers, and told me to put her gown on, that I might not stain my own - she borrowed my lace frill, as she was going to meet a gentleman in the Park, and lent me her handkerchief instead; she gave me the ear-rings.</p>
               <p>O'BRYAN's Defence. A woman who works with me at Millbank trod on this brooch, and bent it; she gave it to me - I went to this house on Sunday, and Barrett told me to put on this shawl and old bonnet, as I was going to Chandos-street; I did not like it, but she said it made no difference; I returned, and gave them to her.</p>

Barrett said she had pawned the gown at her request, and had given her the six shillings.</p>

I attribute her death to the sudden and great shock her constitution received from the sudden and great fall, being in a very debilitated state of constitution; she told me she did not think she should ever overcome it - this was sixteen or seventeen days before her death - she never appeared to mend - she never spoke about her death more than at that time; she said she was thrown down by some boys.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. She died from debility of constitution, arising from a shock which she received? A. She certainly died from the injury - her constitution not being sufficiently good to overcome the shock, I judge the immediate cause of her death to be the fall.</p>

Wilson, who was with me, brought out a light, and the boys tried to blow it out, but he would not let them. Thomas Williams had some mud in his hand; he went round by another boy, and kept throwing it at her as she lay in the gutter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You were among the boys? A. No, I was not - I saw it done - I was eating some fried fish; I had not been playing with them that day - some of them live in the same court - they did it for a lark; they often played with her; I did not observe that she was drunk; I never saw her in liquor.</p>

            . I am thirteen years old - I live in Charles-court, and know all the prisoners; I had just come home from working at a printing-office, and saw them all there in company together - old Mrs. Hood came along, and Thomas Williams said, "Let us have a lark with this Scotch b-wd;" Frederick Williams instantly laid hold of her, and they all helped to shove her down to her own door, by her head and b-m. My mother, who keeps a shop in the court, called me in, and I did not see her fall - I heard her groaning, and crying "Oh! my thigh is broken" - I brought out a candle, and they tried to blow it out - Frederick Williams helped to pick her up - Thomas Williams got behind a boy, and was pelting her with mud - I saw them laughing.</p>

            , pawnbroker, High-street, Kensington. I know the prisoner. On the 30th of October he came into our shop, between five and six o'clock in the evening; I had never seen him before; the shop was lighted with gas - he offered a chronometer in pawn; he was about ten minutes in the shop - I asked how much he wanted on it; he said, 1l. - I asked where he got it from, as that was a very low value; he said he gave eight guineas for it, eight years ago, and bought it of a groom, who was his fellow-servant; but he did not want more than 1l. on it, as it would be easier to take it out again - that his name was Samuel Clarke, and he lived at No. 5, Turnham-green, in a gentleman's service - I said he might have had a great deal more on it - he said he knew that he could have more on it in town - I gave him 1l., and it has been in my possession ever since: I should think he was ten minutes in the shop; I am quite certain of him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. He came to you at half-past three o'clock and remained till half-past ten; what had you to drink? A. He asked if I would have any thing to drink; I said, No - he said he was thirsty, and my servant got him some ale - I only know of two pots being got, but I was not awake all the time; I sat on the sofa by the fire, and slept between eight and nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you show him the watch, or did he take it up? A. When he came in I said, "You are pretty punctual;" he took the watch off the mantel-piece, and said I could not be in great want of money having such a valuable watch by me - he had told me that he had no money; I had had the watch about four months, I should think; I told him how I came by it; he complained of having no money, and that brought up the statement; I told him it was a bad debt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell him you were walking in Regent-street on Tuesday evening, and met a genteel boy, about thirteen years old, and that he gave you the watch, having been with you that night, and having no money? A. I said a gentleman had been with me, having no money, and said he would leave the watch - I do not know his age, he was quite a young lad; I did not take much notice of him- he was with me all night, and gave me the watch to keep till he could redeem it; he has called for it since it has been missing; I did not ask him for the watch, he gave it into my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was the price of your prostitution? A. Yes; I never promised to compromise this matter if the prisoner would pay 30s. for expenses and 3l. for the watch; I have neither seen him nor sent to him; nothing of the kind has ever passed - he said he did not know me when I met him; he valued it at ten guineas when he was in my room; I missed it while he was in the room, and afterwards found it was in the cupboard wrapped up in the handkerchief - when he was leaving the room I did not say I was going to dress to receive another visiter - I was quite sober; I had but three glasses of ale and some filberts; I do not think he could be very sober; I had neither dinner nor tea, for as soon as I got home he knocked at the door.</p>

            . I attended on the prosecutrix at the time in question; I was there all day, but did not sleep there - I saw the prisoner at her lodging on the day the watch was missed - I let him in, as near as I can recollect, at half-past two o'clock; they had a little ale and some nuts; two pots were fetched while she was up; the prisoner paid for both ale and nuts; I cannot say whether he was sober or not; they had no tea; I found the watch hanging over the fire-place; while she was asleep the prisoner went out, and while he was gone I wrapped it up in a handkerchief, or part of a white petticoat, and put it into the cupboard; he came in again in five minutes, and said he had ordered some oysters, for he was hungry, and they were brought; he asked the prosecutrix to take some; she said she was too ill; I went home after the oysters came and know nothing more; I did not see the watch after I put it into the cupboard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How was she ill? A. She had had no dinner when the prisoner came, and she fainted away with the heat of the room; she drank ale about three times; I suppose she had a glass altogether; I fetched two more pots afterwards, but she drank none of that, and she did not know of its being brought; the prisoner handed the watch over the back of the chair to me, and said, "Here, Mary, go and pledge it for your mistress; it is a pity she should be so short of money, and have such a beautiful watch in the place;" but I did not take it; this was after I had wrapped it up; I do not know how it got into his possession.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you would not pawn it, what did he do with it? A. Mistress took it out of his hand, saying,"No, I would sooner want a shilling than pawn it, when it is not my own" - it was not in the handkerchief then, but I am sure I had wrapped it up before that.</p>

            . I am a constable of Marlborough-street; the prisoner was brought to the office, and gave his address at Brunswick-terrace, Hackney-road - I afterwards went to the lock-up room, and asked him if that was correct; he said he did not wish to give me trouble, that it was not correct, nor would he tell where he lived, let the consequence be what it would - I afterwards got his proper address from his wife at the office; but the watch has not been found.</p>

               <p>THOMAS THOMAS. I live in Marchmont-street, Burton-crescent, with Gibbons and Co., who are linen-drapers. On the 11th of November, about twelve o'clock at night, I was coming from the City; I had been to Sun-street, and had left there about half an hour: I was sober; I went up to the City-road to see for a stage; but as there was none,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070023"/>I returned; I met a female in Golden-lane, and asked her the way to Smithfield; she directed me through a court, which led out of <placeName id="t18261207-27-crimeloc157">Golden-lane</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18261207-27-crimeloc157" type="placeName" value="Golden-lane"/>

                        targets="t18261207-27-off155 t18261207-27-crimeloc157"/>; I went into the court, and there were three men there - they all pushed me about, and at last knocked me on the forehead with a stick and cut my forehead - they knocked me down; two of them laid me on my face on the pavement, and while they were beating me the third man put his hand into my right-hand trousers pocket and took three sovereigns and some silver - they beat me cruelly about the head while I was on the ground, and took off my hat and a great-coat, which Harris had lent me; they tried to take my clothes off, but could not; I tried to get up, but they struck me again under the left ear with their fists, and that stunned me - as soon as I recovered I hallooed out, Murder! and Stop thief! I had not called out before, except when I was on the ground; but my face was so close to the ground that I could not be heard - on recovering, I was all over mud, and they were just running away in different directions; I cannot swear to either of them; but when they were brought to the watch-house I said it was as much like them as possible; I cannot say that Gray is the woman who directed me down the court; a watchman came to my assistance and took me to the watch-house; I was all over blood and dirt; I described the great-coat and the men as well as I could, and in a short time the coat was brought to the watch-house; I have not recovered the hat or money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Did you come out of Golden-lane into the court? A. It led out of Golden-lane, I believe, but I do not know much of the neighbourhood.</p>

            . I live in Bell-alley, leading into Goswell-street - I am married. On this day five weeks, about one o'clock at night, I was going home with my husband, whom I had met; I go out to wash and mangle at Peerless-pool; I was going through Green Arbour-court and saw a gentleman with a light coat on; three men were on one, side of him, and a female on the other; they were all four pushing him about backwards and forwards; I did not know the men, but by the woman's voice I thought it was Sarah Gray - I saw her, but did not go up to look at her face, but know her voice; I have known her some years - I said to her, after they had run away,"Oh! for shame, Sarah Gray - I am afraid you are one of those who helped to rob that poor man."</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw them, did you hear her say any thing? A. No - but I am convinced it was her, because she had no bonnet on, nor had she when I spoke to her - I was within three yards of her. When I spoke to her she used a bad expression, and asked how many I had robbed in my time; I know it was her I spoke to - the man they were pushing about had a light-coloured coat, with mother-o'-pearl buttons behind - I saw that, as it was a very moonlight night; I only saw them push him about as I went in doors, but when we heard him cry Murder! my husband and I went to his assistance; they were all gone from him then, but I met Gray coming down the steps, and said I was convinced, by her person, she was the same woman; I am quite sure, by her person, that she is the same woman; she went down Crown-court when I spoke to her, and I saw no more of her; the prisoner was just under the gateway by Green Arbour-court, without hat or coat - I went with him to the watch-house, as the watchman said he had got the coat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where does the court lead to? A. Golden-lane; it is Turk's Head-court - I thought the three men were rather tall - I am sure there was a woman with them when I first saw them, but I did not speak to her then; I judge, from her height and voice, that it was her.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Luke. On Sunday morning, the 12th of November, at near two o'clock, I was coming from the watch-house; I came down White's-yard into Basket-alley, and there saw the prisoner Thorn with something under his arm - I said, "I do not think this is right," and he dropped it; he was not above five yards off, and could hear what I said - he ran up White's-yard, and I after him, springing my rattle and calling Stop thief! Poulston picked it up - just as he turned the corner into Whitecross-street, the watchman stopped him- I only lost sight of him for half a minute, while he turned round the corner - I had seen him before, but did not know his name; he is the man who dropped the bundle - Poulston came up in two or three minutes - we all went to the watch-house, and he left the coat there - I am sure Thorn is the man who dropped it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. This was nearly two o'clock? A. Yes. I did not see him stopped, but was close behind - he had got about six yards from the corner; there was nobody running but him and me - the watchman who stopped him was coming towards us, hearing the rattle. I have no doubt of his being the man.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I heard the rattle spring at two o'clock in the morning; I was at the corner of Banner-street and Whitecross-street - I ran to the spot, and met the prisoner coming out of White's-yard - I caught him in my arms; Simons was three or four yards behind him - he came up directly, and said, "That is the man" - nobody else was running.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he not running towards Golden-lane? A. He ran towards me - he must have turned back to go to Golden-lane: I took him within fifteen or twenty yards of White's-yard - he had a cap on, which he threw away just before he got to me: I saw that cap at the watch-house.</p>

On the 12th of November I left the warehouse at half-past seven o'clock in the evening; I believe every thing was safe - the packages were all complete; there was a pen-knife, a pencil-case, a seal, and a medal in my desk. I was sent for the same night; I found the desk broken open, and my things taken away; the packages were not as I had left them. - I have found every thing but the seal.

I have the care of the upper part, over Mr. Haigh's warehouse, and keep the keys; I go there every evening to see that all is secure, and to fasten the outer door. I went there on the 25th of November, about half-past ten o'clock - I was going to open the door, but there seemed an obstruction inside; I tried to open it three times; hearing a noise in the passage I turned the latchkey down, to prevent anybody coming out, and then called, through the key-hole, "Is anybody inside?" I received no answer - nobody sleeps there. I then called the watchman three times; Willsher, the officer, came over, and waited outside - I got several persons to assist; I entered the house at the private door, with two or three officers; Willsher stood at the private door - I heard glass break, and when I got in I saw Mr. Haigh's warehouse-door open - it ought to have been shut; the first-floor window was open, and four panes of glass were broken in the sky-light, which is under it - they were quite safe that morning; the leads by the sky-light lead from the window to a small yard of the house - persons could let themselves down from those leads into the yard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How high are those leads? A. As high as the first-floor, but there is a projection where they could have rested.</p>

            . I am an officer of Cheap Ward, and live in Little Bell-alley, Coleman-street. On the 25th of November, between ten and half-past ten o'clock, I heard Watkins give an alarm; I immediately went to the door of No. 12, Bucklersbury, listened, and heard persons in the passage - I went to the warehouse door, and held it fast; I found it shake - they were endeavouring to get out there; I went over to the Green Man public-house, and called Hawkins to assist, and then went to the watch-house, for further assistance, returned, and heard two distinct smashes of glass; Hawkins went to the door of No. 11, and got admission; the prisoners were taken - their hands were cut, as if by glass - I went into the premises, and found Mr. Haigh's door was broken open by great force - I found a bag there, containing four shawls, with printed borders, and two pieces of cotton print - the desk and a trunk were also broken open, and I found a phoshorus box, a dark-lantern, and a jemmy or crow-bar.</p>

I went with Hawkins into No. 11, and on the ground-floor is a window, which looks into the yard of No. 12 - we found the two prisoners there, standing close to the window; I do not think they could get out, except by coming through No. 11. I pulled Jones through the window.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You live at the dining-room? A. Yes. Nos. 10 and 11 are both dining-rooms - there is no communication to the yard from No. 10. I suppose we dine one hundred and seventy persons every day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you recollect either of the prisoners dining there? A. No; Jones' hands were dirty and bleeding - he said, "See what a condition I am in;" the window I drew him through was not broken. I did not go into the yard to see if any glass was broken.</p>

            . I am beadle of Cheap Ward. I took the prisoners from the watch-house to the Compter. I afterwards went to No. 12, Bucklersbury, and found an empty black bag - I found some skeleton and picklock-keys in the yard where the prisoners were taken, and a piece of whalebone - they were covered over with a handkerchief: this was on the Monday morning. The skylight is on the leads, and there were marks on the wall, down the leads, of plaster having been scraped off, as if persons had let themselves down into the yard. The window of No. 11 opened into that yard. The prisoners were asked what they had to say, and refused to say any thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go on the leads? A. No - they are eleven or twelve feet high: I could get down easily.</p>

             I am between fourteen and fifteen years old. I was in Smithfield-market - my father gave me the mare to mind while he went round the market. The prisoner came, took it away from me, and told me to go to my father - he cut me with a whip, told me my father wanted me, and told me to go to him - I went to my father, and when I came back I saw neither the prisoner nor the mare: I have not seen it since. I saw him again when he was in custody, not before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have you not seen me several times since? A. I saw him once at the corner of Catherine Wheel-alley, where he lived - he asked me if my father was at home, and said he was ashamed to come down to him - that was all. I had a basket on my head, and did not try to have him secured.</p>

            . I am a constable of Union-hall. I apprehended the prisoner in Great Dover-street, at the back of Kent-street, and told him it was for stealing Berryman's horse; he said he had sold it, and meant to take the money to him, but all on a sudden he lost it out of his pocket in the market - this was on the 29th of October: I had been a long time looking after him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming over Blackfriar's-bridge, and met this man with an old horse - he said,"You may as well come and run the horse for me, as you often do" - he said, "Take this, and try to sell it - ask 40s. for it:" I ran it about the market, and he sent the boy to say he had bought another one. I went back to the father, who gave me the mare - a man came, and asked what I wanted for it - I said 3l.; then he came and asked if I wanted to change it - I said No, to sell it; he said if it would go in harness he would buy it - I put it in harness, and he offered 45s. for it; another man offered me the same. The prosecutor said, "It cost me 50s., and the lowest you can take for it is 56s., and if that man bids you for it, I will come up and bid more;" a man came up and bid me 56s., and I sold it to him. While I was looking about for the prosecutor I lost the money.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

            . I am a butcher. On the 10th of November, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, Mr. Rhodes bought two pigs - I saw the carcases hanging opposite the scale in Swan's shop; I had weighed them. Mr. Rhodes gave his name as belonging to them - he paid for them, and went out with Boulter, who had come with him - the pigs hung there about ten minutes - the prisoner then came into Swan's shop, and said, "I want two pigs in the name of Rhodes;" I saw no one with him - I pointed them out, thinking it was all right, and let him take them away on his shoulder; I had seen him before, but did not know whether he was a porter in the market, or what: Mr. Rhodes had said he would either call or send for them - he brought Clarke, the porter, in about half an hour for them; I said that a person had fetched them - on the Friday evening Mr. Rhodes pointed out the house where the prisoner lived, which is his father's shop - I walked by about nine o'clock that evening, saw the prisoner walking about the shop, and was perfectly satisfied that he was the person who called for the pigs; I am quite certain of him. Mr. Rhodes was not with me then. On the Monday evening, I took Gibbons and another constable with me, and he was taken - I did not go into the shop myself, and did not hear him say any thing.</p>

I had not seen the prisoner, and did not know they were stolen - I asked him who he had given them to; he said some man had fetched them - I was with Mr. Rhodes when they were bought; and when he questioned Harman, he said, in Rhodes' presence, that he should not know the man who took them; he said so positively - I had hung the pigs up myself in the shop - I saw the prisoner in his father's shop, about two hours afterwards - Clarke and Hodwell were present when Harman said this.</p>

I went to buy some butter at his shop - the prisoner's sister had told me about the pigs - I have been acquainted with the prisoner and his family about five months. Rhodes said this to me without my naming any thing about it - I went there to buy a quarter of a pound of butter, and he began telling me the whole particulars - he said it was an unfortunate affair about William Davies; I said it was - he said, if Mr. Davies had given them the money for the pigs at the time, his father would have dropped all further proceedings.</p>

            . I live at No. 8, Islington-green. On the 16th of November, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was passing Mr. Hawthorn's shop, and saw Tobin run out with this shawl in his hand - it was not tied in any thing; he scrambled it up like a pocket handkerchief; I saw him give it to a man who was standing three or four yards from the shop, on the same side of the way; I saw Webster when he was at the watch-house, between four and five o'clock, but cannot swear to him. The man was dressed in a brown great coat, and had a blue apron on, which he put the shawl into, and went down the road; Tobin went away round the pavement, then returned, and met the man again in the road; he stood with him about a minute, and then left him - I followed him into Mr. Lee's, a linen-draper's-shop; I went in and mentioned this, and had him secured. Webster was dressed the same as the man who received the shawl, but I cannot say whether he is the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Should you know the shawl again? A. It was the same colour as the one produced.</p>

Edwards came to our shop - I went, with Wade, to Mr. Lee's, and found Tobin in Mr. Lee's custody - it was between three and four o'clock; I saw Webster sitting on a rail, directly opposite Lee's door, with a brown coat and blue apron on - he came towards me, and I laid hold of his coat; he struck me and ran off, and I after him - when he had got to the other side of the way I saw him throw these goods out of his apron over the rails; it was the silk - also a shawl and cloak; he threw the shawl over first; Wade picked them up. As he turned the corner of Back-road I called Stop thief! and he was stopped; he is the man who threw the goods away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw him throw them away? A. Yes. I know the shawl by the pattern - it has no mark on it; the manufacturer makes for many persons - I know the cloak to be Mr. Hawthorn's, by the shape and by the ticket which is on it; it is very small, and was made from a remnant of cloth which we could not use.</p>

On the 2d of December about half-past two o'clock, I went up stairs to answer the dining-room bell, and as I came down to the foot of the stairs, I observed some one in the knife-house, which is part of the dwelling-house, and joins it; his back was towards me. I went into the knife-house, and found it was the prisoner - he had these two patent brass lamps in a basket, which was on the ground, before him; there were a few lemons in the basket; he turned round with two lemons in his hand, and asked if I wanted any lemons; I had put the lamps on a shelf in the knife-house before - he could reach them down; I asked what he was going to do with the lamps - he said, "Nothing at all;" I collared him, and called Edgar, the porter, to fetch the beadle. The lamps belonged to Mr. Penny; I am certain they are worth full 3l. - I do not know what they cost; they are large lamps, with two burners each; I think them worth between 3l. and 4l. I am certain they are worth more than 40s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Is there a back-door to the house? A. Yes - there is a side-door, which we call the back-door; he must have entered at that door. One lamp alone is worth 40s. I did not value them at Hatton-garden.</p>

B. on it; it cost me 27s. two months before - I left the articles stated in the indictment in it, which were worth 5l. I went about six weeks ago to fetch it, and it was gone; I had not been there in the interval. I went about a week afterwards to the prisoner, whom I knew before by sight - I said I heard he had taken my trunk; he said he had not, but he knew who had it; I said I should see further into it - he said Forsyth and Clarke had taken it, and sold it for 16s. - I knew them by sight; he spoke about the trunk, but did not mention its contents; I have not seen it or its contents since; I did not leave it in any one's care, and told no one that I had left it there; I was frequently going there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You knew the prisoner before? A. Yes, and I knew the other men by sight; they lodged in the same house. No application was made to the Magistrate for a warrant to apprehend Clarke and Forsyth, in my hearing. Forsyth is gone to Scotland. I met Clarke in Drury-lane since, but did not speak to him; I lost sight of him all at once - I do not know that he ran - he merely passed me; he was walking, bot when he saw me he got out of my sight; I did not follow him - I saw him afterwards come out of the Temple, but did not speak to him, as he ran off; I pursued, but did not cry Stop thief! he was not taken.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was your box covered with nails? A. There were brass nails round the lid.</p>
               <p>SARAH SEYMOUR. I keep the Black Boy and Apple Tree public-house, in the parish of St. Martin's in the Fields, and am a widow. I saw Beattie at my house six months ago. A dark trunk, covered with leather and brass nails, with the initials J. B. on it, stood on my third floor landing-place, for five or six months. I never knew who it belonged to; I have several lodgers; I do not know how it went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is yours a house of call for journeymen bakers? A. Yes. The trunk was not left in my care - I have four or five lodgers at a time, sometimes six - it is an open landing-place; Clarke and Forsyth lodged with me five or six months, and left about seven weeks ago; they went away within a day or two of each other; there was no alarm about the trunk then; I have not seen them since. I think other boxes stood there.</p>

            . I am son of the last witness. I have known the prisoner about six months, by his club being held at our house. I was taking something up to a gentleman in the parlour some time ago, and saw the prisoner taking<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070031"/>the box in question out of my mother's house - it was a dark leather box - I think black; it had brass nails round the top, and the initials J. B. or I. B., about the middle of the lid, in brass nails. I went to my mother, and told her Serringour was taking away his box, not knowing but it belonged to him - I took no further notice, and do not know what became of him; I at first saw him on the landing, and when I came down from the parlour he was gone. I had seen it on the third-floor landing-place once or twice, but never took particular notice of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many lodgers were there? A. I cannot say - there were several bakers, who were out of place. I thought the box might belong to the prisoner, though it had those initials; Clarke left the house about a week or a fortnight afterwards - Forsyth left a little before. I do not know of their being wanted on this charge.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Why did you not take it yourself? A. It was Sunday, I could not find time to fetch it - I lived at Mr. Horton's, Clifton-street, Finsbury, at the time, and the prisoner was living at Mrs. Seymour's - I have had the box three months - I bought it of Forsyth - it was open when I bought it - I gave 6s. and another box for it - all my clothes were in it when the prisoner fetched it - I was not before the Magistrate, and did not hear of this till last Saturday week.</p>

Oakingham had a 6d. and 4 1/2d., and in his hat I found a pair of gloves - he began to sing - I told him they were charged with a highway robbery, which I thought affected their lives - the girls answered "Then we shall have a holiday at the tread-mill if it is so;" I took them to the watch-house, and, on returning to the Red Lion, the servant of the house gave me a red silk handkerchief, which I produce.</p>

On Wednesday afternoon, the 29th of November, at two o'clock, I was in the shop; Wright and Harris knocked at the door - I did not know them before; they came in and asked to look at a second-hand silver watch; Wright said he had just come from sea, had 6l. in his pocket, and he wanted to buy one - I said I did not sell silver watches, and had none to suit him; he asked to see a metal one - I said I thought I had none that would suit him; he desired me very much to show him a watch - I showed him an old metal one in a tortoise-shell case - Wilkinson and Clark were standing at the window all this time, and appeared in conversation with each other - Wilkinson came in, and stood behind the other two; I asked what he wanted; he said, after some hesitation, that he wanted to buy a ring: I said I had none for sale, and desired him to go about his business - he went out, and stood at the window again, with Clark - while Wright was looking at the watch, Harris took an old silver watch off the case, and covered it with his hands; but I discovered it, and took it from him; I desired him not to touch any thing, unless I gave it into his hand; I took it from him, and hung it up - Harris then passed behind Wright, and got behind me, by the window - I turned round to speak to him, and at that instant Wright snatched up a watch and ran off; it was a French repeater, in a silver case, and a very large antique watch. I immediately rose a cry of Stop thief! my neighbours ran out and pursued Wright; Mr. Slark caught him in my sight; I called my wife down-stairs, but Harris slipped out behind me, and ran off with the other two prisoners who were at the window: I pursued them; they all run one way - I saw Slark take the watch from Wright; he gave it to me(Joseph Dossett here produced the watch); this is it; it has been in my possession ever since 1810, and is worth more than 40s.; he took it off a hook in the window.</p>

About one o'clock on the 29th of November, Wilkinson, Wright, and Harris, came into my shop, and after they left, my suspicion was excited - I watched them some distance, and saw them join Clark ten or twelve doors from my house; they all went on together to Moore's window, and all stopped there some time, then went on together four or five doors, and separated; Clark and Wilkinson went over the road, and crossed over again to Moore's door; the other two went to the window - about an hour after I heard a cry of Stop thief! - I followed and secured Wilkinson.</p>

I had an officer ready when he came home about three o'clock, and I gave him in charge: I told him he had been robbing me; the officer asked him for his key, and we went to search the box again, in his presence; the things were there still - he said he had done wrong, and they were my property.</p>

            . I am son of the last witness. - On the 29th of October she gave me the bag, which contained a 10l. note, two half-sovereigns, and some silver - I counted it, and put it into the bag again, and, to the best of my recollection, put it into the desk, but I am sure I left it in the shop; I recollect there was a half-crown piece in it, which I had taken between eight and nine o'clock that morning, and on ringing it, it sounded like lead, but I found it was cut in the edge, and cracked in two places; a little girl had paid it to me, who brought it from Mr. Griffiths; this did not occur to me till next morning, but I am positive I put a half-crown of that description into the bag. I went out of the shop about half-past nine o'clock, and thought I had left my mother there - I left no customer there; I thought I shut the door, but it does not latch very easy; when I came home I desired my mother to look into the desk for the bag, and it was gone. I went with a friend between eleven and twelve o'clock, to the prisoners' house, and found them with two more persons in the room; Thomas Andrews is Bridget's son - she was on the bed, beastly drunk, and smoking a pipe; Benyon was sitting on the bed, but not quite so drunk - she smelt of rum; the boy was sitting in the room. I told them we had missed some money in the morning, and asked if they could give me any information about it. I fetched Eatough, and was present when he made a search; 18s. in shillings, sixpences, and half-crowns were found in Bridget Andrews' pocket, and 7d. in copper; the officer took it, and the next day, at Worship-street, I recognized the half-crown, which was among them - I am sure that half-crown was in the bag; it was the one I have spoken of, and was taken out of her pocket.</p>

            . I am a labourer at the Custom-house-quay. On Thursday, the 23d of November, I received six wooden boxes and a bale from the locker; they were placed just outside the warehouse door; I know the prisoner very well - he was there above half an hour; I first saw him there about half-past four o'clock - he asked if I wanted a cart to take the cases; I said, No, the man was going after a truck. I have known the prisoner two years - he asked me ten or twelve times if I would have a cart, and kept leaning on the cases; a truck came along, and I asked the man who came along with it, if he would take them, as we could not get one; Brown said he would be d-d if I should take them in a truck, he would fetch a cart; instead of a cart coming a carman came; the prisoner came to the boxes, and leaned over them again; the carman asked if I wanted a cart - I said No; he said he would have nothing to do with them, and walked away; Brown was still leaning on the boxes; the man whom I had sent for a truck came in at the gate; I went to ask if he had got one, and when I turned round I saw Brown take one box in his right-hand; it would not weigh 28lbs.; he ran out of the gate with it; I told the man to mind the other five, and I followed him, but saw nothing of him - he was out of sight when I got to the gateway. The box has not been found; it was about five o'clock when he took it; I am positive I saw him take it away.</p>

I did not know what I was about; I had been most of my time in the country - when I collared the prisoner, some others caught hold of me behind, and said, "What do you want with him, he has not got your money; that man has got it, who is running away;" he got from me, and ran down Earl-street; I hallooed Stop thief! and he was secured before I lost sight of him; I have not found my money; he said, at Guildhall, if I would not come against him, he would get all my money back.</p>

            . I am an officer. I heard a cry of Stop thief! and the prisoner was running down Earl-street, pursued by a number of people; he was secured, and the prosecutor gave the statement he has now, as he went to the Compter; I heard him say something to the prosecutor to the effect he has stated, but, being in conversation with another officer, I did not attend to it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He tapped me on the shoulder, and asked if I would decide a wager; I asked what it was, and said, "Well, I will hold it, just to decide the wager;" he gave me the money, and told me to give it to the winner, which I did - he turned round, and said I had got his money.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. The shop is kept by Jenkins' father? A. I cannot say that; some of the prints were exposed in the window.</p>

I am an officer, and went with Mr. Watts, on the 2d of December, to Jenkins' shop - he called me in after the first prints were produced - I had been in the shop 7 or 8 minutes before John Joseph Jenkins produced the rest; he had hesitated about it, but I said I should certainly search - he then fetched them, and produced in all twenty-two - he said they had bought them of some lads, one of whom was a livery-servant - he said he did not purchase them, but at last acknowledged he was present when his brother did; that his brother was at Walworth, and that they had given information to Hurst and Co. - I went over to Walworth to his brother - he said they had bought them very fair - that the boy had produced his master's crest on his buttons, and that, as at times, these things were sold when persons were in distress - he thought it all correct - I found they had given information to Hurst and Co.</p>

            . I am a printseller, and live in Newport-street. On the 30th of November, about the middle of the day, Newland came and offered me some heads of Butler Dryden and Milton, which I gave him 2s. for - as he was going out he turned and asked if I would buy twelve plates to illustrate Byron's works - I said there should be twenty-two, and asked him the price - he said 9d. each; I offered him 5s. for the twelve - he went out, returned in two hours and a half, and took the 5s.; the next morning he brought me eight plates, five or six were soiled, but one was quite clean - I gave him 5s. 6d. for the lot - I had no suspicion at that time; but in the afternoon he produced some more, and I asked if he was a copper-plate printer - he said, No; that he had lived with Colonel Smith, in Harley-square, and the female-servant had given them to him - that she lived with Alaric Watts, at Manchester, who had given several soiled ones to his children, and she had asked him for some, which she had got framed - he went away - I gave information, and saw him in custody the next morning.</p>

Newland came to me, four or five days before he was taken, and brought a print called the Rivals, belonging to the Souvenir - I asked if he was a printer - he said, No; and suspecting him, I called him into a back-parlour, and asked where he got them from - he said Mr. Watts had given each of the servants a set - I said I knew they were stolen, and asked him to write his own and his master's name and address - he wrote "James Evans, No. 5, Foley-place - A. Watts, North-bank" - he asked 6s. for the set - I said I had been selling them at 6d. each, and I would give him 5s.; he said very well, and he would bring them in the morning - I intended to secure him if he brought them; but he came and said he had only eight and did not bring them - I said, "I must have the set;" and he said his fellow-servant had two which would make the set, and he would bring them - he called again, and said he exchanged them for other prints, which he produced - I did not secure him.</p>

               <p>LORD CLAURICARDE. This is the watch I lost; it is a very remarkable one - I had had it about three months.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Henrick, jeweller, Princes-street, Soho. I sold the Marquis Clauricarde this watch on the 12th of July, 1824; it is worth 40l. - I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I gave the woman this watch with the foul linen, from the Clarendon; she had not seen me with it, but I saw her with it on the Sunday when I called, and told her not to give it to any body that knew me, for fear of any harm; she said she would show it to a young man, who would buy it for his sweetheart; she fell out with me in consequence of my bringing a strange washerwoman to the house.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Pearson, and know Nolan's premises. On Tuesday, the 31st of October, about a quarter or half-past nine o'clock, I was in Nolan's yard, and saw the prisoner in the passage leading from the street to the yard; I stood in the yard, and he was standing in the passage, and was particular to shut the door after him; he went up Nolan's stairs very slow; I also went up, and he asked me if Mrs. Nolan was at home - he was then standing on the landing; I said I did not think she was at home; I left him standing on the landing; I went away: I am sure he is the man - he was dressed as he is now.</p>
               <p>JOHN NOLAN. I rent these two rooms. I came home at twelve o'clock - my wife told me what had happened; I went over at night to where the prisoner lodges, and found him at last at the Cock public-house, in Hopkins'-street, sitting there with his brother, having a pot of beer - his brother, the man who lodged with him, and his wife, were with him - his brother desired me to sit down, and drink; I said I wanted to speak to them at the door - they came to the door; I collared the prisoner, and said,"Was not you at my house to-day;" he said, "I was not;" I said, "I am told you were, and have broken my door and box open, and taken three sovereigns and a half out of it;" he said, "I was not there;" I said, "The man will know you - come up with me to him, and he can see you, or else I shall send you to the watch-house, and bring Pearson forward in the morning;" I took him to Pearson, who said he was the man who was in the yard, and went up the stairs - he denied it.</p>

            . I am beadle of St. George, Hanover-square. I was called in about eight o'clock at night on the 31st of October. I went to the Red Lion public-house in Ebury-street, and found Nolan - he said the prisoner had broken into his house, and robbed him of three sovereigns and a half; the prisoner denied it; I asked where he had been all that day - he said at work in Newport-market. I searched him, and found one shilling, one sixpence, one penny-piece, and a duplicate, on him. On the following morning, previous to taking him to Queen-square, I said I should go to Newport-market, and inquire if he had been there all day - he then said he had been there but half a day, and he could not tell me the number of the house, or the person's name, or where they lived, but that he had been moving goods.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was working half a day - this man is my first cousin; I was moving a man's goods, and he gave me 2s. and a pot of beer. I never asked him where the goods came from; I helped to put them into the waggon - my partner is gone into the country, and cannot come here.</p>

Bowter accompanied us to my shop, where the prisoner was at work, and recognized him as the man who sold it to him. I brought him into the shop, and asked him to tell me to what other places he had taken my property, as I had lost some weighing-machines -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070041"/>I said it would save me a deal of trouble, as I was determined to find it out; he then said, voluntarily, that he had sold two mills and two weighing-machines of mine, to Mr. Frost, of Castle-street, and some mills and weighing-machines to Levi, of Belton-street; we went to Frost's, and found two mills and two machines; we also found two mills and two machines, at Levi's - I know them all to be mine.

I had been to the desk about half an hour before, and I left in it a wooden bowl, containing a half-crown, and another containing some halfpence; I heard the door open and the bell ring, but thinking it was my son I did not attend; I heard the handle turn round - a bell rings in the parlour when the door opens; I heard a cry of Mother! I ran into the shop, and saw Turner bring the prisoner in - my son was there. I described what money I had, and Turner produced it; I missed the half-crown and halfpence from the desk.</p>

I said, "What business have you at my father's desk?" and immediately called Mother! he instantly ran out of the shop; I pursued, crying Stop thief! Turner was coming out of his house - he joined in the pursuit, and he was taken, without being out of my sight; he had the desk open, but I did not see him take any thing.

When I met him on the stairs, I do not know whether he came from the breakfast or bed-room - I never said I had lost but seven sovereigns, or 5l. 10s. - I found the rest among my clothes; my box was safe at half-past nine o'clock in the morning, and the other lodgers were then all gone out, and my landlord was out - there was no lock to the bed-room door; one of the lodgers breakfasted with us, and he went out at the same time as me.</p>

On the 28th of November, the prisoner and Higgins breakfasted with me, but nobody else; the other lodgers had all gone out to work at six o'clock; Higgins said he wanted his hair cut, and the prisoner said that a man next door would do it - I asked Higgins to stop in his own room and have it done, but the prisoner persuaded him to have it cut next door, and after breakfast they went down-stairs together; the prisoner returned directly, and went through my room into the bed-room; nobody but him was there - he told me he was taken very ill in the stomach, and asked me to lend him 1 1/2d. for some gin, as he had not got a farthing; he wanted me to fetch it, but I went down and sent somebody for it, and as I returned, he went into the bed-room and closed the door, he merely shut it; the gin came in about ten minutes, and I asked him to come out and have it; he said, "Stop a while" - I put it down, and he was in the room full ten minutes longer; I heard a noise like the box moving against the wainscoat, and the jingling of money on the floor - it did not sound like silver, but like gold falling on the floor - he came out and asked me for the gin; he drank it out of the bottle, without pouring it into a glass - I went downstairs, and did not see him again till he was taken; he had lodged there about five weeks; nobody but him had gone into the room before Higgins returned, which was in about five minutes after the prisoner left.</p>

Higgins first mentioned about getting his hair cut - I was not more than a minute or two gone down for the gin; I found him in the bed-room, and the door closed - I saw him close the door - I heard something move against the wainscoat, and after that heard money scattering on the floor; I thought at the time it was something in his pocket, which he shook on the floor - it struck me at the time it was nothing proper; I thought it was gold; I said nothing to him; he had told me he had no money about him, but I did not know but he might have money and yet deny it, as he owed me some; it was not my place to ask him about it.</p>

I fetched my staff, went into Grafton-street, and there found him in a man's custody - he said he would go with me, as I was an officer; and as we went along, he said, "I did not take the sovereigns" - I had not mentioned sovereigns, nor heard a word about them before. When I got to the watch-house, he said, "Don't search me, I have not got the sovereigns" - I found 19s. 3d. on him. A man named George Craven followed him to Marlborough-street; they got into conversation by the fire-place in the office, and the prisoner said to him, "Mind you say you brought me some silver;" "What silver," said Craven; "O," he said, "say you brought me some silver, and be sure you say it was after breakfast to-day" - Craven said, "After breakfast?" "Yes," said the prisoner, "after breakfast, and more than that, you must swear to it; or if you cannot, you know who will" - I turned round and said, "What are you talking about, silver?" Craven replied, "I brought him some silver" - I said, "What silver?" he said, "I don't know" - I said, "Where did you bring it from?" he said from a man; he did not know what man; I said, "What house? what number?" he said, "I don't know, but I know it was yesterday."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had not Higgins been speaking to him before you took him? A. Not to my knowledge; I found no gold on him - he said I should not find the gold.</p>

This clock was safe at half-past eleven o'clock on the 12th of October - I do not recollect seeing the prisoner there, not to be positive of his person: it was missed about twelve o'clock - there was a person in the house similar to the prisoner in dress, but I cannot speak to his person.

            . I am a broker, and live in the New Cut, Lambeth. On a Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday in October, I bought this clock of the prisoner for 2l. - he brought it to me about the middle of the day; I think he was alone - he told me it did not belong to him, but to a clockmaker who lived in Clerkenwell, and who was obliged to part with it - he expected to receive 5s. for his trouble in selling it. Mr. Fiske claimed it in about four days - I met the prisoner, three weeks or a month afterwards, in Fleet-street; I had been told by an officer that I was to take him up when I saw him, but it was not in my power to lay hold of him; I only spoke civilly to him, and said nothing about the clock - I think we only said,"How do you do?" I did not give any alarm; it would have been a folly to do so, as no officer was near - he came to sell something at my house about a fortnight afterwards, and was taken - there had been a plan laid to take him - I am certain of his person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you recollect the day of the month? A. No; I only know it was Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday; I thought it best to take him when I had an officer handy - when he sold me the clock, he told me there was a person waiting outside for the money, but I did not see that person, nor did he point him out; I did not go to the door; I had known the prisoner twelve months, or I should have been more particular - he might have said it belonged to a man who was waiting at the door, but I do not recollect it - I only recollect that he said it belonged to the maker in Clerkenwell. I thought 2l. as much as it was worth, to sell again; but I am not a competent judge - there was a person hanging a bell at my house at the time; I do not know his name.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 17th of October I went with Mr. Fiske, and got the clock from Munting's.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a long written defence, stating that he had met an acquaintance, named Conway, in St. John-street, whom he understood to be a clockmaker, and whom he had been in the habit of meeting for the last four years, at the Cherry Tree public-house, in Clerkenwell. Conway had the clock, which he stated to be worth 4l. 10s., but, being in distress, that he would give the prisoner all he could get above 2l. for it; that they went together over to Lambeth, and Conway waited outside while he went in and sold the clock; that he told Munting, that all he got above 2l. he was to have, and, after walking from Clerkenwell, it was natural that he should wish to get something - that Munting pointed to the door, and said, "Is that the person it belongs to;" he said, Yes; he met Munting in Fleet-street afterwards, and went and drank with him at a public-house in Shoe-lane, but he said nothing about the clock.</p>
               <p>JAMES MUNTING re-examined. I did drink with him when I met him in Fleet-street, and stopped with him about an hour; my reasons for so doing were, that if an officer had come in I should have given him in charge; I did not desire the landlord to send for one. I was entirely guided by the officer's directions; Sinderby is the man who was hanging the bell.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18261207-63-person496">- SINDERBY</persName>
            . I was hanging a bell in Munting's passage in October, when the prisoner came there - the shop door was open, and there was a man out at the door - Jones said he had the clock to sell for a person, who was waiting at the door - he told Munting the person who belonged to the clock, said it was a very good one, and worth at least 3l., but he should have it for 2l. 10s., and then he should get 10s. for his trouble; he agreed at last to give 2l. for it. When I had finished my job I went into the public-house; he paid the prisoner for the clock within five minutes after he paid me - they were nearly an hour bargaining about the clock; it was then five minutes after three. I, the prisoner, and the person who was waiting for him, went into the public-house together, and had a pot of beer - I saw him give the man the 2l., and he gave him 5s. for his trouble; the man complained that the clock was worth more, and then went away. The public-house is two or three doors from Munting's.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was this a short or a tall man? A. He was rather tall, and pitted with the small-pox - I have not seen him since; I did not go before the Magistrate: I heard of the prisoner being taken up about a fortnight ago - I think his wife called on me; I did not mention what I knew to anybody; I have known the prisoner a good while.</p>
               <p>Q. When, for the first time, did you tell anybody what you have stated to-day? A. I suppose a day or two afterwards - I told it to a person whom I knew.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that person? A. Why, I do not know; I might tell it - there is no doubt but I mentioned it to people, but I cannot say who.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, who did you tell it to? A. I told it to a person named Gibson, who lives in Bear-lane, directly I heard he was taken about the clock, and I told it to one Butler, and Wilson; I dare say I told it to half a dozen or a dozen people; none of them are here; I never<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070044"/>saw the other man before; there was no conversation between us, except his giving him the 5s. I did not say a word; we were not ten minutes in the public-house - the man was dressed like a working man, with a white apron on - he went away before the prisoner.</p>

I returned between eight and nine o'clock, and found the street door burst open, the drawers all open, and property strewed about; I missed a 5s. piece, and a few shillings from the drawer; some gown pieces laid in the middle of the room, with a large shawl, ready to pack them in.

            . I live in King's-place, within thirty yards of Leggett's house. On the 23d of April, 1825, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, I saw Gravett standing at the end of Church-row - he watched Mrs. Leggatt out to market, away from the house; he then went down Church-row, and about twenty minutes after seven o'clock, I went to Leggett's house for some milk, and passed Gravett within fourteen or fifteen yards of the house; I went on, and when I pushed Leggett's door I found it was open; a chain was round the knob - it had been broken open; I went into the shop, and the prisoner stood there; I have known him many years. I said, "Is not Leggett at home?" he said, No - I said, "I want some milk;" he said, "So do I;" I put my back against the door, and said, "Well, he won't be long;" he stood with a bit of parsley in his hand, twisting it about, in an agitated manner, and said, "Well, Mary, as Leggett is not here, we can't have it" - he then passed me, and ran away. I did not know where he lived - his family were brought up in our neighbourhood; I had seen him constantly about before this happened, but not afterwards, till the 24th of November last, when he was in custody, except once, about twelve months ago or longer, when he came and begged of me not to appear against him, and asked me to say he was asking for milk; I had a basin in my hand for the milk, but he had neither basin nor mug; I saw nobody else in the house. I saw Leggett between eight and nine o'clock, and told him what I had seen; I called a young woman, and told her somebody had broken in; we looked into the parlour, and saw the drawers open, and the things scattered about; Gravett was taken up, and examined at Hatton-garden - the Magistrate discharged him, saying he must be taken again if Smith was found. Leggett did not appear there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you observe the door open? A. I pushed it, and the chain rattled. I found it ajar - anybody going to it might see that.</p>

            . I am a gold and silver worker, and live in Spann's-buildings, St. Pancras, fifty or sixty yards from Leggett's. On the 23d of November, 1825, about seven o'clock in the morning, I went to my gate, and saw Smith come running down as fast as he could, from the back walk, in a direction from Leggett's house; I thought there was something the matter; I went, and found Dimmock there. I went into the house which had been broken open, and the things were all in confusion. I knew the prisoner before, and cannot be mistaken in him. Limbrick was sent for, and then I left the place. I knew the prisoner lived in the neighbourhood, but I did not know where; he was frequently about, but I never saw him after this.</p>

On Wednesday, the 29th of November, the prisoner came alone into the shop, about half-past one o'clock, and asked to look at some cambric muslin - I was serving three distinct customers at the time - there was a shopman there - nothing was shown to her; I desired her to walk lower down the shop and I would attend upon her - I suspected her, and watched her as minutely as I could - I saw her reach over the counter, just opposite a pile of Irish linen; I shortly saw her lay hold of something, but could not see what it was - she put it under her left arm, and walked down the shop, concealing it under her shawl - I could just see the end of it; she attempted to walk out, and when she came opposite me, I asked if she had been served - she said, No - I said, "I will serve you directly;" she said, "No, I will call again;" but I reached a chair for her to sit down, so that her left-side should be towards me: but she turned her back to me; I then laid hold of her, and found she had a piece of Irish linen, which cost us exactly 2l. 16s. - I said, "You old wretch, what have you got under your shawl;" she stammered, and said,"I have nothing but this bundle;" producing one from under her right-arm, at the same time she dropped the Irish linen - I sent for an officer, who took her - the house is the dwelling-house of myself and father - we both reside there, and the rent is paid out of the partnership funds.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Brown's employ. The prisoner lived in the neighbourhood; I do not know what he is. On Thursday, the 23d of November, about half-past eight o'clock at night, I stationed myself in the middle of the field, about twelve yards from the hay; I saw the prisoner and White come into the middle of the field, and take the truss up - it would weigh 30lbs. - they each took half of it; I followed them with it into the road, and asked if they had stolen that hay - they said, No - they both had it on their backs; I followed them into the town, but let them go without stopping them; I have not found it - there was no hay in the field, but what was my master's - the prisoner was taken on the Wednesday following.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Where were you when we took the hay? A. About twelve yards off - they did not appear to see me - they each had a sack, which they put it into.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The sack would not hold half a truss; I never had any hay out of his master's field - he came and said I had stolen his master's hay; I said I had not; he said, "You have, and I shall know you."</p>
               <p>GEORGE CLAYTON. I said, "Tims, you have stolen this hay;" he denied it, but when we got nearly into the town, he said he had, and it was the first time.</p>

The prisoner lived nearly opposite to me; I became acquainted with him in the beginning of 1825, when he sent a note for me to bleed him - he was not in business at that time, but I understood from himself, that he had been running a coach - a legacy had been left me, which the prisoner did not know then, but did afterwards. About July, 1825, he stated a great deal to me about coaches, and said if I liked to have any concern with him, he was going to run a London coach, and if I would advance him 100l., I should have three horses, half a new set of harness, and half the profits, and if I did not approve of the business, there was an agreement entered into; it is burnt - I did not see it burnt - I understood so from Mr. Becket; if I did not like, the agreement was, that I might return the horses and harness, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070047"/>money should he returned to me; I continued to run them about seven or eight weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any limited time for you to see whether you liked or disliked it? A. No - after I had run them some time, I told him I did not like the concern, and requested him to return me the money according to his agreement; I returned the horses, and he told me he could not pay the 100l., but wished me to draw a bill on him at three months - this was in October - it became due in January - he accepted it, but did not pay any part of it when due; I produced the bill (this bill was here read, it was a promissory note for 136l., and interest for the same, dated October, at three months, signed T. Becket; and endorsed was a receipt for 21l. dated March 9, 1826 -"11th of March, received for rent and fixtures of place, No. 26, Blackfriars-road, 6l. 10s. 8d.") I have given him credit on the back for all I ever received on account of the bill. I received this letter from him about the end of March, or beginning of April last - it is not dated - he gave it me himself - (the following extract from the letter produced was here read, "N. B. The balance of 108l. 10s. 8d. shall shortly be paid, that we may quit friends") - subsequent to the receipt of this letter, I was arrested at the suit of the prisoner for 21l. - this was at the end of June - I was taken to a lock-up house in George-street, Blackfriars-road, and kept there two days and two nights; on my solemn oath, I did not owe him a farthing, but he owed me the balance of the bill 108s. 10s. 8d. - about five minutes after I got to the lock-up house, the defendant called on me, and much violent altercation took place upon the impropriety of his arresting me; I told him he had perjured himself - he said if I used any such abusive language as that, he would take his hat and go out - in about half an hour he sent for some porter, and asked if I would have some, and told me he had arrested me on purpose, that I might not be hostile to him with regard to his commission of bankruptcy (he was a bankrupt at that time, as I understood, by the papers), and that he was going to bring an action against a clergyman in Lincolnshire, which he could not do without my evidence; he said he would endeavour to get me out, but it was too late that night; he called several times next day; I was afterwards liberated, and he paid all the expenses; I am married - my wife was at home - she called at the lock-up house that night, but whether while the defendant was there I do not know - (here the following extract from the letter produced was read,"This is the account as it stands, leaving to you 108l. 10s. 8d. of my own good will and gift.")</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not the first application, on the coach account, made by you to the defendant? A. No. I did not tell him I was tired of my profession, by which I was not getting a farthing, and wish him to allow me to horse a coach; I swear that - Herbert Evans was our book-keeper - he was about three months in our employ - we were concerned in two coaches - the bill was the balance of all accounts; he sold me five horses and half a set of new harness; they came to 106l.; I was to horse the Worcester coach from there to Pershore, which is nine miles, no further; I was to horse the Independent coach to Bromyard, fourteen miles; I did that five or six weeks; I was to pay for the forage of the horses on that stage - the defendant paid that, but it was settled in the balance - I could see the books when I liked - I cannot say whether Evans, the book-keeper, knows of my paying for the forage; I think I never conversed with him on that subject; I swear that I paid it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever give the defendant a bill for any money you owed him? A. Yes; and that bill was cancelled at the time of our settlement - it was not given up to me; he told me he had burnt it at the time of the settlement - nobody was present; I know the defendant was a bankrupt; I swear he said he arrested me that I might not be hostile; he was not a bankrupt when we made the settlement, nor had he even told me he was about to become one - what I mean by the settlement is, when he gave me this promissory note.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If the note had been paid, it would have been a settlement? A. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Can you say whether he become a bankrupt, or arrested you first? A. I cannot exactly state - I think he was a bankrupt about a week before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not, when you gave him the 21l. bill, owe him 150l.? A. No. I had taken no proceedings on my bill before he arrested me; nobody was present when I paid him for the horses and harness - I took no receipt - I received a note from him, saying, he had the 21l. bill, and if I did not pay it, I should be arrested; I believe he has stated he has a claim of above 100l. on me; I do not know E. Eastwood, and am not aware that I ever saw him - I was at a house in Basinghall-street with the defendant and a gentleman; I was not then in conversation with him on the subject of our accounts - nobody was present when we talked about our affairs; I never said the 108l. bill was nothing but an accommodation bill, or that the defendant liberated me, on my promise to give up that bill, and call it an accommodation bill; I never had any conversation with the defendant on the subject of this bill in the presence of Evans - he was not present when this bill was drawn, nor sent out to buy a stamp; the defendant advanced to me the keep of the five horses for about five weeks; I did not pay him weekly - it was settled monthly, with the coach accounts, out of the earnings of the coach, instead of giving it to me; the book-keeper is aware of that, I should think.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not some coach stopped, and 500l. due to the defendant in consequence of it? A. I do not know that he was to receive 500l. - he never told me so; I was witness to a signature on a stamp; this bill was not given for my expenses and trouble on that occasion; I never stated in Evans' presence that it was given for that; Becket gave me the bill in his lodgings, at Worcester - Evans was not present at any conversation about this bill being given - Becket never told me he had brought an action to recover the 500l. - I am now assistant to a physician; I was living with Mr. Humphreys, an attorney, when I was served with this writ; I lived four or five months with him, and have left only ten days; I lived with Messrs. Raymond and Co., at Worcester; when I settled with the defendant for the keep of the horses, I had the books; the book-keeper was not there; I received 28s. or 29s. as my share of the profit, after he had paid himself for the horses; I have not proved this debt under his commission, as I intended to take him for it afterwards; I went to examine his ba<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070048"/>lance sheet before the Commissioners - they asked if I was a creditor; I said, Yes, but declined proving.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. If you had, you must have given up your bill? A. Yes; what I call the settlement, was the bill being given; nobody was present.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When the 136l. bill was given, there had been a 21l. bill given before; what became of that? A. It was cancelled; this bill was given as a final settlement of every item on both sides; Becket said he had burnt it; it was reckoned before the balance was struck of 136l.; there was no money transaction of any kind after that, or any thing upon which a debt could accrue.</p>

            . I am a commission-broker. I have known the defendant several years - I have seen Colls once or twice - I saw him in company with Becket, who said to me, "This is my friend Mr. Colls, who I mentioned to you before;" some conversation took place, and Becket said, "We have had some differences, but they are now made up;" Colls nodded assent; this was on the 5th of August; some of Becket's friends then came up, and Becket went away with them; Colls told me he was very sorry for what had passed, and he would do any thing for him; that Becket had arrested him for a 21l. bill, and at the same time he had a bill of his for 108l. - he considered the arrest was unjust, but matters were settled between them - he said Becket had released him, and they had settled their differences - that Becket was a good fellow, and he would do any thing to serve him - he did not say he had promised to give up the 108l. bill - this was after the arrest, on the day of the third meeting of Becket's creditors - he walked into the Bankrupt-court, and I asked if he meant to prove his debt - he said, No, they had settled their differences; he did not say where the bill was - Becket bears the character of a perfect gentleman.</p>

            . I was book-keeper to these parties; Mr. Colls horsed the coach to Birmingham - Mr. Becket fed the horses for about three months - I was never present when Colls paid Becket any of the money advanced: I never saw this 136l. bill before; I was present when a bill was given by Becket to Colls; I bought the stamp - this was the latter end of October, or the beginning of November 1825, for it was after the London coach had stopped, which was on the 28th of October; the other coach stopped on the 10th of November; I heard Colls say it was an accommodation bill - it was said Colls was principal witness to the signing of a bond respecting the stopping of a coach, and he being necessary to prove the signature of Mr. Bowen of Pershore, Colls said it would be a great expense to come from London to Worscester to give evidence, and wanted 150l.; and after consideration, Becket gave him a 140l. bill, considering the 40l. would pay his expenses if he was absent a week, and the 100l. to put into his pocket - I heard this between Colls and Becket.</p>


               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. What are you now? A. I am in the employ of Mr. Hyde, an attorney at Worcester - I left the defendant's service in November, 1825; before that, I lived with a Mr. Clark, who made a charge against me for having misapplied some of his money - I had left him before I heard of it - he is a coach-owner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the defendant dismiss you for embezzling his money? A. No - I left them because the coach stopped - I was not charged with going off with 50l. or 60l. - I never saw a bill paid by my father to Becket - I never heard of his paying the defendant any money on my account - I went from him to Mr. Hyde.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was any charge true or false made by Mr. Becket? Q. No - I left on the 10th of November.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did Mr. Clark make any charge against you? A. No; he was under-sheriff of Worcester last year; both coaches had stopped in 1825.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. With respect to the 140l., what became of the action? A. It dropped on account of Becket being involved; he could not carry it on.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BURT. I was in Becket and Colls' employ on the Bromyard coach - Colls was to horse it; the horses were kept by Becket nearly three months; I am sure it was above five weeks - he allowed me 1s. a day for attending them. <rs id="t18261207-74-verdict439" type="verdictDescription">

I then walked back, and waited at Pugh's-row till the prisoner came in - I told him I wanted him to go to the office, to inquire about the box, as I had not received it; he went with me, but said he had occasion to stop, and desired me to go into the office - I went in, but did not find it. I was coming back, not having seen him, when he ran after me; I said, "You was not at the office; and the clerk says you took it away"- he said, "I did not," and returned towards the office with me; just before we got there he went down a dark turning; I followed him - he ran, but I seized him - he tried to escape, but I took him to the office; the clerk said, "That is the man who had the box."</p>

The prosecutor and the prisoner came on the 9th, and asked a few questions, and on the 10th they brought the box, before nine o'clock in the morning - Williams gave me 2d. for booking; the prisoner then said, "You need not be in a hurry to load the box, as we may want it again - he may not go;" I said, "Very well;" they left, and in about two hours the prisoner returned, alone, and asked for the box - I asked how he was going to send it; he said, "The soldier is not going for a week - I am going to take it back to his lodging;" he took it away.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). The prosecutor had married an Irish woman, for no other purpose than her money, which is plainly evident, by his telling me that on their arrival at the County of Cork, he intended to leave her, and return to London, and he ordered me to fetch this box, sell the things which it contained, and have the money ready against his arrival. I was much in want of money, and when he came up I had spent it.</p>

            . I am foreman to John Hyde Bowler and his partners; this hat is theirs; it was put out to go to Bristol; Pink came to our house three or four times a week from Lincoln's shop, and had access to the warehouse - the wholesale price of it is 22s.; I did not miss it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070052"/>till I heard of his being in custody; the ruffs cost 15s. and 16s. each; and must have been taken while I was at tea; the ruffs are in an unfinished state; he could do nothing with them.</p>

            . I keep a coal-shed in Swallow-street. I have known Orgar about a year and a half; he came to my house about seven or eight weeks ago, and asked if he might leave some boxes which he bad been with to a gentleman's house, but he was out - he then asked if his brother might leave a parcel there, and said he would come for it - Pink, who was with him then, left a parcel and hat-box - I had seen Pink pass the door with hat-boxes in his hand; the parcel was as large as these ruffs - Orgar called in two or three hours and fetched them all away - he had left things there before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You cannot tell what was in the boxes? A. No.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Five witnesses appeared to the character of Pink, and five for Orgar.</p>

            . I know the prisoner. On the 7th of December, 1818, I and my wife were present at St. James's, Westminster, when he was married to Mary Hitchcock - they lived together till within the last five weeks; she is now in Court, and very near her confinement.</p>
               <p>JOHN HAIR re-examined. When I consented to my daughter's marriage, I do not recollect his saying whether he was single or a widower - he never told me he had been married - he paid his addresses to her about two years, but only three months at my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Was there never any report of a former marriage? A. There was, about four months ago; my wife heard of it, but we could learn no foundation for it - she married from my house, but she had lived at a liquor-shop, and he visited her there. There was some little dispute between her and my wife, who is her mother-in-law, and I got her a place - I knew the prisoner was a police-officer of Marlborough-street; he lived near me - I inquired of my daughter about it.</p>
               <p>MRS. HAIR. I know the prisoner - he used to come to our house; I heard a report of his having been married, and inquired of my daughter-in-law about him; she said he was not married.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 31st of October I was with Morgan, about six o'clock in the evening, at the corner of Park-lane, and saw the three prisoners together - Davis had something under his arm; we crossed the road, and I saw it was an iron rail; I asked him what it was - he said, a few sticks, which he had picked up in Park-lane. The other prisoners ran away.</p>

            . On the 23d of October, in the evening, I was on duty in the Harrow-road, and saw the prisoner near Mr. Bowran's farm; he passed me with an empty cart, and stopped in the road, about one hundred yards from Bowran's place; two loads of hay came out of the yard, and directly they passed, he went to the yard - a man came out, and I saw them put three trusses of hay into the cart; the prisoner went on in the cart with them; he did not take the hay out of the yard, but was in the cart, and received it. I went and asked if that was Mr. Bowran's cart; he said. Yes; I said I did not think it was; he said it was - I said, "Why then did not you come out with the teams?" he said he had been to Kensal-green; I said he had not been out of my sight; he then said he came from the Red Lion public-house - that they wanted some hay, and he had been for it; he asked if I would go there; I said perhaps I might - he said if I would there was any thing I choose to drink at my service. I then took him to the watch-house. The name of R. Miller was on the cart - he is hostler at the Red Lion. I took the prisoner next morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A man came and said he wanted my horse and cart for an hour; he did not say for what; he took me along the road, and threw the hay into the cart - he told me to go on, and he would catch me before I got to Paddington.</p>
               <p>MR. BOWRAN. I think my foreman, who has absconded, did it, and that the prisoner is innocent; two of my men have absconded - I suspect both.</p>

            . I am a chimney-sweeper, and lived, on the 4th of August, at No. 47, Duck-lane. On that morning the prisoner, with Miles and another person, came in with a sack, with something in it, and a brush and a shovel, at half-past seven o'clock; they put the sack down on the floor, and it laid there for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes - I saw it opened, and a bundle of linen was drawn out of it, which was thrown up in an empty cupboard - they all went down; I then got up, and saw this apron hanging half-way out of the bundle - Miles brought the sack in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Miles asked me to go with him to do the flues, and when I came down I missed him out of the kitchen - he returned with something in the sack - I asked what it was, and he said, "Ashes from the dusthole" - he then took up the ashes from there, and we went away - I believe Miles suffered for it last Session.</p>

The prisoner came there on the 30th of November, about nine o'clock in the morning, and asked for some black-kid gloves - I showed him some, and while I turned my head, he put three gloves into his pocket - he was going away, and I accused him of taking them - he denied it, and tried to make his escape; but another young man came up, and he was taken - I found three gloves on him - I missed them from the paper - I found the fellow to one of the gloves.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not the prisoner offer you 2s. 6d. a pair for the gloves? A. Yes; he offered to pay the other young man for them, when I accused him of it - I told the Magistrate that he offered to make his escape - I went out to call my master.</p>

I am shopman to Mr. Corren. - Lewis rang the bell - I ran up; and on getting into the shop, I saw the prisoner with the handle of the door in his hand; Lewis accused him of taking some gloves, which he denied; but on his persisting, the prisoner said he had a pair of gloves in his pocket, for which he was going to pay; and, on his producing the gloves, I found this pair<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070059"/>and this odd one on him - he offered 2s. 6d. for the pair - I saw him attempt to open the door, which the witness kept shut - he took the chain down, I believe, but there was a latch - my master came into the shop, and the prisoner fell on his knees, and asked for forgiveness - I heard him say he was willing to pay for them after he had produced them - but he denied having them at first.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Islington. On the 1st of November, at a quarter-past three o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner coming out of Mr. Laycock's premises with a pail and tin milk-kettle in his hands - I said, "What have you there? give up what you have got;" he gave the kettle to the woman who was with him- they walked on - I called to them to stop; the prisoner ran over to me and said, "Watchman, don't say any thing about it" - I took the woman and can back to the yard; the prisoner went away; it was full of milk.</p>

On the 13th of November, about one o'clock, I saw the prisoner come and take this stuff out of the window - I heard it drawn out, went to the door, and saw her pull it out - I called to her, but she went into a passage; I went and took her - I have seen her in the shop before; another girl was with her.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am watchman of St. Ann's. I met the prisoner in Market-street, on the 8th of November, at half-past four o'clock in the morning - she said she was an hour too late for her washing: she had these sheets and candlesticks before her - I followed her across the turning, and asked what she had - she said a sheet, which she was going to take to wash at her sister's - I said,"Here is a candlestick;" she said, "Yes, I am going to clean it" - I took her to the watch-house; she objected to the sheets being examined by a man, and took the candlesticks out herself - she gave me two false addresses - I at last found the prosecutor.</p>

I said, "No, but I have lost something else;" I missed two sovereigns and a half from my waistcoat pocket; I said, "You have robbed me of two sovereigns and a half;" she said, "No - I have not a farthing about me;" she then threw herself down on some steps, pulled both her stockings off, and some half-pence fell out, but nothing else; she was then walking on, and some more half-pence fell from her; I then saw her attempt to put her hand into her bosom, but I clasped her hands, and said I would take her to the watch-house - she said she would go, and I gave her to the watchman - we then went on, and a sovereign dropped before us in the watch-house - the constable searched her; I heard a sovereign fall from her after that, and saw her take the half-sovereign from her mouth.</p>

               <p>JURY to JAMES MANN. Q. How long was it, after you saw the boys, that you gave the alarm? A. About three hours; I was going out then, and returned about four o'clock; I told my master, and he said, why did I not get an officer; I said I was afraid - I afterwards saw Smith looking in at our window, and told the patrol, who went and caught him and Butler.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see what was in the bag? A. No; I met you with the bag empty, and when I returned I met you with it full.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going home and had this wood to carry to a friend's; I sat there I suppose an hour, and then this woman came, and said, "That is the man who robbed me;" I said, "Ma'am" - "Yes," said she,"you have robbed me of my bed-clothes;" I said I had done no such thing, what I brought here is in the coalhole - the empty bag was on the floor - she saw it, and did not know it again - I never saw this property till it was shown me by the officer - there are many people come to that house - it is a lodging-house.</p>

            . I am a prisoner in the House of Correction. I went with the two prisoners in October last - we set off to go to Portsmouth in order to go to sea - we went to Guildford - they said we had better not go all together into town, as the people would look at us - this was on a Wednesday - they told me to stop behind; but I followed gently after them - I saw them go into the prosecutor's shop - I did not see the name on the door - Harding went and staid a little time - Withers stood at the door and window - when Harding came out, they walked on very fast - I went, and asked what they walked so fast for - Harding said, "Never mind, we have only got a silver watch;" he pulled it out of his pocket, and gave it to Withers - I saw it was a silver-hunter - we went to Portsmouth and returned from there in a week, on a Tuesday - I saw Cooke on the Thursday morning, and he had bought this watch the day before; and on Saturday, I told Buckeridge of it - I had no share in the produce of it.</p>

            . In consequence of what Burchmore told me, I went to Harding's house; they denied him; but I found him concealed in the back-parlour- and in taking him to the watch-house, I told him it was for stealing a watch at Guildford, and some pen-knives and other things at Portsmouth; he said he did not care, there were more in it, and they must all fare alike; I afterwards took Withers, and have been since looking for one Suter; but have not found him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you quite certain of him? A. Yes; I do not know where he lives; I heard he was a weaver.

               <p>COURT. Q. Who put money on the table? A. A man put down three sovereigns (which laid there some time) for me not to prosecute - I said I knew nothing about law - a person said it was only not to appear at Worship-street; and I got out of the way till I was forced to appear. I laid the money on the mantel-piece after some time - I know the prisoner was living at Bethnal-green on the 6th of November, three or four hundred yards from where I was robbed, and about two hundred yards from me - I do not know where he lived before - I complained of somebody throwing dirt at my windows, but not that it was him - I heard he was often passing my house.</p>

            . I am a hair-dresser. The prisoners were taken in my shop - they were both sitting down, having their hair cut - a third man was waiting there, and a woman - they had been there five or six minutes, when Simpson came in - the prisoners both remained in their situation, but I saw the third man in momentary agitation - he made up to Newland - I was then keeping some intruders out of the shop, and the third man escaped; the prisoners got up after the third man escaped, but not before.</p>
               <p>JOHN SIMPSON re-examined. The moment I went in the prisoners got up, and I think, said, "What do you want with us?"</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr, PHILLIPS. Q. You were cutting Newland's hair? A. Yes; he did not take his coat ff - I did not see him with the watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Did not you put a cloth over his arms? A. Yes; he could not put his hand behind him; the watch hung on the back of the chair, it was not there before they came in; I know the third man came up to the chair, or near it - I was attending to my business - I think the other man might have put it there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say Newland could not put it there without your seeing him? A. No; they had cloths before them; that does not confine their arms - the watch hung on the chair back; I stood behind the chair till Linsey took the watch.(Watch produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am the wife of John Savage. On the 9th of November, about a quarter to three o'clock, my landlord came for my rent; the prisoner had taken a shop of me in New Compton-street; I took out my pocket-book and paid Ellis, the landlord; I had 9 sovereigns and 13s. left; I laid the book on the table in the lower-room, and missed it the next day when my husband asked for it; I have never seen it since; I went to the prisoner, and told him my child had seen him take it - he said it was no such thing - I asked where he had changed a 10l. note - he said he would tell me - he went into the parlour, then came out, and said he would not tell me; he was taken in charge, and no sovereigns found on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not you occupy the shop before the prisoner? A. Yes; I had not the pocket-book in my hand after Ellis left; the Magistrate discharged the prisoner on his own recognizance.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How often have you and your mother talked about this? A. Not many times; she said she would not have beaten me if I had told her; he went out directly -

             was not in the room - my mother did not tell me what to say to-day - she paid Mr. Ellis some money; the prisoner was in the shop; I saw my mother put some gold and silver into the pocket-book - I saw her put six sovereigns into it; and there were nine on the counter; my father took it up and gave it to my mother.</p>
               <p>JOHN SAVAGE. The prisoner had taken this shop, and paid me three sovereigns, and then was to pay seven, but he only gave me 6l. 13s., and said he should keep the rest for good-luck; this was about noon on the 9th of November - next morning I wanted the money - I said to my wife, "Have you got your money all right?" and the child said, "Oh, mother! Mr. Anderson took it" - she took the child to him, and after this I went to him with the child - he said it was all false, and he said he had changed a 10l. note the night before, as he had no silver; he had asked me to lend him 6d. - I found he had changed a note at a grocer's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. I have driven a cabriolet, but do nothing since I lost my money - I let this shop in order to get two horses to drive the cabriolet.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I engaged to give 10l. for this shop; when I went there, I met Mr. Ellis coming out at the door - my wife said, "This is the landlord; Mr. Savage has been paying some rent, and you must pay him 4s. 6d. on Monday" - I talked with him, but we did not go in, and I never saw the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH PARRY. I am out of place, and live with the prisoner - when Mrs. Savage was paying Ellis some rent, the prisoner came in and met Ellis at the door; after they were both gone, I saw a very dark-coloured pocket-book - I saw the book in her hand, while Ellis was writing a receipt.</p>
               <p>- ELLIS. I am the landlord - Savage paid me the rent - I met the prisoner at the door as I went out; we just stopped and talked about some repairs at a coal-shed; I went home - I think Anderson went just before me; I had settled with Savage before the prisoner came; I did not notice the little girl there; I saw no pocket-book.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you not as drunk as you could be? A.

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. In June, 1825, I received this money from him. I then lodged in the prisoner's house, No. 22, Bury-street - he knew I had this money, as I paid him some - the rest was in a paper; he came up to my bed-room door on the 24th of June, (I think) - I was not up, and asked who was there? he said, "It is me;" I put on my gown, went into the front room, and he said, "I have come up relative to this money, for I advise you not to keep it in the house, where there are so many lodgers, and so many persons coming;" I said, "I intend to take it to Coutts' bank;" he said, "I am going past there (to the Adelphi) in the course of the morning, and will leave it, it is not safe here;" I said,"Who is to find the money - how are they to know it is here?" he pointed to the window, and said, "How easily might a man get in there, and if any thing was to happen to the money I should cut my throat, for my regard to Mr. Devenish;" I said, "How are they to find it?" he said they would have it if they tore the carpet up; I had put it on the top of the bed, and in several places - I believe I then took it out of the chimney; he said he would take it to Coutts', and would put it there, in Mr. Devenish's name or mine, which I liked; I said I would take it myself; he said there was nothing to do but to take it there and bring me a book, and leave it in what name I thought proper; I objected to it for, I suppose, a quarter of an hour; he said he was going to a jeweller for some watches for his brother, and would leave it, and bring me the book before I was up; I at last gave him a 200l., a 100l. and a 50l. Bank note; I had 27l. in gold, which I kept back; he said, "You had better send the whole;" I said I would not - he took the notes, and came back at three o'clock to dinner - I did not see him then, but I sent down in the evening for the book - he sent up word that they would not take less than 500l. there, and he would keep it till next day, and take it into the City; I asked him about six o'clock for it - he said it was in his brother's iron chest, and he would keep it there till next day, when he would go and get me more for it in the City, by putting it into the Stocks or Bank; I told the woman with whom he lived, that evening, that upon consideration I would not have it put into the Bank next day, which was Saturday, I went into the kitchen to him, at three o'clock, and asked him for the money, as I would not have any thing done with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070083"/>it; he said he had left it at his brother's, and would go and fetch it; I said, "Mr. Devenish is now up stairs, and I wish to have it immediately, as he does not know it is out of my hands;" he said he would go and get it immediately - he went out, and I did not see him again till last Thursday week, when he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What do you mean by living with the prisoner? A. I lodge there - I gave him the money in the front room; there was a gentleman in my bed at that time - I do not know his name, on my oath - I never described him as a dry-salter in the City; my husband was with me the next day - I did not tell him what I meant to do with the money; I never said I wished to put it out of my husband's way because he wasted it; or that he was a worthless and careless fellow; I told the prisoner to put it in my name, Mrs. Devenish; I have at times gone by my maiden name; I never authorized him to take it into the City; I did not go to his brother's; I indicted his brother for receiving the 50l. note this Sessions; nobody advised me to prosecute - I always intended to do it when I found the prisoner; I saw him last Thursday week in a public-house at the corner of Bury-street. I believe my husband has had 100l. back; Sarah Heale acted as landlady in the prisoner's house - I paid her the rent occasionally; I told her on Sunday morning, I did not know how to tell my husband about the money, for he would murder me; she and I went to his brother's house at two o'clock that morning - I saw my husband's receipt for the 100l.; I said I had ruined my husband, because he had sold his commission to get me out of my situation, and I would punish the prisoner whenever I found him; I went to Bow-street, and took every pains to trace him; Mr. Devenish also went to Norwich about him; I was never married but once - I have heard he had a wife living when he married me, but I am not positive of it.</p>

            . I am an ostler at a livery stables, and have been there 25 or 26 years. I have known the prisoner 12 or 14 years, he keeps a house close to Mr. Bevan's stables. In June, 1825, the servant of the prosecutor came for me; I found Mr. and Mrs. Devenish there - they asked if I knew where Mr. Tupman was - I said,"No; I saw him last night, and parted with him at the corner;" I did not know what they wanted - they sent for me again in half an hour; I saw them both on the stairs - it was on a Sunday; they said they had had a great loss; I asked, what - Mrs. Devenish said she had put 350l. into Tupman's hands to take to the banker's, and they were afraid he had absconded; I said, I thought he would return in a short time; she mentioned Coutt's name to me, but nobody else; Mr. Devenish then came and asked if I had any relations at Norwich; I said, "Only an acquaintance or two;" he asked their names - I said, I did not know - he said he would find them - that he supposed he should not get half his money back. In September last, I sent for Mr. Devenish, and told him there was a great chance of his getting 100l. back; I had not seen Tupman till last September, at a house in Russell-street; I did not say I had seen him; he said he would give a receipt for the whole if he could get 100l. back; he said he would prepare a receipt, and brought a draft of it, and left it with me; we met the same day to settle it - Mrs. Devenish knew what was going on - she did not see the prisoner, but she came to me with her husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know while all this was going on, that they charged him with a robbery? A. Yes; Mrs. Devenish objected to a receipt for the full amount - but Mr. Devenish proposed this form - as soon as this was done, the prisoner appeared in his business as usual.</p>
               <p>Mr. McDOWELL. Q. He was very much in your society? A. Yes. - I knew he was charged with a robbery; I saw him in September, and asked what he had left; he seid, 100l. - he had spent the rest; he kept out of the way till I got the receipt; I recommended Mr. Devenish to take the 100l., rather than lose all.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Did you know that he had stolen it? A. Mrs. Devenish said she had given it him - I should not have interfered if I had known he had stolen it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. She gave him the money? A. Yes, to put in the banker's.</p>

            . I lived servant to the prisoner at this house. Mrs. Devenish told me on the Thursday to send Tupman up-stairs; he went up, when they were all at supper; and she told me to send him up to her; and in the morning she said, in my presence, more than once,"Be sure, Bill, you come up to me in the morning before you go out.</p>
               <p>Mr. McDOWELL. Q. Did Tupman return at his usual hour on Saturday? A. No. He went away - I never saw him after - when he came home on Friday, I asked him what she wanted; he said she had given him 350l. to put into Coutt's bank. The truth is, I was living with him.</p>

            . I have lived with Mr. Harvey two years. I do not sleep there, but serve in his shop; I have known the prisoner about three months; this pot is my master's - the prisoner asked me for it, and I gave it to him, and a great many other things; he often asked me before I gave him any thing; these are things master dealt in; I used to give them to him at master's gate, close to the shop - he asked me a long while before I gave him any thing; I never got a farthing for them - he had the butter and cheese on Monday; he paid me nothing for them; he once gave me some grapes, but nothing else; after I had given him a few things, I was frightened. This began about three months ago - he used to talk to me, and then ask me for things; I had no part of the produce; I have dined with him sometimes on a Sunday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you come to me, and ask if I would have some tobacco and several other things? A. No; I gave him the pot at the hedge, and the butter at the gate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He brought them to me; I did not steal them; he gave them to me sometimes at the gate - I asked if there was any danger - he said No, he had paid for them.</p>

On Saturday, the 4th of November, I opened the cupboard, at the bottom of the stairs, in company with Foster and one of the messengers - we found this salt ledger of 1821, but it was not cut in the manner books are when they are sold - there were some tea books in a drawer, and some brown paper for lighting fires; some of the papers were strewed about the rooms, and some locked up.</p>

            . I am a glass-cutter. I saw the prisoner in Jacobs' shop, wiping some glasses - I saw him walk from place to place, and saw him take six tumblers(three in a nest stuck together with hay) from a locker near the floor - Jacobs was then in the parlour; he came into the shop in five minutes, and the prisoner asked the price of some other glasses which he had picked out - Jacobs went into the parlour again, and the prisoner walked to the back of the counter, and fetched a goblet - Jacobs saw him, and asked what he did there; he said he was looking out another goblet, and asked the price of some on the counter - he then asked the weight of two, which was told him; he said he could not believe it, and went and weighed them; at this time I saw him take something out of a nest, and put into his pocket - he walked up, weighed the tumbler, and said it was very good - he took a wine-glass, and put it into his pocket; I heard it knock against the others in his pocket - Jacobs returned into the shop; the prisoner had two weights in his hand; he put them down, and packed up some ale-glasses and goblets which he had looked out on the counter - he was going out, and I said he had something in his pocket; Jacobs called him back and said, "Let me look at those things you have got;" he said, "What things? I have none but what you know of;" Jacobs then said to me, "What was it my son spoke about?" I said, "A gross of wines" - the prisoner had then got into the shop - Jacobs seized him, and found this glass on him; he begged him, for Heaven's sake, to let him go; when the officer came, Jacobs loosened his hold, and he ran out into the Tenter-ground - I pursued, and saw him taken.</p>
