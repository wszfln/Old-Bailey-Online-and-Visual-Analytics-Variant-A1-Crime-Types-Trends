When you return the acceptance, have the kindness to say through what bank you would wish the money to be paid, and it shall be remitted to you by the next post, less three months interest, at the rate of eight per cent. per annum. Trusting it may be of some service to you, I am, Sir, &amp;c., John Bull. P. S. You must furnish me with the address of the party who indorses the bill, and the same must be made payable in London")—I received in that letter a bill, wrote my name under<lb/>neath the drawer's, which is the way they do in Scotland, and got my bro<lb/>ther, Andrew Alexander, to write his name across it on the face of it, as an indorsement—we both understood it was a legal bill, and that it would go perfectly safe—I enclosed it in a letter addressed to the prisoner, and posted it—on the 21st of May I received this letter from the prisoner, in which there was another bill for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., drawn by him—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"May 21st, 1847.

               <p>for a legal security; if you will refer to my letter, you will perceive I wished it made payable at London. You must excuse my being particular, but in matters of this kind I am obliged to be. I have enclosed you another draft, with a form in, which must be accepted and endorsed, on the receipt of which I will remit the amount through Messrs. Jones, Lloyd, and Co., to the Commercial Bank of Scotland, to be placed to your account. I shall not be at all particular about the whole being repaid in twelve months, so long as the interest is regularly paid. I shall be very glad to make your acquaint<lb/>ance when you come to London; meanwhile believe me, dear Sir, yours very truly, John Bull. As the other acceptance is not available, I shall get it exchanged for a fresh stamp at the stamp-office")—In consequence of that letter, I accepted the second bill, according to the way described in the letter, had it endorsed, and sent it, directed to Mr. John Bull, as before—I never received any answer—the instrument I sent was to be substituted for the other bill—I did not provide the stamp for it—it struck me that he was a downright straight-forward man, and I did not know the difference between the English and Scotch law—he said he would either destroy it or get 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the stamp—I thought he detained the first bill in order to get the stamp allowed—it was not my 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he paid for the stamp—I do not know whether I was to pay for it.</p>

                  </hi> I am a hawker, and a bricklayer and plasterer, and live at Uxbridge.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184709200018"/>
               <p>then, but she was there very soon afterwards—she told me she should come to bed too—I had told her before that I did not want her there—I had seen her whispering to a man that she called cousin—she laid on the bed—she had taken off part of her things—I put the candle out—I went to bed be<lb/>tween ten and eleven o'clock—I went to sleep, and awoke about three in the morning—I then missed my clothes from under my head—the prisoner was gone, and the window open—it is twelve feet or more from the ground—a shaw! was torn in half, and one of her aprons was torn, and fastened round a wooden spout on the top of the window—I had seen that apron on the pri<lb/>soner—I rang for the landlord, and found my clothes under the bed—I could not find the piece of Holland that the sovereigns were in—we got a police-man, went after the prisoner, and found her very much intoxicated in a gin<lb/>shop at Paddington—she had some silver in her hand, and was waving it about, and said she did not care—she saw me, and went to another door—the officer brought her out—she declared she never saw me before—she called me William, and she said, "Feel in your waistcoat pocket, and you will find a penny <hi rend="italic">bit</hi> and a half-sovereign; I took it from the servants; you will find it there"—we took her to Uxbridge—she said she was very sorry she robbed me, that she would not bring anybody else into it; and if she was allowed to go with me, she would show me the man she gave it to, to take care of—a sovereign was found on her—she cried very much, and said she hoped I would forgive her, and if she had known I meant to take a policeman after her she would have taken every penny I had, and I should not have had a thing to put on my back—I did not know her before.</p>

                  </hi> On the 4th of Aug.

                  </hi> I live at No. 151, Bishopsgate-street, and am a cheese-monger—the prisoner was in my service. On Tuesday, the 24th of Aug., I cleared out the tills, and emptied four tills into the one with a look—I disco<lb/>vered two shillings between the till and the bowl—I expected they were put there for some improper purpose, and I marked them before my wife, and put them there again—I have seen them since in the policeman's hands.</p>

On Thursday morning, about ten minutes before seven o'clock, I went down stairs from my bed-room—I went with the prisoner into the shop, and then down stairs to fetch up some cheeses—he fetched the first two, then I fetched two, he fetched the third two—I swept up the shop—I then went down into the cellar, and there was a tub, and I saw some saw-dust on the board the money was on—I hit my head against it, and that made a jink—I drew out the board, and there were these three shillings.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of Ebenezer Webber. I occupy two rooms at No. 1, Gloucester-street, Haggerstone. On the 25th of Aug. I went out to an evening party—I left home at half-past nine o'clock—I returned at a quarter before one o'clock—I found my apartments had been broken into, and the prisoner was at the station-house—the articles now produced were gone—they had been safe when I left home—these bracelets were in a box, and all the other thing in the room—the parties had got in by the back window, which had been fastened, when I came home it was wide open—it had been opened by putting a hand through a pane, (which I had accidentally broken myself,) and opening the catch—this is all my pro<lb/>perty.</p>

                  </hi> I am the son of Lewis Condun, and live in Alfred-place, Holland-lane, Kensington. On the 17th of Aug., I was going up the lane, I saw the prisoner Nagle standing at the parlour window of my father's house—he went to the door—Prenderville came out of the parlour door, joined Nagle, and they went up the lane together—I went and told my father, and missed from the house an inkstand, three silver tea-spoons, a little ivory wheelbarrow, and a brooch, which I have since seen in the hands of Clark—they had been safe at seven o'clock that morning—the door of the house was left open, as it was a warm day.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 484.) On Tuesday, the 14th of Sept., between seven and eight in the evening, I went with Thain and Russell to Bishopsgate-street Within—I saw the prisoners Madden and Griffith come out of the warehouse of the Mr. Silver of No. 4 1/2, Bishopagate-street—they went to the Marlboro' Head public-house—Griffith had a small paper parcel, partly concealed under his coat—he went to the public-house—in about ten minutes Colmer joined them, and about eight o'clock Jacobs joined them, and they all four sat in a box together—they were talking and drinking together—they all four came out together—Jacobs went towards Shoreditch church, Russell followed him, and I followed the other three as far as Farringdon-street—they were walking and talking together—Colmer there left the other two—we followed Griffith and Madden down Fleet-street to the Strand—they turned down Clement's-inn to New Inn-passage, which is rather dark—they stopped there, and I saw Madden take something from his coat-pocket, and give to Griffith, who kneeled down and untied a blue bundle which he had been carrying from the public-house—I passed by him, and saw a brown paper parcel in the blue handkerchief, and as I passed I distinctly saw a piece of cloth lying on the brown paper parcel—the parcel was then tied up in the handkerchief—they then separated—Griffith went with the bindle to Mr. Spencer's, in Stanhope-street, Clare-market, and Madden went to a small street opposite Spencer's shop—I looked through Spencer's window, and saw Griffith untying the parcel—I went into the shop, took possession of it, and now produce it—I asked Griffith where he had brought the cloth from—he made no answer—I</p>

               <p>about half-past two in the morning; he was then in fits—they were quiet fits, but every limb was in action, his eyes were wide open, his hands and mouth were at work—his hands were opening and shutting—I sent for medical assistance, and he was put into a warm-bath—he continued in that state till he died, at seven in the morning.</p>

                  </hi> I am a medical man. On the 19th of Aug., between five and six o'clock in the morning, I was called to examine the deceased—I found him in convulsions, and in a very collapsed condition—my assistant had seen him before, and reported that it was a case of urgency—he had done every thing which I should have done myself—I found deceased lying on the bed insensible—the pupils of his eyes were dilated—he moved his hands about like a person in convulsions—his pulse was hardly perceptible—those were indications of an affection of the brain—I had occasion to see another patient not far off—I told the mother to make application to the child—when I came back he was dead—I had considered him hopeless—I made a <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> examination, and from the appearances, death was caused by conges<lb/>tion of the brain—I did not find any bruises on the body, it was in a healthy state—the brain was as it usually is in congestion—the white parts had a great many <hi rend="italic">points</hi> of blood, proving that is was loaded with blood—I have heard the evidence, and from that, and from my examination, my opinion is, that the general excitement of the day previous brought on the convulsions, but it is difficult to give a positive opinion.</p>

Bank of England note—the name of Simmonds on the front I should say was the prisoner's writing—I believe he has been sent to Jones Loyd's, with money—my father usually sends to the bank—I do not know in whose writing this order for a check-book is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> These boxes, you say, were kept locked up in a room up stairs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I do not think the door was always locked—the boxes in which the deeds were kept were not locked—anybody going to the house<lb/>keeper and asking for the key would not be a circumstance that would excite notice—I cannot say that we very frequently have occasion to send up—when we have occasion to send up, the clerks go occasionally—we sometimes go ourselves, and sometimes one clerk, sometimes another—there are two clerks in our office, and either of them would go—I cannot speak to Mr. Peel's writing—I am not aware that I ever saw him write—I do not think this order for the check-book is the prisoner's writing—I do not know any person whose handwriting it resembles—there is some similarity between the name of Simmonds on the bank note and the writing on the check—I can swear to the writing on the note being the prisoner's writing to the best of my belief—I have been in the firm since April, 1846—the prisoner left in March, 1847—he was in the service of myself and father during the whole time he was in the office.</p>

               <p>the housekeeper—I do not know that just before the prisoner left, he was in the habit of going up to that room—the cause of his leaving had no reference to anything done in that room—the writing on the note is "Henry Simmonds, 13, Belvidere-street, Lambeth"—I believe the whole of that is the handwriting of the prisoner—I believe the filling up of this check to be similar to the prisoner's—I should be inclined to believe it is his writing—I cannot swear positively to it—I believe it is the prisoner's.</p>

                  </hi> I am clerk to Messrs. Patteson, and have been so about twelve years. I was there when the prisoner was there—I had opportunities of seeing his writing nearly every business day—I know the upper room where the deeds were kept—the prisoner would have access if be pleased to that room—I do not know of his going there on any occasion—I am not able to say whether or not he ever did go there—there would be several drafts in the lower room where he would have to work, but whether Mr. Peel's signature would be attached to them I cannot say—some of them would probably be in the handwriting of Mr. Peel—I do not recollect any assignments of bankruptcy—I believe the figures on this check(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) to be in the prisoner's writing—I cannot say as to the signature, but the figures and date are precisely like his writing—I should say unquestionably that this "Henry Simmonds, 13, Belvidere-road, Lambeth," on the Bank of England note is his writing—if it is not his, I never saw a better imitation—this order, I should say, was not his.</p>

               <p>cannot be certain—I have no doubt as to my belief of the writing—the writing in the body of the check is similar to his—that on the bank note is precisely as he writes quick—I have seen so much of his writing—I have seen him write quick and slow—I do not think there is a great difference between the writing on the note and that on the check—the writing on the check is not an easy hand—I do not think it is an easy flowing writing—the "Henry Thompson" is more easy, in my opinion, than the "£89"—I cannot say a word about the signature at the bottom—I do not think it is very free—it seems to be stiff.</p>

I also act in the evening as check-taker at the Pavilion theatre—I know Hayward, and I know Alexander by sight—I remember seeing Hayward on the 21st of June last, at the Mulberry Tree, Stepney-green—there was a publican's ball there, and therefore I know it was on that day—I was there after being at the Pavilion Theatre—I saw Hayward in the ball-room—I was there as one of the company, and he also—we left the ball about half-past twelve o'clock—he wished me to sleep with him that night, and I slept at the coffee-shop—he said he had got a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, three sovereigns, and some silver about him, and he had a gold watch and chain—he said he had given eighteen guineas for the watch—I had known him before, by coming backwards and forwards to the Pavilion—I did not see the note, I saw the purse—he had the note inside the purse—there was one note, I could not tell whether it was a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note or not—I saw no appearance o a note, but he told me had it—the next morning I went home and got my breakfast, came back, and went with him to Rotherhithe—I dined with him there—he paid for the dinner—he put his purse on the table, and said he had got a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note there and some sovereigns—some time after that, I think on a Saturday morning, about the middle of July. about the 17th, I saw him again, at the corner of the New-road, White chapel—he wished me to go with him to the other end of</p>

Hayward was standing a short dis<lb/>tance off, and Alexander was there—they passed it off in a sort of joke, they did not say much—I said it to Alexander and the two young men who were with him, they were coopers—I said, "Have you seen Forrester looking about?"—I had not really seen him—I merely asked them that—upon that, Alexander gave the two <hi rend="italic">gents.</hi> a <hi rend="italic">bit</hi> of a <hi rend="italic">nudge</hi> and a laugh, as much as to say, "Do you say a word," and it was all peace and quiet<lb/>ness in consequence—I went away, and left them standing there—I saw Hayward again the same night—he said, "Have you seen Forrester looking about?"—I said, "No, I have not"—he said, "You must have seen him, or you would not have said anything about such a thing," or something like that—he told me he had got into a <hi rend="italic">mess</hi>, and he did not know which way to get out of it—he said, "If the question is put to you whether you have seen me with a gold watch or a large sum of money, be sure and say no; say you never saw me with more than a few shillings"—he did not mentioned anybody that was likely to put that question—I said, "Well, perhaps you will have no objection to tell me what this <hi rend="italic">mess</hi> is"—he said, "No, I would rather you would ask me for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Alexander came up at the time, and Hayward told him he would speak to him in a moment—the last words he said, "Be sure you do not say a word, or I shall be lost for ever"—Alexander could</p>

                  </hi> I am in the service of Mr. John Hackman Brown, a linen draper, in High-street, Aldgate. On the 25th of Aug., about half-past eleven o'clock, I was in the cellar, and saw the prisoner and two other women come over the grating—they pulled a piece of cotton about which was on a chair, and the prisoner drew it under her shawl—I ran up and took her—she dropped the cotton—this now produced is it—I gave the prisoner to a police-man—I had not lost sight of her.</p>

On the morning of the 24th of Aug., at a quarter before six o'clock, I went into a public-house, at the corner of Compton-street, with some friends—the two prisoners came in with two other women and a man—I had a watch in my pocket, and a man named Nolan, who was in his company with M'Carthy, amused himself with my watch-chain—he addressed me by name—I said, "I have no knowledge of you"—he said, "You know my father, I am the son of Mr. Nolan"—I said, "I know Mr. Nolan, I have not a knowledge of you"—Nolan was on my right sight, M'Carthy on my left, and Doherty was at some distance—I had some conversation with Nolan—a person there asked me if I were aware who I was in company with—I said</p>

               <p>"No"—he said he was a convicted felon—M'Carthy knocked my friend down for saying that—I went to lift him up, and while lifting him up, my watch was stolen—M'Carthy left the house directly—he was taken in about thirty hours afterwards—he was remanded twice, and then discharged—he came to my house afterwards, and said if I was satisfied to pay what was lent on the watch, he would give me every information where it was—he appointed ten o'clock the next morning to meet me, and go along with me to Petticaot-lane, where he described it to be at a Jew's place—the next morning I sent to Bow-street for a policeman to come and watch—M'Carthy was punctual to his time, he came at ten o'clock—he said, "Are you ready now?"—I said, "Yes"—he said had I any objection to the female, Doherty, going with him—he called her <hi rend="italic">Moll</hi>, or something, I do not know what—I asked him what he wished Doherty to go with me for—he said, "I will let you know now what you were not before aware of; she has admitted to me this morning that she received the watch from Nolan; that she went with another woman to Petticoat-lane, and there deposited it with a Jew for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said I had no objection whatever to her coming, on the contrary, I was rather pleased that she would come—I knew she was the woman who had been with him at the public-house—he went out, and came in in about ten minutes with Doherty—he said, "This is Doherty"—I said,: Indeed; you know all about this watch?"—she said, "Yes, sir; I am very sorry it occurred; have you any objection to come with me to Petticoat-lane? if you have not, M'Carthy and I will go along with you"—we went, and at every watch-maker's shop she came to, she endeavored to point out a watch that was similar to mine—I was walking between Doherty and M'Carty, and the policeman was behind us—in going along Doherty admitted that she had been with Nolan; that he conveyed that watch to her, and she and another woman conveyed it to Petticoat-lane, and there left it in the hands of a Jew for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she said they did not sell it, but left it there till they ascertained whether I would drop it or not—that it was worth 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and they said they would pay the Jew 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. with interest, and get the watch—we went to a public-house opposite Petticoat-lane, and Doherty said, "I will go and let the Jew know; have you got the money?"—I said, "Yes"—she went away and returned in about half an hour—she said, "The Jew has not got the watch on his own premises; he will have it in half an hour"—she then said that house was too light, and we went to another house, and staid there half an hour—M'Carthy then said the half hour was gone, and he would go and speak to the Jew—he said he would probably sooner come for M'Carthy than he would for Doherty—he went out, and he returned and said, "I saw the watch, what a pity it is that the ring is broken"—I said, it did not matter—he said, "The Jew hesitates in coming up; I may succeed in bringing him up; but if he comes you must not notice him"—I said, "I will not; if he comes I will take no notice of him"—Doherty then said, "You had better let us have the whole amount, and we will go down to the Jew and get the watch and bring it up"—I said, "No, I will not; I will leave it with the landlord"—Doherty then said, "You had better let us have a sove<lb/>reign"—I produced a sovereign and put it on the table—Doherty said, "We had better both be off"—M'Carthy said, "I will take the sovereign and go"—Doherty said, "No; I will go with you, and show you the Jew and his house and place"—I went out with Doherty, leaving M'Carthy and the sove<lb/>reign—Doherty went some distance, and she shoed me a respectable look<lb/>ing man sitting on a tailor's shop-board—she said, "That is the man, and</p>

                  </hi> I am a clerk to the Eastern Counties Railway Company—the prisoner was in the Company's service from about Feb. last until June—during that time I had the means of seeing his handwriting from time to time, and became acquainted with it—I believe this order to be his writing; also this check, and the endorsement to the bank-note—I be<lb/>lieve his salary was about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, but I do not know exactly—I never heard it from himself.</p>

                  </hi> I am a carpenter, and live in Orchard-place, Mary<lb/>lebone. I had a lodger named Garey, and one named Crimming—on the 1st of Aug., a complaint was made to me that Crimming and several others were coming to my place to kick up a row and knock my place and me about—I acquainted the constables, and they refused to come in—about half-past seven o'clock in the morning I met the prisoner on the stairs—I had never seen him before—he was with Crimming—he had a poker in his hand and hit me with it—he went into Crimming's room, I tried to get in after him, but could not—he broke the panel of the door with the poker—he then wanted to get out of the window, the back way—I went round outside the window—he saw me, turned back again, and came out of the door—he had the poker with him still—I tried to lay hold of him, and he lifted up the poker, hit me with it, and cut my forehead open—it bled very much—I was senseless after the first blow, and did not see him make any farther attempt—I fell back against some persons behind me—the prisoner attempted to hit me again with the poker, but was prevented by the constable, who defended the blow off with his staff—he was taken into custody—I did not have a doctor that night, as it was rather late—a man dressed the wound—it bled till six o'clock next morning—I was in the doctor's hands better than a fortnight.</p>

                  </hi> I live Inverness-shire—I am a stranger in London. On Friday night, the 10th of Sept., about half-past eleven o'clock, I was in Drury-lane—I went into the White Lion public-house—I remained below a few minutes, and took something to drink—I heard some singing up stairs—I asked the man if it was a public room—he said it was—I went up, and asked what was to pay—the prisoner Dyke, who was the chairman of the meeting, said, "A shilling"—I paid him the shilling—he invited me to take a seat on his left hand—I sat a little while, not many minutes—there seemed to be a little disorder amongst some of the company—I wished to go away—I called for some drink, and paid for it—I think it was two glasses of rum-and-water—I did not drink any myself up stairs, I had down stairs—I was quite sober—I retired after I had paid for what I ordered—Dyke said he wished to speak to me particularly at the bar of the house—Brennan got up with him—I was going down, the two prisoners followed me, and Dyke pushed me against the balustrade, or the wall of the stairs, put his hand into my right waistcoat-pocket, and took my watch out, and Brennan took my purse from my right-hand trowsers-pocket, and my handkerchief from my coat-pocket—I took the purse from her with great violence, and she returned to the room—my watch was fastened to the chain—I cannot say how Dyke took it—most likely he unscrewed the swivel—the watch was gone, and the chain remained—I called out I was robbed, and ordered the landlord of the house to shut the door, which he did very reluctantly I thought, and I noticed three or four persons went out—I cannot tell whether Dyke was one—I am not sure how much was in the purse, but when it was counted in the office at Bow-street there were five half-crowns, fifteen shillings, and eight sixpences—Brennan had got it almost out of my pocket when I took it from her—I went up stairs afterwards, and found her—I said I was robbed—she threw my hand-kerchief to me, and said, "There is your handkerchief, and be d—d"—police-man No. 47 came—I gave her in charge—Dyke was then gone, but I saw him afterwards—I am quite sure he is the man.</p>

                  </hi> I am a sailor, and live in Meetinghouse-alley. On the 15th of Sept. I went to the Cock and Neptune public-house—the prisoner was there—she said, "Halloa!"—I turned round—she took the handkerchief out of my pocket, and put both her hands behind her with the handkerchief in them—she had a shawl on—I asked her several times for the handkerchief—she gave me her own—I took it, and walked out—when I got to the light I found it was not mine—it was torn very nearly in two, and bad two holes in it—I went and found the prisoner in the tap-room—I fetched a policeman—I had never seen her before—the handkerchief I got from the prisoner is rather lighter than mine—they were both red.</p>

On the 24th of Aug., about half-past nine o'clock at night, I was at the corner of Charles-street, Hampstead-road—there was a crowd—the Ethic<lb/>pians were singing—I was holding up a little girl over the people's heads, and I heard a scuffle behind me; turned round, and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand—it had been in my pocket—I said, "That is mine"—he flung it down—it was taken up by a policeman—this produced is it—it is mine.</p>

                  </hi> I am a widow, and live at No. 7, Church-buildings, Bream's buildings, Chancery-lane—I occupy the whole house—I know the prisoner and his wife. On Monday night, the 12th of Sept., his wife slept with my daughter—on Tuesday morning, near twelve o'clock, the prisoner rushed into my room—no one was there but his wife and myself—he said nothing, but flew to his wife, and was wrestling with her, apparently with his feet—I hallooed out, "Don't do that, Lund; don't use her so;" and, as near as I re<lb/>member, no more was done till I received a blow with a chair on my arm—I was then standing at the prisoner's right hand, his wife was further to the left—he could not have struck me in striking at her—she tried to make her escape, and got behind him, as the street-door was shut—it had been standing open—I received two more blows at the same time—I called "Murder!" and within a half a minute the court had plenty in it from every door—I was calling out that he had broken my arm—my arm was broken—I also received a blow on my right eye with his fist—it was all discoloured—he held the chair by the back with both hands, and the feet came down on my arm—his wife was not near me when he struck me with his fist in the face—the blow could not have been intended for her.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of Wm. Maslin, a lady's shoemaker, in Church-building. On Tuesday morning, the 13th of Sept., I was sitting at work in my mother-in-law's room, at No. 7, and heard screams and cries of murder—I ran down stairs, and saw Mrs. Reed's front room door wide open, and Mrs. Reed standing in the middle of the room, with the prisoner in front of her, and his wife behind Mrs. Reed—the prisoner had his fist clenched to<lb/>wards Mrs. Reed, who was crying for mercy—I did not see the blow struck—Mrs. Reed was holding her arm, and crying "Oh dear, my arm is broken!—her hand was bleeding very much—his wife was standing behind him with her hand up, and while I was looking at Mrs. Reed his wife went out about two yards from him with her hand before her face—he pursued her and took hold of her by the throat—she looked up and said, "Don't hurt me"—he said, "Go home"—she said, "I will if you will let me get my bonnet and shawl"—he would not wait, but drove her on in front of him about four or five yards till they came to two steps which go up into another yard, and as she was getting up those steps he kicked her—there are two folding doors there, and as she was folding them that he should not follow her, she escaped—I did not see her again, till she was in the hospital—I followed him and gave him into custody.</p>

               <p>a cut on her little finger, which was bleeding profusely; her arm was broker at the lower third, above the wrist; she had some bruises on the right side of her face, and her left arm was also bruised—the bruises on the left arm might have been done with the hand—the right arm was swollen from the violence of the blow—I should say a chair used with force would be likely to have done it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had you lodged in the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Six weeks—Shea is a shoemaker—his wife does nothing for her living—they have five children—Dible is a drover—that is his right name—I do not know that his name is Thomas Attwell, and that he had deserted his wife, and goes by the name of Dible to prevent his being found out—I know his wife very well—her maiden name was Boyce, but Dible is her marriage name—I go by the name of Ryder—I took the room in that name—Dible went by his own name—he did not go by the name of Francis—I cannot say whether the prisoners knew I was not married to Dible—they never asked me—we passed as Mr. and Mrs. Ryder—they did not complain that we quarrelled and got intoxicated, and give us notice—I told the female prisoner that morning when she told me she would give me a mark that I should carry to my grave, that I should go away—they had not given me warning to quit before that—I cannot say in which hand Mary Shea had the chopper—I cannot say what became of the candle—she did not blow it out—I have never said so—it was not after I got up into my own room that I fainted—it was at the foot of the stairs when I received the blow—my forehead was cut by the blow—Dible lifted me up, and carried me into my own room—I do not know whether Mary Shea blew the candle out before she struck me—I have never said that she did so, that I swear—we were in the dark; when she came out of the back room with a lighted candle in one hand, and the chopper in the other—I suppose she blew the candle out when I received the blow—I did not see her blow it out—I have lived with Dible three years—he has left his wife about five years—I did not break open the door of the prisoner's room that evening—Bartholomew Shea did not fetch a policeman to the house—the policeman came past the door, and I was taken to the station—he did not, before this happened, make a complaint against me for breaking open his door, she abused me like a pickpocket when I wanted to go up to my room, and said I should not come in, and stood with her hands on her hips and wanted to fight me, right or wrong—I brought my mother to the house, and she was coming up stairs with me—we did not use threatening language towards the prisoners—Shea did not on that occasion go for a policeman, and when he came back find I had burst open his room door—I did not run away when the policeman was coming—I told him to take me—he did take me—I said I would go, for I had done nothing to be taken for—I was taken to the station—Shea made a complaint against me, and he was told to get a warrant against me, at Worship-street, the next morning—the inspector discharged me—Shea did not charge me with burst<lb/>ing open his door, or anything of the kind—he said he had no charge, for he</p>

                  </hi> I am a drover, and live at No. 18, Price's-street, White<lb/>chapel. On Monday, the 16th of Aug., about ten o'clock at night, I was coming home—I had had two pints of beer—I was going through the pas<lb/>sage, and found Ellen Ryder having a few words with Mrs. Shea, concerning water—the prisoners were both standing at the door—as we were going up stairs, I said to Ryder, "Come up stairs, don't talk to the <hi rend="italic">rubbish</hi>; I don't mind what they say," when she received a blow—I did not see it struck, for I was going up stairs at the time—she immediately fell down on the stairs, and the male prisoner struck me on the head with some sharp instrument, I do not know what—I did not see any instrument—here is the mark—I became insensible from the blow—I believe they put the light out—as soon as I recovered myself, I conveyed Ryder up stairs the best way I could, and placed her on a chair—I then came down to fetch a policeman—I found out outside the door, and gave the prisoners into custody—I was taken to the hospital, and had my head dressed.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon, at the London Hospital.

                  </hi> I was at home on the Monday night, between nine and ten o'clock—I was in the front room, where my father and mother lived—Charles Poole lived in the back room—Dible was out, about his business—Ryder was up in her own room all day—about five o'clock in the evening her mother was passing, and she went and dragged her mother by great force to the door, and asked my mother what she had got to say to her mother—she said she had nothing at all to say to a woman she did not know—her mother answered, "No, my dear, I know you have nothing to say to me, for my daughter is a bad woman, my dear; you go in and shut the door, and don't talk to her"—my mother came in and locked the door—Ryder put her back to it, and burst it in, and broke the lock—this was at five o'clock—my father went to the door—Ryder hit him a slap in the face, he never resented it—he went into Whitechapel-road, got a policeman, and he, my father and mother, and Mrs. Ryder went to the station—she afterwards came back from the station—Dible came home about seven o'clock—(my father was out of the way then—my mother and the children were in the front room)—she said to him, "Oh, John, I was locked up for about five minutes, but they could not keep me any longer"—and then he brought one of his fellow drovers to assault my father—they went out into the passage—Mrs. Ryder said, "John don't go to out there, for it is dark"—"Never mind," said the other man, "I know the b----y <hi rend="italic">dodge</hi>," and they went up stairs—my father was then at his landlord's—they came down again, and hurrahed and danced up stairs; we thought they would have the house down upon us—they said to my mother, "We are not frightened, we have got plenty of knives"—they then called to one another to come out and have a drop of gin—they went to a police-house, and my mother was frightened that they would follow my father, and do something to him—they went in the direction where he was—my mother put on her bonnet and shawl, and went to look for my father, and the men went hurrahing and crying out for my father in the street and saying, if they had him, what they would not do to him—when they came back again they seemed as if they had been drinking—my father and mother came home in about half an hour, and my father spoke to the policeman, and told him to have an eye to his house, and he said he would be in the way every five minutes—my father locked his door and sat down to work—Mr. Poole came in, and my father told him what had happened in the evening—my mother went into the back room to make his bed, and Mrs. and Mrs. Dible came in drunk—they went up stairs and came down again, burst the street door open, and came hurrahing through the passage, and kicking and dancing about—they then went up stairs and had a great row between themselves—I did not see them, but I heard them pulling themselves about—as my mother went back to dress the bed came down stairs—Dible called my mother a swine-looking b----, and then Mrs. Dible came and burst the</p>

On the evening of the 20th of Aug., Wrench was brought to me—I examined him and found a large wound in his throat and neck between five and six inches long, and about half or three-quarters of an inch deep—the smaller vessels were divided, the larger ones escaped—there had been a good deal of hemorrhage I believe before I saw it—I dressed it and he was doing well in the course of a few days—I know the prisoner—I had seen him the same morning—he addressed me as I was going round the wards, saying he wished to speak to me—he said he suspected he had the disease—I ordered him to be brought over, and found such was not the case—there was not the slightest foundation for any such opinion—I have seen him two or three times since he has been in the workhouse—I had noticed that same morning, and I think once before—I considered that his manner was singular.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you noticed him enough to form an opinion whether his mind was at all unsound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I spoke to him only a few words—he did not answer me at all—he appeared surly and morose in his manners—that was before this occurrence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you been surgeon to the workhouse? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About nine months—I do not think he has been there all that time—my duty is not to attend at the house, but out of it; but the gentleman who attends in the workhouse was then out of town, and I was attending for him—I had very little opportunity of seeing the prisoner—from what I did see of him I thought his manner was singular—he appeared very singular on that morn<lb/>ing—there did not appear to be the slightest foundation for the disease—I was struck with the oddness of his complaining of a disease for which there</p>

               <p>was not the slightest foundation—he appeared to be odd in his manner—his eye was strange—there is no stronger indication of insanity than the eye—I noticed that appearance about him that I asked two of the men to come and be present with me while I examined—I was fearful of being with him alone—I imagined that he was in such a state he might com<lb/>mit an act of violence—that was the morning this took place—from what I have understood from the medical man, he was brought into the workhouse in a state of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>, brought on by furious drinking—<hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> is a species of insanity while it lasts—the mind of a person suffering from it is almost always unhinged—it is a kind of fever of the brain—I should say the brain was in a state of depression in the intervals between the attacks—that would not create unconsciousness, or prevent the proper operation of the mental faculties—I imagine the partly would be cool and collected during the intervals—he was quite calm in his manner when I saw him on the morning in question.</p>

                  </hi> I am the governor of the workhouse—the prisoner came there on the 18th of August—he then seemed to be in good health, and quite in a sane state of mind—he was rather eccentric in his manner—I saw him the day this happened, and spoke to him—he appeared no worse that day than I had seen him on the previous days—he was rather of a morose, reserved, and sullen disposition—he did not seem to join with the other people—there was no appearance of violence that day—he complained to me about the state of his body as the surgeon had described, and I described the the surgeon to examine him—I know Wrench—I was not aware of his occasionally bringing the prisoner down when he would not bathe or come to his meals—Bachelor is the orderly man of the word—he would not have authority to direct Welch to bring him down—he would have authority to ask any of the men in the ward to assist him—I do not know of Welch having ill-used the prisoner in any way—I have inquired since, but have not learnt that he has—this knife is a worn-out old knife, which I believe did belong to the word—they are not allowed to keep possession of their knives after they have done their meals—if the prisoner did so, it was contrary to the rules of the house.</p>

On the 2nd of Sept. the prisoners Barnett and Thomas Rush were looking in at our window—there were rings, watches, and other things in it—they went away, returned, and stood in the same place they had done before—they then went past the door—they came again, and I saw them go away the third time—I then ran down to the bottom of the shop, and saw that a card of rings was gone from the window—I went to the door, looked towards Ratcliff-highway, and then looked towards Shadwell, and saw Barnett—I caught hold him, and brought him back to the shop—I told him on what account I brought him back—he said, "Me! me! you are mistaken"—I have no doubt that he and Thomas Rush are the persons I saw at the window—a small corner of the pane of this wis<lb/>dow was cracked previously, but after the rings were gone it was broken away—there was a large piece out—a lad brought in two rings immediately after<lb/>wards—I had observed the window shortly before I saw the prisoner there—it was then quite safe.</p>

I saw Barnett and Thomas Rush close by Mr. Wood's window—Barnett appeared to me to be writing on a pane of glass—they both turned round, and looked both ways in the street—Barnett turned round; after that, he bent himself down, and appeared to put his hand into the window—he took out something in his hand from the wis<lb/>down, and gave it to Thomas Rush, who crossed the road, and I lost sight of him—Barnett passed on towards Francis-street, and as he was coming back Mr. Reed caught him, and took him into the shop—I saw two or three little things drops from Barnett's hand on the pavement, as he took his hand from the window—I could not see what they were</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon, in High-street, poplar. I was called, and found Mrs. Northorn in a very excited state, bleeding from a wound in the forehead—there were other contusions about her body—I believe these tongs would produce what I saw, and also the wound on the eye—one blow with them would make the two wounds—each finger of the tongs would make one—the wounds were only an inch apart.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that Mrs. Northorn had burat his door open, and refused to go out; that on his attempting to put her out, she struck him on the nose with the tongs; that he took the tongs from her, and struck her across the back with them, but that he never struck her on the face, except with his fist.</hi>)</p>

I came down about ten minutes to seven, and found the door lead<lb/>ing from the passage into the kitchen open—the washhouse-door was shut, but unbolted—I did not take any notice of it, the young men being down before me—while lighting the fire I looked up the passage leading to the street-door, and saw the prisoner standing there—there is a door from the passage into the shop, and another into the parlour—it communicates with the stair-case—I asked what she wanted—she said she wanted Mrs. Furley—the pri<lb/>soner was not living there then—she said she had been up to Mrs. Furley, and she was coming down directly—I went into the parlour, then into the kitchen, and then my master gave the alarm that the cash-box had been stolen—I came back and the prisoner was gone—about half an hour afterwards I went into the garden and found this basket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) filled up with things, and a wrapper tied close down over them—there appeared to be more in it then there is now—it stood just inside the back garden-gate, which leads into the street at the back of the house—I saw Miss Furley's shoes in it, some tea sugar, and other things—I pushed the gate open, it was unfastened—I found this work-box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the basket—it is mine—I had it only the night before—this petticoat is mine—it was found in the basket.</p>

I saw her in the privy the policeman's custody.</p>

                  </hi> I keep the King's Head public house, at Knights-bridge. On Thursday evening, the 4th of Dec. last, I had a large party in my house,—the prisoner was there, and two persons named Scully and Potter—I did not see them come in, but I saw them all three in the house in company together—I had seen the three in company together at my home many times previously—the prisoner and Potter had slept in my house three or four nights previous to that—they knew my house well—they had been in the habit of sleeping there for three weeks at different times—I saw the prisoner and the other two on the night of the 4th as late as twelve o'clock—I did not observe either of the three leave—I cleared my house about one in the morning—I was the last person up—I made the bar safe, and left the bar window safe when I went to bed—I left some silver and copper, and some articles of plate, cigars, and cheroots, in the bar—I was disturbed about four o'clock in the morning by Oram—I went down into the bar, the window was open, and the shutters of the bar-parlour down—that must have been opened form the inside—I found some of the silver gone, and some things tied up in a handkerchief ready to be taken—I missed some silver and copper, some articles of plate, cigars, cheroots, a great coat, and a handkerchief—the articles tied up ready for removal had been displaced from where I had left them the night before—whoever committed the robbery must have been in the house I should say, and afterwards broken out—there was no appear<lb/>ance of external violence—I sent for a policeman—some of the property has been returned to me from this Court. When Scully and Potter were tried here—the prisoner was taken last Saturday three weeks.</p>

                  </hi> I live at No. 2, Wheat-sheaf-court, St. Pancras. Two months ago, last Friday, I met the prisoner at the corner of Penton-street—he asked me if I was going home—I said I did not know—he asked me to drink—I went into the Crown and had a glass of ale—the prisoner went home with me, and remained about two hours—he then got up to go away without giving me anything—I asked him whether he intended to leave me so, and what he was going away for; and he <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his fist and knocked me down twice—I screamed, "Murder"—a lodger came down, and saw the stats I was in—I said, "For God's sake come in, the man is killing me"—he came in and said, "What are you doing to the woman?"—he said, "Get a light and see!"—he went up stairs—while he was gone, the prisoner went away, and locked the door—before the man came down, I had felt the pri<lb/>soner do something to my thigh—I do not know what it was—I perceived</p>

               <p>something the matter with my thigh, and said the prisoner had stabbed me—while the man was gone up stairs, the prisoner took me up, threw me on the bed, took up the contents of the slops, and threw it in my face and eyes—he went away, and locked the door—I fell off the bed, and laid there till the next morning when the person came in—I examined myself—I found a great wound on the left side, on the thick part of my thigh—I bathed it with warm water, but did not go to a surgeon for about a week afterwards—it is dreadfully bad now—I saw the prisoner about a month afterwards, on Wed<lb/>nesday night, when I was in the Crown, drinking some ale with a gentleman—he came in with two females—I said, "That is the man that has got the key of my room-door"—he laughed at me, and said, "Yes, I have got it, and I mean to <hi rend="italic">stick to it</hi>"—I said, "That is the man that stabbed me on the thigh"—he said nothing to that—I looked for a policeman to give him in charge.</p>

Turner came to the door—at that time the prisoner had stabbed me—Turner had a light in his hand at that time—he just opened the door, in his shirt, and walked away—I said, "Come in, he is murdering me," and then Turner went up stairs to put on his things—I do not know whether that was because he would not shock me—he knew me pretty well, by living in the house—I do not know whether he came down again—he did not come into my room then; when he came down with the light he did, and said, "What have you been doing to her?"—the prisoner did not tell him he had not been doing anything; if he did, I did not hear him—he told him he had better get a light and see—after the prisoner was gone, and the door locked,</p>

The prosecutrix came to my surgery about the 14th of Aug.—I found she had received a wound—it was a circular cavity—the circumference was about three-quarters of an inch, and about half an inch deep—it appeared to have been inflicted some time—it was an old wound—it was granulating—I have not treated it since—she came but once—I should suppose it was inflicted with a blunt instrument—it might have been occasioned if she had fallen on a hard substance with a point to it—it would have required considerable violence to have inflicted it.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of William Bywater, of St. Paul's Deptford—I knew the deceased for seven years—her name was Mary Hutch<lb/>ings—she was the prisoner's wife—I lived next door to them. On Sunday evening the 22nd of Aug., I was called into their house, about eight o'clock, or it might be a little before—I directly went up stairs, and found the deceased down by the side of the bed—she was dressed—she was very bad indeed, and complained of pain at the bottom of her stomach—she was very sick—I undressed her, and got her into bed—the prisoner was at home, their two sons and the youngest daughter, that is all the family that are at home—the de<lb/>ceased said she was very poorly, and I went down stairs to the prisoner, to get some brandy for her—I got some from him, he mixed it in hot water, brought it up stairs to me, and I gave it to the deceased—she drank it, and threw it up immediately—the prisoner had sent out the boy for the brandy—I had no conversation with him while the boy was gone for it—when I first went into the house, he said to me, "Mrs. Bywater, I wish you would go up to my wife; she is very bad, and she has been taking some d—stuff or other" that was before I went up stairs.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What sort of a woman was Mary Hutchings? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She was a very nice woman, and one might be very comfortable with her—the prisoner and her lived on very bad terms—I had no conversation with the prisoner before his wife's death, as to the state in which she was—I do not remember it—I told him once that Dr. Downing said she was in a dangerous state.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he state at that time why he broke open the drawer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because he was afraid his wife had got to it; that he threw it away in case she had got to the arsenic—he did not know whether she had got to it, or whether she had not, but he threw it away for fear she should get to it, as she was so bad—he did not say, in case she <hi rend="italic">had got</hi> to it, but in case she <hi rend="italic">should get</hi> to it—I might have said "in case she had got to it"—I do not know that I did.</p>

               <p>looking into her pocket for keys—I did not go to the drawer that was said to have been broken open, because the husband and son had nailed the lock on again—I saw the outside of the drawer—I did not see any other drawer there locked up—that was the drawer that belonged to the boy—it was one of a chest of drawers—all the drawers were not locked—I cannot say whether some of them were—I did not try them all—I tried some, and those that I tried were all open—they had locked on—the deceased used to place some clothes in those drawers that were in her son's room, as well as in other part of the house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he give you any reason for having broken open the drawer and emptied the stuff into the fire? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, because my mother had told him she had taken jalap, and he said he thought she had taken something more than jalap—that was all he said about it—it was then that I went up stair and found my mother groaning—I found that my drawer was taken out, and placed on a box—the lock was broken, as if it had been forced, and the bottle was gone—the drawer was lying a very short distance from the bed where my mother was—I do not recollect that my mother spoke to me when I went up—I said nothing to her then about the drawer or the bottle—I did when I went up a second time—the first time I went up I put the lock on the drawer again—my father came and helped me to nail it on—her went up with me—I got some nails, put the lock on again, and put the drawer in its place—my father helped me to do it—I heard nothing pass between my father and mother on that occasion—there were no other bottles or any medicine in that drawer—I think my father came down out of the room with me after mead<lb/>ing the drawer, I am not certain—I went up a second time, after I had my tea—after putting on the lock, I went down and had my tea—me father was there while I had my tea, as well as I can recollect—I think there was ten poured out for my mother—I cannot say who took it up to her—I do not think I did—some tea was taken up by somebody—I saw it taken up, but cannot tell who took it—I cannot tell whether it was my father or my little brother—I cannot say who poured out the tea for her, I did not—it was about six o'clock that we had tea—my mother was ill at dinner time—she had been well enough in the morning to get the dinner ready and make the pudding.</p>

I think, about half full when I first had it—I knew it was poison, and that it was dangerous, and was careful about it—the word "poison" was written on a paper that was on the bottle—I cannot read and write—I cannot read writing—I had a Testament and another book in my drawer—I have read the Testament sometimes—my father did not buy it me, it was my grandfather's, and I had it—I never knew of my mother taking much medicine.</p>

                  </hi> I am a lecturer upon practical chemistry at St. Thomas's Hospital. I have examined these five packages, two of them contain jalap, one contains carbonate of magnesia, another some pills, and another some brown sugar—the pills appear to be composed of common aloes, commonly called bitter aloes—I also examined the bottle—it had no label round it—it had apparently contained some organic matter in a state of decomposition, but it was impossible to state what it was, it was so completely decomposed—this is not the bottle that was taken from the privy—the bottle taken from the privy contained a quantity of night soil and traces of arsenic—there was certainly enough to enable me to say that the bottle had contained white arsenic (<hi rend="italic">the bottle was here produce</hi>)—it has no label on it, nor had it when it was given to me—I was not present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I received the stomach from Dr. Taylor—I submitted it to a chemical test, and found that it contained a considerable quantity of white arsenic—I was afterwards present when the kidneys were taken out—I submitted them to the same analysis, and they also contained arsenic—I succeeded in reproducing arsenic to the extent of about fifteen grains, some portion of which I have here—(<hi rend="italic">producing several small tubes</hi>)—this is arsenic in the metallic condition in which it came from the contents of the stomach, and this is some in the state of white arsenic—at my last experiment I found this white arsenic in a pure state to adhere to one side of this tube—fifteen grains would be quite sufficient to cause death—this other tube contains fifteen grains of arsenic—it is a about the same in bulk as an ordinary pinch of snuff, that might he held between the fingers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would tea hold it in solution? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To a certain extent it would, but it would be more suspended in the fluid than actually in solu<lb/>tion—it would be held in the tea for a short time, but being rather neavy it would soon settle to the bottom—it would settle, perhaps, in the course of three or four minutes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you that you extracted the whole that there was in the stomach at the time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—if anything is allowed for loss it would be but a few hundredths of a grain—the taking of arsenic produce a burning sensation in the throat—that comes on some little time afterwards—in some cases it will take half an hour or more, it is very uncer<lb/>tain—the operation of arsenic is extremely uncertain in point of time, vary<lb/>ing from half an hour to four or five—the sickness usually begins with pains in the stomach, but that is also uncertain—sickness frequently comes on a very short time afterwards, but sometimes we find cases where sickness does not occur at all—the pain is principally in the stomach and back part of the throat—that would render a person indisposed to eat or drink—sometimes it causes considerable thirst—they feel disposed to take cold liquids, but indis<lb/>posed to take their food—very probably a little eaten would bring on retching and sickness.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In what period of time would the indisposition to eat com<lb/>monly arise? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would be very difficult to say, it would depend so much upon the period at which the person began to eat before taking the arsenic—if it is taken upon a full stomach it does not act so speedily as if it is taken upon an empty stomach—if it was taken about an hour before dinner, probably at dinner time the person would not feel disposed to eat—that is the ordinary consequence of an exhibition of arsenic.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have some powders there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, they were brought to me by the beadle as having been found in the house—amongst them there is an aloetic pill—it is what is usually called bitter aloes—it contains bitter aloes—it is an aperient medicine—here is also some jalap—jalap is about as innocent a medicine as anybody can take—it some<lb/>times slightly irritates the stomach—it not unfrequently causes a little nausea—it is a mild aperient—there is no direction upon these powders as to the amount to be taken—I could not tell whether was any jalap in the stomach—jalap is a vegetable—I did not apply any test to ascertain the existence of any vegetable matter in the stomach, and am not able to state whether there was any vegetable poison or medicine in the stomach at that time—if she had taken any large quantity of jalap in the course of the day upon which she died, I might possibly have found some traces of it in the stomach, but after so much vomiting it would be unlikely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would it be at all unlikely, a person's stomach being deranged, that jalap should cause vomiting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would be extremely likely, it is a nauseous medicine—that vomiting, if caused by taking jalap or an aloetic medicine, would indispose the party to eat—a deranged stomach alone would indispose a party to eat—the immediate action of arsenic is by eating into the coats of the stomach—if the stomach is empty the arsenic is more quick in its operation—if it was taken an hour before dinner, upon an empty stomach, and caused nausea and vomiting, I should expect those symptoms to be accompanied by violent heat and pain in the region of the stomach—that would probably precede the vomiting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, suppose a person to have taken jalap, and to have been sick and indisposed to eat at dinner-time, and not to complain of any burning heat or sensation of pain at the stomach, would you think that the fact of the jalap having been taken, would account for that state of things? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly, more naturally than if arsenic had been taken in the mean time.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 180.) On the 19th of Aug. I was on duty in High-street, Deptford—I saw the prisoner driving a cart—I knew him before—I did not notice whether there was anything in it—he went with it to Hedges', a marine-store dealer, in High-street, Deptford, he got out of the cart, and went to a side gateway, attached to Mr. Hedge's shop—after remaining there about two minutes, two of Mr. Hedge's men came out of the yard, undid the tailboard, and took from the cart a basket covered with a cloth, and carried it into Mr. Hedge's yard (I did not see the prisoner at that time)—I followed into the yard, and saw the basket on the ground—the prisoner stood by it—I asked him what it contained—he said, "Copper"—I asked him to let me look at it—he said he would with the greatest pleasure—one of Hedge's men undid the cloth—I looked, and saw this copper in the basket—here are a great many pieces, weighing in all about 126lbs—I asked the pri<lb/>soner how he accounted for it—he told me he bought it at different shop a Woolwich—I told him I was not satisfied, and should take him before a Magistrate, which I did—I examined the basket at the station, and found one piece with the broad-arrow on it—this is it—I knew the prisoner to be a marine-store dealer.</p>

                  </hi> I live in High-street, Borough, in the parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. About eleven o'clock, on the 1st of Sept., I went to bed—I fastened up my premises—the shop-door was bolted and locked—about one o'clock I was awoke by the door-bell ringing—I dressed, went down, and found two constable with the prisoner in custody—I looked round my pre<lb/>mises with one of them, and found the first floor back-room window open—there is a court by the side of the house—the window goes out on the leads—the shop extends beyond the house—there is a skylight with leads, and whoever got into the house must have climbed up the water-spout, got on the leads, and then lifted up the back-room window—that could have been done—I found foot-marks on the leads, as if a person had had nails in his boots—it was a scraping on the leads—I had a very large stock—nothing was taken—a pair of steps had been placed against the shop-door at night—I found them two yards from the door, placed against the shutter-box—the window had been shut quite down, but not fastened—I saw the officer pick up a dark lantern in the shop—it was not on my premises before.</p>

I was on duty in Battersa-foelds on the evening of the 21st of Aug., and about five minutes before nine o'clock met the prosecutor—he told me what had happened to him, in consequence of which I went back with him—we saw the female prisoner, but I did not speak to her or take her into custody then—I saw her again on the 3rd of Sept., and took her into custody—I told her she was charged with being concerned in a robbery in Battersea-fields with <hi rend="italic">Swanney</hi> Simpson—she said she knew nothing about <hi rend="italic">Swanney</hi> Simpson—next day, after coming out of the Magis<lb/>trate's office, she said there was only her and Simpson and the prosecutor there, only them three—no one was putting questions to her at that time—she was in custody at the time—we were returning from the Magistrate's office—she said she wanted to give her evidence—I told her she had been asked twice whether she had anything to ask the witnesses, and she had said as—she said she wished to tell the truth, that there was only them three there, that was Simpson, her, and the prosecutor.</p>

                  </hi> I am wife of Edward Edeney, of Mint-street. On Sunday evening, the 25th of July, I saw the prisoner in the road with a woman, and the prosecutrix going for some water—the mug was standing before her—the prisoner laid his mother down in the road, the girl was standing before her, he made use of a very bad expression, kicked her at the bottom of the belly, and told her to be off—she fell back, and would have</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon, and live in Great Suffolk-street. On the 20th of July I was called to attend the prosecutrix—I found her lying on the bed, very faint—I examined her person, and found that the bottom of her belly, in the * * *, it was a wound about an inch and a half long, and was bleeding very much—there was a wound and a bruise—there was a good deal of blood on her person—in my opinion, it was a dangerous wound—she is suffering from it now very much—the bladder was very much affected, and is now—as soon as she came to, she complained of very great pain at the bottom of the belly, great pain on pressure—I administered proper remedies—she is has complained more or less since of that pain—she at first suffered from not passing her water, but now she has great difficulty in holding it, and has great pain when she passes it—she feels much easier when she is in a recumbent posture—she has been confined to her bed up to this time—in my opinion, such a contusion and wound might have been caused by the kick of a powerful man—if it had been a little higher, it might have ruptured the bladder—she is certainly recovering now, but I expect she will feel the effect of it almost ever after.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon, in the Old Kent-road. I knew the deceased Mrs. Olds very well—I was called to see her on the Thursday, the day she died—I had attended her before, for violet cough, occasional spitting of blood, and irritability of the lungs—it was a pulmonary complaint—my first observation of her on this occasion was on the Wednesday morn<lb/>ing, 25th of Aug., when she came to my house, and complained of violent pain in her chest and about the stomach, and vomiting of blood at times—while she was in my house she spat up a good deal of blood—I never knew her spit blood before—she had frequently complained of cough and cold—she complained of being hurt about the throat, and being held and pressed about the chest—I saw the throat—the skin appeared a little reddened, as if com<lb/>pressed, but there was nothing particularly marked about it—it seemed redder</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184709200199"/>
               <p>than it ought to be—there were no bruises—it was only red in one part—the left temple was bruised—that seemed to have been the effect of some violence—it was rather a lasting bruise, but not of itself likely to occasion death—I prescribed for her, and directed her to take everything very cold—I was sent for to her the next day, between one and two o'clock, and she was dead—I was prevented from seeing her in the morning—there was venous blood about the mouth—it seemed to come from the lungs—it was of a dark colour—by the direction of the Coroner I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the appearance of the lungs was very unhealthy—the upper part of each lung was very congested, very loaded with extravasated blood, the bronchial vessels also very loaded with blood and the aesophagus—the blood in the lungs was partly fluid and partly coagulated—the liver was very unhealthy, of a very dark colour instead of its natural colour—there was a flaxidity about it, which showed a great deal of unnatural character—the gall-bladder was almost empty—there was scarcely any bile in it—it contained a little air apparently—the stomach appeared partially inflamed about the upper part, and there was a great deal of blood mixed with fluid of the stomach—it must have come into the stomach from the trachea—the vessels were very loaded with blood, not rup<lb/>tured, but the arteries of that part are so minute, in all probability the blood might have come in partially from the veins of the stomach—that would not account for the whole—a large quantity must have come from the lungs, and got down the throat—the spleen and other organs were not quite healthy—there did not appear any inflammation about the bowels in general—the principal seat of disorder appeared the lungs and liver, and the irregular state of the bladder—in my opinion the flow of blood from the lungs arose from violence by blows or falls—the lungs being in a weak state they were susceptible—I can undertake to say that violence must have produced those effects—they could not have been produced to that extent without violence.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had you attended this poor woman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Several times in the course of the summer—she had taken medicine—she had stated to me before this that she had spit small quantities of blood, not to any extent—she told me that she occasionally expectorated blood—I mean by that, thrown it from her lungs—that might probably be occasioned by ulceration—there must have been some lesion of ves<lb/>sels to give rise to it—there may be a lesion without a rupture, or the evacuation of blood, but it generally happens—I am able to say that the blood evacuated was venous blood, and not arterial—I did not ascertain what vessel was broken—there were a variety of vessels, towards the upper part of the lungs, not any of the main vessels—there is no difficulty in ascertaining whether blood is venous or arterial—the colour of venous blood is dark, and arterial blood is red or florid—at the upper part of the lungs, the veins and arteries mix and inter<lb/>sect—I can hardly say that there were no arterial vessels ruptured, probably there might have been, but the greater amount was venous blood—I cannot say whether that was from the diseased part of the lung, as the lungs alto<lb/>gether were very weak, and participated in point of texture to a similarity of construction—there had been ulceration—it occasionally happens with the lungs in such a state, that the cough may rupture the vessels and produce great extravasation of blood—it is almost universally the mode in which such patients die—I know that the deceased was subject to a frequent cough—I do not consider, from the appearances of the lungs, that a violent fit of coughing would have produced the great effusion that I witnessed; the lungs were apparently not in that very tender state as to produce it—they were in a weakened state—external violence must be a considerably greater strain</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184709200200"/>
               <p>upon the lungs than a cough—it must in my opinion have been done by a violent concussion which jarred the vessels, and gave rise to the ruptures—such a concussion might be occasioned by a violent cough under a very much more diseased state of lings, but I do not consider these lungs were in that state—none of the main vessels were ruptured, only the smaller once—they would be very tender, and were in a delicate state.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose she had died from any other cause than the rupture, and you had seen these lungs without the extravasation of blood upon them, should you have said they were at all safe even from day to day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I should not consider they were in such a weak state as to give way—I should not consider that a violent cough would have been likely to affect them at all</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Evan though you had heard that she had been in the habit of spiting blood? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The answer to that question would depend entirely upon the examination of any particular part which might be diseased—I believe har age was about forty odd, I cannot say exactly, from forty to fifty—she might have been fifty-two—the blood in the stomach had come from the lungs, got into the trachea, and so passed into the stomach.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do I understand you rightly, that the state of the lungs was not in your opinion such as to lead you to conclude that a mere fit of coughing would have ruptured the vessels, and have produced the quantity of blood you saw? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—if on the Saturday night pre<lb/>vious to my seeing her, she had been thrown down on the ground, and held there, I should consider that would account for the rupture of the vessels I saw.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were there many ulcers on the lungs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not a great many, there were four or five patches of ulceration—sometimes the efflux of blend arises from ulceration eating into the vessels, opening the surface of the vessels themselves; and sometimes a vessel will burst or rupture from con<lb/>cussion, by reason of its weakness—it was quite impossible for me to in<lb/>vestigate the number of opening through which the blood might have flowed, there was such a large accumulation in the parts that it was nothing but a mass of blood, intermixed so firmly in the upper part of the lungs with the trachea, and so on, that it was a complete choak as it were—I divided the lungs in my examination, but could discriminate the openings, the vessels are so very minute there—suffocation was the immediate cause of death by the vomiting of blood into the mouth, choaking the passage—she was cough<lb/>ing at the time she came to me in the morning from the quantity of blood that was rising in her throat—I had never seen her so violently troubled by a cough before—I had seen her about a fortnight before—I did not observe any more chance of her dying then, than I had observed at other periods when I had seen her—if I had heard next morning that she had been taken with a violent cough which had ended in suffocation by blood, I should have been very much surprised—she was not in that condition—she was generally emaciated, with weak powers, and had been in a bad state of health for several years—there was no accounting for the state of the liver, lungs, spleen, and gall-bladder—there was peculiar constitutional irregularity—I had know her for many years, and she was a very regular, quiet, domestic person—the liver may be disordered by a habit of drinking—there were appearances that would arise from irregular habits, but I never saw her intoxicated, or sup<lb/>posed she was addicted to drinking—I always considered her a woman of feeble habits, weak about the lungs, with an unnatural state of liver, and no on—the ordinary immediate cause of death from pulmonary complaints is from inflammation of the substance of the lungs, producing matter, so that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184709200201"/>
               <p>they expectorate <hi rend="italic">pus</hi> and in proportion to the number of ulcers on the sur<lb/>face of the lungs, so in the same ratio will a person become sooner or later destroyed—it is a diminution of the powers of life—the process of ulcera<lb/>tion going on in the lungs must necessarily furnish blood to support those inflammatory parts, and thus nature is robbed of a very great support—it decays the functions of the lungs—I examined the deceased's body externally—I did not perceive any marks of violence except that on the left temple and the throat.</p>

On the Saturday night the 21st Aug., I was in my own back room, and was disturbed by a fall, and a cry of murder—I heard the fall first—the deceased and her husband slept in the up-stairs front room—the fall appeared to be in their back room—I heard Mrs. Olds cry "Murder"—I then ran to my door and opened it—the cries were still going on—they then appeared to come from the front room—I went up stairs into my front room, and opened the window, and then heard Mr. Olds say something to his wife, but what it was I could not understand—I heard her crying—I did not hear her say anything—it appeared to me as though he was still beating her—I did not see him—I judged by her cries that he was beating her—I did not hear the sound of blows just then—I saw their son William pass my door as I opened it—he came from his father's house—I saw him come back with a policeman—after the policeman was gone, I heard Mr. Olds beating his wife again—I heard the blows—the policeman stayed, I should think, about five minutes—I heard Mrs. Olds say, "You brute," you brute," several times, that was after I heard the sound of blows—there was no one there but the boy William, Mr. Olds, and his wife—I only heard the one fall, the other was hitting—I saw the deceased about four o'clock on the afternoon of the next day (the Sunday) in the back yard—she was very ill then—I saw her again on the Monday in the back yard, and saw marks on her throat—I did not see them on Sunday—I was nearer to her on Monday than I was on the Sunday—she had a bruise on the left temple—I had seen her about the middle of the day on the satur<lb/>day—she had not any bruise on the left temple then—I was her on the Wednesday and Thursday—she was very ill each day—each day she got worse—I saw her at the sink vomiting blood—she called me to see it—I had not seen her spit blood before the Saturday—she had not been well for some time before—after the Saturday night I observed a very great change in her—it continued up to Thursday, when she died—I saw her on the morning she died, at nine o'clock, not after that—she died at half-past two—I ran in when she was dying.</p>

                  </hi> I am fourteen years old, and lived with the prisoner and the deceased, my father and mother. On the Saturday night before she died I was at home—my father and mother and I were in the house above nine o'clock, nobody else—my mother had had some money left her—I believe it was kept in a drawer of a cheat of drawers that was there—when my father came home he said, "I want some money"—he was not sober my mother said, "No," she would not give it him; and he took hold of the drawers by the bottom and turned them over—I believe the money was in those drawers—I never saw any there—my father went backwards to get the hammer to break the drawers open—my mother took the hammer out of his hand, and threw it over the pigstye—he then began quarrelling and hitting her—they were both quarrelling—I did not see my mother hit him, nor my father hit her—I went out to fetch a policeman—my mother was then in the front room—she was standing up—I did not see her down upon the ground at all—I went for the policeman because my mother sent me—I did not see my father do anything to her—she was sitting down in a chair when I went for the policeman—my father was standing by the fire-side—he was not quiet, he was making a noise and <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—I did not see him doing any-thing else—I should have seen it if it had been so—my mother hallooed one two or three times, "Run for a policeman," and I did so—I did not see anybody hold my mother round the body.</p>

The prisoner is my son, but not my husband's son—my husband and I were tried for felony—it was for keeping goods sent to us to mangle—we were acquitted—we had the goods in the house, but we did not know who they belonged to—before we were acquitted the prisoner came for the key of the house, to take care of the things—when we were acquitted, we went back to the house, found it quite empty, and the key given up to the land-lord—we lost the whole of our household furniture—18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would not replace them—I have seen the things produced—I am confident this gown and shawl are mine—the other things are my husband's, and were in the house when we were taken to prison.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of Stephen Betts, a butcher, at Putney. The prisoner was in my service about three months—on the 31st of Aug., in consequence of some circumstances, I required to search her box—the police<lb/>man was sent for; and on her consenting, I went up to her box in her bed-room, and she unlocked it—I found in it two aprons belonging to my son Stephen, and a sheet cut to pieces—I have put it together to see if it would make a sheet—I can swear to it by a B which I put on it myself, and a little dot—I found a long muslin curtain, which was an apron of my daughter's, and I joined it together myself, and made a curtain—it is my own work—I found a night-shirt of my son's in the kitchen table-drawer, which I can swear to by a B that was on it—the letters have been picked out, but I can see that there has been the cotton there—I asked the prisoner how she came by the aprons—she said she had made half-a-dozen aprons for a young man, and he had given her these two—she said the curtain was her own—I said I could swear to it—she said it was hers, and she had more like it—I told her to show me one like it, and she showed me one which was clear muslin—the sheet, she said, she bought of a housemaid at Streatham, where she lived servant—I had never given her these things—she had no right or authority to have them in her box.</p>

Chitty, 2, Arnold's Paragon, Francis-street, Newington Butts, London"—after the hamper per was delivered there, I went into the house—I saw Morton and Eaton talking—the hamper was taken into the parlour, and afterwards taken to the station-house in Lock's-fields.</p>
