From information I received on 13th June last, I went with Jarvis to Mr. Savage's, a pawnbroker in White<lb/>chapel-road—I went into the shop, and found Mr. Savage and the prisoner—I told Mr. Savage, in the prisoner's presence, that we had come to make some inquiry about some gold that had been stolen, which he had purchased—he said, "Not me, my man," pointing to the prisoner—I then asked the prisoner who he got it from, and—when he said, "I bought it after business hours on Thursday night"—I said, "Who did you buy it of?"—he said, "Of a man; I never saw him before, and I don't know who he is"—I said, "Is that all you know about it?"—he said, "I asked him his name and address; he looked like a working man; I thought he was in the trade"—I said, "Will you show me the entry?"—he looked about the shop for a book some little time—Mr. Savage said it was upstairs in the drawing-room—a book was fetched down, and the entry was shown—it was the last entry in the book—there appeared to be some sand on the writing—Jarvis, who was with me, said, "This has been altered from the 11th to the 12th"—the prisoner then said, it being an affair that had occurred after business hours, it would not go into that day's account—Mr. Savage said that he always sent all his old gold and silver to Messrs. Johnson and Walker, the refiners, in Aldersgate-street.</p>

Q.</hi> You are not an assayer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; we have to melt gold, but we do not style ourselves gold melters, because we do not melt for the trade; we are gold-beaters, and manufacturers of gold and silver leaf—it is not alloyed before it comes to us to be beaten; we alloy it—there is a variation of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per oz.; the highest price is 86<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the lowest 85<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we alloy the gold according to the purpose it is intended for—it can be alloyed down to almost a little above the value of silver—in order to produce a very extraordinary colour, we have reduced it to one-half in value—some notion of the value of gold may be formed by the use of a stone and aqua-fortis—I should think a person, without having it assayed, might be able to tell the value within a few shillings.</p>

                  </hi>. On the night of 14th July, I was with the prisoner, going towards a field near Chase-gate, Hadley—I had been working with him all day and supping with him—I was quite sober—I expect we were both so—my brothers had been with us at supper, but they were not with us when this happened—after supper the prisoner and I turned back to the field at the Chase-gate and lay down—the prisoner said I should not lie there, if I did he would cut my head off with a scythe—there had been very few words between us; only what he said himself—I had given him no blackguarding—he said this without any provocation—I did not lie down—the prisoner started with the intention, as I supposed, to fetch the scythe, and I went to stop him and he threw me down, kicked me in the body, and cut me with a knife on the left arm—I did not strike him at all before he struck me—I struck him with my open hand, but not before he cut me with the knife in the arm, here is the mark; I bled very much—I went for a policeman.</p>

I am a surgeon at Barnet—the prosecutor was brought to my surgery about 1 in the morning of 15th July; he was very much exhausted from loss of blood, and was then bleeding profusely from the left arm—there were four or five deep jagged wounds, one almost reaching to the bone, which I was obliged to sew up and dress—I consider he was in danger from such severe wounds—erysipelas might have followed, but they healed up very well.</p>

From instructions I received, I went with another officer to watch the premises of Mr. Hill, a confectioner, of Bishopsgate-street Within—about half-past 4 o'clock on Monday, 10th August, I saw the prisoner leave the premises—we followed him into Wormwood-street—on coming up to him I told him I was an officer, and asked what he had about him; that he was suspected of having something about him which belonged to his master—he said, "Who instructed you to watch me? I have only a few eggs; it is a very bad job for me; cannot the matter be compromised?"—I said, "Not under any circumstances; I must take you to the station and search you"—I searched him at the station, and found in his hat this cake, which just fitted the hat, and 6 small cakes, and 10 eggs in his pockets—I afterwards searched his lodging, and there found some lemon-peel and some cakes, a quantity of butter rolled up in paper, and some loaf sugar, and about 1 1/2 lbs. currants; they are such things as confectioners use.</p>

I live at 4, Aldgate, in the City of London, and am a photographic artist; my name is up outside, and there are portraits at the door, so that any person would know what my calling was—on Thursday, 18th June, about 7 in the evening, the prisoner came to my premises—I was in a back room on the first-floor with my wife—I had never seen the prisoner before—he said he wished to look at some of my specimens—he spoke as good English as I can—I showed him several specimens—he seemed perfectly satisfied, but said he would not have one taken then, he would call again the next day—I believe my wife gave him one of my cards and he left—on the following day, Friday, he came again between 12 and 1—I was in the same room—he came upstairs to me—he said he had come to have his portrait taken—my wife showed him where to arrange himself—he said he was in no hurry, he would wait till the other customers had gone, and when they had gone, I took a portrait of him—I did not like the look of it and I took another of him—he then said he wished to speak to me privately, and asked if I could copy works of art—I said, oh, yes, anything—he said he had got some work for me to do, which he would bring the following day—he came on the following day, the 20th, at noon—I asked him where his residence was and I would send for the works of art—he said, oh, his hotel was a long way, pointing towards the east—he produced a one gulden note to pay for is portrait and gave it to my wife: she handed it to me, saying she did not know the meaning of it—he afterwards gave her a gold half-Napoleon, and she gave him change in English coin—he took one portrait away with him, the other</p>

               <p>he left, and I afterwards gave it to the police—on the following day, Saturday, the prisoner came again from about 12 to 1—my wife and daughter were there and several customers—my wife thought he wanted another portrait, so she asked him to arrange his hair again—he said, oh, no, he would wait till all the customers had gone—he did so—he then asked me to shut the door—I did so; my wife and child were there also—the prisoner then took a pocket-book out of his inside coat-pocket—took from it a one gulden note and asked if I could copy that—I said, "Oh, yes"—he then asked if I thought we could procure paper in London like that to print them on—I said I did not know—he said it did not matter much, as we could get plenty in a foreign country, by going to Paris or some of those places—my wife went upstairs to attend to dinner while this conversation was going on, my daughter stopped all the time—the prisoner asked me if that was my wife that had just left the room—I said, "Yes"—he said, "That is all right"—he then said, "Is this your daughter?"—I said, "Yes" and he said, "That is all right then"—he then said, "You must not let any living soul in the world see these notes, nor yet the impression you take of the notes"—I said, "It is not likely"—I was to copy 1, 000 from the one gulden note—he said he would give me an order for 1, 000 from that, and we could pass them off to foreign gentlemen as we travelled round the country—this is the note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I can swear to it by the pin mark and the No. 840—we were to travel in France, Belgium, Austria, Russia, Prussia, and all parts of the Continent—I said "Very good," and with that he bade me good afternoon—after he had gone, I spoke to my wife and shewed her the note, and after consulting with her, I put on my hat and coat and went directly to Seething-lane station and gave information to Inspector Scott, not ten minutes after the prisoner had left—the prisoner had said that he would call again on the Monday morning to see the impression that I took from the note, and then if I liked he would give me some of greater value—I photographed the note early on the Monday morning—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the glass impression—the prisoner did not come into my place during that day—I saw him on the opposite side of the way I dare say a dozen times, walking backwards and forwards during the afternoon; he was parading about for full three hours—about a quarter to 9 in the evening, I shut up my place in the ordinary way—after my business is over I generally stand at my door for a short time—I was stand<lb/>ing there about ten minutes past 9, when the prisoner came up to me and shook hands with me—he pulled me on one side from the shop where the foreigners are and said, "You must not let them hear one word"—the ground-floor is an ice-cream and confectioner's shop, kept by Italians—I said, "Let us go and have a glass of ale together"—we went into an hotel in Jewry-street, about fifteen doors from my place and had a glass of ale—on the way he asked if I had photographed that note—I said "Yes"—he asked how it looked—I said it was very good—he said he should like to see it—after having the ale we went back to my place and went upstairs together—my wife was sitting there at needle work—he said, "Good evening, madame;" and I said, "He has come to see the impression I have taken from that note"—he said, "Oh, shut the door"—the door was closed and I sat down at the table with him—I showed him the photograph I had taken and let him have the note to compare with it; he seemed highly pleased with it and said he had got some more of greater value, and he would let me have them to go on with, and make as good a job of them as that—he then remarked, "But this is a very dry job," and gave me half-a-crown to get a bottle of gin—I went out and was away for about an hour—I went to make</p>

               <p>inquiries where the officers lived that had the case in hand—I left the prisoner at my place; when I returned he had left; I met him as I came back—before I left he talked very much about making our fortunes, and I was to get them done on copper-plate, so that I was to have them lithographed, and he would find any amount of money—I was to get plates done by lithography so that we might go on and make as many thousands as we thought proper, which<lb/>ever way I could get them done the best not to be detected—when I went away I left the one gulden note and the photograph in the room—I said he had better leave it, for I thought I could get a better one than I had already got—I met the prisoner on my return, next door to Mr. Gatti's, about seven doors from my place—he told me he had been back, and had left two notes of more value with my wife, and given her six and a half Napoleons as a deposit for me to go on with the work—we parted in the street—when I got home my wife showed me a 5 gulden note, a 10 gulden note, and six and a half gold Napoleons—on Tuesday evening, the 23<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the prisoner came and knocked at my door—my wife and I were sitting in the room—he sat down at the end of the table, with his back partly towards the door—he came leaning right over me as I sat in my easy chair, and said, "You say anything to the police?"—I said, "It is not likely"—he said, "Because I hear something last night, and I am going off to Boulogne in the morning"—he said I must keep the secret, or we should both be ruined and transported and sent to the galleys, and I don't know where, if it was found out—I said it was not a likely thing that I should do anything of the kind to risk my liberty—we had the three notes on the table, and the glass impression that I had photographed—the prisoner was comparing the one gul<lb/>den note with it, talking about our travelling, and what fine fortunes we could make, and all kinds of humbug—another knock came to the door; I said, "Come in," and Scott, the detective, put his head round the doorway—he was in plain clothes—I went outside to speak to him—I made some com<lb/>munication to him—I returned to the room, and then went out again on to the stairs—the officers then went into the room and took the prisoner into custody, and took possession of the three notes and the glass impression—the portrait I had given up on the Saturday when I had given the informa<lb/>tion—this photograph is taken upon a plate of glass; the glass is covered with prepared collodion; it is then exposed to the light, with the note in front, and the impression of the note then becomes printed on the glass—when it is printed on the glass I can set it, so as to print from it—we have to fix it—we wash it and tone it, and then wash it again, and then fix it—when that is done, by placing it upon sensitive paper, we can print off as many copies as we wish, by placing it to the light—we must have the right paper, so that the sun may act upon it—I did not prepare it for printing—I never intended to print—I black-varnished it, so that it could not be scratched when the officers were making use of it—by varnishing it I pre<lb/>vented its being printed from, because the collodion is on the varnish side—I varnished it to preserve it, so that, in being shown about, the collodion should not be scratched off—the plate I have produced is an exact <hi rend="italic">fac-simile</hi> of the note.</p>

               <p>I had gone on with the right process, but I never intended to go on with it—from the prisoner's instructions, I was to take all the three notes like this, and then have copper or lithographic plates taken from them, and he would supply me with money to get those plates done—that was his intention—I was not simply to take a copy by photography for that purpose; his instruc<lb/>tions were for me to get the plates done, and if we could not get the paper in London I was to travel with him and we could procure it abroad when we had once got the stone. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the impression or shadow is created on the glass, you fix it; it does not eat into the glass at all, does it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That depends upon what process we are working; in this process it does not—it is a mere shadow on the surface of the glass, which I fixed there by means of the varnish that I put on it—before putting the varnish, I might have washed it off the face of the glass, but I put the varnish on so that it should not be washed off—that was for the purpose of the police making use of it—this is very much fainter than the original from which I printed, because it is varnished on the collodion side—independent of the varnish, there would have been as good blacks as in the original note—the reproduc<lb/>tions would have been as good a colour if I had printed—that is what we call a positive—it would have been a negative if I had had instructions to take one, but I had other instructions—the prisoner's instructions were to take something from which I could get a copperplate—if I had followed out the prisoner's instructions instead of those of the police I should have taken a negative, and from that negative I might have printed—I could not print from a positive, it would appear the wrong way—all are taken as posi<lb/>tives in the first instance, and then converted into negatives—this was never converted into a negative—I could not possibly print until it was converted into a negative, it would have come out left-handed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, at 36, Coleman-street—the prisoner was occasionally employed in my office as clerk, about a year and a half ago—he called on Friday, 3d July, between 2 and 3 o'clock, and the shares were brought into my room by a clerk of mine, named Brain—the prisoner said he had been offered 115<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them, by Mr. Bennett, and he wanted to know what was the real value of them; he thought they were worth a good deal more, and asked me to ascertain what they were worth—I went out and asked our broker, and then came back and told the prisoner that the price was seven-eighths, and that I was quite sure he had been offered the top price for them—he asked me to go with him to Mr. Bennett, and I went—he had these letters of allotment with him, and told Mr. Ben<lb/>nett that he would take 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a share—that was the only time I went with him to Bennett's—I did not hear him say anything about his selling the shares for his aunt named Nicholson, who lived at Rochester—they said that they did not know whether the fifth letter of acceptance bore Mrs. Philip's sig<lb/>nature, and asked me whether I would guarantee it—I said, "Certainly not, I could not identify it"—the prisoner left it in my hands, and I went next morning to the office of the Scinde Railway Company to make inquiries about Mrs. Philip's signature—on 4th July, in the middle of the day the prisoner called at my office—I informed him that Mrs. Philip's signature was all right—I went from the railway office to Mr. Bennett's, but he was out of town—I had some communication with my brokers, and from what they said, I returned the prisoner the letter for the seventy-two shares on July 4th—it was not dealt in—he was standing at my office door at the time—on the same afternoon, I think, a policeman called at my office, and I told him what I knew about the shares—the prisoner had then gone, and I did not know where he resided—I had not seen him for three months or more previous to his calling on me.</p>

Q.</hi> Did the prisoner know that you had a correspondent at Rochester? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it was arranged that I should have possession of the seventy-two shares that I might make inquiries about them, and I took possession of them—the prisoner never said anything to me about his aunt, nor did Mr. Bennett say anything about her—the prisoner was two months or more in my office—he frequently had as much as 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and was the last person in the world whose honesty I should have suspected—his father held a high position in the Army.</p>

               <p>money—when money was to be collected instructions were given to the accountant's office to collect it—there are regular collectors employed—the prisoner had no right to deal with money at all—if goods were brought up from Birmingham, and the money not collected at the time, he would have nothing to do with that, it would only come into his department if there was a correspondence—Postle was a clerk in the office, and also a lad named Demetrius—when money had to be collected from the English line and the Irish line also, the collector would collect it and pay it into the cashier's office; a reference to the book is then obtained from the cashier's office, on which the clerk who has it in charge authorizes the Irish Company to re<lb/>charge the amount to the debit of the North Western Railway Company at Camden-town station, that settles the account—in this letter of advice there ought to be a letter of reference to the cash-book; the Irish Company would then send an invoice for the amount, which would go to the general corre<lb/>spondence office, first to the person who opens the letters; he would look at the reference on it, and distribute it into the accountant's office if it had the cash reference on it—the invoice is treated as a voucher between the two companies, and in our clearing he would use it as a voucher for the money—it would be brought into the correspondence office to see where the money was to be obtained—it ought to be in such a shape as to be distributed from the letter opener into the correspondence office, and not be returned—this letter is in the prisoner's writing: "If you have not yet charged this Com<lb/>pany with the above amount be good enough to do so, inclosing me an invoice giving reference to this letter; let this be done at once"—that is not a regular or proper letter, because, in the first place, it should give the cash reference; and next it says, "enclose <hi rend="italic">me</hi> an invoice," which he ought not to have done—with the name Stephenson signed here, and the initials under<lb/>neath, it would necessarily go into the correspondence office, and the proper authority would say, "You may re-charge this amount," giving reference to the cash folio—it would have gone all right to the accountant's office if unaccompanied by this letter, but being accompanied by this letter, it came to the correspondence office—it bears the reference which would take it to that office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a greengrocer, in Alfred-street, Millwall—I met the prosecutor running on the same day that the glass was broken—he came along with a pane of glass on his back—the prisoner was running to go to his horse up Alfred-street, and as he passed the prosecutor and another glazier, by his running, his waistcoat flew open, and caught the corner of the glass, and rented the side of it up—the glazier had two straps round his shoulders—he got them off, and said, "You broke my glass, you broke my glass," and that was all we could get out of him—after that, of course, the prisoner wanted to go to his horse—he went to go away, and the glazier caught hold of him, and then they went up by the coal wharf near a public-house, I don't know the sign of it, and had a struggle together, and the glass got broke—that was all I saw—the prisoner then ran away—I saw him jumping across some ditches on the marsh—I stood alongside of them when they were struggling, and I suppose forty people more—the prisoner had this whip-handle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his hands—he did not use it—he did not strike at all—they had a tumble together—the glazier kept on his legs</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186308170051"/>
               <p>—if you and I had a struggle together, we should very likely tumble—I never was in a place like this before—I saw the glazier fall on the ground when they were struggling, and the prisoner too—I have known the prisoner about five or six months—I have lived there about twelve months—I saw the police come up afterwards, Holton and another one—I can swear the prisoner did not take any money from the prosecutor—I was not near my shop at this time—this was at the top of Alfred-street, at the public-house—I don't know the sign of it—I do not use it—I have not been using a public-house this morning—I have not touched a drop of beer this last fortnight or three weeks.</p>

I took Bailey from information I received from Mr. Blackmore's foreman, who identified him—I told him I should take him for receiving property stolen from M. Ponzini's, which he had pledged—I took him to the station, and fetched a clock from the pawn<lb/>broker's—Bailey said that some man brought it to him in the middle of the day on Thursday, and asked him to pledge it, and he should know him again, and that the same man fetched away the things which the pawn<lb/>broker would not take; that he did not know the man's name, but he was a Frenchman—I searched Bailey's room, and found the stock of a centre-bit and a chisel.</p>

I showed them to him; he said that he was in some little difficulty, and wanted to place some furniture somewhere, and that there was not a cartload. I told him he was welcome to put it in my kitchen, and he did so. He said that he was in business, and was about going through the Insolvency Court.

               <p>I replaced everything, and on the next morning gave information to the police—I went up with the officer Gaylor, and brought all these things out and placed them before the prisoner and the whole of the workmen—I said to the detective, "This is Christopher Homan, whom I charge with stealing this property"—he made no answer directly; but shortly afterwards he got up and said, "It is all right; this is your property; I made it for you. How have I stolen it?"—I then said to Owen, "Who told you to make these things up?" referring to the jiggers and portions of the castings—he said, "Mr. Homan, of course"—Homan then said, "I had them made to make small glasses for you; I thought you might make up some microscopes, and then they might be useful"—I said, "If that is the case, how came there to be two jiggers made? it would not require two"—he then came forward and said to Owen, "Now be frank, Owen; did not you say to me that one would be very useful to you for your work?" and Owen, in a very hesitating manner, said after a short time, "Well, yes, I did say it would be handy"—I said, "Even if you had made these jiggers for your work and Owen's, how do you explain making up microscopes?" and he again repeated something to the effect that he thought I might make up some object powers, and then the body of the microscope might be handy to try them in—he was then taken to the station by Gaylor—I saw him searched there, and these four small lenses (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) found on him wrapped up separately in paper and then inclosed in one parcel—they are mine—they are eye-pieces of an astronomical telescope—he said they were my property—I did not hear him say how they came in his pocket—I went with the officer to the address the prisoner gave, and found a spectroscope, telescope, a pocket compass-box, and a set of ground frames for a quadrant, with coloured glass—I can swear to this telescope as my property, and I am sure the other things are mine—he had no authority to take them away from my place—I never gave him per<lb/>mission to remove them—some of the workmen were paid by the day, and some by piece-work—this work would all be called piece-work—there is an account of the work which each man does; the prisoner gave that account to Mr. Blakley, who paid the wages.</p>

               <p>microscopes—two arms could not be used in one microscope—I never saw it—I don't see any other duplicate except that—we found the things at the prisoner's house in a set of drawers, not all together in one drawer—I did not observe any children's books or slates in the same drawer—these glasses are all different colours—that is not a magnifying glass on that compass, it is plain glass to protect the card—there were no flies in it when we found it; there were eight or ten half-crowns in it, I should think—I never saw one of these used by children to put flies in; it would be rather an expensive style of fly-box—the prisoner's wife, was there—she said the things belonged to the little boy, but not until after some considerable time.</p>

On Tuesday morn<lb/>ing, 28th July, about half-past 11 o'clock, I went with another policeman to Lee's house, the Prince of Wales beershop, Old Nichol-street, Bethnal-green—when I got up to the door a woman ran in to Lee's wife and called out "Hedge, hedge!"—I went in to the bar-parlour and saw the prisoners stand<lb/>ing at a table by some weights and scales—it is a public parlour, but there was nobody there but the prisoners and Lee's wife—this broken silver (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was in the scale, but as soon as I entered Lee shot it out into a piece of newspaper, Jackson wrapped it up in a hurry, and took his seat at the back of the room—I said, "What have you got about you?"—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "Let me see"—he stood up and held up his arms—I searched him, and found 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I did not take—I then went to the table, undid the parcel, and saw the silver—I said, "Is this your's?"—he said, "No"—I said to Lee, "Is this your's?"—he said, "No"—I said, "If it does not belong to you, I will take it," and placed it in my pocket—by the side of it laid another paper parcel—I examined it, it con<lb/>tained forty-one spoons, tied in a bundle—I put them in my trousers pocket—I was in plain clothes—I found a waistcoat near the scales—I took it up, and Lee said, "That is mine"—I opened it, and in the pocket was a silver gilt watch with a chain attached to the waistcoat, and five other watches rolled up in the waistcoat—I also found in the waistcoat 201. in gold, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and some old coins, which I gave up to the wife at the station—87 H was with me—Lee said, "You are not going to take that"—I said, "I must keep it for the present"—his wife said, "Do not take that money away, Mr. Dunnaway, I have not got a farthing to go on with"—I turned to Jackson and said, "We shall make this man accountable for this silver, and if he does not go down quietly with us we shall call upon you to assist us in the Queen's name—Lee said, "Very well"—I then directed Jack<lb/>son to be taken in custody, and as soon as he got outside the door, I had my head partly turned, and Jackson struck the other constable a violent blow and tried to escape—I caught him by the collar, and assisted down to the station with Jackson, leaving Lee behind—I afterwards went back to the</p>

I reside at Boundary Cottages, Kensal-green, New Town—on Sunday, 5th July, I went with my brother, Henry Benton, to bathe in the canal—a pleasure-boat came by while we were bathing, and my brother said, "Keep in the water; there may be females in the boat"—I caught hold of the rope—the prisoner was with the boat, and he told me to loose the line—I left go directly—he said to me, "You ought to know better than to lay hold of the line, and if you had not loosed it when you did I would have given you a punch on the head"—we then got out of the water, and were dressing, when the prisoner came back to the iron bridge, and began at me, and wanted me to fight—I told him I could not fight—he said he would make me fight, and I pulled my knife out, and said if he came nigh me I would let him have the knife—my brother came up, and said, "What is the matter?"—I told him that Dixon was going to give me a smack on the mouth—my brother took up the quarrel, and said, "Fight me first"—they then fought together—my brother struck the first blow, under the throat; Dixon struck the next, on the lip—they fought for a quarter of an hour as near as I can say—they then shook hands, and my brother laid down under a hedge till the people went away—the last blow struck him on the nose—it bled very much, he could not stop it all day—he after<lb/>wards went home, had his dinner, and laid down a bit—he got up about half-past 5, and went to his horses—I saw him again about 8 or half-past—he seemed very well the next day, and went to a fair and a play in the even<lb/>ing—on the Tuesday he said "Good morning" to me just before I went out about 8 o'clock—he was then in bed—he sent for me about 2 or half-past, and they could not hold him in bed—he then was delirious—I stayed with him till half-past 6 in the evening, when he died—he never recovered his senses.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside with my brother—on 21st July the prisoner came into our service as housemaid—on Sunday night, 2d August, I asked my brother to move some wine into the pantry—I found that corks had gone out of several bottles then—I went to see the prisoner's box ex<lb/>amined,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at 25, Church-street, Lambeth—I was called to Windmill-court, and saw the deceased lying in the arms of a woman, who was supporting her on a chair—she was then dead, and had been dead about ten minutes—I made a very superficial examination at that time—I saw that she had a black eye—on the 8th I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> ex<lb/>amination, by order of the Coroner, seventy-two hours after death—on removing the skull-cap, I found the membranes of the brain highly congested, the brain itself softened, and extravasation, had gone on at the base of the brain on the left side; that was recent—I found the lungs congested, and on the right side a transverse fracture of the anterior sixth rib, which had per<lb/>forated the pleura; that was of recent date—the liver was enlarged, not nutmegged; it was adherent to the side from previous inflammation—the gall-bladder contained a minute quantity of bile, the stomach was softened, and there were traces of inflammation of a sub-acute character, such as we find from intemperance—the heart was suffused, rather below the average size, the walls thin, but no organic disease beyond—I came to the conclusion that death was caused by the shock to the nervous system, arising from the injury to the pleura—that might originate from a blow—it arose from violence.</p>

               <p>shock to the system would turn the balance against her—she was, no doubt, a person given to drink—the brain may have become softened by dissipated habits—softening of the brain frequently causes death—death might have arisen from the softening of the brain, or from the effects of the fracture of the rib, penetrating the pleura—in my opinion the latter was the cause of death, not the softening of the brain—the vessels of the brain would be con<lb/>gested by excessive drinking, and a fall or a succession of falls might pro<lb/>duce a rupture of an artery, and cause such a coagulum as I found, and that pressing on the brain might produce insensibility; not within half an hour—I know the works of the Dutch author Vandercrofts—he is considered an authority on these matters—death would no doubt have resulted ultimately from the effect of the softening of the brain—it is possible, but not probable that a succession of falls might cause the rupture of the artery, and so produce death, but in this instance we had a blow on the eye, and effusion going on at the posterior base of the brain as if from a blow—it is possible that injury might result from a fall—I have known persons live for years with softening of the brain—I should not expect in the case of a person so suffering, addicted to drink, and meeting with a fall, that death would supervene—I should undoubtedly expect that a person suffering from perforation of the pleura would exhibit symptoms of excessive pain within a few hours—a transverse fracture of the rib might be produced equally as well by a fall as by a blow.</p>

Bennison's (64th Regt.) stolen bilk Capt. Stewart, of the 3d Buffs, and others, will prosecute you for felony.

I must refer you to <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> of July 28, and read the trial of 'Fitch <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> St. George,' and then read the sworn cross-examination of the plaintiff and the defendant. Stubbs's Trade Protection Society will afford every information as to his past career and antecedents for the last ten years. He was formerly a hosier's apprentice, but he had no desire to live honestly. He has also lately been inquired for by the gentlemen of Scotland-yard, but unfortunately his victims are ashamed to have publicity given to their names, and prefer the loss to notoriety.

I live at St. George's-terrace, Paxton-park, Sydenham, and am a plate-layer on the permanent way—on 12th July I was going towards London-bridge Railway-station, and as I was passing near where St. Thomas's Hospital used to be I met two women—the female prisoner is one of them—one of them, I believe this one, asked me to treat them to two bottles of ginger-beer—I pulled out some coppers to pay for three bottles, and a sixpence fell out on the ground—this woman poured some dust over it—I went to take it up, and she took the dust and sixpence up together—I asked for the money several times, and then the male prisoner came up and pushed me down, and kicked me on the head and face when I was down—I have a mark there now—I had my watch before I was thrown down—I was rendered insensible, and taken to Guy's Hospital, where my wounds were dressed—my head bled very much in several places—when I came to, I missed my watch—I am quite sure it was the male prisoner who knocked me down.</p>

I then left my wife at the corner, and saw the prosecutor lying down; he had been kicked. I turned back, and my wife was gone. I walked down the Borough, and met a policeman, and then saw my wife leaning against a wall. I asked her was the matter, and she said some one wanted to give her in charge for striking a man with a knife. I said, "Stuff, come home." We went home, and about half-past 5 in the morning a policeman came to our house, and told us the charge. I said it was a serious charge, but we knew nothing about it. We were taken to the station, and the prosecutor came in. The inspector asked him if he knew us. He said he did not know me, but he thought that was the woman, but if it was her she had a light dress on and a black shawl. The inspector asked the ginger-beer man what he knew about it. He said he saw me and my wife standing together, and he saw me put up my hand, but whether I hit the prosecutor or shoved him he could not say, and the inspector said on that evidence it was useless for him to book the charge. A sergeant then came in, and said, "If you don't intend to press the charge, I shall on my own account," and we were locked up; we were remanded for a week, and then committed to Croydon Assizes for high<lb/>way robbery with violence; we were there honourably acquitted, and then committed here for a common assault.</p>
