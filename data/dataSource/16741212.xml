               Upon the first of these Indictments no sufficient Evidence being produced, the Jury could not thereupon bring him in Guilty
            </rs>; as the second there was full proof that he had often endeavoured to reconcile divers of his Majesties Protestant subjects to the Ro<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16741212004"/>mish Church, and had actually perverted several to embrace the Roman Catholique Religion, and assert and maintain the Popes supremacy in matters Ecclesiastical, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To all which he had very little to object, only alleadged, that if it were a Crime so Capital him to persuade People to the Roman Catholique Religion, (which he was verily persuaded was the onely true one) then it must be the same offence in Quakers and other different persuasions, since they as well as he made it their endeavour to draw people from the Church of England to their particular party. But to this was easily answered, that the very Words of the Law had expressed the Roman Catholique religion or Popery, but no such thing of any other Faction, and that Recriminations were no excuse, much less Justification; Whereupon after a full hearing, Debating, and weighing of the matter, the Jury brought him in <rs id="t16741212-1-verdict5" type="verdictDescription">
