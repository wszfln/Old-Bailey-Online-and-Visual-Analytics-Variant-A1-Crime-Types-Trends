            . On the 3d of May, between four and five in the Afternoon, the Prisoner came into my Shop and asked for a Pair of grey Stockings; I asked him what Price; he said about 4 s. 6 d. he looked on several Pair, and thought they were hardly fine enough, and as I was getting some others, I turned my Eyes on one Side, and saw him shuffle this Pair into his Pocket; he had hardly got them in; I said to him, I suppose, Master, you design to pay me for that Pair of Stockings you have in your Pocket. Says he, I have none in my Pocket, there is the Pair of Stockings I took lying on the Ground. There was a Pair lying on the Ground; but they were of a darker Colour. I went up to him, and said, I will be certain whether you have them or no; I laid hold of his Collar, and gave a Knock, and my Wife and Maid came up; he fell down upon his Knees and begged for Mercy, and said it was the first Fact that ever he committed. My Wife was for running her Hand into his Pocket to take the Stockings out, but he would not let her; then he put his Hand into his Pocket, pulled out two Pair, and threw them down; that was one Pair more than I knew of. This is one of the Pair he pulled out.</p>

The Prisoner and another Woman, came into my Shop on the 28th of April, between Three and Four, in the Afternoon, and asked for some black Silk Lace; I showed her some, she did not seem to like any of them, and asked to see some others; I had two or three Customers with me, so I told her, I should have more next Week, if they would come then; which they agreed to do: I saw her take the Lace, and followed her into the Street, and took her into my Next-door Neighbour's Shop, and took the Lace from under her Arm; before she went out of the Shop, I saw a bit of it hanging down, and then I took the Box of Lace away, because I would not be deceived by her shuffling it into the Box again: I know it is my Lace, because it has my Mark on it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not take it with a Design to steal it, but only as a Pattern (but the Prisoner said afterwards, that she did not know she took it out of the Shop; that it might be by Chance, that she had it under her Arm).</p>

The Prisoner lived in our Family as a Chamber-Maid, between two and three Years, and has been gone about three Months; we never mistrusted her Honesty, if we had, we should not have kept her so long; nor was she turned away upon any Suspicion of that Kind, and we had a very good Character of her from a Relation of ours that she lived with; I never heard any Thing amiss of her.</p>

               <p>Court. Give an Account of the Robbery.</p>
               <p>Martin. I will show you what was preceding the Robbery, and then the Robbery itself. She came the 13th; she went away the 17th, pretending to be ill of a sore Throat, and did not return again till Tuesday se'ennight following, which was the 26th; in which Interim of Time, she sent a Message to let us know, that she was ill, and desired that somebody might do her Business, and she would pay for it. On Wednesday the 27th she was to wash, (some time before this she was to have washed) and when she came to take out a ten Gallon Kettle which we wash in, there was a Hole in it, which we imagine to have been made by herself, because we never observed it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174305190004"/> before; the perswaded my Wife to let the Kettle go to be mended, and told her that all the Pots and Kettles wanted tinning, and perswaded her to let them go to an Acquaintance of her's: She carried that great Kettle, a Pot, 5 Saucepans, and a Stew-pan, and brought home but two of the Saucepans; on Thursday Night I came home about 12 o'Clock, they had been washing that Day, and the Cloaths were hanging up to dry in the Kitchen upon a wooden Horse: I went to draw a little Small-Beer, and saw a Rush-light burning on the Stairs, and a parcel of Linnen and Plates lying there; I went up Stairs and asked her the Reason of the Candle's being left, she said she designed to clean the House, (and told my Wife she would make the House as white as a Curd) I suppose that was to prevent our minding of it if we should hear any rustling or Noise: A little after 6 o'Clock I got up, and found the Back-Door open, and the Garden-Door unbolted, which I always take Care to see fast at Night; upon returning in again (for I thought she was gone out a gossipping with some Neighbour or other, not having any Imagination of what she had done) I bolted the Door and went up Stairs; my Wife said, It is a fine Morning, I will get up too; and when she got up, she found we were stripp'd, and that the Prisoner was gone; she seem'd to have some Judgment in doing it, for she pulled these Papers out of my Coat-Pocket, and left them upon a Chair. I miss'd all the things mentioned in the Indictment, and several more; I miss'd my Shoes and Coat, which I had worn the Day before; I believe she could not well carry any more, for it was near an hundred Weight. She had taken my Wife's Keys out of her Pocket, and taken several things out of the Drawers, but she left the Keys on the Table in the Kitchen. - She was gone out of the House when I bolted the Garden-Door; then I began to recollect where her Friends liv'd; for she had told me formerly, that she lived somewhere in Whitechapel, and that her Friends lived in More-lane by Morefields. However, the next Day I advertis'd them, and described her Person; on the Monday following, three Jews came to me, pretending they could help me to take the Person that robb'd me, and told me there was some of the things sold among their Jews, and one Mylock said he had bought some of the Goods, one Jacobs came with two or three more Persons afterwards; and when she was taken up, and carried before Sir

            . I live at Lambeth, and happened to get a Fare to Westminster Horse-Ferry , and thought to stay to get another back again, and instead of that, I happened to get one to London; this Man (Bretter) came with a Bundle on his Shoulder, and I asked him if he wanted a Sculler, he said no, but that there was a Woman coming behind who wanted one; and I asked her if she wanted a Sculler, and she said, Yes; What must I give you, said she, to carry me to the three Cranes; Nine-Pence, said I, For with that Bundle it deserves it; she said, she would not give it; then said I, If you will not give me so much, give me Six-Pence, and a Pint of Beer; she said, she would give me no Pint, she would give me but Six-Pence; when we came there, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174305190005"/> asked her if she wanted a Porter to carry it up; she said, Yes; I said, I would carry it for her; (it was to go into Little Morefields) but, when I got it upon my Shoulder, I found it was too heavy for me, and I asked a Waterman whether he would not earn a Jobb, but he would not: The Things were tied up in a Linnen Cloth, and some of the Plates fell out, I believe there might be half a Dozen of them; I called to her, and told her, there were some of them fell out; (she said, there were Plates and Linnen) I could not get a Porter, but there came a young Man, who undertook the Jobb, and she took the Plates up, and put them into the Bundle again herself.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is it from the Artillery-Wall, to the Ferry?</p>

               <p>Ware. It was full half an Hour after Five, and when I got against St. Paul's, the Clock struck Six; and, I said to the young Woman, the Clock strikes Six now; this was on Friday, and it was Monday, before I heard any more of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to recollect this Particular, that it was on a Friday?</p>

               <p>Q. But this does not tell me, how you came to find her out?</p>
               <p>Ware. I did not find her out; I did not see her again, till I came to Guild-Hall ; I knew her as soon as I saw her, and she knew me. Mr Martin came to me, and asked me if I did not carry such a Fare.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you could know a Fare, that you carried last Friday?</p>
               <p>Ware . I cannot tell, whether I could or no, but I know this Woman; I might not take so much Notice of every Fare I carry.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think this Man (Bretter) could carry that Bundle of Things so far in a Quarter of an Hour; 'tis above half a Mile, and he is an older Man than you?</p>

               <p>Burgess Yerwood. The Prisoner came to my House, with two Sancepans to be tinned, and asked me, whether I would buy any Pots , Kettles, and Sauce-pans; she said, her Mistress sent her; I asked her, where she lived, and I would go and see them, she said her Mistress's Name was Martin , but that she would not let me see her; she brought them, and giving a very plausible Account of the Thing, (for I am as careful of buying stolen Goods, as any Body) I agreed to give her Fifteen Shillings for them; she said, she would go and tell her Mistress, and I gave her Fifteen Shillings; they were old Things, and I knocked them all to Pieces: - I cannot tell whether it was before, or after the Robbery: I cannot tell what Day of the Month it was. I think, it was on a Wednesday, that the Saucepans were tinned, and that she came on Thursday Morning, and then I weighed the Pots, &amp;c. and paid her for them.</p>

            . The Prisoner came to me on 12th of April, pretending that she came to see me; I asked her, how she came to know where I lived; she said, she came to enquire a Servant's Character for her Aunt, and so enquired after me; said I, Why don't you live with your Aunt ; she said, she would sooner live with a Stranger, than live with her; and, I did then ask her, whether she would come and live with me ; and she said she would, I hired her then, and she came the Day after: The Sunday following, she pretended she had a sore Throat, that was the 17th; I said, she might go to her Friends, and she staid till the 26th; and, on the 29th she robbed me. On Thursday Night, I went to Bed before my Husband came home; this Boy [He that was produced, but not examined] runs of Errands for us, and he went away about half an Hour after Nine ; and she desired me to go to Bed betimes, because I had had a hard Day's Work: Mr. Martin came home about Twelve o'Clock at Night, and she had laid down on the Side of the Bed by me; for I had a Servant died in the House, and , I am afraid to lie by my self. When my Husband came home, she said, she would get up very early, and wash the Kitchen before I got up, and it should be as white as a Curd; and desired if I should wake, that I would call her up at Four o'Clock; I said, it would be too soon to get up, after such a hard Day's Work.</p>

               <p>Q. What did she take from you?</p>
               <p>Mrs Martin. She took every Thing I had; I had not a Shift left, but what I had on: [She then mentioned the Things as in the Indictment; a China Tea-Pot , with a Silver Spout, &amp;c.]</p>
               <p>Q. Did you wake and call her?</p>
               <p>Mrs Martin . No, I did not?</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any of these Things to produce?</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174305190006"/>Q. Was she sober when she laid down by you?</p>
               <p>Mrs Martin. Yes, she was sober; I do not know whether she slept; I thought she was tired, and for that Reason I desired her to lie down on the Bed.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner's Council pleaded, that it could not amount to a Felony, because the Goods were put under the Prisoner's Care; but the Court were of a different Opinion.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence . As to the Kettle and Pot my Mistress sent me to sell them to Mr Yerwood. I carried two of the Saucepans home, and had 15 s. for what I sold, and paid 18 d. for tinning the two, and gave her 13 s. 6 d. to pay the Surgeon for curing her Hand. My Mistress harrasses me Night and Day, sending me about one trifling Errand or another; for she is either out of her Senses , or else has drank herself out of them. My Mistress sent me about to get a Nurse-Child for her;

            . On the 13th of April, I had an Information of the Prisoner's having robbed us, and was directed to go to one Madam Deson's Lodging, and there I found several Sorts of Silk which were mine; I went home to my Shop, seized the Prisoner, and charged him with the Robbery, (he has been Apprentice to Mr Swan, who is my Partner, three Years) at first he denied it, but afterwards owned it. He had got acquainted with this Woman, and he had hired a Coach, in Order to have gone to France with her, and he would certainly have gone that Evening. Some of these Goods were made up into Garments, and some of them have our own Mark upon them. There was a white Damask, and the Lustrings were made into Dresses, for Madam Deson's Use; and the black Velvet was made into a Waistcoat and Breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know these are your Goods?</p>
               <p>Buck . We have a very regular Method of entering them in a Number-Book , and keeping an Account of what is cut off each Piece, in order to know whether we are defrauded by our Servants or no; and there are particular Patterns which we know. I compared this Pattern with a Piece of Damask in our Shop, and found it to be part of that Piece, which appeared to be deficient by the Number-Book; and there were about forty Yards of Lustring deficient.</p>
               <p>Court . Sir, when you and your Partner are out, and any Person comes to buy any Lustring or Damask, has the Prisoner a Right to dispose of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Buck . We do allow a Right to our Servants to sell. I am very certain to fifteen Yards of Damask, and five Yards of black Velvet being cut off our Pieces; and I think, to the best of my Remembrance,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174305190007"/> there were our Marks on some of the Remnants. He owned before Colonel De Veil, that all these Things were our Property. I do not know whether it was through Madam Deson's Means that he did this, she was indicted but the Bill was thrown out. These are the Patterns of the Goods laid in the Indictment, which Mrs Gost gave me.</p>

               <p>Pillet. He was not an Acquaintance of mine, till about three Weeks before this; I have known Mr Brunet a great while.</p>
               <p>Counc. Do not you think this was a sudden Quarrel over Liquor?</p>
               <p>Pillet . It was a Quarrel: - I did not hear any bad Expressions made Use of.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bermier examined by an Interpreter, his Evidence was, That between Ten and Eleven o'Clock, he went into Pillet's House with Legier ; and there he found the Prisoners drinking; that at first coming in, Legier and Beaugrand spoke to one another in English, which he did not understand; and afterwards, that they spoke French, in a very civil, friendly Manner; that he asked them, whether they were French, and the Prisoner said they were born at Calais , in France; that talking about Sea-Affairs, Beaugrand , said, he was willing to go to Sea, but would not go in the Station of a Cook, because it was beneath a Sailor's Dignity; with that, Legier answered, that a Captain's Cook was inferior to a Sailor; but a Commodore's Cook, was preferable to a Sailor; with that, Beaugrand , gave him the Lye, and said, he was a lying Rascal, or some such Expression as that; and that the Sailor, (the Prisoner Beaugrand) took up a Pewter Pot, and attempted to strike the Cook (the Deceas'd) with it: Upon that, the Deceas'd took hold of him, and pulled him over the Table; laid him upon the Table, and took the Pot out of Beaugrand's Hand, and struck him several Blows over the Head, with the Side of the Pot.</p>
               <p>Counc. Could not Beaugrand have hit Legier with the Pot over the Table?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174305190009"/>Bermier . Yes, he could have hit him with it, if he had been very forward to do it.</p>
               <p>Counc . Why did not he do it then?</p>
               <p>Bermier . Because immediately as he made the Motion to strike him, Legier fell upon him, and drew him over the Table.</p>
               <p>Counc. Was Beangrand fitting or standing when he made the Motion?</p>
               <p>Bermier. He was fitting, before he made the Motion; but when he made the Motion, he stood up; and immediately Mr. Pillet endeavoured to part them, but could not; and then he went out to get a Watchman, and when he came in they were parted; and then, I said to Legier, Let us go home, is it possible that Frenchmen can fight so in a strange Country ; upon that, the Deceas'd asked for his Hat and Wig, and when I gave him his Wig to put on, the Uncle ( Brunet ) made a Motion, as if he was going to strike Legier, and, in the mean Time Beangrand came up, and gave him a Stab.</p>
               <p>Court . Ask him whether he saw any thing in Beaugrand's Hand, at the Time of his giving him the Thrust?</p>
               <p>Bermier . No, I did not, for if I had seen any thing in his Hand, I would have prevented the Mischief.</p>
               <p>Court . Ask him if he knows whether the Deceas'd had any Knife, when he came into the House?</p>
               <p>Bermier. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the Wound?</p>
               <p>Mr Bermier pointed to the left Side of the Belly near the Navel. - While he was putting his Wig on, I saw the Push made at him.</p>
               <p>Court. Ask him if he saw the Wound after the Man was dead?</p>
               <p>Bermier. No.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did he look upon Beaugrand's Head, to see what Condition it was in?</p>
               <p>Bermier. I saw several Blows given him upon the Head, but I did not see the Wounds: - I saw him bleed.</p>
               <p>

             , the Watchman. I was called to Mr. Pillet's House, between Twelve and One from my Stand; and when I came in, I saw the Deceas'd standing up against the Wall, supported by two Men.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Pillet one of the two Men?</p>
               <p>Rawlins. No, Pillet was standing by, with a Candle in his Hand; I asked the Deceas'd, if he could stand, and he shook his Head, for he could not speak; and in a few Minutes he dropped down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come to himself after he dropped down?</p>

               <p>Rawlins. No, he lifted up his Hand once. I saw a great deal of Blood come out from about his Navel, and run over the Waistband of his Breeches. and my Brother Watchman lifted up his Shirt, and there was one Wound.</p>
               <p>Q. What Sort of a Wound was it?</p>
               <p>Rawlins. It was a Sort of a pickedish Wound, and looked almost as if he had been blooded.</p>
               <p>Q. What, did it look like the Prick of a Launcet?</p>
               <p>Rawlins . Yes, I think so. I asked where the Man was that did it, and they said there were but two Men in the House, and it was one of them; and while I was talking, the Prisoners came rushing out in order to make their Escapes; the old Man (Brunet) came running out, and said he would kill him by God.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention any Name?</p>
               <p>Rawlins . He did not mention any Name. I turned about and said, Sir, you have killed him already; then they went into a neighbouring Yard, and I and another Watchman apprehended them; they had shut a Door against us, and I pushed hard against the Door, and the Latch flew open ; then I spoke to the Sailor, and said he must surrender, that he was my Prisoner , and he surrendered immediately. I was told the other was in the Bog-house; I went to the Bog-house and told him he was my Prisoner; he pulled out a Pair of Scissars, (they were taken out of his Pocket afterwards) but did not do any thing with them, he said he would kill all. We took them both to the Landlord's House, and I found this Sheath and Fork under the Table; there was a Knife that was bloody found the next Day in the Horse-pond belonging to the Prince of Wales's Yard. - The Deceased had three Wounds.</p>
               <p>The Coroner produced a Knife with a sharp pointed Blade, about eight or nine Inches long. This Knife was found next Day in the next Yard, which can be proved to be the Property of the Prisoner.</p>

               <p>Counc. If a Man had a sharp Knife in his Pocket, might it not run into his Body by Accident?</p>

             , Surgeon. I think on the 28th of April, between one and two in the Morning, I was sent for to the Assistance of the Deceased, to the Sign of the White-Bear in Newport-street; I found a Man sitting upon the Ground, supported by the Chimney-Piece; I examined his Pulse first, and found he was dead; after that, I inspected the Body and found three Wounds, one within an Inch of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174305190010"/> left Nipple, another within an Inch or two of the Cartilage of the Breast-Bone, about four Inches above the Navel; and the third between the fifth and sixth Rib on the left Side; the next Day I opened the Body, and found that the first Wound upon the Breast near the Nipple had penetrated to the Diaphragma; the second entered into the Liver and Vena Cava; and the third entered into the Cawl: It is my Opinion that the Wound given into the Liver was immediate Death; that into the Lungs might have proved mortal; the Consequence of the third Wound was dubious.</p>

             . I have not known Beaugrand long, but I have known the Uncle two or three Years; about six in the Morning I heard there was a Man killed; I went to the Round House and saw the two Prisoners handcuffed together, and Beaugrand had a Handkerchief about his Head; and there were five Wounds upon his Head, the Pot had made Marks like Horseshoes; one of the Wounds gaped so that you might put your Finger into it, he is not well of them yet. I have been in the Uncle's Company five hundred Times, and have been out of Town with him, and played at Cards with him frequently, and never saw him in a Passion. I never heard he was addicted to quarrelling, or any malicious Action.</p>

Mr. Rich said we should go through his House; this was agreed upon, but the Mob arose, and fell upon us with Stones, Brickbats, &amp;c. which they threw into the Shakespear's Head to such a Degree, that we expected to have been murdered; but Mr Rich was so good, as to let us, the Prisoner, and eight or ten Soldiers which came to our Assistance, into the Play-House, through his Ground, and there we were consined about an Hour, and durst not venture out all that Time, though we had the Soldiers with us.</p>

            . There was another Woman with her, and she asked for some Check for Aprons; and immediately Apple by came to me and informed me of this, and said he would show me where it is. No, said the other, stay and show me some Check. No, said I, I will not stay. So I left my Wife in the Shop, and went after the Prisoner and took her; they both of them asked for Check, and neither of them had a Farthing of Money in their Pockets. I have another Indictment of the same Nature; we are pester'd with these Creatures. <rs id="t17430519-12-verdict66" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Eliz Conran. Last Monday Morning, between 7 and 8 o'Clock, the Prisoner came to our Shop; says she, I was recommended to you to buy some Cambrick: I asked her what Price she would have it; she said, about 7 s. 6 d. a Yard; (she had a Basket with Butter and Eggs, I believe she <rs id="t17430519-13-deflabel71" type="occupation">sells Butter and Eggs</rs>

She desired I would show her some Lawn; I showed her some Long Lawn, and she said she would have a Handkerchief of it, and I apprehend, at the Time I turned my Rack to get the Lawn, (for I had left several Pieces of Cambrick on the Counter) that she took an Opportunity to take the Cambrick; I had a trembling came over me, suspecting she had taken something, I looked in the Woman's Face, and immediately she shifted her Elbow very much; I heard, as I thought, a piece of Cambrick rustle, said I, Mistress, I must ask your Pardon, but I believe you have got something of mine. She denied it, and gave me very unhandsome Language; I call'd, Adam , and got some Assistance; she had a red Cloak on, I turned it on one side, and saw the Cambrick under her Arm; I snatch'd at it twice, and at the second Pull I got it from her. (The Cambrick was produc'd, which was sworn to by Mr and Mrs Conran.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I took this Piece of Cambrick, and put it under my Arm, because I liked it better than any other, and never thought of stealing it; for the Minute she asked me whether I had a Piece of Cambrick of her's, I said, Yes.</p>
               <p>Mrs Conran. I had forgot one thing, if she had not put me in Mind of it; when she bid me measure the Lawn, she said she would not have it now, but would call again for it, and went to take her Basket up, and go out of the Shop.</p>

               <p>Prisoner . I know nothing of it. When I went to the Door, the Door was open, and a young Man was there chopping of Sticks; I asked him for Mrs Wild, he said she was not at Home, but if I would set down, he would call her. I went there about a Bed my Husband had bargained with her for, and had not fetched away according to the Time appointed, and I went to see whether she had disposed of it. I have sent for my Husband but he could not come.</p>
               <p>Deb. Wild . She was in my House once before, and never but once; she said she lived at Turnham-Green , but I do not know where she lives. The Man that goes for her Husband (but he is not her Husband) came to me and bargained for a Bed, but he never came for it.</p>

            . I live just by the Prisoner; I lodged some Time in her House in Cable Street. - I lived there on and off about three Years. - I lived there when these Things were stole, but they were not brought there.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you know what Month it was that these Goods were taken.</p>
               <p>Davis. I know no otherwise than by their being advertised the 17th of November last.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the Prisoner live then?</p>
               <p>Davis. She was not at Home at her own House then - She was not to my Knowledge, for I did not see her.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time was it you called there to see whether she was at Home or not?</p>
               <p>Davis. I was in and out every Day for a Dram. - Her Husband and her Mother kept the House.</p>
               <p>Q. For how long before this 17th of November might you be in and out every Day?</p>
               <p>Davis. I seldom missed a Day going in, since I lived there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Prisoner there on the 17th of November?</p>
               <p>Davis. She was not. - I cannot tell whether she was there on the 16th. I knew a Man that came to her House sometimes, and he said he sold these Things to a Jew in Rosemary-Lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Shields lodge in that House at that Time?</p>
               <p>Davis. I never was there all Night to see who lodged there. - I do not know he lodged there then, but he had lodged there.</p>

             . I know the Prisoner to have been at my House in November last, about the Middle of the Month. I am a Rope-Maker and work in Sun-Tavern-Fields; I am a Man that goes out in the Morning, and does not come home till Night. - My House is at Mile-End. She came for the Air, and was so very bad at my House, that she laid down eight Hours in a Day upon the Bed together. - She was at my House about three Weeks.</p>

               <p>Q. Cannot you tell what Day of the Month it was that she came to your House?</p>
               <p>Downes. To the best of my Knowledge it was the 15th or 16th - I think it was not the 17th - I can tell by the Club that I belong to, which is every third Monday in the Month, and she came a Week before that Time.</p>
               <p>Q. What Day of the Week did she come?</p>
               <p>Downes. To the best of my Knowledge it was on a Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the Sunday before, or the Sunday se'nnight before?</p>
               <p>Downes . It was the Sunday se'nnight before.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that?</p>
               <p>Downes . I cannot say to a Day, but what I have said I know to be true.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you out or at home when she came?</p>
               <p>Downes . I was at home when she came.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she ill all the Time she was at your House?</p>
               <p>Downes. She was ill all the while.</p>
               <p>Q. Now as she was three Weeks at your House, did not she when she was a little better go to Town.</p>
               <p>Downes . She never went out any farther than into the Yard.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that when you are at Work all Day?</p>
               <p>Downes . Sometimes I come home and lie down for an Hour or two, for we cannot make Ropes when the Sun shines; and sometimes we work till nine or ten o'Clock at Night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you work now till 9 or 10 o'Clock at Night?</p>
               <p>Downes . Yes. We begin at 8 o'Clock at Night, and work till 8 in the Morning, and sometimes we work all Day if we can hold it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if this be your way of working, how can you take upon you to say the Prisoner did not come to Town while you were out?</p>
               <p>Downes . Because where I left her I found her: - I look upon her to be a very honest Woman; I never heard any thing to the contrary.</p>

               <p>Q. Might it not be a Fortnight spent?</p>
               <p>Downes . No, I am sure it was not a Fortnight. - She was ill, and came for the Benefit of the Air , and staid, I believe, 18 or 20 Days.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she pay for it, or did you receive her as a Friend ?</p>

The Day before yesterday, a little after six in the Evening, I locked the Compting-House at the Mansion-House, that is now building for the Lord Mayors, (I belong to Mr Dance ) I left the Things mentioned in the Indictment in a Drawer in the Compting-House; when I went in the Morning I found the Door open, and the Drawer laid upon the Floor; I immediately missed the Things, and in the Afternoon one Draper told me that a Man had sold a Gold Ring to Mr. Wallis , at the Red Lion in Wentworth street, Spital-Fields ; I went there with Draper, and Mr. Wallis said he had bought a Pair of Gold Buttons, and had paid twenty Shillings for them, that his Wife had them, and he would not let me see them without paying him the 20 s. and I did pay him 20 s. for them - The Prisoner was then at Mr Wallis's House, and pulled a Pair of Silver Spurs out of his Pocket, and said that they were given him by one Martin ; he said he found the Buttons in the Minories , but when he came before Justice Peck , he said that Martin gave him both the Buttons and the Spurs.</p>

             . Yesterday Morning between nine and ten o'Clock, as I was standing at my Door, the Prisoner came by, and another Neighbour with him, he said Mr Wallis, See what a Find I have got to-day, I have found a Pair of Gold Buttons; and said, that when he picked them up, he would have sold them for a Shilling, but a Gentleman coming by said they were Gold; there was another Labourer with him who saw him pick them up; but I am apt to think he dropped them himself, and then pretended to find them. I asked him what he would do with them, he said he would sell them, and said they were worth a Guinea and an half; I said I would give him what a Silversmith would give for them; a Neighbour's Man weighed them, and they weighed 20 s. 9 d. and I gave him 20 s. and a Pot of Beer for them; he said he found the Buttons in the Minories, but that Martin gave him the Spurs.</p>
