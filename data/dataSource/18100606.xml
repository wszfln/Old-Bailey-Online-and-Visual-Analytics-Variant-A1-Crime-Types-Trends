He does; I shewed the prisoner some twine, I asked him eighteen shillings a dozen for them; he desired me to make out a bill of parcels in the name of Williams; I did: he purchased three dozen. He dropped his pocket book in our shop, my girl was gone out to get change of a pound note, when she returned she picked up the pocket book in the shop; she brought it to me; I said it belonged to that gentleman in the shop, I had seen it in his hand just before; the prisoner exclaimed, what a lucky thing it was that she picked it up, he had bills in it to a great amount, some hundreds, belonging to his captain and himself; he said he would reward the girl for picking it up; I told him there was no necessity for that: he asked me to change him a five pound note; I told him I was not certain whether I could; I took out my pocket book to see, I had not enough small notes to give him change for the five pound note; I had a ten pound note, it was the first note I took out of my pocket book; he asked me if I could give him change of a twenty pound note; I had the ten pound in my hand; he catched the ten pound note out of my hand very quick; he then went to the door in a very great hurry, and said, send your girl with me, my captain is waiting just above; he went away with the twine, saying, he would be back in a moment; my girl went with him; she did not return for several hours.</p>

Yes; I cannot tell what day it was; it was about February; I never saw him before.

On the 5th of February, 1760, I went into the Royal Navy, on board captain Lockhart Ross's ship, and was turned over to his Majesty's ship Namur, and was at the taking of the Havannah in August, 1762; and when I returned to England was turned over, and remained on board the Royal George; after that I went on board the Princess Amelia; and when the war began with America I was sent out with Lord Howe; I received a wound and was sent on shore at Dublin's Island. After that I was sent on board the ship commanded by captain Keith, and remained on board untill I was sent home, and then I was sent on board the ship commanded by sir Hyde Parker, and when I came to Spithead I was drafted on board the Agammemnon, and when that ship arrived at Plymouth I was paid off; but as long as I could stand under British colours I was willing to serve his Majesty; I went on board again when lord Hood took the command; I was on board the Barfleur, and the Victory, and after Touton was taken in 1793, I was sent home with a French man-of-war, and was then drafted into sir

               <p>Atkinson. I did not; I know nothing of the parties.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. When I was taken up for this note and brought before the magistrate at Worship-street the woman first said that I snatched the note out of her hand afterwards she said she gave it me; there is an attorney of the name of Davies that knows I was admitted to bail. I had the note from her, but not violently.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing her on the 16th of April last, and where was it - A. On Monday the 16th of April, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I was in St. John-street, the prisoner passed me, I spoke to her, she immediately crossed the way and went out of St. John's-street into St. John's lane, I followed her; she went down St. John's-lane, until she came into St. John's-street again; she went into Mr. Warwick's, the Hat and Mitre, in St. John-street; she had not been in the house above two or three minutes before I went in; I found the prisoner in the act of taking up some halfpence off the counter; I then asked Mrs. Warwick what the prisoner had to drink; the prisoner was standing by all the while, she told me that she had a glass of gin; I asked her how she paid for it; she told me with a sixpence; I asked Mrs. Warwick where that sixpence was; she told me that she had put it in the till, she should know it again, because she had no other there; on my looking at it I discovered it to be a bad one; I desired Mrs. Warwick, in the presence of the prisoner to mark it, so that at any time hereafter she might be able to speak to it; she marked it and gave it to me; I have had it ever since; this is the sixpence. I proceeded to search the prisoner; in her right hand pocket I found one counterfeit shilling, and two other counterfeit sixpences; I have had them ever since. In her left hand pocket I found two thimbles, some thread and tape in small quantities, and under her left arm pit, between her shift and gown, I found this paper containing six other counterfeit sixpences, and seven new halfpence; I have kept them by themselves ever since; these are them. I then took her in custody before the justice in Hatton Garden; she was committed.</p>

            . Q. You are an officer of Bow-street - A. I was; I am not now. In consequence of information from the last witness I went with him and Croker to a house in Charles-street, Drury-lane, in a back room on a ground floor; there were two women; the prisoner was one of them, she was sitting on a chair by the fire; I asked Callow which was the woman; he pointed to the prisoner; the other woman went out. I think Croker then asked her if she sold that man any silver, pointing to Callow; she made no reply; I asked her if she knew him; she said, oh, yes, he is my husband; Callow denied it; she had the appearance of a blue handkerchief in her hand, I asked her what she had got there, she gave me no answer; I attempted to take it from her, she resisted, and in the struggle a quantity of silver fell into her lap, and on the floor, which I took up, and Croker took the handkerchief from her; I picked up twelve counterfeit shillings, these are them; I searched the room, and in a cupboard I found this counterfeit dollar, and in a drawer in the room I found another counterfeit shilling, and a small piece of metal; she was taken into custody.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any shillings that Callow the last witness gave to you - A. Yes; two that he gave to me at the

            . On Sunday afternoon, the 13th of May, about half past three o'clock, I left my house; my wife and me and the child went out together to spend the evening, and left Mr. Dobbs and Mr. Lee in the house up stairs, in their own room; these young men had one key and we the other. I returned at half past eight in the evening, I found the door locked as usual; I took the key out of my pocket and opened the door with it.</p>
               <p>Q. You found nothing amiss with the lock - A. Nothing at all; it is a spring lock, there is no latch; the door was single locked. As soon as I opened the door I saw two men, they stood before me, close by the door.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not dark then - A. Not quite dark; it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181006060006"/>was so dark within doors that I could not tell who they were by their faces; they both of them instantly rushed out by me; I was alone; as they passed me they dropped a small dark lanthorn. This lanthorn gave me full reason to believe they were thieves.</p>
               <p>Q. What business do you carry on in your house - A. None at all. I am a porter to Miller, Berry and Co. King-street, Cheapside. I instantly cried out, stop thief; I kept them in sight, and ran after them as far as the top of Tabernacle-row, very near; they ran together; when they got near the top of Tabernacle-row the prisoner turned round and rushed back by me again; I turned round after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite positive that you kept them both in your sight till they both got to the top of Tabernacle-row - A. I kept them both in my sight. The prisoner rushed back by me again, the other got out of my sight, up the road; I turned round after the prisoner, I still cried out stop thief, and kept my eyes upon him all the while; after he passed me about twenty yards he was stopped by a gentleman, his name is Pearce, I got up to him, and, with assistance, took him to Worship-street; Armstrong searched him in my presence, and took out of his pocket a small bag containing thirteen picklock keys, a steel crow he took out of his pocket, also a small box, and a red leather pocket book; the prisoner said the pocket book was his own; he took from him a watch and some silver, I believe he returned him the silver. When the prisoner was secured I went home with Mr. Armstrong and others about nine o'clock. When I first ran after the prisoner the door was left open, on my way other office I returned to my house then with the prisoner and told the people that was the house where I lived, and where I had found the prisoner. I locked the door and took the prisoner to Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Q. After having secured the prisoner, when you came from the office you found the door locked as you had left it, did not you - A. Yes; I opened the door with my own key; Armstrong, my wife, and two or three more went in with me; we first went into the parlour, we saw on the floor, close by the door, a black canvas bag, Armstrong asked if the bag was ours.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that bag yours - A It was not. I never saw the bag before to my knowledge. Armstrong took out of the bag a tea caddie with some tea, and a silver shell in it, he also took out of it a shawl, six napkins, an ironing blanket, and a piece of wrapper about the same size.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any of these yours - A. Yes, all my property, they were in my house when I left it, about three in the afternoon; the tea caddie was on the dining table in the parlour, and the tea and the shell, the napkins were wrapped up in the ironing blanket, and the piece of wrapper was with it, they were in the closet in the parlour when we went out of the house We then went up stairs into my lodgers room, the lodgers were out, they lodged in the one pair of stairs; when we got into the room we found Mr. Dobbs's box, the ead of it was thrown open; we examined the lock, we found it had been broken open with a crow; Armstrong asked the lodgers names, I told him; he said very likely the pocket book had been taken out of that box. Lee and 
               <persName id="t18100606-5-person92">Dobbs</persName>
             both lodged in one room; we examined all over the house, we lost a silver tea spoon, and two plated spoons, but never recovered them.</p>

I found among the picklock keys that were taken from the prisoner, a piece of India rubber that had been in my box, and I missed a double bladed pen knife out of my box, and a key belonging to a tool box.</p>
               <p>ROBERT LEE. Q You are a mill-wright, are you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You lodged in the same room with Dobbs -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181006060007"/>A. Yes. On Sunday the 13th of May we went out about four o'clock, and returned together about ten o'clock; we went up stairs; I missed nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing this box of your companion Dobbs - A. I saw him lock it; I did not know the contents.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street office. On Sunday the 13th of May, about nine o'clock, I received charge of the prisoner from Mr. Davis, at the public house next door to the office; I said I would search him; he said Mr. Armstrong, I will give up all to you; I searched him, in his coat pocket was this bag, with the major part of these keys in it, one or two might be loose in his pocket, the India-rubber was loose in one of his pockets, and this crow in his waistcoat or coat pocket; this phosphorus, in his putting his hand, this came out, I picked it up, with one piece of match in it. One of these parts of the lanthorn was given me by some gentleman accompanying Mr. Davis.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at these two pieces of the dark lanthorn and tell me whether that was the lanthorn that fell at your door - A. The lanthorn dropped down in two pieces; I had not time to examine it. I believe this to be the same lanthorn, it fell in two pieces.</p>
               <p>Armstrong All that I found about the prisoner were the matches, keys, and phosphorus; I then searched his breast pocket of his coat, I found this red pocket hook, he at that time said it was his; I saw some papers in it, but no bank notes; there was in it a ticket of she mill wrights company, and a bill and receipt in Dobb's name; after I had found these things I locked the prisoner up, I went with the prosecutor, and a number of gentlemen accompanied me to his house, the door was unlocked, and in the parlour, just as I turned in, this bag laid on the floor, I opened it and turned these things out, which Mr. Davis said was his; here is the tea-caddie and the shall I went up stairs, and in a minute Bishop came to me; he was placed at the back of the house; I found a box wrenched open.</p>
               <p>Q. Would such an instrument as that crow wrench it open - A. Yes; the hasp appeared to have been forced out; Mr. Dobbs was not there. I took care of this pocket book, hearing his name was Dobbs, I have had it in my custody ever since. The next morning Mr. Dobbs appeared, he said he had lost pocket book; I then took Mr. Davis, Bishop, the prisoner, and one or two gentlemen that were there into the parlour at the side of the office; I had the prisoner stripped; I searched his clothes and could not find any thing; I got hold of his coat, I rubbed the collar, sleeves, and breast part, and at the lower part of the breast I heard some paper rattle; I pulled them out and it was eleven one pound bank notes, I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Davis. Look at these things - A. The caddie and silver shell is my husband's property, the shawl is my sisters, she left it at my house; I washed it; the napkins are my property; they were all in my house when I left it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Dobbs. Look at that pocket book, is it yours - A. It is my pocket book, I know it by my own hand-writing; the mill-wrights ticket and the letter addressed to me is there.</p>
               <p>Q. You say at least there were nine one pound notes in it, you believe more - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I leave it entirely to the mercy of the court.</p>

            , ESQ. Q. On the 18th of April last were you returning from London to your country house - A. I was riding on horseback, returning from London to Munden, in the parish of Hendon, between the four and five mile stone, between <placeName id="t18100606-6-crimeloc28">London</placeName>

               <p>Q. Do you know the person of the prisoner at the bar - A. I do; I had a view of his person distinctly; he took hold of the rein of the bridle with his left hand, holding the pistol in his right.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner on foot - A. Yes, and alone; he said give me your money, or I'll shoot you; I did not give him the money that time, in a little time he repeated, if you do not give me your money I'll shoot you; in a little time after I gave him my purse, with my money in it; there were thirty-three shillings in it, in sixpences, shillings, and five shilling pieces, a half crown piece, as stated in the indictment. I believe that was the exact sum, but as I had been in London I cannot say to a shilling or two; there was a remarkable sixpence among the money in the reign of king William, 1698, was the date; it being a sixpence that had not been worn, I carried it in my pocket three or four years. He then asked me for my pocket book, I did not deliver him my pocket book; he said, if you do not give me your pocket book I will shoot you, my pistol is well primed; I told him I thought there was enough in my purse to content him; then he said to me, is there much in it, to which I answered, I cannot tell, you can tell by the weight of it as well as I can; then he took his hand off my bridle, and we parted.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe which way the prisoner went A. I did; I went over just the rise of the hill that he might think I was gone home quietly; I met with a young man, I told him I had been robbed, I asked him if he would go back and help to take the footpad; we soon after saw Mr. Dixie, to whom I mentioned the circumstance, he very regularly joined me, and in a few minutes we had possession of the prisoner; he was searched, Mr. Dixie pulled the pistol out of his pocket, without any flint or any charge, and he also pulled my purse out of his pocket; I looked at my purse and saw my sixpence there; the purse and money was given to the patrol of Edgware.</p>
               <p>Q. There are other sixpences of the same date - A. No doubt about it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you overtook the prisoner was he walking - A. I saw him turn down a lane. I must in justice say of him, for a crime of this kind, I do not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181006060008"/>know how he could commit it with less offence.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM DIXIE. Q. In consequence of Mr. Parker communicating the circumstance to you, you returned with him and apprehended the prisoner - A. I did; Mr. Parker met me at the bottom of the hill, as far as what he speaks in my presence is perfectly correct.</p>

               <p>Q. to Mr. Parker. You were before the same magistrate - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that your purse - A. It is my purse; the sixpence corresponds with what I had; I have no doubt about it.</p>
               <p>Q. When he said he would shoot you, at that time did you suppose the pistol to be loaded - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Is Charlton field a field belonging to Mr. Morton - A. No, he bought some turnips there, and the sheep were there all hurdled round. On the evening of the 1st of March I counted them, there were two hundred and seventy; I went away from them about six o'clock when it was dark, they were all right when I left them. On the 2nd of March I let them out in the course of the day, counted them, and missed one; when I missed the sheep I looked round the hurdles, I saw one hurdle had been opened, and hard by that there was a gap in the edge, and the sheep had been drawed through there.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see any marks in the edge by the wool that the sheep had been drawed through there - A. Yes. I went to the other side of the edge, there was an appearance upon the ground, that I could see; it had been drawn plain about fifteen rods; it was loaded on a poney then and carried away; I tracked the feet of the poney up the field and down.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you alone when you tracked the feet of the poney - A. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you track the feet of the poney to - A. I tracked it about eighty rod that night, it was in the evening, I could not track it any more that night; I went home to my landlord, I told him that I had lost a sheep, and that it was carried away with a poney; I got some information from my landlord.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181006060009"/>Q.The second day how far did you track the poney - A. I had to go across the road and up a little meadow's; we tracked the poney close to the prisoner's garden.</p>
               <p>Q. You traced the poney quite back to the prisoner's house - A. Yes, where the prisoner lodged; the house belonged to Mr. Saunders.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know this poney - A. No, I was a stranger there, my master sent me there to look after the sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you traced this poney close up to the hedge as far as it could go - A. And the sheep was drawed over there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you suppose the poney to be unloaded did you see any marks there - A. I saw marks on the paling by Saunders's house.</p>
               <p>Q. I only want to know how far it is from where you saw the marks on the hedge to Saunders's house - A. About twenty rods, he could not go any further with the poney.</p>
               <p>Q. How far where the pales from the hedge - A. Close by.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw no marks on the other side of the hedge A. No, the poles were close by.</p>
               <p>Q. When you observed this what did you do - A. I went down and got a search warrant; and the constable went with me to Saunders's house; we searched the house.</p>
               <p>Q. This was the second day after you missed it, was it - A. Yes, Mr. Saunders was not at home, I saw the prisoner and his wife, they were at home when we searched; the prisoner is a taylor; upon searching the house we found all but the liver and the head; we have got the skin and wool here. The sheep was cut up into joints as well as he could cut it, and all hung up over the bed.</p>

               <p>Q. Was your father at home then - A. No, my father went from home on the Saturday before.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does your father live - A. At Upper Alliford Sunbury.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day was the sheep brought to your father's house - A. On Friday the 2nd of March; my father returned on the Tuesday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a mother alive - A. No, I have a sister, she is nine years old, there were only us two left in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of his bringing this sheep in your father's house - A. No, only I saw it in the back-kitchen on the Friday morning about five o'clock, the prisoner was just coming in at the back-door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the sheep dead - A. Yes, but the skin was not off; the prisoner asked me to help him up stairs with it; I did, and his wife helped it up too. When he got it up stairs he began skinning it; he asked me to help him, I helped him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you where he got it from - A. No, did not ask him. I thought it queer to see it in the house. He skinned it, and about three o'clock on the Friday afternoon he cut it into joints. At night I saw him pulling the wool off the skin.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him hang up the joints - A. Yes near about his bed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Recollect, you are going to take my life away. Was not part of the wool off the skin when you saw it in the house - A. It was not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. The wool been seen in that place, there were some sheep in the field adjoining to the house, they come backwards and forwards into a garden this lad turned them out - A. Some of Mr. Collin's did the week before, none of Mr. Morton's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This poney has been in these people's field; it was apt to break into gentlemen's fields which is well known to the neighbours all round.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.(to Saunders.) What poney was this - A. My father's poney, he would sometimes run into the fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this poney on the 2nd of May - A. In my father's stable. It was in the stable that morning when I got up at five o'clock.</p>
               <p>MR. ESSOM. I am a constable of Sunbury, I searched the prisoner's house on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what day of the month it was - A. Yes, the 3rd of March, I searched one room, and when I went to search another the prisoner ran away. I and another man went after him and brought him back. Then I searched the upper part of the house and in his bed-chamber I found very near the whole of the sheep cut up in joints in a very bad manner. We brought some of it down stairs, then we perceived there was something buried in the garden close to the back door and there we dug up the entrails, we found the skin at the top of the stairs in a bag, I took the bag with the wool and the skin in it home to my house; I have had it in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any trace of the owners name on the skin - A. The wool was all plucked off the skin and the skin was underneath the wool in the bag, the wool being plucked off we could not trace the owners mark. This is the skin it was wet then, it is dry now, and this is the wool.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Prosecutor) Look over the skin - A. I have done it before there was a mark on the wool provided that it had not been plucked off it was mark'd WL on the near side.</p>
               <p>Q. In the situation that you found the skin and the wool you could not discover any trace of that mark - A. No I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there several people in that neighbourhood that had sheep as well as you - A. Yes; not fat sheep, it was a very large sheep, I suppose it weighed thirteen stone, the neighbours flock of sheep were chiefly lambs.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not weigh the different joints of this sheep did you - A. No, it was a wether sheep and by the skin I could perceive it was a wether sheep.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I hope you will have a feeling for my wife and children. I am innocent of what I am brought here for as a child unborn. On the 29th of February as my wife was going home from Kingston to Alliford she saw a man standing close by the river with the carcase of a sheep, the head was missing, my wife having a horse and cart the gentleman told her she might take it home for her family, he told her it would be a pity for the sheep to lay there the tide would wash it away, the gentleman looked for the mark and finding no mark he told my wife he would help it into my cart which he did, my wife thanked him kindly, the gentleman told me I might take it without fear, I thought him to be my friend, the boy knows that I did not bring the sheep in, I was in bed.</p>
               <p>Witness. He brought it in his own self.</p>

            . On the 5th of February about seven o'clock I had a cart load of ds, I had delivered some, and what I had in the cart I was to bring home to the Axe Inn. I received the goods at Paddington they came up by the Canal. I had four packs of cotton in one bail, they were all safe when I left Mr. White's facing the bottom of Falcon-square, they were at the bottom of the cart covered over with a sheet.</p>

I missed one of these packs through some one calling out stop carman, you have lost a truss; I stopped the horse; I ran and took it from the prisoner myself and put it in the cart again; the patrol secured the prisoner, and some of the by standers, the prisoner was not above ten yards from the cart. He said it tumbled down from the cart and he had holloaed for the carman to stop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible that it could have dropped from the cart - A. It was impossible for it to have dropped, from the cart, it is a close bodied cart; there is a tail-board to it, it shuts up close, it lay at the bottom. The patrol secured the prisoner and brought him back to the Axe Inn, there was a constable sent for and he was charged.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that was one of the four packs that you had in the cart - A. Yes, I can swear to the wrapper, Sir

            . I am a patrol. On the 5th of February about seven o'clock or half-past seven in Silver-street I saw two men on the opposite side of the way, drawing something out of a cart driven by Watson. I went round the tail of the cart and seized hold of the prisoner, he had got the wrapper out of the cart, the other person ran off, I held him till somebody ran after the carman, Watson secured the wrapper and the goods and put it in his cart, as soon as I seized hold of the prisoner he holoaed Carman.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not holloa out Carman before you took hold of him - A. No, and when the Carman came up, he asked me whether I thought he looked like a person that would take such a thing out of a cart; the prisoner wanted me to let him go, he said he would not run away, I said he might depend upon it I would not let him go, I took him to the Axe, I ran and Mr. Holt sent for an officer and from there we took him to the Compter; the wrapper was delivered to Prestow the officer.</p>

               <p>ALEXANDER GOODYEAR. I am a paper-stainer. On the 19th of April I lived in Mr. East's house. On that morning about a quarter past three, it was moon-light, I was alarmed at the barking of a dog, and shortly after the alarm I heard a fowl squall out. I jumped out of bed, opened my window, and looked out. I saw the prisoner standing in Mr. East's garden. I asked him what he was about there; he made no answer. I called the watchman, the watchman came, and took the prisoner with the two fowls they appeared to have been recently killed. I knew the fowls, they were alive the evening before.</p>

A man ran against me; I was walking at the time, and at the same moment I felt my watch was gone. No violence was offered me at all, his running against me did not hurt me at all, it only drew off my attention; there were two or three others with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that you had your watch about you at the time that the man ran against you - A. Most certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish the person of the man who ran against you - A. I cannot identify him, it was dark, he was a man of that size and appearance, he was dressed in black.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon perceiving that your watch was gone what did you do - A. I ran after these men, all the three men ran, the other two put on the appearance as if pursuing him. I tried to lay hold of him, but he very soon disappeared. I called out watch, and stop thief. When he got to Temple-bar he took to the left hand side of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after that you saw any person in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181006060011"/>custody - A. A little more than a fortnight; this was on the 13th of March, and on the 18th of April I saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your watch ever found again - A. It was found the following day at the pawnbroker's, the chain was wanting. I have seen the watch key and seal again.</p>
               <p>Q.Now when you saw this man in custody, did you recollect this man to be one of the persons - A. It struck me very much; I cannot but believe that he is, but I do not speak positively to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the worth of your watch - A. It was a gold watch, I value it very little under twenty guineas; the chain was bought for four guineas, and the seal is worth a pound; it was marked with my initials, and the watch had my initials on it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do I understand you right that you felt the watch moving from your person, or did you only perceive that you had lost it after the man ran against you - A. I felt the motion of the watch as it was going from me, and in a violent manner.</p>

            . I live at Mr. Barker, 115, Houndsditch. On the 31st of March about, twelve o'clock in the day, the prisoner pawned a gold watch with me; it had a gold seal and gold key to it. I advanced 8 l. on it. On Tuesday the 17th of April he came to our house with another man to look at the watch, he did not say for what purpose, he produced the duplicate of this gold watch that he had pawned. I recollect him to be the very man to whom I had advanced money upon the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you at that time heard of the watch been a stolen watch - A. Yes; on the same day that I took it in, about four o'clock in the afternoon, a bill came from Bow-street describing the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop him or cause him to be stopped then - A. I pretended to be looking for the watch while I sent for an officer; when the officer came the prisoner ran off.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the prisoner ran off had you told him that you suspected him to be the person that stole the watch A. No. I told him nothing at all about it; he got off and the next evening I saw him in custody at Bow-street, I knew him directly. When he first came in with the watch he brought a gold chain, he wanted to know the weight of it; the chain at that time was not attached to the watch. I weighed the chain for him, it weighed an ounce and five pennyweight, it was worth about 3 l. 10 s.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. I apprehended the prisoner in a public-house at the bottom of Bow-street, he had been taken upon another charge and got away. I asked him what he had done with the chain that he had stolen with the watch, he said he never saw any chain. I said, where did you get the watch that you pawned in Houndsditch. He said, he had it of a man of the name of Smith, who lived at No 14, Charles-street Black-friars-road. I told him I would be obliged to him to let me know where the chain was because it would be proved that he produced the chain at the time that he pawned the watch. He said he could not tell me where it was. When I first apprehended the prisoner, I said, oh, master Braham, is it you? I have been looking for you a good while for a watch that you stole in Fleet-street. He said, I know nothing of a watch. I went to No. 14 Charles-street, no such person as Smith lived there as I could find.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am entirely innocent of the charge that I am accused of; I have dealt in watches, and I have pledged watches; the gentleman must be mistaken in the man. Mr. Morris can come forward to say that I have pledgded watches at his shop.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I have pledged to the amount of an hundred pounds of watches at his shop and, Mr. Morris never knew any harm in my character - A. In all probability he has been at my shop I have some knowledge of his face; I have seen him before, upon particularly what I cannot say, it may be watches; I have taken things in pawn of him, but what I cannot say.</p>

            . On the 17th of April, about eight in the evening, I was standing at my own door; it was just dusk. I had information that the officer was waiting for a person that had robbed the shop. I saw the prisoner cross the way with the jean under his arm; the prisoner was coming from Mr. Sorel's shop nearly across to ours; the officer met him in the middle of the street and stopped him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him at any time in Mr. Sorel's shop, did you - A.I did not; the officer attempted to take him; the prisoner struck at him twice or three times; after he struck at him he dropped the property and ran off; the officer picked up the jean. I pursued the prisoner, the prisoner was never out of my sight till he was secured, there was a board in the jean when he struck at the officer.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was coming through Bishopgate-street on the 17th of April, a little after eight o'clock. I saw three or four suspicious characters. I saw the prisoner Davis, and another, go to Mr. Sorel's shop, the lower part of the window is board instead of glass; they stood a tiptoe and looked over the blank window into the shop. I watched the prisoner, and crossed over the way, being by myself, and spoke to Mr. Hughes's porter, and while I was speaking I saw the prisoner coming towards me with this jean in his arms; I stopped him and said, what have you got here? he said, you b - r, I'll let you know, and then hit at me. made a hit at him with my truncheon; he hit me again and I dropped on my knee; I made a catch at his waistcoat, the buttons broke, he got away; on his seeing Mr. Hughes coming he dropped the goods and set off; Mr. Hughes got hold of him, and then I got up to him and secured him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body in Mr. Sorel's shop at that time. - A. I was not positive what shop it was taken out, after I had secured the prisoner I went to a linen draper's shop. I asked them if it was their property, they said, No; Mr. Sorel's shop was shut up. I went there the next morning, they said they had lost the property.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. This was about eight o'clock the man stopped him, how lately before had you seen it. - A. I had not seen it since the morning; the person to whom it was sold lived in Henrietta-street, Cavendish-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body at home in your shop at this time. - A. There were two men, they are neither of them here; the jean is worth thirty shillings.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 28th of May a little after seven o'clock, I was passing down Ludgate-hill, in company with Hardy, I observed the prisoner whom I knew to be a suspicious character go into Mr. Laming's shop. I set Hardy upon the watch, I sent for assistance, I did not see the assistance I expected on Ludgate Hill. I returned and saw the prisoner within three or four doors of Mr. Laming's, towards Fleet-market; she was alone walking very brisk, she went down Fleet-market, and then I stopped her; I asked her what she had got in her apron; she made no answer but instantly gave it me out of her apron, this is the piece, I told her I knew where it came from, I took her back to Mr. Laming's.</p>
               <p>Q Was the linen claimed by Laming's people - A. Yes, instantly as I took her in the shop; I have had the linen ever since in my possession.</p>
               <p>- HARDY. I was on the opposite side of the way and saw the prisoner go into Mr. Laming's shop, I saw her go in twice she came to the door and went in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181006060013"/>again; when she came out I followed her with Lee, she turned up a court, two other persons were with her, they all three went up the pawnbroker's court, a woman that was with her gave the property to her at the pawnbroker's door in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons had been in the shop besides this woman - A. Two others, the prisoner came out first, the two others came out in about two minutes afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they all go up the pawnbroker's passage - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Lee join you at the time - A. He joined me coming up the hill; I accompanied Lee till he stopped the woman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked it up in the pawnbroker's court, I was never in the shop so help me God, in Fleet-market the gentleman came up to me, I said, if it is your's take it, nobody gave it me; I picked it up and saw no owner to it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q.to Hardy. Did you see the woman come out of the shop - A. I saw the other woman take it out of her apron and deliver it to the prisoner.</p>

On the next morning I was on the watch about six o'clock, I saw the prisoner on my premises, in consequence of that lead being missed that I had marked the night before, I took one of the men into custody, and in consequence of what he said I took this man into custody; I sent for an officer between six and seven o'clock and charged him with the theft. The officer enquired of him whether he had any property of mine or my partner's; he said he had not, we then went to his apartments, No. 11, King's-head-court, Shoreditch, there we found six bars of solder laying in a chair in the parlour and six bars more in a cupboard concealed in the same room; we then returned and brought the prisoner to his room, Armstrong then produced the solder. We had cast the solder a few days before and not sold any, I knew the solder to be mine, this is the mould that made the impression in the sand to cast it in. This is the lead that we found under his own chest in our own workshop.</p>

               <p>Q. Did that stranger come home with you - A. No, only Mrs. Lyons came home with me; the prisoner was at home, I think I found him in the back parlour on the sofa; I believe Kelley was in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you came home did you go to bed. - A. In about three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there nobody else in the house - A. Yes, Mrs. Lyons slept in the house, I believe she went to bed at the same time; she is a widow, and often visited me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body come in the house at that time when you and Mrs. Lyons came home - A. No, only Mrs. Lyons came home with me in the coach; and nobody was in the parlour but him.</p>
               <p>Q. But there was somebody in the house besides him. - A.Just for a few moments, but I never left him, a person that came home in the coach with me.</p>
               <p>Q. You said nobody came home in the coach with you - A. Yes, I did not think proper to mention it.</p>
               <p>Q. I took it down from your mouth, that only Mrs. Lyons came home in the coach with you - A. Nobody but her and a gentleman, he came home with me and went in the front parlour; he did not stay above ten minutes, he never went into the back parlour; I beg your pardon, Mrs. Lyons can tell better than me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that man an acquaintance of yours - A, No, he came home with me from dancing at the ball; when he was gone I went to bed. I got up in the morning about eleven o'clock, I went into the back parlour, the prisoner was not in the house; then I went to the drawer to put my trinkets away; I took hold of the box, when I used to take hold of the box the guineas used to rattle, and then it did not; I said to Mrs. Lyons, Oh my goodness, the guineas are not in the box; I searched and found the bank notes and money was gone. I mentioned my loss to Kelley and sent him to the prisoner; he sent word he would come in a quarter of an hour; he did not return. I went to his master's house; I told him he had taken my money, and asked him to give it me; he said, he knew nothing at all about it. I went to Bow-street, got a warrant, and took him up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There were two men came home with her, one stopped and slept with her.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. There were two men came home with me in the coach, one never came in the house.</p>
               <p>Court. When you come here to swear upon that oath you have taken, whatever is the consequence to your private character, do not swear that which is false; the prisoner desires me to put this question to you, whether one of these men did come home and sleep with you - A. He remained with me a little time in my bed room; he did not sleep with me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have a witness here to prove that he did sleep with you. You asked me to come and sleep with you; I am telling the truth; did not you say in the coach, by God, Harry, if you do not come back and sleep with me, I never will speak to you any more - A. Upon my oath I said to take care of the house; I never asked him to sleep with me in my life.</p>
               <p>RACHAIL LYONS. I am a widow woman, I live with my relations; I have a small pittance of my own; I was in the habit of calling on Mrs. Martin. On the 19th of May, the prisoner was at Mrs. Martin's when I came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when Mrs. Martin desired him to stay in the house that night - A. Yes, she pressed him very much to come and stay in the house with Kelley. I went home to fetch some clean things to dress myself; I went down in the kitchen to put my clean things on; he was in the back parlour with her all the time Mrs. Martin was dressing; and by the time I was ready he went and fetched a coach, then we all three went to the top of St. James's-street; I and Mrs. Martin went to the ball. We returned about half past five in the morning; two gentlemen came with us in the coach, one was an Irish gentleman that lodged at the hummums, I do not know who the other was.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got home did these two gentleman go into the house - A. Yes, both went into the house, one went into the front parlour, and the other went into the back parlour. Mrs. Martin went into the parlour with the Irish gentleman, the other went away; the Irish gentleman staid almost till twelve at noon; he wrote a note for the man to go to the hummums to fetch his clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to this back parlour door, did you lock it when you went out. - A. No, I locked it in the morning when I went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned you found Molloy there - A. Yes, he was in the habit of being there a great deal; when I saw him in the morning, he was coming out of the back parlour, going home.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that this gentleman went into the back parlour, and was for some time with Mrs. Martin, and by his staying till twelve o'clock at noon, I suppose that he went to her bed room and slept with her - A. Certainly.</p>

             - A. My wife. I have done business for Mrs. Martin for five years. On the 19th of May, the prisoner returned soon after Mrs. Martin had set him off; about twelve o'clock he went into the back parlour, and there he staid till Mrs. Martin came home. I went several times into the back parlour to attend the fire; the prisoner was all the time laying on the sofa, sometimes asleep and sometimes awake. I only went into the room to make up the fire, and came back again directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your wife go into the back parlour - A. No, my wife came to me between ten and eleven o'clock, and asked me when I was coming home: she staid half an hour and went away. When Mrs. Martin and Lyons came home two gentlemen came with them, they both went into the front parlour when I saw them, and then I went down stair. One of them went up stairs with Mrs. Martin, and went away about twelve o'clock at noon.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the evening of the 19th of May I called on Mrs. Martin, she asked me to give her some brandy; I told her I had no money; she gave me half a crown to get some, and then she gave me a shilling. I fetched the brandy; she asked me to stop, I told her I was afraid of losing my situation. I got a coach for her; she said, by God, Harry you shall sleep with me to night; I told her I would come let my situation be what it would. I had been five years about her house, and almost every day there. I laid on the sofa till five o'clock; when she and Mrs. Lyons came home I went down in the kitchen, and when Mrs. Lyons came down she asked me to come to dinner; I said, no, I would call in the evening,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181006060015"/>I went home my master was getting up he told me to go to Mr. Obee's, the boot maker; when I returned Mrs. Martin came she said, you have robbed me, give me the seventy-five pounds; I told her I did not know what she meaned, and after that the officer came and took me to prison.</p>

               <p>Q. What was she a girl of the town - A. Yes, I had known her for fourteen years. I am not a married man. I was speaking to her; the prisoner was unknown to me at that time. A person unknown to me came and knocked me down; the night was dark and rainy. The person that knocked me down came rather behind me; I did not see him; I was stunned immediately; I was cut on the nose; it disfigured me; I should think it was done with some instrument; I was stunned and fell. I did not recollect any thing afterwards till the next morning, I then saw my pockets were turned out. It was Christmas day, I was rather in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was knocked down what became of you. - A. I was led to a house in Titchfield-street by persons more than one, as I was told the next morning, I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that you were robbed - A. I know from the loss of what I missed; before I spoke to this woman I had a one pound note and a gold ring in my pocket, and a silk handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Q. You know Mr. Dukes do you - A. Yes, I have known him fourteen years. On the 25th of December Mr. Dukes met me in the Haymarket, about half after eleven at night; I was in Tichbone-street with another young man. I met Mr. Dukes by a wine vaults; I do not recollect whether I asked him, or he me, to go in to have something to drink; the young man, me, and Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181006060016"/>Dukes, went into the wine vaults; Mr. Dukes could not pay for the liquor, he had not got any thing less than a one pound note, he pulled the one pound note out; the young man paid for the liquor, it came to sixpence; we came out and stood talking a little while, then Mr. Dukes and me took a walk down to Coventry court together, and as we went down the Haymarket, at the corner of Coventry-court, I saw no person near but the prisoner; I have known the prisoner three or four years, he is a butcher by trade, and at the corner of Coventry-court the prisoner knocked Mr. Dukes down without saying a word; Mr. Dukes fell, I cannot tell what part he struck him his back was towards the prisoner; when he knocked him down I did not observe any thing in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mr. Dukes was struck down did he continue on the ground - A. He fell on his face; immediately as he fell I went to assist him, and screamed out; I stooped to pick him up, there was some instrument came and cut me across my right eye, I fell with the cut; the watchman or patrole took me into No. 12, Coventry-court. I do not know nothing further from the loss of blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you so stunned by receiving this cut, that you did not know what passed afterwards - A. Yes, this shawl that I have on was covered with blood; I cannot swear that the prisoner cut me, but I can swear that the prisoner knocked down Mr. Dukes, but I could not swear that he robbed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you brought any of the people at whose house you were carried in Coventry-court - A. No, I did not know there was any occasion, I thought if it was necessary, Mr. Bly would do it.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he in your company in Mr. Manton's house - A. Yes, on the 7th of May, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you two left in possession of the house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What past at that time - A. He asked me if I was going to bed, I told him I was not going to bed till the washerwomen came.</p>
               <p>Q. What, the washerwomen were coming were they - A. Yes; the prisoner said if I did sit up for them I should sit without fire; then he began to put the fire out with the poker, and it became too hot for him; he says, d - n you, if I cannot put you out I'll quench you out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did he say so the fire - A. Yes. I then went towards the kitchen door, he pulled me back again; the gate bell rang for the washerwomen, he went to the gate using all the bad language he could, and he returned using bad language, the same as before, and did not let the women in; I them went towards the door to let them in myself, he gave me a blow on my right breast, and sent me back again, and insisted upon me not letting them in; I then went and unbarred one of the kitchen windows, I said to the women, for God's sake do not go, if you do I shall be killed. The women I had not let in, they were in the front court; the prisoner then barred the window again, and then I went and let the women in. When I went out there was a fire, and when I came in there was no candle; I bid the women stand still; I went up stairs into my own sleeping room and truck a light; I came down again; he put that candle out; I went up the second time and struck another light, and left one burning in my own room, and brought the tinder box and one light in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you lock the door of your room - A. I did, and brought the key of my door down; he put the second light out I had brought down; I struck a light the third time, he attempted to put that light out; with great difficulty we kept the third in; he then gave me several blows, and insisted upon my going up stairs; he pulled me up one stair, and I resisted him; he kept using very bad language, and insisted upon the women going home, and my going up stairs.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. Where were the women all this time - A. In the kitchen. He then found that he could not get the better of none of us, he fetched three large doors out of the yard, he came into the kitchen with them, and one of the women went out for assistance; there was one of the woman left with me in the kitchen; he then threw me down, gave me several blows upon my arms and different parts of my body, he said, if that d - d old bitch is gone out she shall keep out; he then went out to bolt the woman out that was gone for assistance, and while the prisoner was bolting her out I concealed myself in an out house.</p>
               <p>Q.Could you see the house from the out-house - A. No; I saw the house as I was going through the court, and while I was in the fore-court I saw the prisoner in the closet, in my sleeping room; when I saw him come out of the closet I went to let in the woman that went for assistance; I let in the woman and

            .</p>
               <p>COURT. When you saw him in the closet in your room I suppose he had a candle - A. Yes, he had two candles, one he had with him in the closet, and one I left in my room; I could see all over the room, there were no curtains; I stood in the front court until I saw him come out.</p>
               <p>Q. What was there usually kept in that closet - A. Powder and arms.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he in that closet - A. For the space of three minutes; and when I saw him come out of the closet I let the woman and Darvill in; I said, for God's sake make haste, we shall have the house burned, or else we shall all be shot, the gardener has gone into my master's powder closet.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. Did you return with Darvill and the woman towards the kitchen - A. Yes, and on our entering the kitchen he said, d - n my eyes if I do not shoot the first man that enters: Darvill went up to him and laid his right hand on his left shoulder; Darvill lowered the pistol with his left hand, the prisoner instantly pulled both the triggers, (it was a double barrelled pistol) and lodged three slugs in my foot; I have never been able to do my work since. This is the pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. When Darvill went towards the prisoner in what direction was the prisoner pointing the pistol - A. The prisoner was sitting in a chair when Darvill went up to him, he was holding the pistol in this position; the pistol was pointed exactly to my middle at the time that I went into the room.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then the pistol was pointed towards you was it - A. Yes, it was pointed towards me; Darvill lowered it; the prisoner instantly pulled both the triggers, it went off and lodged three slugs in my foot; one ball grazed my ankle bone and the other my toes the prisoner refused to give the pistol up after he had fired it off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. Did you afterwards see the door of your bed room - A. Yes; it had been broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the key of the closet where the arms were kept in your bed room - A. Yes; it by over the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Then for the purpose at coming at the pistols, he must have broken open your door - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The moment the pistol went off, was as Darvill had hold of the barrel, lowering it - A. Yes, his hand laid to, lowering it, and the prisoner's fingers were in the triggers.</p>
               <p>Q.When you speak of his pulling both the triggers you cannot tell whether it was lowering it that moved the triggers - A.He only put his hand so on the barrel.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you see the prisoner's fingers move - A. Yes. I am sure Darvill's fingers were not on the triggers.</p>
               <p>Q.But did you see his fingers move - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you suppose his fingers moved when the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181006060018"/>pistol went off - A. Yes. Darvill did no more than lay his hand on the barrel and lowered it, or else I must have been shot dead.</p>
               <p>Q. That is, supposing the trigger had been pulled, if he had not laid his hand on the barrel you must have been killed - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. He was angry about the washerwomen coming so late that night - do not suppose that I say he was right - A. Yes; he said because they came so late he would not let them in, and they should not come in.</p>
               <p>Q. And then when one of them went out afterwards he said no man should come in the house - A. He said he would shoot the first man that came in and Darvill was the only man that did come in then; I let him in.</p>
               <p>Q. After the pistol went off did he say it was done by accident, or what did he say - A. I said, see what you have done; yes, he said, I have done it now, those were the words; I said, look, you have made me a fine foot, he said, d - n your foot; when the surgeon came he said, I am the boy that done it.</p>
               <p>COURT. What was your situation in the family - A. Cook.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been acquainted with the prisoner - A. Ever since the 19th of December, that is the time I came into Mr. Manton's service.</p>
               <p>Q. And what was this day of the month - A. The 7th of May when it was done.</p>
               <p>Q. You had lived together in the same house had not you, you the cook, and he the gardener - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you had any disputes together - A. No further than other servants do, trifling affairs, and not before this night any particular dispute; we had been good fellow servants together till this night.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had no reason to suppose that he owed you any gradge or malice - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You owed him no ill will, nor he owed you no ill will - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he at any time taken any liberty with you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And he did not, as I understand from you wish to take any liberty with you - A. Yes, he wished to pull me up stairs and send the women home again.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer's labourer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live on Harrow-hill - A. No; I was at work there. On the night of the 7th of May I was fetched to Mr. Manton's house on the night the accident happened. On the next morning he said, that he had shot the cook; I told him it was a very bad affair; he made me answer that he could not get her to his terms; he said no more.</p>

            , the washerwoman; came and called me up out of bed; I went to Mr. Manton's house, and when I came to the door the prisoner swore he would shoot the first man that, entered the door; I got about half across the kitchen, I said, John, if you shoot the first man that enters the kitchen, you must shoot me, for I am the first man that enters the kitchen; he swore he would be d - d if he would not; I seized him by the collar with my right hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you stand with respect to him - A. By the side of him; I clapped my left hand on the pistol and lowered it down.</p>
               <p>Q. Now at that time that you put your hand on the pistol and lowered it down, did it appear to you that he was pointing it at any person - A. Yes, it was directed to the cook, much about her middle. After I lowered the pistol it went off immediately; he shot the young woman in the foot, and the young woman said, for God's sake hold that fellow fast, do not let him go, while some assistance comes; he said, there I have let it off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Upon your lowering the pistol it was pointed quite downwards - A. Much about so.</p>
               <p>Q. The young woman was coming on in the room - A. Yes, by the side of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner standing or sitting - A. Sitting.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he point the pistol at all to you when he said he would shoot the first man that came in - A. No, it was merely as I tell you; he did not alter the pistol at all until I pointed it down.</p>
               <p>COURT. Before you had bore it down as I understood from you it was levelled at the cook - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. And you say, until you bore it down, he had not altered the direction at all - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who entered the kitchen first, you or the cook - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And she followed you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And you tell me he did not at all alter the direction of the pistol from what it was at first - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he did not alter the pistol to point it at her, but she came by the side of you - A. By the side of me.</p>
               <p>COURT. I understood you to say when you and she went into the room the pistol was directed to her - was it directed to you or to her - A. Directed to her.</p>
               <p>Q. You say she was on the side of you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. When you entered the kitchen you entered before her, then she was behind you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then do you mean that when you entered the kitchen that he must have shot you first if he meaned to shoot her - A. I entered the kitchen first, and when I got up she stood at the side of me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. And you have told me from the time that you entered the kitchen he did not alter the position of the pistol - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore by her not remaining behind you but coming of oneside of you, she came in the front of the pistol - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And at that time you clapped your hand on the pistol to lower it, and then it went off instantly - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. To whom was the pistol pointed at when you first went in the kitchen - A. It was pointed rather across the kitchen, in a direction towards the persons that entered the door.</p>
               <p>Q. And if you had not lowered the pistol would it not have shot the woman in the body - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. If it had gone off - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether it would have gone off if you had not lowered it is more than you can swear - A. Yes; I cannot swear that.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 9th of April, 1809, were you at the London coffee-house - A. I was; I arrived there on the morning of the 9th of April; I brought with me a portmanteau.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the number of the room to which you were shewn - A. I do not exactly remember the number; it was at the top of the house; my portmanteau was put into that room that I engaged; I had in that portmanteau a pocket book, and some articles of linen. I did not sleep in the coffee-house that night. On the 10th, the next day, I called at the London coffee-house, about two o'clock, I found my portmanteau was cut, and missed two shirts, three neckcloths, a waistcoat, two pocket handkerchiefs, a pair of stockings, and my pocket book; I mentioned it to the people of the house that I had lost these things out of my portmanteau; a strap that went round the portmanteau was cut at one end, so that it was completely open. This was on Monday the 10th. On Tuesday week the 18th of April, I received that letter by the post.</p>

               <p>"London, 19th of April, 1809.</p>
               <p>SIR, Your pocket book has fell into the hands of a young man whose ungovernable passion, and cursed insatuation for the gaming table has led him into an act the most disgraceful; and the property I took from your trunk at the London coffee-house furnished me with a guinea at a moment I was destitute; again I took to the gaming table and have been fortunate; this morning an opportunity offered for my going abroad with the prospect of doing good. Your linen is gone, and it is out of the question. Is your pocket book of any value to you? I offer it to you on the following terms; I require twenty-five pounds. Twenty-five pounds is a large sum to give away, possibly you will have to return at no distant period. Insert to me in the Morning Chronicle Newspaper the following, should you be disposed to give this sum; - E. P. R. agrees to the propoposition contained in G. B's communication. This I shall look for, and do not delay."</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed to prosecutor. This is a long time since this happened - A. It is above a year.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know whether you in point of fact packed up your own clothes yourself, or left it for your servant - A. I am pretty sure I packed them up myself. I am certain I lost my things out of my portmanteau; I saw the pocket book in the portmanteau, and the linen also when I was in London. I arrived by the mail coach at the London coffee-house; I shifted myself at the London coffee-house, and saw them there; I do not know the number of the room I had there, it was between No. 60 and 70. I received that letter at Margate; I marked it.</p>

He spoke loud enough that any one in No. 66 might hear him. On the next day Mr. Pilcher returned to the house, he complained to me that his portmanteau had been cut.</p>

               <p>Q. You were stationed there and a letter was put in there with twenty-five pound in notes - A. I was stationed there; this pocket book was brought there by a porter, and given to Mr. Pilcher in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time you did not succeed in apprehending the prisoner - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 4th of April last did you by accident meet him - A. I did, in St. Paul's church-yard; Bishop, the officer, was with me; he went up and and asked him if his name was not Furlonger, he said it was; upon that I accosted him; I told him that I had a question to put to him relative to some business at the London coffee-house, and whether he would have any objection to go there to have some questions put to him; his answer was, certainly not; he was desirous to know what we wanted of him. When he came to that part of St. Paul's church yard where there is a turning into Pater-noster-row, he sprang from us and ran as fast as possible for a man to run; I cried out stop thief; he was stopped. I put him into a house and went to Mr. Leech.</p>
               <p>DANIEL BISHOP. I am an officer. While the prisoner was in my custody in St. Paul's churchyard I told him he was charged with a felony at the London coffee house, and for writing a number of letters; he acknowledged writing the letters; he said, distress, and misfortunes of his family drove him to it; I then shewed him a letter, which I have in my hand; he said he wrote a number of letters; I said, did you write this; he said, yes.</p>

On the 21st of May, between four and five in the afternoon, I was in Leadenhall-street; Mr. Hutton informed me that he had seen the captain's pocket picked, he pointed out the two men; they turned down a small court, I lost sight of them.

I assisted the officer in conveying him to the compter, and on examining his contents of the pocketbook it was found to contain ten one pound notes, a cr party on the ship Ockham, commanded by captain Schutt. I saw captain Schutt that day in Bishopgate-street; he claimed his pocket book in the presence of Carney; Carney said he picked the pocket book up.</p>

               <p>JOHN HARDY. I am an officer. As I was walking up Bishopgate-street, on the 21st of May, about half past four in the afternoon, I saw a number of people run, I joined in the pursuit; Carney was stopped just by Bishopgate church; Emanuel made down Houndsditch; I pursued Emanuel, I collared him a few doors lower than the Quakers meeting, in Houndsditch. Emanuel said he knew nothing of the other man; sometime after the pocket book was found, the captain came and owned it. I searched Emanuel and found nothing at all on him.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Hutton. Is that the pocket book that you saw taken from the captain - A. Yes. When we got to the compter the captain told what was in the book, I examined it and found it was so.</p>
               <p>Carney's Defence. I was passing down Bishopgate-street, I picked up a pocket book; whether any body saw me I do not know. As for stealing it from the pocket of a gentleman I did not, and what was in it I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Emanuel's Defence. I know nothing at all of it, I am innocent of the affair. I know nothing of Carney, he cannot say any thing of me. I was walking up Houndsditch, I heard somebody call out stop thief; I ran as well as others; that gentleman came and took hold of me, and let me go, then he came after me and took me.</p>

             the surgeon that attended him, he told me he had not a doubt but that blow on his head was the cause of his death. The wound on his head appeared to me to have been done with a blunt instrument; I searched the room, I found this mallet, on examining the mallet I found several marks of blood. I found the mallet under some matting, the prisoner was in the room, I asked her what the use of that mallet was; she said, they used it in platting their work. They were door matt makers.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner any relation to the deceased - A. I believe the prisoner was wife to the brother of the deceased, but cohabited with the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner about the death of the deceased - A. She said she knew nothing of the death of the deceased, nor how the blood came on the mallet; she told me he came home on Friday night, the 30th of March, very much intoxicated, he quarrelled with her and threw her down stairs; she went up a second and third time; after that there was a candle lit by his desire; they had a scuffle again; he pulled the lighted candle out of the candlestick, and thrust it into his eye, which very much burned his left eye.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he tell you what happened in consequence of those words - A. No; he was almost past speaking when I went.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand from him that in consequence of these words that she threw the mallet at him - A. I should think so.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if I understand you right, you understood they had a quarrel together; they had many words, she threw the mallet at him in consequence of that - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many children had they - A. Two; they have had five. I have known them twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q.Had they lived well together and orderly - A. They lived very unhappy, they frequently quarrelled and fell out.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that blows passed from one to the other - A.Sometimes they often parted for a day or two.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing at all that passed from him for which he charged her with the cause of his death - A. He only wished her to take care of the children; he said he should not die happy if she did not come and take the children away.</p>
               <p>MR. WESTON. Q. You are a surgeon - A. Yes. On the the 9th of April the deceased came to my house, he stated that he could not open his mouth; I examined and found him with a lock jaw. I found a confused wound on the back of his head by some blunt instrument; considering him in great danger. I wrote a letter to Mr. Ashley Cooper, a surgeon of Guy's hospital. I requested the deceased to go with that letter that he might be admitted into Guy's hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he got into Guy's hospital - A. No. He went to Mr. Cooper, he did not see him; the servant saw him, he told him he had a lock jaw. Mr. Cooper told him he might come on the Friday, he would take him; he came again to me, I saw him at the door; I told him to go again, he would die if he did not get into the hospital immediately. He then stated that he hoped I would bring his wife to justice, that he considered himself as dying; I told him he would die. When I came home I was surprised to see him at my house, he told me that Mr. Cooper said he must come on Friday, I told him he would be dead before then; he died on the next day. He had some medicines from my house.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had told him he must die did he tell you how he received the wound - A. Yes; he stated by his wife throwing a mallet at him; I said, I suppose you were both drunk; he said that she was drunk, and that she thrust a lighted candle in his eye. He died on the 10th of April. I saw him on the Thursday following; upon examining the head there was a confused wound, with extraversated blood between the scull and the scalp, which covered the scull; the scull was not fractured; there was a slight extraversation under the scull, on the membrane of the brain, and injuries of the head frequently produce death. I conceive that the blow was the cause of his death. I consider the blow on the head produced a lock jaw and after that death.</p>

I met him the next morning after he had been fighting, and having words by Whitechapel-market; he asked me if I had heard of his row; I told him no. I live in the middle of the court, he lived at the top; he said, how do think my Sall served me; I said I did not know, I was a bed; he replied, we had a few words last night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be in a dying situation - A. No; his face seemed scarrified and scratched.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.

After we came out he said, Sall, we will have a glass of gin; I said no; then he said he would have some beer; I said I would have a glass of peppermint. When we came home he had all the money in his pocket; the children asked me for bread; I said I have none until your father gives me the money; he immediately throwed me down stairs three times; I begged of him to let me in, he did. I know nothing about the mallet. After we had the words he laid down and went to sleep, he awaked again and said, strike a light; I said my dear, lay still and have rest; he would not; he began again immediately; I struck a light, he dragged the candle one way and I another; that is all I know about it.</p>

About a quarter before seven o'clock in the evening, a man came in the shop that wanted some beef steaks, and while I was cutting them he informed me that an officer was gone to Queen-square with a carcase of a sheep that he had taken from a man. In consequence of that I turned round my head and missed one of my sheep; I went up to the Hoop and Grapes public house, and there I saw my carcase of mutton; I knew it to be my sheep by the score that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181006060023"/>we make through the spine in the fore quarter, I waited till the magistrate sat; Mr. Bly marked it and I was ordered to take the sheep home; my young man took it to the office the next day.</p>

            . I am a butcher; I work for the prosecutor. On the 21st of December three dressed sheep were hanging at my master's door; when I returned my master informed me one of the sheep had been taken away. The next morning I took the sheep up to Queen-square office, and that sheep I killed and dressed for my masters; I know it to be my masters property; I took the same sheep that was brought from the office; Mr. Bly put a mark on it; he shewed me the sheep.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. On Wednesday before Christmas day, in the evening between six and seven o'clock. I was coming up Tothill-street, I saw a carcase of mutton on a man's back, and the person who had it turned up a street near the prosecutor's house; I followed the person that had the sheep. After walking about twenty yards I observed the prisoner to mend his pace; I kept the person in view for about four or five turnings, at last he ran with it, and I ran after him; then the person got into Duck-lane; at that time I did not know who it was. In Duck lane the person went into an entry with the sheep on his shoulder. At that time I might be the distance of twelve or fifteen yards; I ran up to the door and found the prisoner standing at the door as bold as could be; I am sure the prisoner is the man; I asked him what he had done with the mutton; he said, what mutton. I Immediately perceived the carcase of mutton close to his heels; I collared him with both my hands; I said, you rascal, you know I know you. I hold him and pulled him out of the house; there was a in the window nearly opposite, I pulled him towards that window as nigh as I could, in order that I might not be deceived in his person; I found he was too strong for me; he is a strong young man. I kept him in that state half a minute, in hopes of getting some person to assist me; it is a bad neighbourhood; I did not holl out, as it was likely I should get somebody to act to the contrary. I received a severe blow over the bridge on my nose the blow stunned me so that I was obliged to let the prisoner go; he ran away as fast as he could, I ran after him a little way and returned and secured the mutton. I took it to the public house; the Hoop and Grapes, Queen-square; Mr. Woodward came and claimed it; he swore to it before the magistrate, then I marked it. Cousins brought down the sheep the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again - A. I never saw him until he was apprehended at Banbury, and when I saw him I knew him to be the same man; I immediately charged him with this offence, among others; as soon as he saw me he called me by my name; he was put into my custody; I brought him to town. I saw him at Banbury on last Wednesday fortnight; I brought him to town on the Friday following.</p>

On Friday last I apprehended the prisoner at a public house in Tothill-street; I searched him and in his pockets I found a number of duplicates; I went to the several pawnbrokers and ordered them to attend and produce the property before the magistrate; they did attend and produced the property, and it was identified. On the Monday; as I was bringing the prisoner from Tothill-fields, the prisoner told me if I would let him go, he would raise money enough to get the thing out; he was very sorry he had done it, he had never done so before; he knew they were in pawn for about thirty shillings.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mrs. Plumpton said if she had a spare bed I should have it; I went up stairs and went into the room and pulled off my shoes; my prosecutor came in and asked me what I did there, I told him I was going to bed. I went down stairs upon his saying the room belonged to him, he went to the chest and throwed the things down stairs, he held me; and reported it to Mrs. Plumpton; they sent for an officer; I was taken to Tothill-fields.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I had nothing in my hand; I saw him drop them as he went down stairs.</p>

               <p>Q. What family have you in the house - A. My wife, myself, my maid servant, and my neice. On the 24th of January last about ten o'clock in the forenoon, the prisoner, in company with another man, came to my house. I knew them both by sight. They called for a breakfast of tea, they were shewed into the dining room; after they had taken their breakfast; in about half an hour a young woman came in that had been with them, they ordered tea for her; they stopped till about half after eleven o'clock. After the young woman had taken breakfast the prisoner went out, he returned in about a quarter of an hour; they paid their breakfast and all went away. In about ten minutes afterwards I went into the said parlour, to a cupboard in the partition, to fetch a bill; I went to unlock the cupboard door, the bolt of the lock had been forced back. I pulled the door open and missed a bundle that I had deposited in that closet; the bundle was left in my care, it was not my own property; the bundle was in the cupboard ten minutes before the men came in, and there were no other persons but them during that morning in that room while they were. Immediately I found the bundle was gone I went to Marlborough-street and took out a warrant for the prisoner, and the other man of the name of Edwards. The prisoner was apprehended in the borough, about a month or five weeks back for a robbery; I went to the office and saw him, and knew him well; he acknowledged that he had been at my house, at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you charged him with this offence - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the things since - A. I have not; I have paid two pounds one shilling for them, I believe it was more than the value of them.</p>

            . Q. You live with the prosecutor. - A. Yes. On the 24th of January last, the prisoner and another man came with him; we shewed them into the dining-room below stairs: they called for a breakfast of tea, I served them with it. In about half an hour a young woman came to them, the prisoner ordered tea for her. They all staid about an hour and a half; the prisoner went out about a quarter of an hour: he returned, and they all three went out together.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the cupboard where these things were kept - A. Yes, I saw the bundle in the cupboard the day before: my master kept one key and my mistress the other. About five or six minutes after they went out my master went to the cupboard, and missed the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Now during the time these people were there, did any other person go in there - A. No one at all, except me, to serve them, after I had served them, I was out in the shop the whole time; if any body had gone into the dining room I must have seen them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive that none of your master's family, and none of the lodgers went into the room while you were there - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. They must have seen me with a bundle if I had it. This lady and master always attended the shop; I left the man and woman there for a quarter of an hour, why should they charge me.</p>

             said, father, will you have some grog; I said, with all my heart; it was poured out into a tin pot; I drank some of it, at that time I did not know where it come from. In about a quarter of an hour after after, Penny said, will you have a little more grog; I said, I should like a little more, where am I to get it; he hauled a nine gallon keg out of the bed place; I said, Penny, who brought it here, he said, he did, I told him he was the properest person to take it back again; some time after he took it to the hold. After some time, Penny and the stranger went on shore, they were all forward in liquor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You know what sucking the monkey is. - A. Yes, drinking and carrying nothing away but what is in the belly; I do not believe they did any more.</p>
               <p>GEORGE SEARS. I am a lighterman to Messrs Lucas and Co.</p>
               <p>Q. On the morning of the 6th of May were you on board the Emma - A. I was, between the hours of three and four, I perceived the hatch was off and down in the hold; this vessel was laden with anchors of Hollands gin by the Excise. I immediately went down in the cabin, I found Walsh and Penny was quite drank, and the other was cherry merry. I saw Penny take a keg from the cabin and put it down in the hold. I told Penny he had better come up and put the hatch on; he did, and he assisted in mooring the craft. We unlocked the barge, I then missed two kegs.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before had you seen the kegs safe - A. On Saturday evening, between five and six, I stowed them in tiers. I told Penny that I would not go down with the craft with the kegs deficient, because if I had, I must have been accountable for them, as I took them in; he replied, that he would buy some kegs and fill them with water; I told him I would not. I took a boat and went down to the London docks, and after that I communicated it to Mr. Lucas's foreman. On the 9th of May I went on board again, I handed the keg on shore that Penny took down into the hold from the cabin.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Now I ask you upon your oath, did you taste of the gin on board that lighter - A. I did not, before it was poured out to me in a bason.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, did not you drink of the liquor that came out of the keg - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Court. You went down in the cabin and drank some with the rest - A. Yes, I never saw any liquor taken from the cask.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Penny. Q. Did not you broach a keg on Saturday afternoon - A. I never broached a keg in my life.</p>
               <p>MR. PEARSON. I am an Excise officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you guage these several casks before they were put on board the Emma - A. I did, that is one of the casks that I guaged, it contained eight gallons and three quarters; I guaged it after it was on shore, it contained seven and a quarter. I looked over the casks I found three deficient; the casks all contained foreign geneva.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You say you guaged the different casks on board the Emma on shore - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Whatever quantity there was put on board; you cannot tell no more than the man in the moon.</p>

               <p>MR. FORBES. I am one of the landing waiters of his Majesty's customs. I was coming up Fleet-street along with Mr. Jones, on the evening of the 17th of May, between six and seven o'clock, I saw him seize Spencer and say, you rascal you have picked my pocket of a handkerchief, he was so close to him at the time, that he touched his clothes; Mr. Jones let him go and seized the other prisoner, who immediately dropped the handkerchief, Mr. Jones picked it up. I followed Spencer and took him in custody, the prisoner then told me that he had not been in Fleet-street that day.</p>

               <p>Spencer's: Defence. I am innocent of it; I never was nigh the gentleman, within four hundred yards; there was a man went by me with a white jacket, I was going up to Somerset-house. I was stopped and put into a house; I said, what for; he said, picking my pocket; I said I never picked your pocket. Ask him if ever he put his hand upon me, before I was brought back by the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I was in the act of seizing him, but seeing the handkerchief pass, I thought it was best to take him with the handkerchief, I then seized Brown.</p>

I searched Flooks and found a bladder in his hat, it held two quarts and half a pint of foreign brandy. I saw a bladder taken out of Towers's hat. Clements produced four more bladders, they all contained foreign brandy; the six bladders contained three gallons, three quarts, a pint, half a pint, and a gill, I took them to the police office.</p>
               <p>DANIEL CLEMENTS. I am a gate-keeper of the London docks. On the 26th of May I commenced my duty a little before eight in the morning. I saw my brother officer lay hold of Flooks, and Towers ran away. I followed him; he fell; then I collared him and took him to the guard-room; there I found Clarke with the other prisoner. I took a bladder from Towers's hat. Mr. Clarke went away, and I had the two prisoners under my custody. I heard them whisper, what shall we do with these. I said, men, you have got more about you, give it me. From Smith I received a bladder out of his breeches, and one from Towers out of his breeches. Towers then gave me two more from a machine that went round his body. The prisoners were taken to the Office.</p>

               <p>Towers's Defence. I did not conceive that I was doing wrong in bringing this brandy away on account of my wife's illness. I sleeped on shore in the place I usually did. I found them bladders of brandy. I conceived it would be of essential service to my family. I went to take them home.</p>
               <p>Flook's Defence. The brandy that I had with me was given me by the mate of a ship. I went to settle with him a small bill, and he gave me three quarts of brandy. I know nothing of the other man.</p>

            , I asked her if her name was not Frances Patterson, she said, yes; I asked her where she had been; she told me down to the northward, and had travelled back by land, I asked her the reason of her taking my money out of my box.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you miss on the 26th of March. - A. A five pound bank note, and nine one's, they were wrapped up inside of a letter and put into a box in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the box locked - A. No, the key was left in it. About half past nine, I went out from my breakfast and left my wife in the house, then I saw the notes safe, before I went out, I put the notes in the letter myself that morning, and eleven pound more, but my wife took the eleven pound to pay away.</p>
               <p>Q. The question that you asked her on the 22d of May was, the reason of her taking your money out of the box - A.She said, on Mr. Smith, I took your money, but it is out of my power to give it you at present, she begged that I would not take her before a magistrate, I told her I must walk back along with her, I took her into the potatoe warehouse near where I live, and the man that keeps the house he went up along with me to Shadwell office, with her; there she was searched, we found nothing about her but an old penknife belonging to me wrapped in a bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the penknife - A. Yes, I gave it over to Mr. Drummond.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 26th of March, where was that knife - A. I cannot say, it generally used to lay in the table drawer along with the other knives in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say how long before the 26th you had seen it - A. No, I am quite clear it was my own knife, when this knife was taken out of her pocket she said, it was mine, the children were playing with it, she took it away from the children.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Smith, did I say I took your money, I never saw it; he has sworn falsely.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am sure she said so, I have a witness that heard it; she said so first to me, and then afterwards before Mr. Drummond.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That is all false. And the wife had one child with her, and the others were with me, the child did not go out to school at all.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I cannot say that, I am sure they went to school that day, I expected and believe they were, because they went regular every day.</p>

I had robbed him of fourteen pounds, I went to his house and was searched, nothing was found, the fact is, I am not guilty, one Drummond, who is an evidence, knows that I said if I was young I would work the money out; I did say so, I did not wish to go before a magistrate. Ask the prosecutrix and his wife, if another woman and Mrs. Trumbell was not left in the house as well as myself, I throw myself on the mercy of the court.</p>

On the 26th of April, I cannot say the hour it was between twelve and five some where about the middle of the day, she came to our shop for half a yard of Irish linen, I sold her the half yard of Irish linen she paid eleven pence for it. I was engaged with other customers while she was looking at different things on the counter, we had a great many pieces of printed cotton laying on the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. How many other shopmen were there in the shop serving beside, you - A. Only myself, Mr. Blower's, and his wife went in the parlour at the back of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door of the parlour open or shut - A. Shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a glass door - A. Yes, a looking glass door, not to look through, persons within could not see the shop excepting through a small side window.</p>
               <p>Q. Could they see through the side window as they sat in the parlour - A. No; they must come up to the window for the purpose of looking through.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think the prisoner staid in your shop, altogether - A. About five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How was she dressed - A. As she is now with a shawl and no cloak, she went out of the shop, and in five minutes after she was gone I missed nine yards of printed cotton, the moment Mr. Blowers came into the shop I missed the cotton, I told him I missed the print.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that the woman went out of the shop were there any other customers in the shop besides her - A. Yes, several others, I ran out of the shop and pursued the prisoner, I saw her going into Howland-street, I ran into Howland-street, and overtook her, and as she was walking the way to the watch house, I said very little to her, she wished to know what I wanted with her, I laid hold of her shoulder, I told her that she had stolen something, she said, she had not, I told her I was certain that she had; then she said, she had; and gave the cotton to me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she take it from - A. It was concealed under her clothes, she put her hand under her apron or gown, I am not certain which, and she produced it, I took it and her likewise to the watch house, I gave the cotton to Mr. Baker, the watch house keeper. The next day she was taken before the magistrate, and committed.</p>
               <p>- BAKER. I am the watch-house keeper. The prisoner and this piece of cotton was delivered into my charge, I have had the cotton ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. to Gudgeon. Look at that printed cotton does that belong to Mr. Blowers - A. Yes, I know it by my own mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon yourself to swear that that piece of cotton was laying on the counter when the prisoner came into the shop - A. Yes, and it is the piece of cotton the prisoner gave me when I overtook her.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181006060031"/>Q. What is the value of that piece of cotton - A. Ten shillings it cost more, it would sell for twelve shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into that man's house, to buy a bit of linen, I asked him if he had any linen at one and eleven pence per yard, he said, he had, he asked me to wait, I was not well I sat down on a stool, I asked this boy would he please to cut off a bit of linen for me, he did, going out of the door I being very ill I caught hold of the rail of the door. A woman came and gave me this bit of cotton in my hand, and immediately this boy came and put his hand on my shoulder, he asked me what I had got; I said, I did not know that woman gave it me, she was gone to get a coach I was so ill, I was not able to go home. When I was taken to the watch house, the bit of cotton was given to the watch house keeper's wife, when the watch house keeper came in he was very tipsey, there was a milkman there he said, he knew me, and that I was a hard working woman.</p>

            . On the 3rd of May the prisoner came into my shop in company with another woman: when the prisoner went out, from suspicion I followed her, she went to Mr. Thorley's shop. As I was entering Mr. Thorley's door I saw her stealing a piece of muslin; she sideled towards the counter, put her hands behind her, and pulled the muslin off the counter. I spoke to Mr. Thorley, and told him the prisoner had stole a piece of muslin; Mr. Thorley's daughter came and took it from under the prisoner's coat.</p>
               <p>MARY THORLEY. I am the daughter of the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the prisoner on the 3rd of May being at your father's shop - A. I do, very well; I took a piece of muslin from behind her, under her coat; she said she did not touch it, she was certain it came there of itself. When I took it from her she had hold of it with one hand behind her. It is my father's property, I had seen it about half an hour before in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it - A. Nine shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never saw the muslin. When the lady turned round, I told her I was very willing to strip, to see whether I had any thing. I pulled off my old coat that I had on, and by pulling the coat off it throwed the muslin down.</p>

I had a good opportunity of looking him full in the face. I said to him, my friend, you are in a violent hurry; while the words were in my mouth, I felt my watch go out of my fob pocket, he was obliged to pull it very hard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181006060032"/>my breeches being very tight.

On the 18th of April, I was passing up St. Ann's-lane close behind the prisoner, I saw the prisoner take the watch out from Mr. Biddle's pocket. I immediately ran after him, when he turned up Gutter lane I was close behind him. Mr. Webster, a gentleman volunteer, with his musquet in front stopped the prisoner; then I laid hold of his collar, and said, he was the man that stole the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you lost sight of him - A. No, only as he was turning the corner; I was close behind him; I never lost sight of him for a minute, I am certain he is the man.</p>

On the 22nd of May, about six o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner and another woman came into the shop to look at some wedding rings; the prisoner, after taking up several and putting them down, took up two, and one of them she put in her mouth; and the other, after having it on, she laid it down. I told her she had another; she said, she had not; I said, I was sure she had, I saw her put it in her mouth. The woman that was with her then run out of the shop. She took the ring out of her mouth, gave it to me, and then ran away; Mr. Hatton went after her, fetched her back; she attempted to run away the second time, but I stopped her; we then sent for an officer.</p>

            . At the time that the prisoner was looking at the rings, a man came in and asked to look at some gold broaches, I handed the gold broaches to the man. When I heard Mrs. Hatton say to the prisoner, you have got two rings, she said, she had but one; Mrs. Hatton said, you have put one in your mouth; she denied having it in her mouth, but made an attempt of slipping it out of her mouth, which Mrs. Hatton saw, and told her of it; she then gave it out of her hand to Mrs. Hatton; there was a parchment ticket attached to the ring, which was in a moistened state, from having been in the mouth. The moment that Mrs. Hatton charged the prisoner with the ring, the man that asked to look at the gold broaches, walked out of the shop.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was that man - A.He gave his name Captain Johnson, before the Lord Mayor. I made enquiry at the Coal Exchange, for the captain of the ship that he gave the name of; there was no such man as captain Johnson, of that ship, he must have given the wrong name.</p>

On Wednesday the 16th of May the prisoner came with another man into my house, he called for a pint of ale, he asked me if I could furnish him with a lodging, saying that he was a jeweller and worked hard by; he had another pint of ale, and after a little while I answered him that I could accomodate him with a lodging; this was about one o'clock in the day; he said he had been up the night before, and he wished to retire to rest. I shewed him a room up two pair of stairs, he seemed pleased with the room, he said he should take it for a constancy; he offered me money for a deposit, I declined it. I left the room and went to Hox on that same afternoon. I returned about eight o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it you left your house - A.About three o'clock in the afternoon; when I returned I understood the prisoner was gone. On the following day my wife missed all the articles mentioned in the indictment. These things were taken out of my own bed room in the one pair of stairs, the door of which was locked when I went to Hoxton</p>
               <p>Q. However, he did not break and enter into the house - you say you shewed him into the room - A. Yes, I did. The officer found some of the property upon him.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL MILLER. I am an officer. On Friday the 18th of last month, I went to the Alderman Parson's Head in Rosemary-lane; I took the prisoner in custody, I asked him where the things were that he had taken from Mr. Cross; at first he denied it; I told him I should certainly find him out if he did not tell, and was going to search him, he then pulled off his hat, and said, here is some of your property; there were three neck handkerchiefs, and another handkerchief he pulled out of his pocket; he said he had sold three silver spoons to a jew in Rosemary-lane, and the remainder of the handkerchiefs he sold to this jew for fourteen or fifteen shillings, and that he did not take any more than three spoons and a number of handkerchiefs; the rest were never found. He said he burst the landlord's bedroom door open after he had been an hour and a half in bed, and took the property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came up from Scotland that present time; I came into this house, I asked for a bed, he took me up to bed; I was sick, I came down, I saw the door open, I saw the thing sticking out of the drawer, there were three tea spoons, and about nine or ten handkerchiefs; it is the first thing I ever did in my life.</p>

Barker went on again till he came to the sign of the Hop Pole in Cow-cross, he stopped again; he said, butcher, step up here, here is son nver lying in the front of the cart; I it stepped in the cart and picked up some shillings, and Barker picked up some, I put them into his left hand, and got out of the cart. In about two or three minutes Barker called me again to see what notes he had got I got into the cart again, Barker had five one pound notes in his hand, I put them into the bag he had in his hand.</p>

               <p>Q. Does the prisoner live in the house - A. She is there of a day, but not in the night. On the 18th of April, in the morning, I missed my bonnet and found the prisoner's.</p>
               <p>MR. FRIEND. I am an officer, I apprehended the prisoner on the 12th of May, at night, I asked the prisoner what she had done with the property that she had robbed this woman of, she at first denied any knowledge of it, but afterwards told me that she could produce some of the property, the greatest part she had disposed of. She said that she was shut out of her lodgings, that she went to Mrs. Peacock's house and shoved back the bolt of the door and took these articles, stated in the indictment; she said it was between twelve and one in the morning. On the next day, when the prosecutrix came to the office, she identified a gown, cap, petticoat, and shift; they were all upon the prisoner's back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was a lodger in the house, that woman there was a lodger there likewise. The door was left open at all hours of the night, and the things that she has said of me is wrong. She sent to me that she would make it up for six pounds. I am not guilty of every thing than I am accused of.</p>

               <p>Q.What is Hanks - A. A timber merchant; he has a parcel of muds for the convenience of laying up timber.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of these pieces of timber missing - A. On the 18th of May I directed George Hutchins, a man in my employ, to go and look at the timber; about eleven o'clock at night he informed me that seven pieces of the timber had been taken away. On the 19th of May I went down to Blackwall, I went on shore at the Folley-house; on my going up that way I saw a piece of timber covered with some boards; I asked a labourer there whose premises they they were, he said,

            's; I saw the prisoner's brother, I asked him if the premises belonged to him, he said no, to his brother. The timber was placed upon two rollers, about ten feet from the saw pit.</p>
               <p>Q.At the time the timber came into your possession belonging in to Flowers and Benson had it any particular mark - A. It was marked F 987, and at one end it was marked with B, and at the other end 
               <persName id="t18100606-62-person548">B, K</persName>
            , my private mark, and No. 54, was cut on it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came into the prisoner's yard were these marks upon the timber - A. Yes, and I observed a mark on the timber, which it had not when in my possession, it was marked T N, and 46 had been burnt over to make the mark look old. The timber I so found on North's premises, I consider it so far my own, if it had not been found I must have paid for it It was the property of Messrs. Flower and Benson that I had in my custody.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he any business to be there at that time - A. None at all. Upon my seeing him coming out I saw his smock frock stick out, I felt it and found it very hard; I took thirty pound weight of lead from under his smock frock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been any lead brought to the new mint that morning - A. There had been a great quantity brought from the old mint; I believe, from the appearance of it, it was part of that brought from the old mint. It being Saturday night the prisoner was taken to the watchhouse till Monday morning, then I accompanied him to the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. When you attended before the magistrate do you know whether that which the prisoner said was taken in writing or not - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>The confession of the prisoner read.</p>
               <p>"The prisoner faith, I know I did wrong, I am sorry I should do any such thing."</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What is the value of the lead - A.Eight shillings; it is rather under what the value is.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was drinking at my master's pay-table; I got in liquor, and how I came by this lead I cannot tell.</p>

On the 5th of May, near twelve o'clock, I was standing at the corner of Creed Church-lane, I heard a cry of stop thief, I met a person running; I laid hold of him, and in the scuffle I saw a pocket book on the ground, I took the pocket book up, the prisoner said he picked it up as he was running along; two foreign captains came up and said it was their property. Neither of the captains are here.</p>

In the morning, about a quarter past five, I awoke and found the prisoner was absent. I felt in my pocket, my watch was gone, and a five pound note, a one pound note, and fifteen shillings in silver; I went down to the landlord and told him; he said she was his lodger, she had broke the lock of the street door and got out; the constable took her up about a fortnight ago; I went to the watchhouse to see her; I knew she was the person.</p>

On the 23d of March I heard a noise in the prisoner's room, I went and asked what that noise was; Shaw told me that the prisoner brought him in, that he gave her half a crown, and that she went away with it. I went and looked and found the prisoner in another room; I said to her, Nancy, you must come up stairs and give the young man the half crown, or else give him satisfaction; I took her up stairs, and the matter was settled; I then went to bed and took the key of the street door between three and four o'clock in the morning I heard a noize, I got up and found the street door open. I went to bed again, and about a quarter past five Shaw came down stairs and told me that he had been robbed of eight pound, I believe, and a watch. In four days afterwards I saw her and spoke to her; I asked her if she was not ashamed to rob the man in my place and run away; she said she was sorry for it, she had got drunk on the business and lost all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send to the prosecutor and let him know where she was - A. No; I told the constable to send for the prosecutor.</p>

On the 15th of April last I was in St. Giles's, I met with Elizabeth Durant, she asked me to give her a glass of gin; we went to the Turk's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181006060037"/>Head, I gave her what she desired; I called for a pint of beer, she sat herself alongside of me. I called for another pint of beer, and repeated it to the third; she then asked me if I was going to reside in that part of the town that evening, if I was she had an excellent bed and a room, if I would put my body under her care: I asked her the expence, she told me half a crown; I granted the request.

               <p>Q. What time of night was this - A. Ten o'clock. She said she should like a drop of gin; I told her I was not partial to gin, if she would send for a drop of beer, well and good; I gave her a shilling more; she called Kite and Ellis into the room where I was in the second story; she sent them for the liquor, they were gone rather longer than ordinary, I being very tired and wearisome asked Durant's consent to lay down upon her bed till they came back.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been to work that day - A. I had moored the craft that morning that I had come in with.</p>
               <p>Q. Besides the liquor that you had with Durant had you drank more liquor than that - A. Yes; I had drank my mooring beer, which is a pint allowed. When I met Durant I was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. When you asked her to lie down upon the bed were you sober - A. I was as sober as I am now.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been drinking any thing this morning - A. I had a little saloop, and one pint of half and half.</p>
               <p>Q. When you asked her to lie down did you lie down upon the bed - A. Yes; I fell asleep.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went to lie down upon the bed what money had you in your pocket - A. I handed my watch up to see what o'clock it was; I had nine shillings in my pocket; I had a loose great coal, tied with two pieces of rope yarn, and a bundle in that coat pocket containing a shirt, a pair of stockings, and three handkerchiefs. After I fell asleep Durant shook me by the shoulder and asked me whether I meaned to have any of the liquor that I sent for; I told her that I wanted rest more than I did any thing to drink; before I went to bed I laid my great coat on the feet of the bed; I arose from off the bed and told them that I would drink; they were all three in the room then; I got up and found the waistband of my breeches slack, on my examining it it was cut in two with some instrument; I felt in my pocket, my money was gone, and my watch was cut out of my fob, I examined the pocket of the great coat, the bundle was gone. I put my shoes on; I told the girls that they had been serving me in a clandestine manner, and if they did not surrender my property I should look for further assistance; they began to threaten me with terrible fury and oaths; Kite said, blast his eyes, if he pretends to say any thing about his property, murder him. I told them to have a little mercy, as I was a stranger, and give me permission to abide in the room that night; they all three laid down upon the bed with their clothes on, I placed myself across the room door to hinder them from escaping; I placed myself in that situation all night, I had enough to do, sometimes they were asleep, sometimes they were domineering over me, and at break of day light Sullivan got out of bed and laid on my big coat upon the floor. When it was broad day light Ellis got out of bed and demanded the door to be opened; I told her I did not object it, if she would deliver my property up to me; Kite rolled herself off the bed, and said, do not stand hesitating about him, let us do the b - r; I said, what do you mean by doing of me; she said, murder the b - r. Kite took up a large pair of bellows, Durant took up an iron bar which burned in the fire, Ellis took up a quart pewter pot, they came to me with great fury; I got Kite in the center, Durant to the right, and Ellis to the left; they struck me, and repeated their blows as long as their strength would hold out. I found myself weak, I thought I must take some other means.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cry out for assistance - A. I did not, the engagement was too sharp; I made at Durant, but catched Kite, I threw her athwart the room with as much vengeance as I could, she received her fall upon the bed; the other two drew back, which gave me time to open the door; I went down stairs as fast as I could, I left my great coat behind me; luckily I heard the watchman sing out the hour or five, at my second call he came to my assistance; I told him that I had been robbed in the night and nearly liked to be murdered about a minute ago; I told him that was the entrance of the nest, and the birds were up stairs. On our going up stairs Kite and Ellis escaped from the room where we were all night into a different apartment; as they were crossing the top of the stairs I heard one of them say, if we had murdered the b - r, as we proposed, it would have been all snug enough. I went up stairs with the watchman into the apartment where they resided all night, there was Durant by herself, the mother of all the mischief, I contracted with her for the bed; I gave the watchman charge of her, he took her to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the searched when taken to the watchhouse - A. Not till the others were taken. We went back directly and found Kite and Ellis just come down stairs at the door, they were taken to the watchhouse; they were searched, a watch was found on Kite, between her breast and under her arm, in a kind of a pocket in her shift. These are the breeches that I have on now, the waistband is cut in two.</p>
               <p>Durant. Did you not give me the watch to keep for the night till the pawnbrokers were open - A. I never gave you the watch, so help me God.</p>
               <p>Durant. I gave Kite the watch in his presence - A. I never saw the watch from the time I handed it up to see what o'clock it was, till I saw it in the watchman's hands.</p>

On the 25th of April, past five o'clock, I was opposite Church-lane, the prosecutor called me, I went to him, he took me to the house where the robbery was done, and conducted me up stairs, he went first, and just as I put my foot on the third stair I heard a woman say, the b - r is charging the watchman with us, had we murdered him according to our proposal it would all have been snug enough. I did not see any body go out of the room because I was behind him. He opened the room door and said here is the mother of the mischief, pointing to Durant; I took her to the watch-house, and delivered her to the constable. I went back with Gardener, I saw Kite and Ellis somewhere near about the door, I took Kite and the patrol took Ellis,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181006060038"/>we delivered them to the constable.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On my going down George-street I met the watchman and Gardener, he told me he had been robbed in Church-lane; I told him there were two or three suspicious characters in Church-lane; I went with him there, he pointed out Kite and Ellis; they were standing talking to another woman about four doors from the house where he had been robbed; I told him to be quiet for fear they should make a run; I went beyond them and crossed over, Ellis ran down the lane, the prosecutor took her. I took Kite and conveyed her to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Durant's Defence. I knew this man for some years by coming to the Black Dog and the Turk's Head, and he mostly, when he came out of the country, sent for me. I was at work all that day; he sent for me, I told him I could not come until I came from work and when I had done work I went to him; he said I am short of money, I have not got above two shillings, take me home, my girl; I said, you must make it more than two shillings; he said, I will pawn the watch and give you five shillings, and give you something to drink; I said it was too late. He gave me the watch, and in the morning he wanted to take it away from me. As he was kicking up the row I reached the watch to Kite. Ellis was never in nor near the place.</p>
               <p>Kite's Defence. I live in the same house. I heard this man and woman a quarreling. I went into the room, this man went to hit her several times; I said, do not hit her, what she has got she will give it you. She gave me the watch and told me to keep it.</p>
               <p>Ellis's Defence. I was down stairs, and when the watchman was coming by I was talking to a young woman that came from Covent Garden with flowers; he pointed to me; I said I knew nothing of it. I attempted to go away, he stopped me.</p>

After we had drank the beer we went out; the prisoner stood opposite of the house, she said, you have plenty of time, will you take a walk to see my room; we went, both of us, and sat down for nine or ten minutes, then I told my shopmate it was time to go to work; he got up and went out, I was following of him, she took bold of my wrist and begged me to lend her sixpence till the next day, she would call the next morning at the public house and would pay me; I put my hand in my pocket, took out a dollar, and two shillings and sixpence I had in my hand; she slipped the money immediately out of my hand, I took hold of her arm and asked her whether she meaned to rob me; she then slipped my watch out of my pocket; I took her towards the door, I thought to give charge of her to somebody; there were then three men at the door, I told them she had robbed me of my watch and property; one of the men knocked me down, she escaped immediately. She was taken on the Sunday following at an iron shop over the way.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This gentleman came to my window, seeing a child with me he asked me if it was mine, I said it was; he gave the child a penny for a bun; he went over to the public house, he asked me to come over; I went and had some of the gin, and another young woman. It about two hours he came to my room with a recruiting serjeant and went away; he broke open two peoples doors, said they were the people that robbed him, and being fearful of his making a disturbance, went out and locked my door; my landlady hearing of it, and I owing her a little money, she padlocked me out; that is the reason I was found at another lodging.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 4th of June, between three and four in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner, he was in company with one more, he was standing behind captain Stopford; I suspected the prisoner, I had seen him in company before; I saw him put his hand into the pocket of Mr. Stopford, and take out this handkerchief; not three minutes before I had seen captain Stopford wipe his face with the handkerchief. Directly as I saw the prisoner make off through the crowd I went after him and brought him back immediately; he had not gone above five or six yards; when I laid hold of him he had the handkerchief in his hand; I took it out of his hand. His companion made off. I told Mr. Stopford he had been robbed, and I saw the man take the handkerchief out of his pocket. I took the prisoner to the watchhouse; he had got two other handkerchiefs, one in his hat and another in his pocket; he had got a wire, and an instrument that is used for star glazing, as they call it.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed - A.About ten o'clock, as near as I can guess, and I got up about six o'clock in the morning. I lost from the house a copper and the lead work round it, and a plank that the lead was nailed to, three handkerchiefs, a pair of my stockings, a window-curtain, a coffee pot, a lanthorn, and a flat iron; I saw them all there the night before in the house, and locked them up myself.</p>

When the information was given me I sought for Bedding, and found him in Bell-street, Paddington, the same morning, between seven and eight o'clock, I went up to him and asked him whether his name was not Bedding, he said, yes, I told him he was my prisoner, he said, for what? I said, for taking my copper away; which at that time was the principal thing that I missed; he denied being at Kensil-green for a long while before; I said your back proves that you have had the copper, for the soot was on the back of his coat. I took him to Marlborough-street and had him searched by Mr. Foy and myself, we found these handkerchiefs in his pocket, and my stockings. He declared he had not been in Kensil-green, he could not tell when.</p>

His back was sooty, he appeared as if he had been carrying a copper; he said he had not done so, nor had not been near Kensil-green for some time before; I asked him how he became possessed of these, to which he gave no answer till he was before the magistrate, and then he said he had found them.</p>

                        targets="t18100606-79-victim642 t18100606-79-viclabel433"/> - A. I did, as I had lived there about nine-weeks, and during the time I lived there I became acquainted with the prisoner Horphard, and supplied him with articles in my trade; he lived in Eden-street; Tottenham Court-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the 1st of June had you communicated to Horphard about quitting your premises - A. Yes, he said, he was acquainted with a gentleman who had been a butler fourteen years; and he wanted a shop in the same line, it would suit him to have the goods. I told him I was not willing to part with all my goods, I would keep part and let him have part on reasonable terms. Diamond came on the 1st of June, Harphord was with him about one o'clock, they had both been with me on the day before, I told them, that I had all ready, I had only the cheese to weigh, I weighed the cheese, and Diamond set them down as I weighed them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said by him or you on the subject of butter - A. Nothing at all, I had some butter in tubs and some was out, I did not sell the butter, the articles that I sold were weighed and put together in the shop, on the right hand side, the counter parted the butter and cheese.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any writing box - A. I had, in the parlour on a table, nothing was said about the writing-box, or the book, it was Gay's tables, I told them the carman would have taken them all away that night but could not, he was overleaden.</p>
               <p>Q. What goods are you speaking of - A. cask of butter and another cask with some cheese plates and glass, they were in the parlour; Mr. Diamond said, it would not be convenient, to take them away till about twelve o'clock the next day as he had the key of the premises; it was agreed that Diamond should take possession and carry on business there and I was not to send my cart to fetch my goods away that I had not sold to him till twelve o'clock; after that we all three went to a public house opposite of Newman-street. The sum for which I had sold to him was one hundred and seven pounds ten shillings, for which I received bill, Harphord said, he would go out and get the money, he went out leaving me and Diamond together. When he returned he said, his banker was shut up; he said, he hoped I would have no objection of taking a bill upon him; I told him I would rather have my money and likewise the money that he Harphord owed me he said, certainly, I had do that we shall settle to; he said, you will take this bill consented at last; they promised to pay me the next day at four o'clock, Horphard went out to get the stamp, and upon that, Diamond 
               <persName id="t18100606-79-person644">drew</persName>
             the bill for one hundred and seven pounds ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that include the butter. - A. It did not; we had a glass of wine or two, I gave Diamond the key after I had got the bill. On the 2d of June in consequence of information from Mr. Ward, I got a search-warrant, I attended the officer with it we went to a house in Charles-street, Bridgewater Gardens. We found the property that had been in my house the day before, every thing was removed there, the tub and all the other articles that I had in my parlour, every things, except a few coals; as well those things that had been sold, as those things that had not been sold. Horphard was there, he said, it was his house; Diamond came in at the time that we were looking over the goods, he began abusing me, and said all them goods were his; afterwards he said he would go down stairs and get some dried mutton, he opened the door and ran away; he was brought back again. They were both taken in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, after this, go to your house in Newman-street - A. I did, I found all my goods were gone except a few coals.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of this tub of butter - A. Five pounds, at least.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you ever been paid your bill - A. I have not, my attorney has called upon them for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You looked the bill, and if you had got the money for the bill we should not have seen you - A. I expect you would, if I had got the money.</p>
               <p>Q. After he gave you a bill you parted; with the key of your house, you gave up possession of the house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. If you had been paid the hundred and seven pounds ten shillings for the goods sold, should you have prosecuted for taking the goods that you had not sold - A. I certainly should not although I had given up the key of the house to Diamond, I had not given all that was in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You are positive and certain that you sold butter whatever to the prisoner - A. I am positive of that, I told him, no butter.</p>

I asked Mr. Diamond what time in the morning it would suit him for me to call and take these things away; he told me not to come till twelve o'clock, because it was not convenient for him before, he had got to come a little way out of the country.</p>

               <p>Q. On the evening of the 1st of June, did you see the two prisoners in Mr. Nicholson's house - A. I did, I heard a conversation between Mr. Nicholson and Mr. Diamond about the cheeses. I said to Mr. Diamond are you to be our neighbour; he said, he believed he was he had agreed, except the price, as he paid ready money he hoped Mr. Nicholson would use him well. On the next morning, the 2nd of June, I got up about twenty minutes after five, the first thing I saw was a before the door, and the two prisoners with it they brought out the dining room stove, and a table that belonged to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181006060042"/>me, which I had lent to Mr. Nicholson, I went and demanded the table, and got it. The cart was loaded with hams and bacon, two or three stoves, and a bedstead, not unscrewed, and some butter; I saw in the cart the large piece that stood on the end of the counter, and three butter tubs. I said to him, you are moving early; one of them said, we are moving a few things, he said either to Bethnal-green, or Bateman's-green, or Bateman's-buildings, it was something like that; I thought it was Bethnal-green, I knew the prosecutor was going there.</p>
               <p>Q. To a place that you did not hear distinctly, but you thought Bethnal-green. If they had said No. 2, Charles-street, could you have mistook it for that - A. No, not by any means, I am certain they did not say Charles-street. I looked at the cart and saw no directions on it. I gave directions to my boy to follow it.</p>

            . Q. You are one of the marshal-man of the city of London - A. I am. I had a warrant to search the house in Charles-street, Bridgewater-gardens; I went there about five o'clock in the afternoon, Mr. Nicholson and Mr. 
               <persName id="t18100606-79-person649">Ward</persName>
             both went with me. We found Horphard there; he said, the house was his; the first that we found was a book, that Mr. Nicholson claimed, it laid on the table; in the room were Horphard was we found a walking stick; we found a tub of butter in the lower room, they have been in my possession ever since. While we were looking over the goods, Diamond let himself in with the key of the street-door, we were then in the passage, he was in a kind of surprise, and asked what was the matter; Horphard said, there was a pretty to do, the officer had come to take the goods out, that they had bought of Mr. Nicholson. Diamond defyed us taking any thing out of the house; I told him I would take him and the goods too; he made a jeer; but when he understood he must go to prison, he said, he would not go without getting something to eat; he went into the cellar for a mutton ham, when he came out of the cellar, we were watching him, he opened the door and ran away as hard as he could, I pursued him, in going round the corner I lost sight of him, I got sight of him again; it appeared to me that he came out of a house that he ran into; I brought him back.</p>
               <p>Horphard's Defence. Before the business was settled, the bill was nothing like a hundred pound, which Mr. Nicholson demanded of Mr. Diamond. He says I have three balls there of lard, a tub of butter, a stick, a writing box. He said, the bill of the whole cask of butter, and the stock, included together to the fixtures, make one hundred and seven pounds ten shillings, I said I have not the money; I went out to a friend to get the money, I was too late. I should have honoured this bill if I had had my liberty. I went out and got a stamp, Diamond 
               <persName id="t18100606-79-person650">drew</persName>
             the bill, and Mr. Nicholson took the bill. Mr. Nicholson said, here is the key Mr. Diamond, go and take possession, to-morrow I will come and see how you get on.</p>
               <p>Diamond's Defence. After every arrangement as I thought, I agreed to give him one hundred and seven pounds ten shillings, for the whole amount of every thing, there were stove, grates, counters, and every other thing, the counter is left behind now; the copper and other things, and a kitchen stove, which belongs to me at this moment, if I am obliged to pay the bill. The bill would have been honoured if I had been able to have gone about my business. When he delivered the key to me, he said, Mr. Diamond, here is the key, all that is in the house is yours, so it ended.</p>
               <p>Q. Prosecutor. When you had agreed, and the several articles were put down, did it amount to one hundred and seven pounds ten shillings, without them goods, when you say were stolen - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Horphard that he might take the writing box, the butter, and all the things in the house, in order to make up one hundred and seven pounds ten shillings - A. No such thing.</p>

               <p>Q.What kind of a boat was it - A. I only took notice that it was a boat with deals, there were two men in the boat, it was not light enough to distinguish their persons. It was about half tide, it just floated her in, they brought her in and moored her there; and after they had made her fast to one of the barges, they got into a skiff and rowed over the water.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. What time in the morning was this - A.Half past three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you could not tell who the men where - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say before the magistrate, that you knew that the prisoner was not one of the men - A. I said had known the prisoner for some years.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore if he had been in the boat you must have known him directly - A. No, I could not, I was forty or fifty yards from him, I could not swear to any man, I could not if it was my own brother.</p>

            . I was a porter at Herrington and Yallowby's wharf. On Easter Monday morning, the 23d of April, between ten minutes and five minutes before five o'clock in the morning, I was called up by two men; one man of the name of Warner was present at the time, and another man stood by the side of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known Warner before - A. Yes, I am sure the prisoner is one of the two men. When they called me up, Warner, the prisoner, told me that there was a craft of deals at Yallowby's wharf, that wanted landing. The other man said he brought them from Limehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say we or I - A. He said, I have brought them from Limehouse. He said, get them landed a soon as we could, to get his craft afloat, as he wanted to take his craft down to Limehouse again; when he sent for the deals away he would pay for the wharfage and for the landing. They went away, I saw no more of them until the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go down to unload the deals - A. Yes; I got Giles to help me, we found the lug boat loaded with deals, the name on the lug boat was Chatfield and Co. We unloaded the lug boat, there was a large hundred of deals, about one hundred and twenty, we did not count them.</p>
               <p>Q. On the same morning did Mr. Arnott, one of the firm of Chatfield and Co. apply to you - A.Yes; and I guided Mr. Prior and Towsy to the prisoner's house, he had told me, on a former occasion, where he lived.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. In point of fact, you had known the prisoner in consequence of a former contract he had with you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no disguise on his part you knew he has been a lighterman for many years - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is the business of a lighterman to call upon you when the tide requires - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore his coming to you at five o'clock on that morning was on the occasion of the tide - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.This man that was with him was quite a stranger, you have never discovered him since - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the prisoner directly you went to his house, he did not run away - A. Yes, the prisoner was found the same morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find any deals or the boat on his premises - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The deals were at Yallowby's wharf at the same time - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it you went after the prisoner - A. It might be half past eight the same morning.</p>

            . I went to apprehend, the prisoner. About half after eight o'clock in the morning, Mr. Prior was with me, we went to Burbridge-street, near Marsh-gate, in the New-cut, leading from Rowland's Hill's chapel; Figg shewed me where he lived, I saw his wife standing about two yards from the door, the prisoner was about thirty yards off, Figg pointed him out to us, I took him in custody to Union-hall. When I took him I told him it was on suspicion of stealing some deals he said, oh, those deals I brought up this morning, I can get through that easy enough, I was hired; I asked him for whom he brought them; he said, an entire stranger that he knew nothing of; and at Mr. Chatfield, he pretended not to recollect the man that hired him, I was present at Union-hall, and there before the magistrate he said, he was employed by a man of the name of Steinback, the magistrate said, you have said to the officer that you was employed by a man you did not know; he replied, I recollect now his name is Steinback. Gough, the officer said, we are able to find Steinback.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. They could not find him - A. No, the other had taken care of that, this was at half past one in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. He was in custody from eight o'clock till half past one, he had no opportunity of seeing Steinback - A. He spoke to his wife going from Mr. Chatfield's accompting-house to the magistrate, she said, Warner what is the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181006060044"/>matter, oh he said, it is about them deals that I brought this morning, oh, she said; it is a pity you got up so soon this morning to earn two shillings.</p>

               <p>GEORGE POTTER. I was in company with Mr. Warner at Battersea; I left him a quarter before ten o'clock on Easter Sunday, at his own door.</p>
               <p>MR. STEWARD. I am a printer. I lodged in the prisoner's house, at that time, and do now, and have for some years past.</p>
               <p>Q. How is his bed-room situated as to your's - A.Mine is and was in the front parlour, they sleep in the back; the top of the house is in an unfinished state.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any communication to their bed-room but through your room - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Then, after they had gone to bed, if they came out of their room to go abroad, must not you know it - A. Yes. On Easter Sunday, I came home between ten and eleven o'clock; I went to bed. I saw the prisoner, he came out to me in an undressed state, we had some conversation about rising in the morning; this was between ten and eleven at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect in the course of the night or morning, any body calling to him - A. Yes, I was disturbed about half past four.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the person that called him up - A. No, not by his voice; I know him now, I have seen the man.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You did not see the man that called him up - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he go out - A. A little after that he dressed himself and went out.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it light when he was called up - A. I know not indeed; I am very close shut up. The day had broke when I looked at my watch, and it wanted twenty minutes to five, that was a few minutes after.</p>
               <p>Q.What occasioned you to look at the watch - A. Because I was roused, and I was afflicted with the rheumatic tooth-ach; rather anxiety to get up to business.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you get up - A. I got up about half an hour afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What business had you for calling, you up so early - A. Oh! six o'clock is the usual time in the morning to go to my work.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your door open into the street - A. Yes, directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he leave the door open - A. No, he shut the door after him.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was light at that time - A. By being roused; I never went to sleep till I looked at my watch.</p>
               <p>Q.After he had gone out and shut the door, you looked at the watch - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you look at your watch when the prisoner went out - A. I had not an opportunity, there was no light.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not look at the watch before the prisoner went out, because there was no light - A. I was more effectually awaked by his shutting the door; the prisoner said something to me, I cannot say what.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that rouse you, or did the shutting of the door rouse you - A.Both; I was in a state of anxiety; I was perfectly awake when the door was shut, not before that.</p>
               <p>Q. If you were perfectly awake, perhaps you can tell me what the prisoner said to you - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner shut the door that roused you, effectually - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you immediately looked at your watch - A. Yes; I got up directly, though I went to bed again; I got up in bed, and got out of bed, though I did not put my clothes on; I looked at my watch; I did nothing else; I laid down again.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what light was there to look at your watch - A. Of course I opened the street door to look at my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that - A. I opened the street door, I cannot say whether I opened it to look at my watch, but I opened the street door and looked at my watch; curiosity led me to open the door to look about me, and to look at the watch at the same time. I did open the door, I cannot say for what purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. When you opened the door did you look out - A. Yes, but I did not look about me. I cannot tell whether I shut the door immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. When you opened the door did it appear a fine morning, was the sun up - A. Yes, it appeared so; my eyes were heavy; as I had mentioned before, I had very little sleep in the early part of the evening.</p>
               <p>Q.As your eyes were very heavy, and you were very sleepy, and had no sleep in the course of the night hardly, what could induce you to get out of bed and open the door - A. I do not know, it was done; it was the anxiety, as I have said before, that induced me to know what time of the day it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard him speaking to you, and was very anxious to know the time of the day, how came you not to ask your friend - A. Because I was not so effectually roused; after the knocking at the door I must have dozed again, and awaked by his speaking to me; I hardly remember his speaking to me; in fact, I remember something or other passing.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you swear to his speaking to you, or no - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181006060045"/>I will swear that there was something passed between us; he certainly spoke to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, man, if you come here to tell the truth, there is a strait-forward way to tell it: now then I want to know, are you certain that the prisoner did speak to you, or did he not - A. Yes, he spoke to me, it roused me a trifling, it did.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when you dressed yourself - A. Between seven and eight.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you said it was your custom to get up at six o'clock - A. It was so, but through my heavyness I laid afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your reason for your looking at the watch - A. To know the time of the morning; it wanted twenty minutes to five.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not so heavy then but what you marked that - A. Yes, I took notice of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Your usual time of rising was at six o'clock in the morning - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your anxiety not to oversleep yourself made you get out of bed to open the door to look at your watch A. I do not know what induced me; I got out of bed, opened the door, and looked at my watch.</p>

               <p>Q. You do not know whether it was by chance or design that you took your watch to the door - A. I know I looked at my watch, I cannot say whether it was by chance or design.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you take your watch from your bed to the door - . That I cannot swear.</p>
               <p>Q.When you were at the door, where was your watch - A. In my hand, and it wanted twenty minutes to five.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did it ever happen to you before, to get out of bed and look at your watch - A. Oh! frequently these fine mornings. I generally look out in my shirt, and sometimes I put on my small clothes. I generally throw the door open to find my things, and sometimes pop my head out.</p>
               <p>Q.And you generally to look at your watch take it to the door - A. Yes, generally.</p>
               <p>Q. You were extremely anxious to get up at six o'clock, where do you work - A. At the Philanthropic Society.</p>
               <p>Q.You told my Lord, that you looked at your watch, it wanted twenty minutes to five, you had an anxiety to get up, you got up about half an hour afterwards - A. I beg your pardon, it certainly is a misunderstanding; I said, in about ten minutes after the prisoner went out I got up and looked at the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me directly the prisoner went out you looked at the watch - A. In ten minutes after the door slammed that I got up; I conceive so.</p>
               <p>Q. You dozed, and was in a state of stupefaction - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. It might be half an hour that you dozed after the door slammed - A. No, it appeared immediately almost.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you doze, or did you not, after the door slammed - A. I beg your pardon, as I heard the door slam I got up instantly without dozing.</p>
               <p>Q.What does the half hour apply to? In half an hour after the prisoner went out, did you get up or doze - A. Between seven and eight, I said, I got up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you breakfast in the house, or not - A. I am not quite certain; I am almost positive that I did; I cannot take upon me to swear.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay without breakfast - A. I do not know how that was; I have done that before now.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you come here to say merely it wanted twenty minutes to five - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If you can recollect it was twenty minutes before five, why cannot you recollect the other - A. When I came home I heard Warner was taken up, it impressed my mind. It was in a conversation between me and Mrs. Warner, I think at dinner time, It was at his own house, or going home.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know, whether on the Monday you got any dinner, or not - A. Oh! yes, I got a dinner, I cannot tell where.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the prisoner's house at dinner time - A. I go almost every day there at dinner time; I am pretty certain I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You staid to dinner with her - A. I do not know, I know I dined, I cannot tell where; I cannot say whether I had any breakfast or not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The prisoner was at home before you went out - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You left him at home when you went out - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that - A. I will not; he was at home two or three minutes before I went out; he came home much about the time that I got up, or a little after; I saw him, and spoke to him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.to Figg. You say you worked as a porter at Herrington's and Yallowby's Wharf, where was it you were called up - A. In Green Dragon-court, St. Andrew's-hill. I heard St. Paul's strike five when I had got my clothes on, before I got down stairs.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was called up by this man only to recommend him to that wharf to land the deals. I called Figg myself, the man was with me. I never went out of my house before the time that my witness has stated.</p>

               <p>- BRIGGS. I am a journeyman tin-plate-worker. On the 21st of April I was in my master's shop, in Shoreditch, the prisoner came in and asked me to buy a kettle; I said, no, we made them. A man came and said, stop this man, he has stolen the kettle; as soon as the man said so, the prisoner went away and left the kettle in the shop. At seven o'clock the prisoner came for it; my master said, John, here is the man come for the kettle. He went away, and on Monday morning the prisoner came again and asked for the kettle; the officer was there and took him in custody.</p>

On the 12th of April I went with my husband's dinner to Knightsbridge Barracks, I left the prisoner in bed in my room; I went into my room again between ten and eleven o'clock, I missed my things, and the prisoner was gone. On the 14th of April I saw the prisoner at the Bull, in Gardener's-lane; she had one of my handkerchiefs on her neck, and the other on her head, and my sleeves on her arm; my gown, petticoat, and third handkerchief has not been found. I charged a constable with her.</p>

I directed Preston at the door to take hold of Joseph, whom I pointed to, and that I would take hold of Solomon; I put myself inside of the door, and that moment I was seen by Joseph, he turned round and ran away towards the Court of King's Bench; Preston pursued Joseph and secured him, just as he had got up the second or third step leading into the Court of King's Bench; Solomon stood still, I took hold of him; I said, I had no doubt that something wrong had been done, I must search him. Preston had got hold of Joseph, at that moment I saw Joseph attempting to put something in his mouth, which I suspected was the notes, I called out do not let him eat the notes; Preston said, he has nothing in his mouth, and brought him up to me. Joseph refused being searched by Preston, and said, Vickrey shall search me, he has known me a good while, and whatever he finds he will return me. As I was searching Solomon, I perceived something strike me on the toe.</p>

               <p>Q.At the time that this struck you on the toe, were there any person near you and Solomon, excepting Preston and Joseph - A. Neither of them were near enough at that time, but there were a number of people collected round. I picked up the book, it opened by falling, and the papers fell on the ground, it was this pocket book with the papers it now contains; I searched Solomon further, in his fob pocket I found four one pound bank notes; in his right hand coat pocket I found a one pound<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181006060048"/>bank note, with a number of loose papers, and a lottery bill; in his left hand breeches pocket I think there were eight dollars, which were returned to him all except two. I searched Joseph, I found nothing in his pockets; I attempted to take off his neckhandkerchief, he refused, said no man should take that off, I took it off; in his neckcloth was a thirty pound bank note; between his shirt and his neck, a five pound bank note, and in the same place a two pound note. I then took them up to the office in Bow-street. In the pocket book there is a banker's check, payable at sight; Mr. Dodd has sworn to it; and a bill for goods sold and delivered to Mr. Dodd, outside it is endorsed, Mr. Dodd, Eltham, that led me to find Mr. Dodd out; I sent word down by the stage coachman that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Solomon near enough to you for the book to fall from him - A. We were close together face to face, there was only room for my hand to be in his pocket between him and me.</p>

            . I am one of the patrol of Bow-street. On this day, when the electors of Westminster met in Palace yard, between two and three o'clock, Vickrey came to me, I was standing near the hall door, he said, there were two men, noted characters, gone into the hall, he desired me to see in what part of the hall they were, I looked, and saw the two prisoners in company together. I was told by Vickery to walk towards them, they were looking at something, which appeared to me to be bank notes; Joseph had the notes, and when I got within two or three yards of the two prisoners, Joseph looked towards the door and ran, he ran towards the Court of King's Bench steps, I catched him; and Vickery cried out, mind, he is eating the notes; I clapped my hand to his jaw bone, he opened his mouth; he had nothing in his mouth; I said to Vickery, if it is any where it is in his neck. I brought him to Vickery; Joseph delivered to me eight shillings, I asked him if he had no notes, he gave me a one pound note out of his hand. I was ordered by the magistrate to give him the one pound note and the eight shillings. I was going to untie his neck-handkerchief, he resisted, said he would not be searched by me, Vickery should search him, as he had known him: I told him I would indulge him; I kept hold of him while Vickery searched Solomon. On Vickery's searching Solomon, to the best of my recollection he was unbuttoning his waistcoat, I saw a pocket book shop from some part of Solomon's person, and the papers flew about, they were picked up by Vickery. I held Solomon while Vickery searched Joseph; Vickery untied Joseph's neck handkerchief, and there took out some notes between his shirt collar and his neck. I accompanied Vickery to the office with the prisoner's, and Mr. Dodd appeared on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Dodd. Look at the pocket-book, is that the pocket book of which you were possessed that day - A. Yes, and here are some memorandums I can swear to, here is an order for payment in my favour, it was in my pocket book when I lost it.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at the notes which Vickrey took from Joseph - A. The thirty pound note, I had not taken the number of that note, I traced the number, Mr. Lloyd is her from whom I had it.</p>
               <p>MR. LLOYD. Q. Look at that note and say whether you know it - A.On the 11th of April I received thirty pound bank note for a check.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that thirty pound note was in your possession - A. No, further than the banker's book will tell.</p>

            . Q. Were you present when these men were in custody of Vickrey and Preston - A. I was present at the time Vickrey told Preston to go towards Joseph, he advanced towards Joseph; Solomon was perfectly composed when Vickrey took him in custody. Preston took Joseph and brought him to Vickrey, he was searched, and I saw something taken from his collar, which I supposed to be Bank notes. During the investigation I saw a pocket book fall at the foot of Solomon.</p>
               <p>Joseph's Defence. I was coming along the bridge to Westminster I picked this book up, and looking at it I put the notes in my neck for safety, and the next morning I intended to look in the newspapers to see if they were advertised. I meaned to restore them to the owner if they were advertised.</p>
               <p>Solomon's Defence. On the 17th of April curiosity led me to go the Westminster Meeting. I had not been in the crowd two minutes, the crowd was so great I ran out for fear of being hurt. I proceeded to Westminster-hall, and I had not been there one minute before somebody catched hold of me Vickrey searched me, and found five pound notes, which was my own property, seven dollars and half a crown, and a cork-screw, and papers that I took coming along. I had no conversation with any one, nor had I any intention of committing a felony whatever. I am quite innocent of this business. I never had the pocket book in my possession; I was before Vickrey, and Preston behind me, I do not know how he could see me drop a pocket book, Mr. Vickrey and I being face to face, if I had dropped it, surely he must have seen the drop it.</p>

I watched him into Mr. Kemshin's yard again. I went to Bedford nursery-place, there I saw three pieces of timber lay; I saw the prisoner coming; I secreted myself; I saw him carry the three pieces of timber by turns to another house, he left the timber there and went to Mr. Kemshin's yard; I watched him in and out of the yard; he brought another piece of timber to the three-pieces. I then met with Mr. Clark; he took the prisoner that morning. The timber is in the Yard.</p>

This was on the Thursday. On the Friday I took the four-pieces and laid them near the house he was building; I took a memorandum in my book that the same pieces should be returned. I was no ways interested; I did it to serve the man as a friend.</p>

When I got out of the river, and was standing by my clothes three men came by the side of the river towards me; one of the men said, we will cut across to the Sluice House, and came directly by the side of my clothes and one of them took up a little dog that I had with me and run up the field with it; my brother ran after him and the two others were going up the field, and I grumbled about their touching the dog; they said let us go back and hit him; they came up to my clothes, I went past my clothes. The prisoner came as if to hit me; my brother said to me, have you lost any thing I put my watch to my hat; I looked in my hat and my watch was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any body take it did you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your watch again - A. No. The prisoner said, which of them took it, shall I run after them. I did not see either of them take it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this is one of them - A. I am sure that he is the one that came to hit me.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM ASHBY. Q. You went to bathe with your brother - A. Yes. When my brother was going across the field I told him to put his watch seal in; he would not. I put my seal in, and when we got to the river I went in first; they did not offer to come to my clothes. When my brother went in he put his watch in his hat; when he came out of the river there were three of them came across; there was no foot path where our clothes were; one of them said, let us go to the Sluice House, and another took up the dog; I went after him to get the dog; after I had got the dog the prisoner came up to my brother and offered to strike him, the third one took the watch out of his hat, while the prisoner was with my brother; I saw him take it out of the hat. The prisoner stood a little while, and said, which is the one that took the watch; he ran up to Highbury-barn, and the others ran to Cannonbury-house, I pursued the prisoner, he was stopped by the ostler at Highbury-barn; a gentleman took him down to the Cock at Islington; he winked to one of the other men that was in Islington, and they run away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to bathe, there were two young men going forward, they said they were going to bathe; I went with them; they said they were going towards the Sluice House; this young lad said he had lost his watch, I asked him who had got it, and I pursued him.</p>

On the 28th of April, about a quarter before seven in the morning, the prisoner came in the shop and asked the person that was standing at the counter for an ounce of coffee, the person had sufficient coffee ground on the counter to serve him, without turning his back; the prisoner observing this immediately asked for another ounce of a different price; this was obliged to be ground, and for the purpose of grinding it the person was obliged to turn his back; the prisoner took this opportunity when his back was turned towards him, to take two five shilling papers of halfpence and penny pieces that were on the counter, in the window. I was on the stairs and observed all this from the counter. The prisoner was in our shop the morning before and seemed to act in a strange way, which gave me suspicion. Upon his taking the coppers I came from the place where I was, I did not lose sight of him nor the coppers; he turned his back to the counter and held them to his breast, and before I got up to him he put the coppers on the counter, by the side of him. When I went up to him he seemed violently agitated, said he had never been guilty of such a thing before, and fell upon his knees, and begged we would not hurt him. An officer was sent for, he was taken in custody.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CLEMENTS. I was sent for. I took the prisoner in custody, I searched him, I only found on him ten or eleven new halfpence.</p>
               <p>Jones. These are the halfpence; there is my initials on them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into the shop for an ounce of coffee and a quartern of sugar. I never touched that property I am challenged with. I am innocent.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Parkin, a pawnbroker. On the 23rd of May, about five o'clock, I took the handkerchief in of the prisoner, I lent her one shilling and sixpence on it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked this handkerchief up at the foot of the stairs; I kept it a good while, and finding no enquiry about it, I thought it was my own; I wanted a few halfpence, I pledged it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>SAMUEL LACK. I am one of the Bow-street patrols On the 22nd of May, about twelve o'clock at night, as the people were coming from Covent Garden theatre, I saw Rogers following a gentleman at the corner of <placeName id="t18100606-106-crimeloc591">Bow-street</placeName>

I took him to the public house and searched him, and found in his breeches these two handkerchiefs, and this in his pocket; I cannot swear which handkerchief it was he took out of the gentleman's pocket. He went upon his knees and prayed very hard that I would let him go, and said it was his first offence.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

They came to me in prison, and asked me if I would give up the money I had upon me and they would not appear against me; I told them I would not, I would be tried by God and my country.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. On the 5th of May, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was passing through Oxford-street I observed the two prisoners at the bar. I observed the two prisoners and another in company with them, standing at the corner of Chapple-street, leading into Orchard-street, and having seen these prisoners before caused me to stop; they observed me and went away; they all three went down Great Chapple-street. I crossed Oxford-street, and looked down Chapple-street to see which way they turned; not seeing them I walked a little way up Oxford-street, in less than five minutes I saw them all three coming on the opposite side of the way, on the same side of the way they were on before; I hid myself by the side of a hackney coach; I saw each of them, as though they took it by turns, walk as far as Mr. Wyer's door; they did not go altogether. Gates took this portmanteau from off others that were placed at the door where it was standing for sale; immediately that he took it, Man and the other that is not apprehended ran off; they followed Gates, who had the portmanteau. Gates, on turning his head off, saw me coming after him; he ran with it as far as the corner of Titchfield-street, there he dropped it opposite of Mr. Leaf's door; he ran down Titchfield-street, I passed the portmanteau, into Dean-street, he took up Dean-street into Oxford-street again. I called out, stop thief; he crossed Oxford-street and ran to the corner of Rathbone-place, where he was stopped. I took him in custody. The prisoner asked me, what I wanted with him, he had done nothing; and as I was conveying him to the place where I saw the portmanteau drop, I found he had his hand in his waistcoat pocket, and he seemed very uneasy; I clapped my hand upon his hand as he had it in his pocket, and he brought out this clasped knife half open. I conveyed him back to the place where I saw the portmanteau drop. Mr. Leaf came out of the shop and said, you are looking for this, and gave the portmanteau to me; then conveyed him to the office. Man was not taken till the Wednesday night following. I know no more than seeing him in company with Gates.</p>

               <p>Q. You are sure as to their persons, are you - A. Yes, I know them both well.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at any time in April miss any cartridges - A. On Sunday, the 22nd of April, about one o'clock, I met the prisoner at the back door of the Nag's Head with about thirty-five ball cartridges in his hand; I desired him to return and to put them in the pouches he took them from. He returned, and put them into pouches, but not the right, they were improperly put; and the men being short of cartridges reported it to their officers. The men's pouches were placed in this public-house while they attended Divine Service. These ball cartridges are furnished by government. The commanding officer ordered him to be taken in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. How much do you think these ball cartridges could have been sold for - A. I do not know the value of them; the men are, I understand, charged three-pence a piece.</p>

Roberts and Plowmen, and one of their men brought some patterns; she said, she could not judge of the patterns, she wished to see the pieces. The young man went and brought a number of pieces; she fixed on two remnants, and requested the young man to bring some plain sarcenet, and to leave the two pieces and she would fix on one of the two while he was gone.

I never saw the prisoner again till the Sunday before Easter. The little girl returned without either of the pieces. I have been made to answer for the sarcenet.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw her again, what passed - A. I was going through St. Paul's Church-yard with the little girl's father I saw her, and he took hold of her. I charged her with taking the two pieces of sarcenet from my girl; she made no answer whatever, and never spoke during the time of taking her to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What has been charged to you for the sarcenet - A. Eight pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand that the captain was to pay for it - A. I understood that she was to pay for it, and that she had the money in her pocket; she said, he had given her eight pounds to pay for it.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon after you had taken the horse out of the cart did Mr. Boulcott's foreman come - A. About half an hour after Mr. Hawkins came. The staves were all in the cart then; I told him I brought them from Smith.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Mr. Hawkins.) In consequence of information that you received, where did you go - A. I went immediately to Mr. Warren, and by his directions I went on the Commercial-road to Hutchinson's yard, there I found the cart in the yard with thirty-six staves in it. I looked round the yard, I saw an hundred staves fixed on a pile, which I recognised having lost from the wharf; and the thirty-six in the cart I knew directly when I saw them. I saw Mr. Hutckinson, and he sent for Kerr. Kerr went to the prisoner's house, he was not at home. About three quarters of an hour afterwards we took the prisoner at the King's Head, by Limehouse-corner. I asked him where he got the staves I found at Mr. Hutchinson's; he said, he had bought them of a master lighterman, he did not know his name. I then went with him to his own house; he said, he had four more staves of the same sort, which he had bought of the same man; he desired me to go and look at them; he found them and brought them to us, they had every appearance to be the same kind of staves, but no marks on them. I found thirty-six staves in the cart at Hutchinson's, sixteen of them were marked; they were Dantzic staves.</p>

               <p>Q. What were you to give for the staves - A. I know nothing of them; I had given nothing for them. As soon as the staves were claimed I sent for my carman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. When Mr. Hawkins was at your premises, did he not say that he could not undertake to speak to them - A. Close to the side of the cart he saw the hundred that I bought the week before, he overhauled them and said, he could not find the brand marks. I examined them and found half a dozen that had the mark, there was no chalk mark at all, that was the hundred: with respect to the thirty-six in the cart, part of the thirty-six bore his mark that he could swear to, that is what he calls the ring.</p>

I told him I would call up at breakfast time, and look at it, my son and I went at eight o'clock, it was a frame saw, I bought it of him for fifteen shillings, the next day he shewed me the other saw, it was a long saw, I gave him fifteen shillings for that, he told me the saws belonged to Thomas Hill he was gone to sea, his wife wanted him to sell them.

In a back room these men were kept in custody pretty nigh a week, I went twice with Fox to the prisoner's lodgings, I saw the wife, and she gave me evasive answers; I left word with the wife that these two men were going into the country to cut some deals for me, and that if he would meet me at the Jacob's Well, and bring the saw box that belonged to the long saw, I would advance the money for them, as they were short of money that bait took; I waited there till about half past ten, the prisoner came to the Jacob's Well, I laid hold of him; I asked him if he did not sell two saws to Fox; he said, no, it was a friend of his that sold them that would be there presently; he denied his name being Birt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that friend ever arrive - A. No, I took him into the kitchen, and told him he had led two innocent men into an error though his bad conduct; he said, that he had them of a woman to sell, her husband was gone to sea; I asked him where that woman lived; he said, he should not tell me, then I immediately handcuffed him and brought him away.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that woman here - A. No, they were brought to me where I live.</p>

I could not go after him and leave the shop, my husband was out; about two minutes after my husband came in; I went after him, and came up to him; I accused him of taking the dollar; he said he had not seen a dollar to day; I told him he had better come back. He came back to my shop, and while he was standing in the shop, Mr. Man, who keeps the next wine vaults, came in, he went into the back parlour, beckoned us to come and speak with him; my husband went. Mr. Man said he took a dollar of the prisoner; we were persuaded to let him go and sell his fish, and in about three hours he was taken and committed.</p>

Yes; I told them the prisoner had left a dollar with me about a quarter of an hour before I went in; he had a glass of gin and left the dollar untill he had been round with his fish, and then he would return; he frequently left money; he is in the habit of taking a good deal of copper; he brings the copper and takes the silver away.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took charge of the prisoner; Mr. Man's wife gave me the dollar in the presence of Mr. Man. When I got the prisoner down to the office his brother in law came to him, he said, you had better pay the dollar back; he began to make an oath in the Irish language.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Crossland. Was it such a dollar as that - A. I cannot speak to the dollar, it has the same appearance; it was not a very bright one.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent; I know nothing about it. I went to Mr. Low's house after I left Mrs. Reading, she came there to me and asked me for the dollar; I turned my pockets out in Mr. Low's house; Mr. Low said you had better go back and have yourself examined at Mr. Reading's house; I did, and was examined, and then they sent me about my business.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

On the 22nd of May I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181006060058"/>coming in at the street-door, and behind the street-door I saw the prisoner, I asked her what she did there; she said she was tyeing her stocking; she then wanted to pass me with her gown under her arm; I saw the pot handle stick out; I asked her what she had got there; she replied, I am going to take it to Mr. Wells; I will give it to you.</p>

A lodger of mine came in, I desired her to go up, she found him slipping down stairs with the boots under his coat; she catched hold of him; in the struggle he dropped one of the boots in the court; I cried out stop thief, and they stopped him; I took the other boot from under his coat.</p>

I wish you would go up to see where that man is; I got one foot on the stairs, he was coming down stairs very softly indeed; I saw the boots under his coat; he told the landlady he would call again in half an hour; I let him go; he dropped one of the boots in the court.

               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

No, nor I never witnessed his writing, only a small mark as a delivery check; the defendant puts a small R, as received to the three shillings and two pence carriage, and sixpence porterage. I did not see him make the mark; it acknowledges the receipt of the parcel.</p>

            , I am foreman to Mr. Jefferies, No. 10, Barbican. On the 31st of May, about eleven o'clock, the prisoner came and asked for a pair of shoe strings, they came to two pence, she tendered to me a bad shilling; I then produced a counterfeit shilling that she had brought the over night, and went for a constable. I delivered the prisoner and the two shillings to the constable.</p>

            . On the 30th of May the prisoner came into my shop for a pair of shoe strings, I served her, they came to two-pence; she gave me a shilling and I gave her change. I noticed a C upon it, and put it into my pocket; I had one other shilling in my pocket, that shiling had no mark upon it at all; she went away, and about six or seven o'clock the same evening she came in again for a pair of shoe strings; she was served with them, they came to two pence; she gave me a shilling, I gave her change; immediately upon her going I had a suspicion; I sent my man after her, he could not see her. The last shilling I kept in my hand, I compared it with the other shilling with the C, I discovered they were both counterfeits; I then put them in my pocket separate. I know this shilling with the C upon it to be the first shilling that the prisoner tendered to me. These are the shillings; the first shilling has a C upon it, and the third shilling a P. Sometime after the prisoner was gone a customer came into my shop, she wanted a sixpence in change of the article she purchased; I gave the first shilling with a C upon it to my man to get two sixpences; I saw the same shilling on the next morning, Mrs. Watts said it was a bad one, she brought it back to me. I knew it to be the first shilling tendered to me by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. to Ibbett. Your master has told us that he gave you the first shilling uttered with a C upon it, and you got two sixpences of Mrs. Watts - A. Yes; she refused it at the time. The same shilling that I received from my master I gave to Mrs. Watts.</p>
               <p>MRS. WATTS. I live at the Still in Barbican; I received a shilling of Ibbett, I gave him two sixpences; I laid it by itself; afterwards I discovered it to be a bad one, it was marked with a letter C. I returned the shilling to Mr. Jefferies.</p>
               <p>- SUNDERLAND. I am a constable. Ibbett gave me two shillings, and when the second examination was I had another shilling gave me by Ibbett.</p>
               <p>Q. to Ibbett. Did you give the last shilling uttered to you to the constable - A. Yes; it has a letter P upon it.</p>

            , I live at the sign of the French Horn, Beech-street. On the evening of the 4th of February the prisoner and another person came to my house together, I served them with six glasses of port wine, it came to three shillings; the prisoner put down a seven shilling piece and told me to take the reckoning; I rung the seven shilling piece and weighed it, it was a good one, I put it back in my till and was going to give change, the other person put down a five shilling piece and said he would pay for it; Dalton said, give me back my seven shilling piece again; I returned him the same seven shilling piece, I had no other in the house. The crown piece laid on the counter, he took it off and said he would not pay for it; then Dalton gave me a seven shilling piece back again; I thought it was the same, I throwed it back in the till, I did not ring or weigh it. I had no other seven shilling piece in the house. I gave them their change and they went away. In less than two minutes after they went out I suspected them; I weighted the seven shilling piece. I found it was not the same, it was a bad one; I called my servant Rachel, I told her I took a bad seven shilling piece of the men that were drinking at the bar; I put the seven shilling piece in a bit of paper, delivered it to her, and directed her to go out of the house; she came back in two or three minutes; in the course of two or three days Dalton came to my house again, he had a glass of part wine: I took this seven shilling piece out of the till. I asked him if he knew it, he gave it me on the Sunday night, it was a bad one; he said he did not knew where he took it, and if I would let have it he would give me another for it; he had not one about him then; I would not let him have it. In a few weeks after Mr. Pugh came to me, and I found the prisoner in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did you give the seven shilling piece that you received of the prisoner - A. To no one; it had not been out of my possession, only to my servant two or three minutes, except when the prisoner was in custody, I gave it to Mr. Pugh.</p>

            . I am a widow, I keep a chandler's shop in Chapel-street, Grub-street. On the 24th of February, between ten and eleven in the evening, the prisoners came to my shop, Dalton turned himself round and said, I think we shall have some bacon; I said, I do not sell bacon, he said, never mind, we will have some cheese; they had half a pound, it came to five-pence halfpenny; Dalton put a seven shilling piece on the counter, I weighed it and found it to be a good one; he said, you seem to scruple it, you had better weigh it again; he kept it in his fingers and put down the same again, as I thought, but it was not the same; I said, there is no necessity of weighing it again. I gave him the change. Williams took the cheese. When they were gone I discovered the seven shilling piece to be a bad one. I have had the seven shilling piece in my possession ever since.</p>

            , you were convicted in April Sessions of stealing a pocket book, a handkerchief, and gloves; from the evidence it appears that the things were taken from the person of Charles Thompson by the prisoner, under such circumstances, and without such force as is sufficient to constitute the crime of robbery. In the statute the 49th of 
               <persName id="o18100606-1-person1046">George</persName>
             the Third, it is enacted that every person who shall feloniously steal goods from the person of any other without their knowledge or not, and without any such force as is sufficient to constitute the crime of robbery, shall be transported beyond the seas for life, or for a term of seven Years, or to imprisonment only. That there was a felonious taking from the person in this case, without such force as is sufficient to constitute the crime of robbery, and it could only be punished as a common larceny, as the learned judges are of opinion; but as the learned judge who tried the man thought proper to defer the objection made by the counsel, to the opinion of the judges, whether it appeared in evidence that the things taken from the prosecutor were taken by the prisoner or accomplice, and whether the prisoner, under the statute of the 49th of 
               <persName id="o18100606-1-person1047">George</persName>
             the Third could be convicted. The judges unanimously are of opinion that the prisoner, under these circumstances that appear in this case, might well be convicted. Looking in this case as it is laid in the indictment, and looking into the statute, it is clear that the Legislature did not mean to alter the law respecting robbery, they only meant to alter it from a capital offence to transportation for life, or to a term of seven years, or to imprisonment only, to be kept to hard labour. This statute not being meant to alter the law respecting robbery, describes it as taking from the person of another money or goods, whether privily, without his knowledge, or not without such force or fear as is sufficient to constitute the crime of robbery, leaving the event of taking with force punishable, as heretofore, by a capital conviction. This indictment, therefore, not containing a capital charge, it is not an indictment for robbery, it is an indictment for taking from the person, though there might be such force as might warrant a conviction for robbery, yet the prisoner could not be convicted of a capital offence. The judges are therefore unanimously of opinion, that the offence is well charged and may be punished by <rs id="o18100606-1-punish765" type="punishmentDescription">

            , in February Sessions you were charged with stealing a quantity of promissory notes, drawn upon stamped paper, stating them to be, in one count , the property of Messrs. Large and co. and in another, the property of Messrs. Brown and co. and in another, the property of Messrs. Waterhouse and co; and other counts charging the prisoner with stealing one hundred and thirty-five pieces of stamped paper. Upon looking at the facts stated in the case, it appears that Messrs. Large and co. corresponded with the house of Messrs. Brown and co.; that Messrs Large and co. lost all the notes that were paid at the house of Messrs. Brown and co.; and previous to the 2nd of January these notes were put into a parcel directed to Messrs. Large and co. Wotten Bassett, to be forwarded by the mail coach. On the 2nd of January they were received by the bookkeeper at the Swan and Two Necks inn, Lad-lane, directed to Messrs . Large and co. and were entered in the book; they were regularly forwarded by that bookkeeper. They did not arrive at Messrs. Large and co. this parcel was never received by them. By an act of parliament, they, as bankers, are permitted to reissue their notes for three years; and these notes having never been received by them, they have been under the necessity of issuing other notes, with other stamps; they would have reissued these notes, had they received them. The notes received by Messrs. Brown and co. in London must go back to Messrs. Large and co. at Wotton Basset, to be reissued; so that if they were stole in London, and never got back to Wotton Basset, they could not be reissued by them. By the evidence it appears several of the notes were traced to the prisoner. There was an objection made by the prisoner's counsel on each of the three last counts , of stealing the stamps, that these counts could not be maintained, because they were used; they were not saleable, nor where they convertable to any other purpose whatever, though the bankers reissued them; but that the paper and stamp upon which they were, were worth nothing. The question is , whether the paper and stamps are the subjects of larceny - whether they are the property of the persons mentioned in the indictment . The paper and stamps had belonged to, and did belong to Messrs. Large and co. which notes had been issued notes, and do not appear to have been issued more than once, and they were then of value to Messrs. Large and co. so long as they had not been issued three times . They were the goods of Messrs. Large and co. and which as such may be the subject of larceny, as well as other papers and stamps. It is enough if they are chattels valuable to the possessor, it is not necessary that they should be valuable to other persons. They are of value to Messrs. Large and co. to the price of the stamp, so they are the subject of larceny, and therefore the conviction is good.</p>
