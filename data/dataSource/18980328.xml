                  </hi>. I am an Italian, a mining engineer—at present I live at the Plough Inn, Erith—I arrived from Johannesburg on December 3rd or 4th in the "Norman"—a few days after, I was walking in Oxford Street—this was between seven and eight in the evening—the prisoner spoke to me—he was a stranger—he asked me if I was an American, and I told him I came from Johannesburg, and was going to Klondyke, and was an Italian—he said he had a brother in Johannesburg, and that he would give me a drink and explain what clothes would be necessary for Klondyke—we discussed this question at the public-house—it was quite close—we had a drink, and he paid—after we had entered an old gentleman came in and asked the way to Madame Tussaud's—I told him I was a stranger—he sat talking for some time—he showed us a bundle of notes, which he said were real bank notes—I did not read them—the prisoner proposed to meet next morning at London Bridge Station to talk about Klondyke—the old gentleman said he would join us at the London Bridge House Hotel—when he pulled the notes out of his pocket the prisoner said, "Look what a silly, showing money to the people"—I said</p>

               <p>to the old man, "You be careful; do not show money like that"—I went home, and next morning I met the prisoner outside London Bridge Station—we went to the hotel, and met the old gentleman inside—I think we had a drink, and entered into a general conversation—the prisoner asked me how much money I had in my pocket—I said I had a £70 note and a £700 cheque—that was a fact—the day before I had £75, and I had spent £5—I showed the cheque to them, and the prisoner said, "You had better cash it"—and he took a cab and went to Glyn Mills bank, in Lombard Street—he suggested that I should have small notes, and the cashier said, "Don't carry too large a sum of money," and he wanted me to have £100 notes—but the prisoner said, "No, it is too big"—when we got back to the hotel the old gentleman was waiting—he said he would be very charitable to my people, and I said if he would I would give him my watch and chain—I meant that seriously—I suggested that we should have dinner, but he said, "No, business first"—the business was to steal my money—we talked about Klondyke, they were not going with me—then the old gentleman asked the prisoner if he trusted him, and the prisoner said, "Yes"—that he had £13,000 in his pocket book, and that he would put it in the old man's pocket—the prisoner then asked me if I trusted him, and I said, "Yes," and I put my pocket book in his pocket, and they went to the bar to have a drink—I asked a waiter to watch them, and gave him 6d.—after a few minutes the waiter came back, and said something to me—I then went to look for the two men, but could not find them—I then drove to the bank and tried to stop the notes—then I told the police—I have never seen the old man since—I gave him my watch and chain—I have not seen that since—I have been to Italy since this happened, but on March 16th I was in St. Paul's Cathedral—I saw the prisoner there, he was sitting on a chair, when he saw me he turned white, and I took him by his jacket and said I would call the police, he said, "Don't call the police, I will give you all the money I have got, cheques, bank notes, everything"—from his boots he took some bank notes—I examined them, and he took off his coat, ran away, and put a bench to trip me up, but I got him by the neck and he did not run away any more—I held him till the police came up.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am certain that this is the man—if I saw the old man I should know him at once—I was with them for three-quarters of an hour in Oxford Street—the appointment for the next morning was made for the London Bridge House Hotel, but the prisoner met me at the station—I had told him where I was living—I am not sure whether the old man came from the door or from the other room of the public-house in Oxford Street, but we were there first—it was the old man who asked me if I trusted him—I gave the waiter at the hotel sixpence to watch them—it was less than 10 minutes after I had given him sixpence that I found the men were gone—I am not sure if the prisoner is dressed in the same clothes, but they are like them—when I saw him in St. Paul's Cathedral I think he was dressed in the same clothes as now—I was with a young lady—she is not here now—she went to call the police—I do not know if she heard my conversation with the prisoner—I told her to call the police as soon as I got the prisoner—I told him to come with me, I wanted to take him to the station—he did not say "I am not the man, on what</p>

Glyn, Mills and Currie, of Lombard Street—on December 7th I remember prosecutor coming to the bank with another person—to the best of my belief it was the prisoner, but he has altered his appearance in some way or other—Mr. Ruggiere came to cash a cheque for £700—I gave him bank notes—I think I asked him if he was going abroad, and I said I thought it would be better if he took a draft, as it was a large amount of notes to take about with him—I did not hear the other person speak to him—the prosecutor said large notes at first, then the prisoner spoke to him, and I think advised him to take smaller ones, but I could not catch it, and then the prose<lb/>cutor asked for small ones—I have one of the numbers here, it is 39820—that was a £10 Bank of England note.</p>

I am the wife of Theodore Mackenzie, of 106, Silchester Road, Netting Hill—on February 7th, the two prisoners came to my shop about middle day—Jacobs said he had been in the neigh<lb/>bourhood three days looking for a retired captain who had been very good to him—he said he had asked a postman, who told him the captain had gone away, and he came to ask me if I knew him—Perez was with him carrying a long bag—Jacobs said he had met Perez at Netting Hill Station, and had given him 5s. to show him the way to find his captain—Jacobs then went across to the Latimer Arras, and Perez, stayed behind—while Jacobs was gone Perez undid the bag, and said, "I will take the liberty of showing you these lovely presents"—Notting Hill Station was about five minutes' walk—while he was showing me the things Jacobs came back, and Perez turned round and said, "I am just showing the things"—Jacobs said he had given £15 for the muff and collar, and £8 for the table cloth, and that he could not take them back because the duty was so heavy—Perez said, "Let us take them back to the man Joseph, who offered you £8 for them"—Jacobs said, "I will not take them to Joseph, he is a Jew"—he then said, "I will let you have them for £2, as I cannot take them back"—he said he would let them go so cheap because he could not find the captain, and had to catch his ship at one o'clock—he was almost crying—I said I would not take them, because I never would buy anything without my husband's consent—Perez urged me to take them as they were so cheap—I refused to take them, and they left—Constable Stephens came to my shop, and I made a statement to him—those are the articles they brought (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

I live at Baum Street Buildings, Spitalfields—on January 19th I was going with a barrow and 104 pairs of boots towards High Holborn—I was going to the Harrow Road—I started about three o'clock and got to High Holborn about 3.30—close to the Royal Music Hall the prisoner came and said "Will you run over to Mr. Isaac's the fruiterer's and get a funeral wreath, and bring it up to Mr. Pintoe's"—I had never seen him before—I could see the shop from there—it was only about 12 yards away—I said, "Who will mind the barrow?"—he said "I will go and see what the boy is doing"—he went away—he was dressed in black—he came back and said the boy was having his tea—I then left the barrow with him and ran over the road—I was only away about a minute—I did not get the wreath—they told me to go to another place but I did not—when I got back the prisoner and the barrow were gone—I went upstairs and made inquiries, and then told the police—on February 25th. I went to Bow Street police-station and was shown 10 men, and I picked out the prisoner—I charged him with having stolen a harrow and 104 pairs of boots—he said he never saw me before—I did not know anything about his powers of hearing, he seemed all right—when I was talking to him in the street he got close, and put his ear to me as if he was rather deaf.</p>

                  </hi>. I am 13 years old—I live at 16, Hogarth Avenue, Cheswick—on March 3rd I was playing outside the gates of Providence House, Hogarth Lane, and calling Mr. Wood "Old Daddy Wood"—I did not think he would like it—Samuel Wiltshire was with me—he pushed open the gate of the garden—he is nine years old—it was a little door that leads to the front of the house—it is nearly nine feet high—a gun went off—I had been there from just after two till just before three p.m. with about four others—I had not shouted after him before—his wife told us to come round the gate and call after him—when the gun went off I felt something come in my face and arm and on my head, and it started bleeding—I ran home—I saw Scanlan wounded—he is six years old—I did not fall—I saw a lot of smoke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Some of the boys were there from about twelve o'clock—we were not shouting all the time—there were 40 or 50 boys there—Wood did not come out and tell us to go away—the boys shouted and started throwing mud and stones—I did not throw at the windows, the stones hit the wall—I did not throw stones—I threw mud—I did not say before the Magistrate that Wood told us to go away—nine or ten boys pushed the gate—we pushed the big gates down just before two o'clock—we went home to dinner—we were not doing it more than three or four minutes, not from 1.30 to three—the boys went to school at two o'clock—we did not throw bricks, there were none about there—I have heard that Wood prosecuted one boy—I did not know the gates were propped up—this was the first day I was there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer of 40, William Street, Chiswick—I know the prisoner lives at Providence House, Hogarth Lane—on the afternoon of March 3rd I was coming back from the waterworks at Hammersmith—I saw 20 or 30 boys (children), not 50—I said before the Magistrate there were 50—I did not count them, there were a lot; there might have been 30 to 40—I fastened the gates—I spoke to Faulkner to get him away—I did not see them throw stones over the wall—I said before the Magistrate "I had also seen them throw stones and bricks over the wall, and they hollowed 'Old Daddy Wood' as loud as they could"—that was afterwards—there were no bricks—I was employed outside Providence House about 2.30 or 2.45—I heard a gun fired and screams and I saw Wood with the gun resting on his feet—I saw Scanlan—I could not see his face for blood—I took the gun away—Wood said, "I have been and given them pepper," or "he has got pepper," and "I do not suppose they will trouble me any more"—the boys seem to have driven the man melancholy by their annoyance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I reckon they were throwing stones and bricks for 15 to 20 minutes, and shouting out "Old Daddy Wood"—nearly all Wood's windows had been broken—I made Wood drop the gun—Wood was bleeding from the left wrist—I am 32 next August—I have not been prosecuted nor anyone connected with me by Wood—I have six children and nephews—a young chap lives in the house—his name is not Huxley</p>

                  </hi>. I am Divisional Surgeon of Police at Chiswick—I examined the boy Faulkner on March 3rd—I found a small shot on the upper part of the scalp of the head and one on the right side of the jaw, just at the angle, and one in the right shoulder—the wounds were not deep—they were not dangerous unless erysipelas set in—he is now perfectly well—I also attended Scanlan—I found a superficial wound on the right temple, on the right shoulder of the leg, and on the stomach and chest: seven or eight wounds altogether—I believe a full charge of powder would have knocked the boys down—these boys were not knocked down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have attended the prisoner for several years—he had been annoyed by boys—I have heard that he has prosecuted boys—I have attended him for erysipelas—he has written to the vicar of the parish about the boys, and to the police I have heard—the annoyance was systematic, I would not say from day to day—he is about 70 years of age and might act impulsively—he is of an excitable temperament.</p>

               <p>sometimes went to visit them in the back room—I cannot say whether Olga was a friend of Theodore's—I first saw the prisoner there on the Friday afternoon, in the back room, third floor—he was talking to Olga there, I was there with them, I afterwards went out leaving them there, they were talking in German—I don't understand German—they appeared to be on perfectly friendly terms, he tried to kiss her but she would not let him—I had heard something said about Olga going away at that time—I can't say when I first heard of that, it was in the same week—I can't say on what day—Olga told me about it herself—she said she was going to live with the prisoner—I knew she had a dress material and a hat bought her by the prisoner—she told me so herself—I was going to leave the house on the Sunday following—on the Saturday I was at home all day—I know a man named Kin—I did not know that he worked for the prisoner—he used to come every evening to the restaurant to have his supper—he came up to our room on the Saturday evening about four—Olga was there—I know that he went to bed when it was hardly dark—the prisoner came in while the three of us were there, and 'he and Olga were talking together in German—they were on friendly terms—shortly after she put on her hat and jacket, and they went out together—she asked me to stop at home while she was out, that the prisoner was going to buy her a ring—soon after they had gone out Kin also left, and Michael also left for a Kttle—he came back—I then laid down on the bed in the back room—there was a lamp alight—Isodore was the next person who came in—Olga was the next—she brought with her some tea and meat, and also a box with some booty—she also told me he had bought her a ring—she told me that he had bought her these things—she and I went out together to a public-house at the corner on the other side of the bridge—when we went out Olga locked Michael in his room and took the key with her—at the public-house we found Theodore, Isodore, and Clements—Olga asked them to come home, and they all three came to the house—the prisoner was then in the restaurant below—I can't say whether he was alone—I did not see him—Olga told me he was there drinking some coffee—Olga was going to leave on the Monday—I knew nothing about her going to leave on the Saturday—when we came back to the house we all went upstairs together to the back room—I did not think the prisoner was waiting to take her away—Olga told me that she expected him—when we all got into the room I sat on the bed, Olga sat on a chair by the side of me—I forgot to say that when we had returned to the room Clement paid Olga two shillings rent—then, after a while, Theodore, Isodore and Clement came along down stairs—nothing was said about why they were going—as the prisoner was coming up I heard him say "Good evening" to the boys, when they were on the landing—I did not see him; I only recognized his voice—there was no light on the staircase—judging by his voice, I should judge he was on the third floor landing—when he said "Good evening," Olga said, "Oh! here comes Karacheski; what does he want here?" I don't remember her saying anything else—I think she said "What the devil does he want to come here for"—she was very bad tempered about his coming—she spoke of the three men as the "boys"—they are all younger</p>

               <p>than the prisoner—Olga called him "the widower"—she used to say "I have got a widower"—when she said "What does he want up here," she asked the boys "to throw him down stairs"—directly after I heard the prisoner say "Good evening" there was a great noise, they were fighting on the landing—they were all shouting—I ran out of the door and shouted "Oh, they are fighting"—I saw the prisoner fire a shot and Clement fell to the ground, they were all standing in a heap struggling together before I heard the shot—Olga had ran out with me and we ran back into the room and the others also—Theodore shut the door—the prisoner was left outside—the others were holding the door to keep him out—there was a handle to the door—it opened from the out<lb/>side, there was a lock inside—they did not lock it because the key was gone, it must have fallen out—the prisoner was hammering at the door—he called out "Mrs. Wysoska, Mrs. Wysoska, come out all of you, or I will shoot the lot of you" and directly after he fired—nobody answered, they all remained quiet—I was injured by the first shot in the arm—I then left the door and went and lay down on the bed by the side of the door—directly afterwards a second shot was fired and I was Olga turn pale and sink to the ground, and Theodore called out "Mrs. Wysoska, Mrs. Wysoska," but she did not answer a word—both the shots that struck me and Olga came through the door—Theodore was still holding the door, when the prisoner burst the door open and came into the room with the revolver in his hand—I saw Theodore catch <hi rend="italic">hold of</hi> his coat and I shouted "Theodore he has got the revolver in his hand"—he was holding it as if ready to fire—I can't say that he was pointing it, because Theodore was wrenching it out of his hand; almost directly Isodore went under the bed—Theodore got the revolver from the prisoner—some policemen then came up and I went out of the room—I can't remember what was done to the prisoner, or how his head got knocked—I caught hold of him, the police came up directly after—I can't remember whether another shot was fired after the prisoner came into the room—I did not hear him say anything more about Olga after he came in.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi>).I received some information about October with regard to the prisoner and a man named Laterner—who is not in this country now—I went to a house at 8, Bury Street, St. Mary's Axe, and saw the prisoner leave it—I knew Laterner by sight; I saw him near this house with the prisoner—about October 24th, Laterner left England, within a day or two of that date—I have seen the prisoner since then, I knew he was living in the East End—on February 16th, I visited the Chatham and Dover Railway Station, about, 12.15, and on my way there I passed along Victoria Street and turned down towards the left—when I got near the station I saw the prisoner at the bottom of Victoria Street—I stopped and watched him, he was apparently looking at the shops—I lost sight of him and then went on to the station, and transacted my business there—I had to meet two of my plain-clothes officers at Vauxhall Bridge Road—I arranged that we should go to the Underground Railway Station to see if the prisoner would turn up again—we then returned to the station and saw the prisoner crossing the road, coming towards me—I stopped him just before going down the steps to the</p>

               <p>Station, and said to him, "Your name is Koenig"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "We are police officers"—he said "Yes, I know, this is all spite, I have got it and you know who gave it to me"—he handed me some papers, including a Russian bond which he took from his vest pocket—I have it here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there were also some coupons—I examined the bond and said, "You will have to give an account of your possession of this bond"—he said, "Yes, it is all a piece of spite"—I took him to Rochester Row police-station—I showed him an envelope which he had handed me with the address, Mr. Koenig, 3, Eastbury Terrace, Berinondsey Mile End—I found on him a five rouble note and a small Russian revenue stamp (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is as I found it—I left him at Rochester Row—I then went to Eastbury Terrace—I had some difficulty in getting in for about 15 minutes—I went in and found a £50 Bank of England note, six £5 Bank of England notes, <hi rend="italic">one</hi> five rouble note, one 50 franc note, one letter with the name and address torn <hi rend="italic">off</hi>, all in the back bedroom on the first floor, and a number of other papers—I then returned to the police-station and saw the prisoner—I said to him, "I am about to ask you some questions as to how you became possessed of this bond and these notes, but any answer you give may be used in evidence against you"—he replied, "I quite understand"—I said, "Where did you get this five rouble note"—he said, "I bought it from a Russian two or three weeks ago in Whitechapel"—I said, "Can you give me his address"—he said, "No, I gave him 10s. for it in a public-house, he was a stranger to me"—I said, "And where did you get this bond"—he said, "I got it also from a Russian, but not the same one, a few weeks ago in another public-house, he gave it to me to sell for him"—I said, Can you give me his address"—he said, "I don't know it, and don't know where you can find him, I have had it several weeks"—I asked him how he got the bank notes—he said he got the £50 note at the Bank of England in exchange for a £100 note, and the £100 note he got abroad—as to the six £5 notes he said, "I got them for gold, you can always exchange notes for gold"—pointing to the five rouble note and the bond I said, "Are these documents genuine"—and he said, "Yes, certainly." He was charged at the station with having a Russian rouble bond in his possession and not giving a satisfactory account of it—the charge was read to him—he said, "It is all a piece of spite, I got it from a man name <hi rend="italic">Jim</hi> a few minutes before you saw me." I had not seen him in the company of anyone on February 16th.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think there were four remands in the case extending over about a month—the prosecution was conducted by the Treasury—the whole of my story was not told on one occasion, there was an interval between the first and second part of it—I did not give any evidence with regard to the instances in October, I did not think it necessary—I do not think I mentioned the name "Laterner"—I did not refer to the letter or to the stamp before the Magistrate—when I was at Victoria Station I saw Koeing looking into the shops, and lost sight of him after having seen him for about ten minutes—I did not see him again for about 25 minutes or half an hour, not much longer, it might have been 35 minutes—I saw him about twelve o'clock, and kept observation on him for about 15 minutes, and the next time I saw him was about one o'clock—I then spoke to him.

               <p>were three public-houses near the spot—he then made the statement about it being spite—he produced the papers and amongst them the bond—I did not find the five rouble note till I got to the station—I mentioned the bond before I got to the station—I had it in my possesion before I went to search the house—he made the first statement about one o'clock and the second at six in the evening, and I wrote the statements down in less than an hour afterwards—the statements were not written down a few minutes ago, I will pledge myself to that—after making the statements he was charged, less than five minutes after—he said, "I had not had that bond two minutes, the man has done this for spite"—it was then that the name "Jim" was mentioned—I believe it was "Jim"—I will not swear, it might have been James—he said he did not know who he was—the name James Joyce was suggested—I went to an address at Hammersmith but cannot find the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Bonnydown Road, East Ham, and am a collector—on March 15th, at 11.30, I was in Tidal Basin Road, and on leaving No. 91 saw the three prisoners—Towner said, "We want some beer," I said, "I have not any beer to give you"—he struck me, and before I could fall they got me by my shoulders, and two of them got my hands behind me and tried to throw me on my face; several blows were given me behind, across my shoulders and neck; they put their hands in my pocket; I had about 12s. 3d., and Host 5s. 9d. Mrs. Ward came up while we were struggling and began to speak to them, which attracted their attention so that I liberated myself and went back into No. 9 and remained there while you could count 15—and when I came out I saw the three prisoners assaulting Mrs. Ward and calling her filthy names—a constable came up shortly afterwards and I went with him to the Gibraltar Tavern and saw the three prisoners in front of the bar—I pointed out Towner and the constable took him—I went to the station leaving the two others there—I suffered pain in my jaw for some time afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a domestic servant residing at Bedford—In April, 1897, I was in the family-way—I saw an advertisement in a newspaper, and on April 27th I went to Mrs. Walker at 244, Ladbroke Grove, Netting Hill—I took a room there, and was confined there on July 23rd of a healthy full-time male child—on July 27th the prisoner called there and saw me, she gave her name as Mrs. Ellis—she said that she wished to have the child to adopt, because it was a nice healthy boy—she wanted to have a dark child, that she had had two and could not get them to live—that her husband was a <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> conductor in a good position to keep the baby—she did not tell me that she wanted to stay at the house—she said I was not to own the child but I could say it was a friend's—she did not require any payment whatever, but she said she would like a good outfit and I provided one for the child—I paid about £3 altogether for it—the bill for £1 5s. 7d. to F. W. Sugden is part of the £3 and I made some of the things myself—I bought a cloak, robe, hat and fall, and made some of the nightgowns and dresses—on August 8th I went home—until I went home Mrs. Walker used to attend and dress the child, but twice I think Mrs. Ellis did it—she was there when I came away—she came on the Thursday, then went away, and came again on the Tuesday—I had had the child vaccinated, and when I left it was in good health. Mrs. Walker and Dr. Francis attended me in my confine<lb/>ment. When I got home I wrote this letter to the prisoner: "August 14th—Dear Mrs. Ellis,—I am writing as I promised; I sent you a wire on Monday; I don't know whether you got it, I was there at the Marble Arch from twelve until 1.30; I was sorry to leave you. I <hi rend="italic">gest</hi> what it would be when I left; how did you get on with them? I have often thought about you, and also your son; hope he is quite well; the same yourself; hope you arrived home safe; write back soon because I am leaving here on Saturday next; send me all the news about them then. I will write to you again when I am settled. Trusting this will find you both well, also your son. From your sincerely friend, <hi rend="smallCaps">

Dear Fanny, of cours you will think it funny I did not meet you on Monday, but I left Mrs. Walker on Sunday evening. I felt very queer, and you could tell by my husband's letters he wanted us home. I am so glad to tell you my baby is getting on lovely; he is growing fatter every day, I am going to have him christened on Sunday; his arm is getting on all right, it is all dried up; but I will now say goodbye, dear friend, and God bless you, and believe me to remain your affectionate friend, <hi rend="smallCaps">MAUDE E. ELLIS</hi>, write back soon"—on October 14th I wrote this—"My dear Mrs. Ellis—You must think me ungrateful for not answering your letter before, the reason was because I am so unsettled. I am leaving this place on Saturday, going back to Bedford dear old home. And I also think of running up to London on Wednesday if all is well, before I go into another place. Do you think it will be convenient for me to call and see you then, should like very much to see your son, hope he is well, also yourself. I simply dread winter coming, for I do feel the cold so much, if not time to answer this to-day send on to Bedford before Wednesday. Trusting thin will find you all well, from yours truly, <hi rend="smallCaps">KANNY TEAR</hi>."—I did not write between August and October—I did not get any reply, and I did not write to her again—the letter was not returned to me—the policeman came about a day after that—I heard of the child's death the next day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was with the prisoner at this place for about 10 days, and she always appeared kind and affectionate to the child—I did not see the advertisement which was pat in the paper, that was Mrs. Walker's doing—I paid Mrs. Walker £10 for being there, but no portion of that found its way into the prisoner's possession—all that went to the baby was the clothes, the 10s. I did not give her—all along she explained that her wish was to adopt the child merely for motives of affection, not for any gain—it did not strike me that she might get tired of it and send it back to me—I thought I had got rid of it altogether, I thought I was free it was vaccinated when it was about five days old—I did not know anything about it having the thrush—it seemed perfectly strong from the first, that is my opinion—it was not weighed.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> While the prisoner was in my place she was very kind to the child and very fond of it—I did not observe that it was suffering rather considerably from thrush—but it had thrush—a case of thrush might be a very serions malady—it is considered a very serious illness for a child—I do not know what it weighed when it went away—I do not say that it was weak—all the girl got was the clothes for the child and 10s. travelling expenses—I did not suggest the 10s.—she remarked that she had nothing for cab fare, and I gave her 10s. to cover all expenses.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 57, Rockingham Street, New Kent Road, and am an omnibus conductor—about 18 months ago I met the prisoner at Chingford under the name of Maud McKenzie—It was about September, 1896—about a month after she became acquainted with me she learnt that I was a married man, and she lived with me till October 6th—she described herself as a barmaid, a single woman, and said that her father was a colonel in the army—that she was well connected, and had a sister in Scotland and an aunt in Bristol—we lived together, at 137, Brook Street, in two rooms on the top floor—she engaged the rooms her self—I told her I was a married man before we ever lived together—I thought she was in the family-way about the middle of May, but I cannot remember the exact date—she told me—she did not say at that time that the had been to see a doctor, but the said she had answered an advertise<lb/>ment, that she then went to see a doctor, who pointed out that she could go to Ladbroke Grove or any other place—I advised her not to go but she said she would, as it would be cheaper—I think she said that she was about six months gone—she went away from me on July 23rd—I received this letter on the Saturday morning: "Mrs. Ellis took queer," &amp;c. (<hi rend="italic">as before</hi>)—I did not recognize the handwriting then, but since I have done so as hers—at the time I thought I was a father, and that was a communication from the nurse—I sent her £1 shortly afterwards—on August 3rd I received this letter from her: "My own darling daddy,—I am glad to tell you I am so much better, and my boy is getting on fine; my nurse says if I go on as well the next two or three days I may get up on Sunday; won't it be lovely? I shall be home soon to show you my little treasure. Give Gype my fondest love and tell her that her little nephew and I would like to see her next week; if she can come over let us know, will you, about Tuesday next will suit. Of course I shall expect you to come and fetch me when I come down; so that you will not be able fo have two days off; but I am tired now. Goodbye, daddy, Goodbye. God bless you and keep daddy safe until I come home. Dear daddy, please manage to send me some money as soon as possible, if it is only 15s. to go on with, I have not any money or brandy to go on with."—on August 6th I received this letter:—"My own daddy,—I am so glad to tell you I am very much better, so is our son; we are both getting on grand. I am going to get up on Sunday, it will be lovely to get on my feet again. Dear daddy, thank you for the money. I was getting very anxious because I had not a farthing left. I have got the baby vaccinated—that cost me 15s.—then the doctor and other little things, it was a big expense. Do not let Gype come, will you, better not; it is a very comfortable place here, she is a Scotchwoman, but now, Good night, daddy; God bless you, with lots of kisses. I am your loving little Mammy. Don't fret, daddy, the doctor sad if I go on as well next week as I have this I shall be with you next Sunday. Lovely kisses.

Write very soon to mammy," Those letters are in her handwriting—she came back to me on August 8th bringing the child with her—I was not at home at the time, but when I got home about 11.45 I found her there and the baby was in bed—it seemed in good health, it was fed with a bottle—I used to be away in the day—I left at 8.30 a.m. and got back about 12.30 at night—about a fortnight or three weeks before she went away I first noticed that the child was ailing—I recommended her to take it to the doctor as it was getting thinner—she said that she had been to a doctor and he had opposed sending it to the Infirmary but that he had prescribed for it—I said the best thing would be to take it to the hospital—she mentioned the doctor's name but I cannot remember it now—I never saw the doctor in the house—I saw one or two bottles of medicine but its health did not seem to improve, it seemed to he wasting away and used to bring everything up—on the average the prisoner bad 5s. 6d. a day—on the night before she went away the child was a bit queer I think but I did not see it—the prisoner was supposed to go to work and on two or three occasions she left the child with a neighbour—she said she was engaged at the South London Music Hall behind the bar—sometime before she went away a rumour reached me that the child was the child of a barman, and I asked her about it and she said that it was all lies and there was no truth in it—I slept with the prisoner right up to the time she went away, and the child was in the same bed—I did not know anything about the injury to the child's head until it came out at the inquest—on the morning she went away she did not say anything about going, she asked me what I would have for dinner, and said she might come down to the 'bus to meet me—the child was in bed when I left, and shortly after one o'clock I went home for my dinner and she was not there—I went upstairs to my room and found the child in bed with its face to the wall, it had a shawl round its head and was in a perspira<lb/>tion—the clothes were turned back but not all over it—I thought it was nearly dead, and I went at once for my sister—I found this envelope from the prisoner telling me that Nellie was dying and that she was going to Glasgow, it is in her hand writing—I saw Mrs. Mc Kenzie and asked her if she would let the girl fetch the baby while I fetched my sister, and I gave her 3d. to get some milk—the child was removed to the infirmary, and when I returned I was arrested—before the Magistrate the case was dismissed against me—I think these two exhibits are in the prisoner's writing.</p>

               <p>the deceased was my mother—she was about 71 years of age—my father is about 60—they had lived in the same block at No. 49 for some 12 years past—that is on the ground floor—their grandson David Williams was living with them—in January last, in consequence of something that happened mother came to live in our house—she stopped about a fortnight—during that time father came to see her—mother hit him with a dish—he asked her to come back—she said she would not—she went back then—it was a fortnight from January 25th—my father is a deep sea diver—since other came to live with us father has not been able to work—on January J 6th about eleven a.m. I saw him coming in at the gate—I called him—he put his hand up and went towards his rooms with a little white parcel—a half-hour afterwards a boy came and called me—I went into the yard and saw my mother lying in the square about 10 yards from her door—Mrs. Grant was with her—I called mother, but she gave no answer—I rushed in the house and looked in the parlour of No. 49—I found father lying on the floor in the bed-room—his face was covered in blood—there was a revolver lying on the ground on his left side—I spoke to him—he did not answer—I rushed back to mother—she was still lying in the square—I saw the police come—I heard one shot fired after I had left him.</p>

The wound seemed to have a great effect, and kept him from being able to work" and "I have never seen father unkind to mother, I have never heard him threaten her"—that is correct—I believe he has been a good and affectionate father.</p>

I shall never survive mine. I hope she will"—after the woman's death I went to the hospital and charged the prisoner, on March 4th at 12.55 p.m., as he was discharged from the hospital—I told him he would be charged with the wilful murder of Wilhelmina Williams, and with attempting to commit suicide—he said, "That is it."</p>

I am a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians and Medical Officer of St. Olave's Parish Workhouse—I first attended the prisoner for injury to his head on January 27th—he came to my surgery which is about 300 or 400 yards from the workhouse—he was suffering from a cut on the vertex of the head about 1 1/2 inches long—it was not bleeding—it was commencing to heal—it probably had been done about a day or two before—he com<lb/>plained of injury to the head very much, and of pain from it—I think I put a dressing on the first day—I saw him on three or four occasions afterwards at the surgery—he was suffering from a considerable amount of bronchitis and distress—and from what I considered to be an acute attack of influenza—the last entry in my book of his coming is on February 4th—I think he was then at his worst—he was feverish, and his mental condition was very unsatisfactory—I had attended him for many years for bronchitis, catarrh, and pain in the head, which he used to attribute to his occu<lb/>pation—I knew he was a deep sea diver, which is an extremely arduous occupation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> His occupation has a tendency to produce a rush of blood to the head, and possibly apoplexy—he complained of neuralgic pains, which is typical of influenza—on February 4th, he was wild and incoherent in manner—he also complained of pains at the back of the head, and down the neck—he seemed seriously upset in his mind—I considered whether I should not exercise my power to order his detention in the House as a person of unsound mind long before this tragedy—he seemed to live on affectionate terms with his wife—I never heard of their quarrelling—he was a bad patient and would not obey instructions—he was in a critical condition, and I advised him to go home and be properly nursed—influenza more affects a man of his age than a younger man—it produces mental depression—his mental condition was very critical—he</p>
