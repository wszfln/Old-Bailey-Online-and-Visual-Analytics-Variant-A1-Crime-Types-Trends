I have for some time past lived with the prisoner—I left him, and returned to my husband, on the 25th of May, which was on a Monday—I saw the prisoner again on the Thurs<lb/>day following, against Bermondsey Church railing—I told him I had brought away two or three things of hit which I did not know I had—it was a working frock, two collars, and a stock—he said he did not want the things—he had got me now, and that was what he want<lb/>ed; and he would not part with me—he asked me if I had got any money—I told him no, I had not, but if he wanted a pint of beer I would give it to him—he laid hold of my shawl, and pulled me into a pub<lb/>lic-house, and said I should go with him—I went with him, and paid for two pints of beer—he accused me of going to Mrs. Saunders to get his linen away—I told him I had done no such thing—he said would I go with him to Mrs. Saunders'—I went, and Mrs. Saunders was in the back parlour—I went, and asked her if I had been to try to get any thing away—she told him I had not—I said to him, "Now are you satisfied?"—he muttered some<lb/>thing, but I do not know what—I asked Mrs. Saunders if she would come out into the yard with me, and we both went into the yard—and when we had been there about two minutes, he followed us into the yard—we were near the water-closet—I said to him in a joke, "You had better go there for us"—he said, "No, I don't want"—I went into the water-closet, and when I came out I went by Mrs. Saunders, and we all three stood together for about five minutes, and we never spoke—at last I made about two steps towards the yard door again, and he collared me, and threw me backwards against the hog<lb/>tub, picked up a piece of brick, and struck me on the head twice—I then clung very tight to his jacket, and said, "For God's sake don't"—he said, "I will never leave you until I have done for you!"—he threw that piece of brick away, and took up a larger piece, and struck me three times with that on the head—I was so faint with the loss of blood that I fell, and said,</p>

I received information, and went to Mrs. Saunders' house—on entering, there was a great deal of blood in the passage, and inside the door of the front room—I went into the back kitchen, and saw the prosecutrix apparently lifeless, covered with blood—in consequence of what she said, I went in search of the prisoner—I found him at the Yorkshire Grape public-house, in Bermondsey-street, about ten minutes' walk from the house—I went to the tap-room door, and said, "Cussell, I want you"—he said, "Yes, I know you do—I expected it would come to this—I am willing to go with you"—I took him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. The prosecutrix was brought to my surgery on the 28th, I believe—it was the evening this happened—she was in a very weak state from loss of blood from the wound on the scalp, which was about an inch in length—I did not examine the depth of it—I merely strapped up the wound, and sent her to the hospital—it di<lb/>vided the skin and part of the integuments, I believe—it produced a great effusion of blood—I did not consider her in imminent danger at the mo<lb/>ment—I did not know whether she was in danger, or not, as I did not examine the wound, because I did not think I should get paid for it—I think it was a sort of wound likely to be inflicted by part of a brickbat.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">written</hi>.) I have been living with the prosecutrix from the 7th of June, 1834, until the 25th of May, 1835. When she brought my tea in the afternoon, she asked what time I should be done work. I told her I did not know. When I went home at eight o'clock in the evening, she had removed with every thing belonging to me and her<lb/>self; and I met her the next day, May the 26th, when she promised to bring every thing belonging to me on the next day, Wednesday, but we</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183506150007"/>
               <p>both got very much intoxicated on the Tuesday, and I did not see her until Thursday, when the had a few article for me. With that we want to a public-house, and had tome beer, but how much I cannot tell, having been drinking all the day. We had a dispute, and we went to where we had been living, to decide what we had been disputing about, where we had high words, and I threw her down on some bricks that were in the yard, and by that means her head was cut. I took her into the house, and sat her in a chair in my landlord's apartment, the beck parlour, when Mrs. Saunders alarmed the neighbourhood, and I went to a public-house again. Two policemen came to me, and told me they wanted me, when I told them I was at their service, and they took me to where I left the prose<lb/>cutrix. They never sent for a doctor, but kept the woman in her gore for two hours before she had any medical assistance. When going to the station-house, which is upwards of a mile, they took her into a surgeon's, and got her head dressed, and made her come to the station-house and give evidence against me. Had she been provided with the assitance of a medical gentleman, it would not have come to what it has; for I am cer<lb/>tain that the prosecutrix knew I had no animosity against her, for we had generally lived on very mutual terms together. I most humbly implore your mercy.</p>

I was on duty on the night of the 29th of May in the Whitechapel-road, next door to Mr. Wilson's house—I was alarmed by Mrs. Wilson calling "Police!" out of the win<lb/>dow about one o'clock—Brown the constable was with me—she told me to run round the court, for there were thieves in the back yard—I did so, and just as I got to the comer of the alley, I found Corston trying to make his escape into the road—I took him into custody, and held him against the wall, and in the mean time I saw another man jump from the wall—he tried to pass me—I put up my hand, and called Brown—he did not get by me, for Brown came and took him into custody—it was the prisoner Rome—Corston resisted, and tried to get from me by slipping his jacket over his head—in the mean time I heard something drop on the pavement, which sounded like a crow-bar—I found these matches in his jacket pocket, and a phosphorus bottle without a cork—this was as he was going to the sta<lb/>tion-house—I returned to the street, to look for what I thought was the crow-bar, and found one at the place where I heard it drop—I went into the prosecutor's premises, and found the cork of the phosphorus bottle on the sill of the back parlour window which was broken open—I searched Rome, and found a bit of rope on him.</p>

                  </hi> s. I live in West Smithfield, and am the wife to Thomas Williams. On the 20th of May, the prisoner came to the shop—I was in the small room adjoining, and observed him standing at the glass-case—I went into the shop, and he left—I went to the door, saw him walking away very deliberately he put his hands behind him—I had knocked for some men to come to my assistance—the prisoner ran when he saw some person pursuing him—he then ran violently—he was taken in about an hour—I am sure this is the same person—three or four papers contain<lb/>ing about six dozen knives, were missing—they had been all safe within five minutes before—I have not seen any of them since—I could not see any thing in his hands—he had them before him first, and then opened them and put them behind him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a slopseller, and live in Houndsditch. The prisoner was in my employ as an articled servant, and has been so for six months—it is part of my business to make up clothes from drill—on the evening of the 4th of June, when I came home, the prisoner met me in the passage in tears, at eleven o'clock at night—he said, "Oh, Sir, a dread<lb/>ful thing has happened"—I led him into my sitting-room, and asked him what was the matter—he said, "Oh, Sir, I have been stealing"—I had no knowledge of what had happened at the time—I said nothing to induce him to say any thing—I said he had better state what had happened—that was after he had said he had been stealing—he produced a parcel, which I have here—I gave it to the policeman the following morning, and know it to be mine—there was also a newspaper and a letter in the parcel—the pri<lb/>soner handed me the parcel himself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Besemeres. I was em<lb/>ployed in cutting drill like this on the 3rd and 4th of June—on the 3rd of June, the prisoner laid hold of some drill, and said, "I shall have two yards and a half of this"—it was a similar pattern to this, but drab instead of lavender—my answer was, "Indeed?"—he said, yes, he should—in a moment or two he came round, and began to undo the piece—I said, "Have you got an order?"—he said, "No"—I said, "You had better get your order"—he said, "I will manage that; there is a great deal of over-measure here"—I said, "Who is it for?"—he said, "My brother"—I said, "You must not have the raw material; you must have nothing but what is made up; the governor won't stand that"—he said, "Hold your tongue, I will manage that"—in about an hour and a half, he cut off two yards and a half—I did not see that; but after he went up to tea, I missed the first cut, the fag end—he had no business to cut that at all—the tea-bell had rung—I found he was in his bed-room—I waited until he came down—I said, "Dudley, you have taken that drill"—he did not deny it—I said, "Go and get it, and bring it down stairs"—he said, "Will you hold your <hi rend="italic">bother</hi>?"—I said, "Nothing will satisfy me till</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183506150016"/>
               <p>you bring it down now, while every thing is quiet, and put it on my board, and I will manage it"—I insisted on its coming down stairs, or to Mr. Besemeres, I must go—he said, "Well, be quiet, I will have my tea, and will bring it down stairs"—he went down to tea, and in about ten minutes brought it down stairs to me in brown paper, from his bed-room, and threw it on my cutting-board—I put it up on the left of me, without undoing it—I went to the principal young man in the house, and ac<lb/>quainted him of it—on the 4th of June, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, he went in the counting-house, and took out a bunch of keys—I did not sec the keys, but I heard them rattle—I was adjoining the counting-house—I suppose he must have seen me—as he went in, he passed behind me—it was not done secretly—I heard the keys rattling—I knew they were the keys of the back premises, where the work-people come in—he took the keys and went out—I sus<lb/>pected he was taking something out of the house—I went round to White, and spoke to him—I suspected be had concealed something in the yard—I let every thing be quiet till half-past eight o'clock in the evening when I leave—I missed him from the warehouse half an hour previous, which was three-quarters of an hour before his time—I sus<lb/>pected he was getting ready to go out—I went out before him, and waited at the end of the street till he came up—he came out at the private door with a parcel in his hand—that was not the right door to come out at—the par<lb/>cel had string round, and was sealed—I went up, and said, "Dudley, what have you there?"—he seemed surprised, and said, "Hold your <hi rend="italic">bother"</hi>—"What is there," I said, "You know what happened yesterday; what is it"—he said, "Only some old newspapers, and nothing else; I am going to send them into the country to my mother" (or brother)—I said "Let me see it, and I shall be satisfied, or worse will come of it"—he said, he would not, and began to swear—I said, "If you do not, I will give you into the hands of a policeman, and what happened yesterday will all come out—I am deter<lb/>mined not to part with you till I see all"—he went into a public-house par<lb/>lour in Liverpool-street, with a great deal of hesitation, and opened the parcel—I found it was this drill—I said, "What this is newspapers, is it?"—he said, "Hold your <hi rend="italic">bother</hi>—don't kick up a noise, it is only a rem<lb/>nant"—I said "This wont do, I shall get in trouble for this"—I called the landlord, and asked him to take care of him, while I went to get the prin<lb/>cipal of the house—he said he would not keep the prisoner, but he would keep the stuff—I persuaded the prisoner to go back with me, and he did—I told the young man in his presence what he had done—the clerk went with me to the public-house, and got the stuff, and brought it down to the house—I took it out of the landlord's hands, and gave it to the clerk, who took it to the watch-house—I do not know where he put it, for I left the house, and went home—this was as near nine o'clock as could be—the pri<lb/>soner slept in the house, and so did the clerk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. When he applied to you the day before to cut off some, you would not do it without the order? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that was on the 3rd, and on the 4th he took this—he said, he would have a piece—I told the Lord Mayor that he said he could manage it, and that it was over-measure, and would not be missed—I said near to the same meaning, but perhaps not in those words—the parcel was directed to his brother—there was a letter and a newspaper in it—he said, it was a bundle of newspapers, I am quite certain—I was once charged with bigamy, but it was proved I was not guilty.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 17th of May, I went into a public-house, in Shadwell, and saw the prisoner there; I know him well—I went into another public-house, and he was there—I do not recollect that we had any thing to drink there—I laid my head on the table and went to sleep—I had my watch safe in my pocket then, and afterwards missed it.</p>

He has been acquainted with the prisoner several years—I had only seen him once myself; that is two years ago—on the 18th of May, he called on me: my husband was out—I was in the parlour, lying on the sofa, very ill—he said he came to see me out of pure respect to Mr. Morgan, as he respected him more than any other man in the office; and he had been more kind to him than any other man—I said I had no recollection of him—he told me his name—I then recognised him—I told him my husband would not be home until half-past one o'clock to dinner—I think this was about ten o'clock—he said he was not in a hurry, he would wait, as he wished to see my husband out of re<lb/>spect—I asked him to take a seat, which he did—there was no one else in the room at the time—the prisoner remained there till a little after twelve o'clock—my mother came at twelve o'clock—she came and sat close to me and never moved from her chair—I never left the room—at twelve o'clock I saw the watch hanging up safe—the prisoner sat under it—he said to me, "Shall I empty the composing-stick for you?"—he afterwards got up, and walked into the passage with his hat in his hand—I said, "Edward, are you going?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "When will you call to see Mr. Morgan?"—he said, "To-morrow, at one o'clock;" but he never came at all—he had not left the house two minutes, before I missed the watch—there had not been a creature in the room except my mother and myself—the composing-stick which he had been using was also gone.</p>

On Tuesday, the 9th of June, about a quarter past ten o'clock in the morning, I was in Charter-house-square, with my son, who was a few paces before me, with my bag—the prisoner came up to me, and snatched my watch from my fob—he did not exactly strike me a blow, but he took my watch—he came in contact with me—he met me—he was in company with another man of the same description—he appeared to be going to give the watch to the other man, but I followed him, and forced it out of his hand, and broke the chain in doing so—I gave an alarm, and sent my son for a policeman, who took him into custody—the other man made his escape—he took it momentarily.</p>

On the 20th of May the prisoner came to the warehouse at a quarter after five o'clock in the evening—he brought a letter, which I produce—it was wafered—it was directed to the firm—I asked him if it was an order—he said it was, and asked if there was time to get a permit that evening—I told him that there was: we could draw a permit until seven o'clock—he said, "Will the goods be ready in half an hour? we are going to Cripplegate-buildings, and will call as we come back"—(he had a porter with him with a knot)—the note was opened in the prisoner's presence, and he said he would come for them in half an hour—I said they would be ready—the note was opened by Hodson, but in the prisoner's presence I am certain—it was not read in his hearing—they went away, leaving the note—when they were gone, I examined it more particularly—it purports to come from John Goodhart, of Lamb's Conduit-street, who is a customer of ours—it was spelt Goodheart, instead of hart—in consequence of that I sent to Mr. Goodhart by our porter, Wilson; and Wicks, one of his shopman, came—the note was returned to me before the prisoner returned, and when he came, he asked if the things were ready—I said, "Yes; walk in, we wish to speak to you respecting this letter"—I handed him into our show-room, and shut the door—I called in Duncan, one of our clerks, and told Goodhart's young man to go into the show-room to him, which he did, bat I was not present there—I went about five minutes, and he said Mr. Wilson gave him the letter—he did not say who he was, or where he lived—he had seen the order at that time.</p>

Mr. Wicks, how do you do? "and at that moment became embarrassed, and said, "I hope you will forgive me"—he was asked if he knew the order was a forged one—he said he was not aware, of it, as he did not write it—that he received it from Wilson, at the bottom of Charterhouse-lane—the goods would have come to 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On the 20th of May, as I was proceeding to the west end of the town, I promiscuously met Wilson on the other side of Smithfield, and a porter with him. I had not seen him for some months—he appeared in a great hurry—after a few minutes' conversation he re<lb/>quested me to deliver the note for him—I said I would—he gave me the note and said, "The porter will go with you; I am in an immediate hurry, I am going down Cheapside into Wood-street"—I understood he meant to say he lived in Wood-street—he said he would meet me there in three-quarters of an hour, and if not between eight and nine o'clock—I never knew where he lived, except that he told me the last time I saw him that he lived at Barnet; and likewise at some other part of the country—when I took the note to Bedwell and Yates, I delivered it to the young man—I was going away—he directly opened it, and said, "Who is it from?"—I said, "From a young man"—I don't recollect that I mentioned the name at the mo<lb/>ment—I was asked whether it was private or an order—I said I supposed it was an order—the porter was standing at the door, and said, "Mr. Wilson will be waiting for you; if you will go down, it is the first house on the left-hand side"—I had before asked Wilson which house it was, and he said the first house after coming out of Cripplegate—I went down there and waited half or three-quarters of an hour, but did not see him—I returned again, and was going to the west end of the town—Mr. Bedwell's house was just in the direction I was going—I went in, to ask if Wilson had called there, as he had told me he should call there after meeting a friend in Wood-street—I did not ask if Wilson had been there, but if the young man had been there—one of the young men laid his hand on me, and said, "I want to speak to you"—I walked into the room—they questioned me respecting the contents of the note, which I acknowledged I did not know—after their explaining to me the contents of it, I said I did not know the particulars, but, meeting him with an apron on, I supposed it was an order—when I came back I was detained—the porter was standing at the door when I came in, but he was not the man who was with Wilson when I first met him—if they had stopped that man as well as me, he could have</p>

               <p>explained where he met Wilson, and given the full particulars; for I sup<lb/>pose he bad been waiting there all the time I was absent, which was three-quarters of an hour—when I saw the porter there I did not know at the moment whether he was the man who bad been with Wilson; but they said, "There is a porter outside; is he the man?"—I said I had not seen him, and one of the young men said he had run away—I certainly said I hoped they would forgive me for receiving the note, as I did not know it was forged—being so well acquainted with Mr. Goodhart's name, I knew how to spell it as well as my own—it would be most unlikely I should spell his name wrong if I had written it.</p>

"which I did—a man who was sitting next to me read the engraving, and in consequence of what he read, I went and took the plates to Mr. Luntley—only Bird and Paradise were present when this passed—Bird said they would go down there again at night, at there was a pair of scales, a saw, and an iron chest, which he dare say had some money in it, and they could break it open; and if there was nothing in it, there was the scales and the saw—I took the plates to Mr. Luntley, as the man next to me said he would be bound to say the man who lost them, would not lose them for a trifle; and as I heard them talk of going there again, I thought it right to take them to Mr. Luntley, to let him know, that he might guard his premises; I took the plates to Mr. Luntley—when I came home, Bird asked me what I had done with the plates—I said I had sold them—he asked what I had got for them—I said, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Bird asked me if I would go with them in the afternoon, and they would put a good job in my way—the whole three were together then—he would not say what it was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to John Giles Pilcher and Jeremiah Pilcher—in consequence of suspicion, I marked some pieces of indigo, in a chest in the colour-room, with chalk—I afterwards missed them—On Thursday, the 21st of May, the prisoner came down from the work-room—I watched him—he went into the colour-room—I went outside the warehouse to the window of the colour-room—the chest was under another window, right opposite the window I was at—I saw him lift up the lid of the chest with one hand, and put the other hand in—he closed the chest and took his paste-pot, and filled it with paste—he came and put down his paste-pot—then returned to the colour room—lifted up the lid of the chest again, and put his other hand in; but I could not see at either time whether he took any tiling out, in consequence of the lid—he closed the chest—I came round and met him at the colour-room door—he seemed much confused—I told my employers directly—his hand was all blue, and his shirt, wrist, and forehead—he worked up above—his business was with the black lead, he bad no business in the colour-room, but to fetch paste—he had been in the employ between four and five years—he was in the habit of putting his black lead box on a firkin in the work-room—he bore an honest cha<lb/>racter before this was discovered.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Pilcher. On Wednes<lb/>day, the 13th of May, Gawkrodger was sent to weigh 21bs. of indigo—in consequence of information he gave me, I went and examined it—I found there was a deficiency, and some pieces were marked with a pen-knife—I marked six pieces width my own hand—I have since seen one of the pieces found in the tub in the prisoner's shop, where he worked—it was one of the pieces I marked—there were other pieces besides, not marked at all—four of the pieces I marked remained where they had been—one was missing, and one found in the firkin—I afterwards saw a piece of indigo, said to be found off the premises, but it was covered with purple-brown, and I could not swear to it; but I believe it to be the same indigo—it was not exactly the mark I made—there appears to be a mark on the bottom more than I put, which creates a doubt in my mind whether it is the same—on the Thursday and Friday after the indigo was marked, he went oftener than he need for paste—the paste-pan stood on the indigo chest—on the Saturday, about half-past ten o'clock, the prisoner came down for paste—I watched him when he came out, his hands were quite blue, and I made a communi<lb/>cation to my employers—on Wednesday I weighed 21bs. of indigo, and placed it on one side of the indigo chest—on Thursday morning, when I went to work, about twenty minutes after six o'clock, I found the colour-room door opened, without a key—I found the shutter taken down, the paste-pan removed, and a bag shifted from one end of the chest to the other, and some of the indigo taken out—that found in the firkin was a different sort to that I weighed up—it is a sort of indigo that has been missed from bags—the 2lbs. had been weighed to detect the person, but none of that was found in the firkin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many men are in your master's service? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never counted them—there was no one but myself and Gawkrodger en<lb/>titled to weigh indigo—I have the sole charge of the colour-room—any body might go in, but nobody but us go in without being specially noticed—I never heard of the reward—I have not been in the employ six months—I believe there are four men and a boy in the warehouse, but the town-ware-house forms quite a separate concern altogether—the prisoner worked in a room which has two sides and an end—it is not an open place—it is a con<lb/>fined place, as it is set apart for him to make up black lead—it Is boarded off from the warehouse, but there is no door to it—there is a door-way—there is a firkin in it, the prisoner uses it to put his black lead on, he has a box or another firkin, and puts the box on the two to keep it even—the indigo was found just underneath his counter—some paste was found over it—he had been noticed to go more frequently for paste than he could want it—some of the chalked indigo was gone—we informed Mr. Pilcher—I know nothing of a man named Russell weighing any—I never heard a word of the reward before to-night—Gawkrodger never mentioned it to me—</p>

               <p>I did not stop the prisoner when I saw his hands blue—I pointed him out on the Saturday night, when his jacket stuck out—that was the Saturday before the Thursday that he was taken—the key of the indigo-room hung up in the warehouseman's little office—no person has a right to that key but my<lb/>self, who unlock the door.</p>

                  </hi> I live with Evan Thomas, a linen-draper, in Pickett-street, Strand—on the 22d of May, the prisoner and another man came together—to look at some black silk handkerchief—one of then bought one—the prisoner took a lace veil from the counter, and put it into his flap—I said nothing then, but put the handkerchief up—I got paid for it, and they went out—I want after them—the prisoner ran and fell down—I caught him before he fell down—he took part of the veil out—I took it from him—I had not time to speak to him before he got out of the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. William Cater, a master, living at Ware, in Hertfordshire. His barges go to Wick's wharf, on the rivet Lea, once or twice a week—he sends up his corn to London, through Wick's wharf, and from thence it is sent out in sacks—Truman and Callow were employed there—the waggons are loaded from the barges late at night sometimes, and it remains on the wharf all night—we do not have any body on the wharf to watch it—it goes away in the morning, sometimes by four or five o'clock—it would be the duty of Truman and Callow to go with it to shoot it out—they live near the wharf—during April and March we sent from Ware to Lea Bridge many quarters of malt—we had recently before that purchased 600 new sack—they were warked was on the top, and a dot resembling a star, but it did not fill up well On the 13th of March, we had occasion to bring 600 quarters of malt to Messrs. Barclay's, the brewers—and after the sacks had returned, we had them counted, and missed five of them, and we have the same, number now, we still miss five;—Truman and Callow were working at Wick's at the time the sacks were returned—I have since seen five sacks in possession of the officer; they are my master's—they are marked as master's, and they were tied with a hank knot—I have examined these five sacks; they have been untied and tied again—the malt very much resembles my master's.</p>

On Saturday night, the 6th of June, I was in the Liverpool-road—I saw Mrs. Cox first at the bottom of Park-lane—she came past the lane, and the prisoner turned up the lane with the bundle—there was nobody with her but the prisoner—he had the bundle under his arm—directly he turned up the lane, the woman came back and said, "Oh, my God! I have lost my bundle"—the man stood up against the wall in, the lane—he said, "Come on; we shall not catch the waggon to-night;" and, they both went further down the road—I stood where I was, and then went down that way, and I saw him coming along with the bundle—he was alone then—he was walking very fast—when I went a little further down</p>

The house belongs to Mr. Hunter—I do not know his Christian name—the house is under repair—I am left in care of it—on Monday, the 1st of June, between eight and nine o'clock, the prisoner came to the door and knocked—it was getting towards dusk—it had gone eight o'clock, I think—my little boy opened the door—he went away that time, and came in again about five or ten minutes—my little boy opened the door then, and called me up—I went up, and asked the prisoner what he wanted—he said he was come for a brush and a trowel—he said they belonged to his brother, who was there at work as a plasterer, and his brother had promised to lend them to him—I told him I thought he would not find it, as it was getting quite dusk, and the tools were at the top of the house, and I would get a light—he said he could do without a light—I saw him distinctly—he went up stairs—I offered to go with him, but he said he should find it without a light—I waited on the stairs for him—he was a long while on the stairs—he came down again, and brought a saw, a brush, and trowel down—I called at the door, seeing a person go by, and asked him, to come to my assistance, for I thought it was not quite right; and the man went and called a policeman—directly the prisoner heard the man's voice, he dropped the saw, and went down the kitchen stairs—the policeman came in and took him, with the brush and trowel in his hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corn-dealer, and live in Seymour-place, Bryanstone-square. Wicks was in my employ for five months—I saw Wicks and Fry at my granary door on the evening of the 10th of June—I said to Wicks, my carman, "What are you going out with!"—he said, "One quarter of oats and one bushel of beans"—I am quite sure he said that—I saw there were two sacks in the cart before I spoke, and just as I spoke to him he discharged another sack into the cart, which made three—when the last sack was put in, the prisoner Fry said, "I have my usual quantity"—I said to him, "What is my man going with?"—he said, "One quarter of oats and one bushel of beans for me"—he then got into the cart—he went partly up the gateway, and then stopped for my man to get in to ride with him—while he was stopping I looked over the cart, and I said, "I perceive you have got three sacks here, Wicks"—he lifted up the sack of corn, and exposing the beans in the front of the cart said, "I have my usual quantity—one quarter of oats and one bushel of beans"—he went out of the yard—I went into my shop—a female told me something, and I followed the cart—I called to him, and said, I was very tired, I would ride with him as far as my brother's, which was in the way where this corn was to be delivered—I did so, and got within two hundred yards of Fry's house—Fry then said, "Are not you going to your brothers?"—I said, "I may as well ride as far as your stables"—I did so—they drove to his door, and un<lb/>loaded one sack of com, and came back for the other—when it was lifted off the beans, I perceived that there was more—I said "Here is more than the quantity ordered; at your peril take them out of the cart"—they were both together when they shot the last sack of corn—I went for the policeman—Fry said, that he had ordered two bushels—I told them not to shoot the beans—Fry then said if he had got more than his quantity, he would pay for them—I was not more than two minutes going to get a policeman—when I came back, I found the beans in the cart—they had remained in the cart—I gave them in charge—I then said to Fry, "Here is more than you have booked"—the policeman then took them, and the beans—I saw the beans afterwards at the station-house—there were two bushels and one peck—Fry has dealt with me some years—his usual quantity was one quarter of oats and one bushel of beans—the value of one bushel and one peck of beans is 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or more.</p>

I am a widow, I attend at Mr. Brooks's shop; it is part of my duty to take orders for goods—I remember Fry coming on the evening of the 10th of June—he asked if Mr. Brooks was at home—I said no—he said, "Never mind, you will do as well; I owe two lots, I want to pay you for one"—he paid for one quarter of corn and one bushel of beans; I then gave him the receipt—I then said, "What am I to send you?"—he said, "The same as usual, one quarter of oats, and one bushel of beans"—I am quite sure of that—I made this entry in the book at the time (<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>:) "Mr. Fry, one quarter oats, on bushel beans, S. Wicks"—that is the name of the man who delivers them—I read the entry to Fry, and he said, "That is right"—Wicks came in, and Fry said to him, "Well, young man, I want some corn to-night; it is useless for you to swear and be cross about it, for I must have it to-night"—Wicks said his horses had been hard at work that day, and he had put them into the stables, would not to-morrow do?—he said, "No, I must have it to-night, I have not a handful for my horses to-night"—Wicks said, "What is it to be?"—I said, "One quarter of oats, and one bushel of beans"—they both left the shop together, and went down to the granary—in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, Wicks came back, and said, "It is very strange that man comes so late at night for his com"—he said, "How long has <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> been gone?" (he is the other carman)—I said, "He went about half-past seven o'clock, he cannot poss<lb/>bly be back yet"—he said, "Then I have a mind to put the horses into the big cart, and take it myself—I said, "I think you had better"—he then said, "What is it to be?"—I then repeated the order again—they went in the light cart, as <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> came back sooner than I expected when he went.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 13, Lascelles-court, St. Giles', near Salutation-court—there is one house which divides the two courts from each other—the prisoner lived at No. 2, Salutation-court, and Pedley, the deceased, at No. 1—the court is not a thoroughfare—I was in that court a little before eleven o'clock, on Saturday night, the 6th of June I saw the prisoner there, and the woman he lives with—she goes by the name of "Ann Benson"—they were in Pedley's room—Benson was quarrelling with the prisoner—Pedley was trying to part them—I was looking into the win<lb/>dow, and could see them—the room is on the ground-floor—Benson had a poker in her hand, and Pedley was trying to part them—he was advis<lb/>ing them to go out of the house—the prisoner apparently wanted to hit Ben<lb/>son, and she had the poker up to defend herself—Pedley was quarrelling with Potter—I could not hear what words passed—he was not touching him—I did not perceive them strike each other—there were persons col<lb/>lected together, looking in at the window—I should think the words be<lb/>tween Pedley and Potter continued five or ten minutes—the deceased got Potter and the woman out of the house—they went out themselves—he used no violence—Potter then came into the court and fought with a young man named Carr—they did not strip—Potter did not appear sober—he got Carr into his own passage, and Ann Benson too, and shut the door—Carr hallooed out," For God's sake, somebody open the door!" I shoved the door in myself—I did not see the prisoner, as it was dark—Carr went out of the Court, and I went after him—I returned into the court between five</p>

Mrs. Cormack! come back, I am stabbed, I have got it here;" and I saw his guts in his hand—he was sup<lb/>ported into his own room, and put into a chair, and a doctor was sent for—I remained there till he was taken away to the hospital—I do not know positively how long it was before he was taken to the hospital—it was about a quarter of an hour that he sat in the chair—the surgeon did not come till after he was gone to the hospital.</p>

We were in the river on the 2nd of June, and about to go into the docks—the deceased, John Peter Oram, was a sailor on board the vessel—the prisoner was acting as third mate—we were hauling the ship into the docks—the crew were all pretty active—I just came from aft—the prisoner was just before the fore hatchway—Oram came off the windlass as I came forwards—he jumped off the windlass, and struck the prisoner back handed, and he went over a spar and a chain: it was a sort of trip up as he was standing between the spar and chain—he would not have fallen if Oram had not <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him—he struck him by the side of his ear, or about the ear—I was on the other side of the deck, and could not see nearer—he struck him, as it appeared to me, with his open hand—Menzies got up, and I saw him put his hand into his pocket, and take a knife out—he went immediately and stabbed Oram; but the pilot spoke to him after he had the knife out, before he struck him—he said, "You villain, are you going to stab the man with that knife?"—he was right over his head when he said that—on the top-gallant forecastle—he must have heard him—the prisoner said nothing when the pilot called out, but went immediately, and struck Oram in his left breast—I caught hold of Oram as he staggered—he said, "I am going, I am going "—and as he fell on the deck, he said, "I am done for"—Menzies went aft, and I believe jumped over-board, but I did not see that; but he was brought on boar and again jumped over—Oram was taken aft, and a doctor was sent for—he died between three and four o'clock next morning.</p>

I lived at Calais in February; the prisoner was an inmate at my house there for a considerable time, and so was her daughter likewise—I left France about the latter end of February—she left some few days after me—before I left, she packed up, and had the care of all my luggage, to the amount of fourteen or fifteen packages—I left my luggage in her care—she was to clear it at the Custom-house at Dover, and leave it at the waggon office there, till she saw me or heard from me—I left France and went to Dover—I saw her at Barfreston, in Kent—she gave me a paper there, which was an order for me to go to Dover, to claim my luggage—I went, and found all my luggage there, except a box which is in Court, containing the articles stated in the indictment—she went to Canterbury, and staid till my luggage arrived—then joined me and my family, and we went to Herne Bay together—we did not know at that time what we had lost, not having unpacked our luggage; but still we consi<lb/>dered if she had got it, it would be as safe as if we had it ourselves—one box was missing at Dover; that had been sent to London by the prisoner—she did not tell me so; but I had not packed my luggage myself, and did not know what there was till I missed it—she left me and came to London, and after I took a house, and unpacked my luggage, I missed the articles—when she first had the possession of these articles, they were in a rose-wood tea-caddy—we left her to pack them up—I came to London to ask her for them—I found her at 51, Great Sutton-street, Clerkenwell—I asked her for my things—she said, "You cannot have them to-night, you shall have them to-morrow"—she did not say where they were till next day—next day she left a note under the tea-board—I have not got it here—her husband took it away—I did not see her next day, for she had absconded from the house, daughter and all—I had appointed to breakfast</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What business are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A carpenter by trade—that is the business I profess—I followed that business in France, and kept a carpenter's shop—the prisoner first came to live with me there, about eighteen months ago—she then passed by the name of Ray—she has had several names lately—I kept a boarding-house at Calais—I believe the prisoner arrived in Calais the latter end of January, or the beginning of February—I do not know why she came there—I suppose it was to see her daughter, who was boarded and educated at my house—I was not in any particular difficulty at that time—I was not about to run away from my creditors—I have no creditors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not write to the prisoner to say, you expected the bailiffs to come into your house daily, to take your goods in execution, and carry you to prison? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I declare to God I did not—I never sent her such a message, nor did my wife, to my knowledge; she cannot write her own name—I did not send for the prisoner to come to Calais—I expected her, because she wrote and said she was coming to see her daughter—I did not tell her I was a ruined man, and was in daily expectation of having my goods seized—I never knew any thing was the matter to cause me to say so—I did not say so—I did not tell her she was the only person upon whose assistance I could rely—I asked her to hire a room for me at Calais—I had not room enough at the boarding-house—she purchased a small quantity of furniture from me, and wanted a small room to put it in—I wanted an extra room, and she put this furniture in it, which she bought of me—I hired it for my business—I do not know that you have a right to question me—I had business as a broker, and had not room sufficient to keep the goods in which I bought—I never put any thing in the room, but my in-mates did—I told the prisoner to sell this furniture, which she did—I know she sold it, and she gave me the money—they were sold in the market-place at Calais, in my presence—I never had a farthing—she never gave it to me—I think it is likely she gave it to my wife; it might amount to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you leave Calais in a hurry? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not particularly; I came as quick as the packet would bring me—I wanted to come to London—I went to St. Omer, and from St. Omer to Boulogne—I went to St. Omer on pleasure; I had no business in particular—I got from Calais to St. Omer in five hours—I got there very late at night—I left about nine o'clock in the morning—I did not transact any particular business in that time—I bought a few articles of wearing apparel, a pair of boots, a neck<lb/>handkerchief, and other articles—it did not suit me to buy them at Calais as I liked St. Omer best—I had no other business there—I got to Bou<lb/>logne in about five hours—I made my way from there to Dover when the tide suited—before I left Calais, I requested the prisoner to take care of my goods, and bring them to England—I never promised to pay her fare.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has not she all along alleged that she received the gold chain, gold seal, and snuff-box, from your wife, after you left? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is no such thing; she never said any thing of the kind before the magistrate—there</p>

               <p>might be a word of that sort happen; but I scarcely believe she spoke three words—my wife is now keeping an eating-house at Herne Bay—the pri<lb/>soner never came to live regularly with us after she returned—she came to Barfreston, and brought me the order for my luggage—I have never had a house since—I have always been in lodgings and hotels, and different places—she was never in my house at Herne Bay—she was with me about three days, but not three weeks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did you learn she was gone to Pentonville? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Her husband promised to produce the goods at two o'clock in the afternoon, and he never came—we waited till three o'clock, and went to the house, and she had flown, goods and all—the landlord and landlady did not know where she was gone—the apprentice boy promiscuously knew where it was—I did not write to her in Wynyatt-street, just before I took her up—I had seen her about two days before I took her up—she had agreed to go to Graves<lb/>end with me before we left France—I believe my wife always paid her fare and expenses—I never received a letter from her when she came to London; and did not know she had arrived, till I went to Barfresto—I <hi rend="italic">judged</hi> to find some one or other there—she never informed me of her having come to Dover—she did not know where to write to me—I wrote perpetually to France, but never could get an answer—I did not knot she was in England—I found I could not get the things from the waggon<lb/>office, because they were in her name—she did not tell me so before I went—I did not see her—I wrote for her to come to Dover, but she ar<lb/>rived before the letter reached, and gave me the bill—she knew I could not get the goods without it—I did not know she was married till her hus<lb/>band came to Herne Bay, and informed me—I did not express any anger at it; I was rather surprised at her not letting me know it was going to happen—the watch was left with me by Mr. Wall, her present husband, as security for money he owes me—I had it from him nearly twelve months ago, or quite—I believe the gold chain and other things were in pawn before I left France—I took them out of pawn before I came away—I gave the money for that purpose, and they were brought out in my presence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not the prisoner tell you, after you wrote to her to come to Dover, that in order to clear the other things, (you not having paid her fare,) she was obliged to pledge them, to raise the money to go there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She never said such a word.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Henry Newington, a glass-dealer, in Whitechapel.

What can you swear to this glass by? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is not such a bottle in London—it is graduated on both sides—I can swear to this tumbler by the make of it—there is no mark on it, but I know the make—we have them made for Mr. Coates, and they are all marked before they go into his house—the peculiarity is in the pattern—you will not find the same shape in London—we have often tried to match them, and are obliged to have them made—we should not sell them to any body but Mr. Coates—we never sell the goblets except to Mr. Coates, and we mark them all before they go into his house—I do not swear to these finger-glasses, nor this bottle—I can swear to this stopper, and can produce the bottle it belongs to—here are my gloves, which were found on the prisoner's person.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I was standing with George Ince—a little boy came up, and said, "Here George here is a stopper, will you have it"—I said, "Where did you get it?"—he said, "One of the school boys gave it to me, and I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it"—I did not know that it was in the indictment, or I could prove I bought it. He was selling some clothes; and after he had sold them, I saw the gloves lying on the ground—I took them up, and intended to give them to him, but did not see him, and forgot it.</p>

I am nine years old—my father makes belts and braces—on the 13th of June I had a bag in my pocket; it had a patent strap, two halfpence, and one penny in it—the prisoner came up to me—I know he is the boy—he said, "Let me measure how many furlongs your bag is, as I want to make one?"—I said, "No;" and he snatched it out of my pocket—I took hold of the string, but he got it away—I called out," Stop thief—he has got my money"—a woman took him by the shoulder, but he got from her—the policeman afterwards took him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Charing-cross hospital. I remember Carroll being brought to the hospital, on Sunday, the 5th of April, at 10 o'clock in the morning—I examined him—I found four or five wounds on the scalp, all of which were trivial in their nature, excepting one over the left temple-bone—there was a slight wound on the cheek-bone—two fingers on his left hand were wounded, and he had a wound in the right knee-joint—they were cut-wounds, evidently inflicted by some sharp instrument; a sabre or knife would inflict them—the man was exceedingly exhausted when brought into the hospital—I presume from the loss of blood, and partly from having been drinking—he remained in the hospital until his death, which was on the 19th of May—inflammation arose on the knee-joint, followed by an extensive formation of matter, which is the com<lb/>mon consequence of wounds in the larger joints—in consequence of that, it was thought necessary, three days previous to his death, to amputate—it was decidedly my opinion that amputation was necessary—he would un<lb/>questionably have died without amputation—I performed the amputation—it was done very successfully—he was so much exhausted previously, that it was a matter of great importance to perform it very expeditiously, and to save is much blood as possible—it was removed within two minutes—there was a very small quantity of blood lost, but he died on the 19th of May—I attribute his death to the irritation and exhaustion consequent on the wound inflicted on the knee-joint (<hi rend="italic">looking at a sword</hi>)—that weapon is quite capable of producing such a wound.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you not believe he would have survived a day or two longer, if amputation had not been performed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps scarcely that time—he lost but a very few ounces of blood by the amputation, scarcely more than the blood retained in the limb which was removed—he did not lose two ounces from the part above—his pulse was about one hundred and twenty just before the operation—it is the custom to feel the pulse during the progress of the operation—there was no sensible change.</p>

               <p>been performed—at the same time we know it to be possible for an indivi<lb/>dual suffering under extreme exhaustion, to sink at any moment, without the infliction of the operation—we communicated to him all that might be apprehended—no operation is done in any hospital without communicating to the individual the probable consequences of it, and having his consent—in the opinion of all the medical officers in the hospital, it was justifiable, on the ground of its absolute necessity, in consequence of the impossibility of his surviving unless the limb could be removed.</p>

I live at No. 7, Star-court, Newton-street, Holborn, On Sunday morning the 5th of April, between four and five o'clock, I was alarmed by a noise—I knew Carroll by sight, but never spoke to him, he lived at No. 3, nearly opposite to me—I got up, in consequence of hearing the noise, and looked out of the window—the row began in the parlour on the ground-floor—Carroll lived in the two-pair—it was a family affair among them—I saw no persons in the court at first, but I saw two women jumping out of the parlour window in their petticoats and shifts; they cried out "Watch and police," and the police came to their assistance very soon—I do not know who was the policeman—he told them he could not enter unless there was murder cried—one or two policemen came—I can<lb/>not exactly say it was one—one, to the best of my knowledge—after this the court was quiet for a time—the woman said to her mother who was inside, "Mother, cry out murder," which the old woman did—at this time the court was quiet—when she cried out "Murder," the daughter cried out "Murder," and the policeman entered at the door—I saw him no more—in about twenty minutes after I heard a noise in the court—I jumped out of bed and went towards the window—I saw two policemen running out of No. 3—they sprang their rattles the moment they came out, and ran up to the end of the court, and some more came to their assistance very soon—some of them ran into No. 4, instead of No. 3—I told them that was not the right house, and directed them to No. 3—there was no noise in No. 3 at that time—they could not get up stairs, seemingly—I heard no noise inside, but seemingly there was a man at the top of the stairs, and they could not get up—I then saw policeman No. 103 get upon the window shutters—he wanted to get into the one pair window—the shutter not being steady under his feet it was impossible for him to do so—Carroll came forwards with a quart pot in his hand, which caused him to jump down—he came to the one pair window—he lived in the one pair—he put his arm and body out of the window, trying to keep the man No. 103 out of the window—he came down, and not long afterwards the prisoner Davis brought in a ladder on his shoulder—I did not notice Davis before—he put the ladder up to the one-pair window, and went away, leaving it there—No. 103 went up the ladder, and broke some of the small panes with his staff—Carroll had the quart pot in his hand, reaching it out to keep him from coming into the room—I did not see him strike him—No. 103 came down, and Davis came with a sword afterwards—this was the first ladder that was there—Davis's sword was drawn, he pulled it from under hit coat—he ran up the ladder with the sword, and made a blow at Carroll—the first blow he made, Carroll put out his hand as a guard, to keep it from his head—he did no injury with the first blow—it did not strike him—the second offer he made, the deceased caught the sword in his hand, and Davis pulled the sword through his hand, which cut all his fingers; and he made a blow at him, and cut him in the head afterwards—Carroll was trying to guard himself with the quart pot—Davis struck him at different times afterwards</p>

               <p>on the head with the sword, and made different stabs at him—the other policemen were on the ladder at the time, trying to get at Carroll with their staves—there were three ladders brought at last—there were a good many policemen behind Davis, on the ladder he stood on, trying to get in, and the other ladders had men on them trying to get in—they did not get in then—the ladder gave way, and Davis fell—Davis was telling Carroll to come down, all this time—I cannot say exactly his words—I heard him telling Carroll to come down; and Carroll asked what they wanted of him, that he had neither beer, gin, or any thing else to give them—they made no answer that I heard—Davis fell on his left shoulder and face—I saw no more of Davis then—the next man I saw with the sword was Yates—he went up a small-round ladder—not the first ladder that came—not the one which Davis fell off—he had the same sword in his hand—I saw him go up the ladder, and make a blow at the deceased—it took effect in the head—I afterwards saw him catch him in the left-side of the head with the sword—that was another blow, it caused Carroll to stagger back three or four steps—he came to the window again with the quart pot—I saw Yates strike him at different times with the sword; but whether it took effect or not I cannot say, for the man was covered over with blood—I am sure be struck him—he made a blow at him which missed—the sword came against the side of the window, which broke the sword—he then came down the ladder—he was often called down by the rest of the police and his officers—I saw a serjeant there—when he came down, he went back again, took the sword, and went up again—and said, "D—n you, will you come down? I will have you down"—Carroll came forward with the quart pot, and put his knee on the open window—(he had all his clothes on)—Yates struck him over the knee—he was then called down, and came down and said, "D—n his eyes, one blow more would have settled it"—I saw no more of the prisoners then—the man who was on the stairs, in the course of a few minutes was taken prisoner—I do not know who that was—Carroll gave himself up, when the man on the stairs was taken—the policemen made their way up stairs—two or three men went in at the window, and Carroll gave himself up—Carroll and the other man were carried away as prisoners—I did not see Carroll strike either of the policemen—he struck at them very often—he made the attempt.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you sober? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; perfectly—I could see what was going on—I was within ten feet of Davis when he was on the ladder, with the sword in his hand—I had a clear view of it—the ladder gave way—I suppose it was from having so many people on it—I suppose four or five were on it—I did not see Carroll give Davis a clinck on the head with the quart pot, which tumbled him off the ladder—I did not see him picked up senseless—I had come out of the house, and I was at the bottom of the ladder, when it gave way—I did not see Carroll knock Davis with the quart-pot quite senseless off the ladder, I had my eye fixed on Davis—I saw Davis on the ground, when the ladder gave way—he was bleeding—Carroll could not reach him with the pot—Davis must have been bleeding from his fall down on the flags—he was bleeding over the temple—I see a mark over his brow—I really think the flags gave him that wound—he got up and walked away—I swear that—I did not hear him swear any—I did not hear him say any thing—I dare say I was ten or eleven feet from him when he fell—he got up of his own ac<lb/>cord, not very briskly—nobody helped him up, I am sure of that—I did not exactly notice—I saw no man take him up—I saw him get up, of his</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If any body had helped him to get up, must not you have seen it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps my eye was not fixed, for the first time he got up I saw no man getting him up—I cannot swear how long he was down—he got up, I suppose, in the course of a couple of minutes after he fell—I saw him raise himself from the ground; nobody helped him that I saw—nobody could do it without my seeing them, except they came in a hurry—on my oath he was not taken up senseless—he got up himself—I swear that deliberately—I saw him walk off himself, and two men with him—they were doing nothing to him that I saw—one of them had hold of him by the arm—I saw Davis come back—he stood at the end of the court, down the court, and back again—that was ten minutes afterwards—he had a handker<lb/>chief tied round his head—I do not know whether this is the pot Car<lb/>roll had (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—I cannot tell how this pot became covered with blood—I saw it in the officer's hands—it was then as it is now—I did not see it that night—I did not notice whether the pot Carroll had in his hand was bloody or not—Carroll had got no blow in the knee till after the ladder fell, and Davis went away.</p>

               <p>lived at No. 4, Star-court—I was not at the wake—I was alarmed by a noise, about half-past four, and got up—Daniel Carroll lived at No. 3, in the one pair—I came to the door of No. 3—there was a noise there—when first I came to the door, the police and I were just going in together; for Mrs. White, who lived in the parlour of No. 3, cried "Watch! Police!"—one policeman, No. 103, was going in at the door along with me—White's daughter had her hand to her cheek, where her brother had struck her, as she said—she was not bleeding—her cheek was quite red, as if she had had a blow—her mother wanted the policeman to go up stairs, to take her son out of the room from the wake—she said that the son was striking his own wife, and the daughter went in at the door, between him and his wife, and he struck the daughter—Mrs. White is not Carroll's mother—the policeman said, he could not go up, at his peril—it was very quiet and still at this time—he said, "I cannot go in, without murder being cried"—the daughter who got the blow from the brother, desired her mother to cry out, "Murder"—I then just came in, to put on my clothes, having nothing on at the time, but a quilt about me—I had not stopped above twenty minutes—I heard no noise during that time, nor till I came out again—I then saw two policemen coming down the stairs, one of them without his hat or staff, and the other had his hand against his mouth, as if it was bleeding—I cannot say whether he was bleeding; as it was darkish—I returned in again to get my shoes, as I had not put them on—the police sprang their rattles very fast; and No. 103, who was one of them, ran down from the top of the court, by my door, to the water<lb/>closet—he had his hat on—he ran to the privy, took hold of the door, and shook it—he looked in, turned about, and stooped for a big stone which was by the privy-door—I said, "Pray, Sir, don't throw that stone; if you do, you will commit murder"—he could not take it up, it was too heavy—he came further, and got a bit of a stone-jug, and <hi rend="italic">slung</hi> it in at the win<lb/>dow—I begged him not to do it, as the child laid there dead—he then got up on the window-shutter, and put his hand on the little bolt of the shutter of the parlour window—he then got his hand on the ledge of the window, and struck up with his staff—they had put his hat and staff out of the window to him, and said they would have nothing more to do with him—Carroll then came to the window, as he struck the win<lb/>dow first with his staff—Carroll had a pot in his hand, and said, "What do you want with me?—I have thrown you out what you wanted, your hat and staff; what more do you want of me?"—there was no disturbance on the stairs—then the policemen were all coming very fast—when Carroll came to the window with the pot in his hand, as he opened the window, the po<lb/>liceman No. 103 fell down off the shutter—then a step-ladder was brought and placed against the wall—No. 103 was the first man who <hi rend="italic">entered</hi> the ladder, and he broke the window with his staff—Carroll was at the window at the time, and No. 103 <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> his staff into the window at him—Carroll was at the window at the time, with the pot in his hand, telling them to keep down from his place, that there was no <hi rend="italic">row</hi> nor disturbance; that he had done nothing that they should try to enter his place; that he had thrown the staff and hat out, and he had a child lying dead; that he was a poor man out of employment, and out of there he would not go, for he knew not what he had done—No. 103 ran down the ladder; there were several of them besides on the ladder, trying to get to Carroll with their staves—No. 103 took the staves out of the hands of the other policemen, and <hi rend="italic">slung</hi> them through the window—Carroll came to the window, and</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> them out as fast as he threw them in—I saw another ladder brought by the prisoner Davis—he placed it before the window, and went away for the space of twenty minutes, and then returned with a sword—he went up the ladder, and squared the sword at the de<lb/>ceased, and the first <hi rend="italic">dart</hi> he gave did not come through—then he cut at Carroll again, and cut him on the side of the head; and he gave another cut, and if that had come right, it would have cut his head off, but it cut the window-sash—he next cut him about a couple of cuts on the head, and he cut him on the cheek, and made a piece hang out of the cheek—his hand was against the lid of the window, and he cut the side of his two fingers off, <hi rend="italic">like</hi>—he cut the fingers through, <hi rend="italic">like</hi>—he cut them down, chipped them—Carroll was trying to cut at him with the pot all this time—he made several offers, but never struck but one policeman; and I cannot tell which one that was—they were all on the ladder, like a swarm of bees—he used to knock them down as they used to ascend—there were two steps out of the ladder which used to upset them; but there was another ladder, and that the policemen held—they fell themselves; for they were so desirous of the men getting on the ladder, that the ladder used to upset them down on the place—the man Carroll struck was not knocked down, for he stooped—he received the blow somewhere about the temple—I cannot say what was the consequence of that, but they were all close down on the ground—I do not know who got the blow on the temple—there was a good deal of blood came from it—the man did not lie senseless on the ground—the ladder did not fall—Davis stood on the second ladder when he fell—a woman put the end of a broom against the window, to knock the blows off the deceased—she did not strike Davis with the broom—the deceased and the woman put their hands against the ladder, and it came down—the ladder dropped from the side of the window, and Davis fell down, and the sword—I saw him on the ground—he was not above a few minutes on the ground, when he was taken up by the rest of his brothers—he was bleeding at the time, for when he came down to the ground, he was cut by the side of the broken ladder in places—he was cut on his head, which way I cannot tell, but he seemed to be cut—the rest of them took him up, and took him away—I saw him half, or three quarters of an hour afterwards, with a handkerchief, or something, about his head.</p>

I was in Star-court on the 5th of April—I went there between four and five o'clock—I heard the cries of" Mur<lb/>der "—some women stood outside crying" Murder"—no one went with me at that time—I went into the ground floor room of the house, and I heard the men up stairs crying "Murder"—I went out and was coming up the court, and met Davis and Pike—I had gone out to call assistance—we all three want up stairs on the first floor—we got in without any difficulty—when I got in I found four or five men fighting—I parted them—we parted them, and were about to come away from the room when we were attacked—the de<lb/>ceased called out for the poker—I had not offered any violence to him—I did not strike any of them before I was attacked—Davis was struck by the deceased with the poker—it was a kind of bar which appeared to be used for a poker—the brother of the deceased came to me—I held his blows off with my arm, and beat his blows off with my staff—I did not see any thing in bis hand—we were then beaten down stairs, and went out, and sprang our rattles for further assistance—I did not perceive any mark of violence on Davis, but the poker struck his head—he had not a hat on then—he had it on when he went up stairs, but it was lost in the scuffle—I saw no injury received by any one, when we were beaten down stairs—some brother<lb/>officers came to our assistance—I returned back, and found one of my brother<lb/>officers on the stairs, and the deceased's brother and others were <hi rend="italic">pitching into</hi> him—I cannot tell who they were; the deceased's brother <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> ont to," Do you want any thing to drink?" and threw down a lot of lime-water out of a quart pot—I then tried to shade the blows off my brother-officer, Burn, and what they were beating with, broke my staff short off—I then went down stairs, and went to the privy to see if I could get any thing to reach the quart pot from the deceased's hand up at the window—the deceased was at the win<lb/>dow at that time—I mounted the shutter—he was away from the window then—I looked in at the window—he saw me, and ran from the top of the stairs at me to the window, with the quart pot, and drove me down off the shutter—I found nothing in the privy to answer my purpose—I did not take up a piece of stone jar, and throw it in at the window—I took up a bit of a pitcher which laid by, and put it down again—I did not try to lift up a heavy stone—when I took up the bit of a pitcher, Larkin said,</p>

               <p>"Put that down, do not be a coward"—I took it up, intending to throw it at him, to knock the quart pot out of his hand—I am quite certain I did not throw it—there were ladders then at the window—I was ordered by one of the Serjeants to clear the court of the mob who came in—I went to do so—when I returned I saw Davis—he was about to mount the ladder, and had a cutlass in his hand—a cutlass is allowed in the country divisions, but it is not allowed in our division, that I am aware of—I turned away for about a minute, and looked round—I then turned again, and saw the de<lb/>ceased fighting away at my brother-officers—Davis was about to cut the quart pot from the deceased's hand—he was striking at his hand with the cutlass—the deceased turned round to hit Davis—whether he struck him at that time, I cannot say—I did not tee him aim several blows—I saw Davis aim one blow, to hit Carroll on the head, and he turned round to hit Davis, and knocked him completely off the ladder—he had one hand holding the ladder, and the other hold of the quart pot—he struck Davis over the head with the quart pot, and Davis fell senseless—he laid there a short time, and the rest of the policemen assisted him away senseless—they led him away—he leaned down with weakness—he returned in twenty minutes or half an hour—after he was gone, I saw some of my brother-officers going up the ladder, trying to get in at the win<lb/>dow—I saw a man with a sword, whom I did not know—he is not here—he is not known, I believe—he was not a policeman—he had the same sword that Davis had—(I saw Yates shortly afterwards with the sword, but did not see him hit any blows with it, for it was then broken—he was swinging it over his head on the ladder, and then he came down)—the man in plain clothes was threatened by some of the mob, and I left, to see him safe out of the court and out of the lane—I saw him do no more with the sword than fling it over his head backwards and forwards—I saw him safely out of the lane—I returned and saw the sword lying down in the middle of the court, broken—I did not see the deceased receive any cut in the knee—both the Carrolls were taken in my presence—I saw the deceased brought out—I believe he was the last that was brought out—I did not go into the room.</p>

                  </hi>. On the morning of the 5th of April, I heard rattles spring in the neighbourhood of Star-court—on getting there, I saw Davis and Pike—Burn was there, bleeding from the mouth—he gave me an ac<lb/>count of what had happened—he was without his hat, cape, and staff—I made an attempt to go up the stairs of the house, but was struck three times on my hat, with a poker, by Francis Carroll—my hat was cut in three places—I received a blow on my left elbow, which prevented me from using it—I could not lift my hand to my head that night, when I came on duty—Burn went up stairs after me, and I saw Carroll's brother kick him in the mouth—the Serjeant came in, and turned the lantern on, and by the light of that, I saw the kick given—Burn came to the door, and had his three teeth knocked out—he appeared injured about the head and shoulder—the serjeant sent me to the station-house with him—I assisted him part of the way—he was bleeding all the way—after that, I returned with a ladder—Davis borrowed my staff of me, and went up the ladder to capture the prisoner, and to get his hat, staff, and cape—he had received an injury Wore he went up, for I saw his face bleedings Carroll, the deceased, was in the room at the time, and he advanced towards the window, with a quart pot in his hand, to strike at Davis—he struck at Davis before Davis had done any thing to him, before he could reach the window—Davis had my staff in his hand then—he used the staff when he was struck at by Carroll, in his own defence—the deceased took the staff from him—Davis came down, and shortly after, I saw him ascend the ladder again, with a cutlass in his hand—he desired Carroll to give himself up—Carroll said he would not—if he gave himself up, it should be for something—he would have the life of somebody, before he surrendered—Davis had not at that time used or offered to use the sword—the deceased took the quart pot, and struck him over the eye a very severe blow—he got three or four blows from the pot—the deceased then turned the ladder, and threw Davis off it—I consider that Davis used the sword to keep off the blows of the pot—Car<lb/>roll turned the ladder over and threw Davis down—I assisted in picking him up—he was very much hurt indeed, and was not able to help himself—two officers took him out of my hands, and led him to the top of the court—I am quite sure, before Davis used the sword in any way, that he had received several blows from the quart pot from Carroll.</p>

I examined the person of the child after death, on the follow<lb/>ing day, by the desire of the constable—I saw it at the father's house—I do not know whether the prisoner was in the room at the time—I saw the child in its life-time, in a very emaciated state—the first question I asked was, whether it was a nine-months child; for I thought it was a premature birth—I was informed that it was a child of nine months—I was struck with its squalid appearance, and consider it must have been totally neglected from its birth, or was labouring under disease—there was one or two small bruises on the face or cheek—I do not think they could be the immediate cause of death—my opinion is, they could not hare caused its death—I think a child receiving a blow on the face, to cause bruises, would be shook at the time—I cannot say whether that shaking might have caused a rupture of blood-vessels in the head, but the bruises could not have caused death—in my judgment, the cause of death was a blow given on the head, from some cause or other—whether it had fallen down I cannot say—I examined it under the apprehension that it had not died from violent means, and did not take another surgeon with me; but when I made an incision over the scalp, I found a considerable quantity of extravasated blood, and got another surgeon to assist me; and, on further examination, I considered a blow must have been given on the head, to produce the extravasation—a blow with the flat hand would be sufficient in so young a child—there was a considerable quantity of extna<lb/>vasated blood on the brain and under the scalp, on the bone of the cra<lb/>nium, as well as within the bone—there was no fracture of the skull—a fracture seldom happens where the skull is so tender; it would rather yield to the blow—I saw one mark on the upper part of the bone of the cranium, which, in my judgment, was produced by violence—the prisoner was in the room when I went to examine the body, but I requested the might leave the room.</p>

I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the appearances on the brain, in my judgment, were the cause of death—it is almost impossible to say when it was inflicted—the quantity of extravasated blood might be more or less—a certain quantity might have been poured out at the time of the accident, and the vessel be<lb/>come plugged up, and afterwards poured out again—I imagine it to have been a recent injury—it might have been as much as a week before, in my opinion</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183506150147"/>
               <p>—I formed my opinion from a case which came before me three months previous, where a child fell from the nurse's arms on the ground; pre<lb/>cisely the same appearances were found, and the child lived a month—it epends on a variety of circumstances when death follows—in that instance, there was a large quantity of blood external of the cranium—it is not im<lb/>possible that a vessel might have been raptured, and continued bleeding at tervals within the brain.</p>

On the day the child died, I called on the prisoner, and found the child on the drawers in her room—I asked her how it came by its death—she immediately pulled the napkin off the baby, and said, "There it is"—I said, "How came it by its death? "—she said, "I did it"—I said, "You did what?"—she said, I smacked the child's face"—I asked her why she smacked the child's face—she made no answer, but began to fret—she appeared overcome with grief, and in a rery melancholy way indeed.</p>

The prisoners were in oar em<lb/>ploy; John for thirteen years, and George is our apprentice—he has been nearly seven years with us—there is a bed-room at our bouse, in which both the prisoners sleep occasionally, but George more frequently—in conse<lb/>quence of some information, I desired a search to be made, and eight flats joints were found in a box, in the bed-room, which George said was his box—these are the joints—they are all ours, with the exception of one, which I have my doubts about—there were four pieces of ivory found in the same bed-room, in a hat box: but I believe neither of them owned the box.</p>

Lovell and La<lb/>zell were in my employ, as carters—on the 10th of June I gave out a sack of spilt beans to each of them to feed their horses—on the 11th they were to go out twice for dung—I was out that morning, from three to a quarter-past three o'clock—I came to Carr-hall-lane, and I saw my two waggons; which these men ought to have been with, standing at the corner of the lane—I saw Lovell—I told him he ought not to go on with his waggon, and leave the other waggon in the position in which it stood—I then saw Lizell coming in a direction from the Thatched-house, which is in the high-road to Woodford—I went home, and at breakfast-time my father made a con<lb/>munication to me—in consequence of that, I sent two patrols, with a sample of beans which I took from the bulk—they afterwards brought about there bushels of spilt beans in two sacks—these are them—I believe they an part of my beans—these are my sacks—I took them of my father at a valuation.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Nelson-street, Camberwell. On Saturday, the 23rd of May, about half-past one o'clock, I was going home from my pay table—I work at Wapping—I was going down Nelson-street—within six or seven doors of my own lodging, I saw two men standing between me and the footway, which is very narrow—I went out in the road to pass them—one of them jumped across and collared me—the prisoners are the two men I saw, I am pefectly sure—I am a little short-sighted—Mills stepped across to me, collared me, and pulled me into the footway where the other man was—he asked me, who I was—I said, "A friend"—I had a bundle under my arm, and a crown-piece in my right-hand pocket, and sixpence in copper—I had half-a-sovereign in my left-hand waistcoat pocket, sewed up by itself—Mills asked me whether I was English or Irish—I said, "Irish"—he said, "B—t the Irish, I don't like them"—he told me then to give him a shilling and he would let me go—I told him I had no shilling about me, no more I had; and as I would not give him the shilling—I was facing him, he turned my face away, came behind me, and gave me a blow with his fist on the <hi rend="italic">pole</hi> of the head, and sent me reeling into the road—I was striving to get up, and when I got my senses I cried out "Murder," for I was out of my senses, when he knocked me at first—he knocked me out of my senses—when I cried "Murder," he ran and knocked me down again, gave me two or three <hi rend="italic">pelts</hi>, and said if I spoke another word out of my lips, I should be murdered on the spot—I do not know what the other man did while I was down; but when I got up they were both standing together over me—I told them I would not speak a word at all if they would let me go with my life—I did not care what they did, so that they let me go with my life—they then let me go—I lost a bundle—I do not know whether they took it or not—I lost it when they knocked me down at first—they remained on the spot a little after I got up, and I ran away towards my lodgings—when I had run a little bit from them, I put my hand in my pocket, and my crown-piece and some of the coppers were gone—to the best of my knowledge I heard them feeling in my pocket, but I do not know whether they took any thing out, but I lost the crown-piece, threepence in copper, and the things that were in the bundle—the halfpence and crown were loose in my pocket—they might have tumbled out—I ran away directly I got up—I did not stop to look for my bundle.</p>

                  </hi>. On Tuesday, the 9th of June, about half-past ten o'clock, I was at the Crown and Anchor, in the Kent-road, in the long room—I remained there till nearly half-past one o'clock—I had been drinking—I had two pints of ale and some cyder—I drank with one or two others who I knew—I did not have above half a quartern of cyder—I might drink a glass or two of ale with others—when I got up to go away I was about <hi rend="italic">half-and-half</hi>, not drunk or sober—I was aware of what I was doing, and what was done to me—on coming down stairs, I saw Glannon, whom I have known from a child—I went up to the bar, and told him I was very glad to see him out of trouble, and I partook of a glass of gin from his hand—the other prisoner drank—I do not know him—I knew him by sight before, but not to have much acquaintance with him—I had fre<lb/>quently seen him before—he was in company with Glannon—after having the gin, I went outside the door, to go away—I left the house, and was followed by Chappell, who pretended to be very drank indeed—I had seen him in the house, and should not think he was drunk then—he ran up against me, and shoved me about—he shoved me up into one corner—Glannon was there at the time, and I was placed on a bench by him, on my back—my legs were put up in the air by some of them—I believe there were others besides the prisoners there—Glannon was lying on my chest, keeping me down on the seat, and I had something put into-my month—I thought it was a piece of old hat, or cloth—I was trying to call out "Murder," but could not from the pressure against my breast, and my mouth was stuffed full of something, what I cannot tell—I cannot say who did it—it prevented my hallooing and making a noise—at that time Chappell was at my fob, in which I had a silver watch, and three gold seals, a gold key, and gold chain—I made great resistance—I found my chain in Chappell's hands—it broke away in the scuffle—I cannot say whether it broke away, at that time or not—he had removed it from my person—I had a scuffle with him for the chain, and cannot say whether he dropped part of the chain, or I did, but it fell—I was lying on my back, and the chain was found on the bench, between my legs—it was broken, and part of it gone—ray trowsers were torn away to get at my watch—I said at the time that I was robbed of my watch, but it was found in my fob—Whitford, the policeman, was there—I saw both the prisoners in the custody of the police, and was quite positive they were the men, and said so—Glannon said at the station-house, that he hoped I should not press the case against them—I have been an old police-officer of Bow-street and Union Hall, for fourteen years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ladies' shoe-maker, and live in Trafalgar-place, Lock's-fields. On Wednesday morning, I was at the door of the Crown and Anchor, about half-past one o'clock, sitting on a bench outside—Gill came and sat down on the bench opposite to me—he told me there had been an attempt to rob him of his watch—I saw his chain and seals hang<lb/>ing out in the usual way—he did not pull his watch out—I gave him some advice, and he shortly afterwards shifted himself from sitting opposite to me, and came and sat down by my side, and he either put his chain and seals inside his flap or pocket, so as to conceal them—Chappell came up and pretended to be very much intoxicated—his hat fell off several times, and each time his hat fell off, he got nearer to the end of the table where the prosecutor was, and then he fell into the prosecutor's lap—he went from one seat to the other, across the table, to fall into his lap—the prosecutor put him out, and then he fell into his lap again—Glannon was sitting on the seat, and when he came, the two prisoners began to hustle the pro<lb/>secutor—he was hustled on to a bench, on his back, and his feet upwards—he was surrounded by half a dozen persons—I jumped over the table to get out of the way—his legs were up in the air—I did not see any thing that they did to him—a constable came (No. 156, I believe) and took them—the prosecutor got off the bench, and said, "I have been robbed of my watch"—Glannon, I think, said, "Search him before he goes away from the place, as he says he has lost his watch"—the prosecutor instantly gave part of the chain and seals to the policeman, out of his left hand.</p>
               <p>

Q.</hi> How long have you known Gill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never saw him before that night—he told me that an attempt had been made to rob him of his watch, before Chappell came and sat by his side—I did not see him laid on the bench—I did not go into the crowd to see him—I was before the Magistrate last Friday week, which was two days after this happened—the policeman asked me to go—I was taking half a pint of por<lb/>ter this night—I am married, but it was fair time—I had been at the pub<lb/>lic-house about half an hour—I drank a share of two pots of porter—I had not been drinking before in any public-house—I had part of a pint of beer at the County Terrace—I did not go to Greenwich—I did not go to the station-house to state this, because I did not want to lose my time—I did</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoe-maker, and live in Fryar-street. I was at the public-house with Smith—the prosecutor came from the public-house, up to where I was sitting, and pulled out his watch-chain—I told him to put it in again, and he put it into his fob—I could not see whether he put it all in—he pulled it out as far as it would come, so as leave the watch in his pocket—after this he sat down on the right hand, at a little distance from Smith—at that time there were from fifty to sixty persons sitting down in two rows of settles—there were others sitting at the same bench with us—I did not know them—there was one man sitting between the prosecutor and Smith—Chappell came and sat on my right-hand side, then moved round to my left-hand side, and appeared very dronk—he fell with his arm on the table, and his hat came off—I think it was sham, from his manner—he got up once, and appeared to be looking after something, and then he got up quite firm—he did not get up on his feet, but merely lifted himself up—he went towards the prosecutor—I did not see him do anything—the prosecutor moved himself, and Went towards the corner—I saw Chappell go towards him—what he did I do not know—four or five were round him when they were robbing him—I do not know Glannon at all—I got out of my seat, went a short distance, saw two policemen, and told them a man was being robbed—I had turned my head, and Smith said, "Don't you see they are robbing him?"—I saw them rummaging about—the policemen came and took the prisoners.</p>
