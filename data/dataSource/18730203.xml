I am a dealer in woollen cloth, in Bond Court, Walbrook—I buy lots of cloth to sell again—this 1170 yards of cloth was bought by me through the prisoner of a Mr. Brayshaw, a manufacturer of Leeds—it is what is called waterproof cloth, which is more in demand at one season of the year—I bought it at the end of the season at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard nett—the prisoner was not paid anything by me on that occasion—what Mr. Brayshaw gave him I don't know—Mr. Brayshaw came himself, and I paid him the money at the time—time (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the invoice settled by him—the cloth was in thirty pieces when I bought it on 15th November—about the 25th November the prisoner called and said if I wanted to sell it he knew a person who wanted it for shipping, who would give a good price for it—I said I would give him 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard commission, and that would be about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the lot; that was in the presence of Mr. Walters, my clerk—the prisoner took a pattern of the cloth to show—he called each day after<lb/>wards, and on the 27th he came and said that a man named Davis had agreed to give him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. with 25 per cent, off—that would bring it to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. nett—he did not give me Davis's address then—I wrote to him on the 28th to tell him to let me have an answer—on the 29th he came and said that Davis had agreed to take it at that price, and he then wrote on this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) the name "J. Davis"—I then proceeded to make out an invoice—I did not put any name at the head of the invoice—I sent my clerk to Perry's to make inquiries as to the reputation of Davis; they were quite satisfactory—the quantity sold to Davis was 1170 yards, contained in twenty-four pieces out of the thirty—the cloth was at my packers', Turner &amp; Co., in Barge Yard, Bucklersbury—Mr. Boutland carries on the business under that name—the prisoner told me they were to go to Pewtress, another packer's, in Bush Lane, for Davis—he said that Davis would have</p>

               <p>them sent there, and would call over and pay for them at Pewtress's, when he had looked over them—I sent the pieces on to Pewtress's, and as I did not know anything about Davis I followed the cart on, and the prisoner came after me—I said to him "I am sending these over to Pewtress's, and I have got the note here; they are to be held to ray order at Pewtress's, not to be given up until they are paid for"—he immediately said "I have been and seen Davis, and he won't take them; he says they are too good for him"—the cloth did not go on to Pewtress's, it went nearly there; but when the prisoner said that, I told them to take the cloth back to Boutland, and it was taken back—I left the invoice I had made out, which had no name on it, on my desk—I only put the date and twenty-four pieces of cloth, 1174 yards—the prisoner came back with me to the office after going with the cart—I left the invoice on the desk when I went out, and when the prisoner went away it was gone—I did not give it to the prisoner—I did not make out an invoice to him in his own name—I never thought of such a thing—he has no place of business—this invoice was produced to me at the Police Court—it is the invoice that was taken away without my authority from my counting-house—it never had my name upon it—I am quite positive about that—on 3rd December the prisoner called again and brought me this card of Mr. Hillyer, and said he had sold the cloth to Hillyer at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. nett—I said I would inquire at Perry's about Hillyer, if he was trustworthy, and if I found it all right I would send them down the day after—the prisoner came again on the morning of the 3rd—Graves, Mr. Boutland's manager, was there—I told Graves in the prisoner's presence that I had sold these goods to Hillyer, and he must take them down to Hillyer's, and I gave him a note with the partioulars on it, with the amouut he had to receive, and strict orders, three or four times over, not to leave the goods without the money—I also told him if Hillyer wanted a yard a piece allowed, he was to allow it as the custom of the trade—I put that in writing—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "R. Hillyer, 29 and 31, Hare Street, Bethnal Green, received for me 91<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 d, at Messrs. Turner &amp; Co.'s, packers, entered twenty-four pieces of cloth, 1170 yards"—the prisoner stood by while the pieces were put into the cart from Boutland's—I was there, and Graves and Mr. Boutland both helped to put the pieces into the cart, and the prisoner went away with Graves to deliver them at Hillyer's, and I never saw him again until he was in custody—I found that a person named Rosenberg had been given into custody by Bennett, Mr. Boutland's man—I don't remember the date, it was on the Saturday that I went to Worship Street, in the same week—I there saw sixteen out of the twenty-four pieces of cloth—I knew nothing of Rosenberg—I never heard anything of him—I believe these two papers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be in the prisoner's writing, but I can't say because I don't know his writing—I saw Him write a note, just the name, but I can't say that I know his writing; I think this is his writing, but I could not swear it—I never authorised him to make out an invoice for the cloth in his own name, or to give a receipt in his own name—he had nothing to do with either selling the goods or receiving the money—the price I have named would allow 91<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was to give him 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard off that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The first time I ever knew the prisoner was when he came wanting to sell me these goods—I had not known him before—I had never dealt with Mr. Brayshaw before—the prisoner did not tell me that he had no capital of his own, but that he knew of some goods that he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187302030005"/>
               <p>could purchase, and he thought might make a considerable profit out of the transaction by finding the cash—he never mentioned anything of the kind—he came several times in November, but it was on the 15th that I agreed to buy these goods—I did buy them, and they were deposited in my warehouse—I have part of Boutland's warehouse in Barge Yard—I first heard that he had got a purchaser for the goods when he came to tell me that Davis had bought them—he did not mention the name at first, he said a party would buy; that was on the 27th November—that was the first time anything was mentioned about his selling the goods—he first mentioned the name on the 29th, when the goods were said to be sold—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the letter I wrote to him, dated the 28th—I said at the Police Court that I had never written such a letter; I had forgotten it—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Merchant Traders' Discount Office, November, 28th.—Mr. Richardson.—Sir,—I will not take less than 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per yard for the goods; and, as they are under offer, I must know at once.")—2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is mentioned there, but 25 per cent. off would make it 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that was the price he said, and he was to have 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard commission on the nett amount—the price was the same, both to Davis and Hillyer—when he came on the 29th he had nobody with him; he never had any one with him—my clerk, Mr. Walters, was with me—he was in several times when the prisoner came—I discount a good many bills for traders in the City—I don't keep a regular warehouse—I buy a lot of cloths at the end of the season, and keep them over till the next season—I have a warehouse and an office—I had not many goods at this particular time, because it was just at the end of the season, when I should buy various lots—persons come to offer goods for sale who you have never known before; that is a common things in the City—I looked to Brayshaw—I knew Brayshaw, of Leeds and Aldermanbury—I sent to Perry's to inquire both about Davis and Hillyer—I found they were respectable persons; I would trust either of them—I should never send goods sold for cash unless I knew they were likely to be paid for; I would never send them, except to a respectable man, because very often tricks may be played—if you deliver goods you don't always get your money—this is the invoice that I began to make out, and which I left on my desk for Davis, and which disappeared—that was on 29th November—that was the day after I wrote the letter stating that I had an offer from another person—that was a man in the Fulham Road, named Jones, and I sold him some of them afterwards—I never heard of Bernard or Searle—no one came with the prisoner to my office on the 29th, or on any occasion, except Mr. Brayshaw, when the goods were bought on the 15th—no person came with the prisoner on the 29th—there was a person who he said had come to look at the goods on 2nd December, a shopman of Hillyer's; he did not bring that person into me—I told him to take him across, and show him the goods at Turner's place; that is all I know about any other person—I never saw any other person with him—that was not on the 29th November, but on the 2nd December—it was at the prisoner's suggestion that the goods were taken to Pewtress's; he ordered them to be taken to Pewtress's for Davis, and Davis was to pay for them there.</p>

               <p>on that occasion that Davis's name was mentioned—Mr. Stepheson com<lb/>menced to write this invoice in my presence—there was some conversation between me and Mr. Stephenson about the Christian name of Davis—I had been to Perry's about it—no name was ever written on that invoice to my knowledge, not whilst it was in my possession—I never gave the prisoner authority to take it off the desk or from the floor of the office—he had no right to have possession of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had no conversation with the prisoner about Hillyer's matter that I am aware of—he did not tell me that Hillyer had paid him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account by way of deposit—he gave me a portion of the information that led me to go to Perry's to make inquiries about Davis and Hillyer—he only told us of Davis on the 29th; we did not know anything about Hillyer then—he gave us some information with respect to them which we found to be correct—we found Davis to be a respectable man, quite to be trusted—I believe I was present at the first conversation between Mr. Stephenson and the prisoner about the goods from Brayshaw—I don't recollect the prisoner saying that he had no capital, but that he knew of some things that might be bought, and if my master would find the capital for him, a considerable profit might be made upon them—I believe the words used were, was Mr. Stephenson willing to buy any goods of that kind—I don't recollect any conversation of the sort you mention, or the word profit on the transaction being used—he came some days afterwards, and asked if they were sold, and said he would sell them for Mr. Stephen<lb/>son, and Mr. Stephenson agreed with him, I believe, to give him 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per yard commission—I heard him do that, and the prisoner seemed satisfied; that was all I heard said.</p>

Mutter &amp; Co.—Real was the driver—they never came back again—I received directions from Mr. Stephenson in the prisoner's presence to take the goods down to Mr. Hillyer's, at Bethnal Green, and to have the money or bring away the goods—I went to Hare Street, Bethnal Green, to a hatter's shop, with the name of Hillyer over the door—the prisoner went with me—I had with me this paper as my authority to receive the 91<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were several persons in the shop—the goods were taken in—the prisoner went in first, I think—when I went in there was a female behind the bar who, I hear, was Mrs. Hillyer—she had some money in her apron—I said "That is what I want"—she remarked "You will have none of that" or something to that effect, and she took a cap and placed it away—I got no money; but I left the</p>

Hillyer's shop, I presume the warehouseman—the shop at Hoxton was a similar shop; a hatter's, with Mr. Hillyer's name—we did not find Mr. Hillyer there—the party who went with us said that Mr. Hillyer was supposed to be back in about ten minutes—he said "Well it is cold waiting, will you have a glass of anything to drink?"—I said "Yes, I don't mind if I do," and we went and had something—when we got into the public-house, the prisoner said to the other party, a tall man, "Have you got the invoice?"—he said "No, I have not, I have left it in the goods"—the prisoner said "Oh then I had better go and fetch it," and he immediately went out to fetch it, as I sup<lb/>posed; the tall man stayed with me—I did not go back to the shop at Hoxton—I went back to the shop at Hare Street in about half an hour—the tall man went with me—I did not find the prisoner or the goods there—they were gone—I next saw the goods at the police-station on the Saturday following—I never saw the prisoner again till he was in custody—I saw Rosenberg in the dock at Worship Street, and was examined as a witness.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the clerk in charge of the Temple Bar Post Office—the prisoner was employed in that office as a lance-corporal of the telegraph boys—there was a bag kept in the office where packets were placed, and when the bag was full they were placed near it—it was the duty of the letter-collector to take them up when he came at 9 o'clock—they should remain there till he came—it was the prisoner's duty to deliver the bag to the collector—on the evening of 14th January I left the office about 8. 10, leaving the prisoner there in charge—he let me out—I returned at 8. 50—the bag would be made up at 9 o'clock—directly I returned I sent the prisoner away and examined the contents of the bag, and, in cones<lb/>quence of what I saw there, I called him down again—I said "Corporal, I find there are some stamps missing from this packet, just turn out your pockets"—he did so—he had these five addressed wrappers in his pocket; he pulled them out—I asked him how he came by them—he said his father gave them to him to procure books and enclose them—I asked him if his father would endorse that statement, and he said "Yes"—I then took him down to the General Post Office, and explained it to the overseer, whom I saw there, and left the prisoner in his charge—I returned to the branch office—there are lockers in the office—I had one of the lockers opened by a boy whom I called from the room up stairs, and the next morning I saw a key fitted to that locker, which it opened—there was also a key which opened a tin box inside the locker—I saw portions of the wrappers in the grate partly burnt—there was a fire in the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable attached to the Post Office—on 14th January I was sent for to the Post Office, about 12.30 at night—I saw the prisoner there and took him in charge—I saw these wrappers there—I asked him where he got them from—he said they were given to him by his father to enclose some works which he was to get and send to customers in the country—he afterwards asked for a pen and ink, and wrote down the this statement—"Sir, I beg to state that all I have said concerning the way</p>

               <p>these papers came into my possession is false. The following is the whole truth of the matter: these papers containing sundry books, &amp; c, were lying on the office floor. I took them up to examine the contents, and tore the the wrappers in doing so; I had no intention at the time of keeping them, but, having torn the corners, I was debating how to replace them, when the C. in C. [clerk in charge] rang the door-bell, and I crammed the covers in my pocket to escape oberservation. However she asked me whether I had any objection to turn out my pockets; I complied with her request, and the result was she found them on me. The contents are in my looker, in the office just as I tore the papers off. Father has nothing at all to do with the matter. This is the first time I ever stole any thing, and I am extremely sorry that it should happen now.—I remain, yours obediently, Henry Wells."—I found a pencil and a bunch of keys on him—he said they belonged to his locker at the office—I opened the locker and the tin box which was inside with those keys the next morning.</p>

I was attracted by a picture in the inside which I wished to look at. I carried them down into the kitchen to endeavour to refasten them, but before I had time to do so, there was a ring at the bell. I went up stairs, putting the wrappers in my pocket the same time, and found Miss Shapland was at the door. I remained in the office in case she should wish me to get anything, when she said 'You can go up stairs as I have a letter to write. I went up stairs, but was summoned down the next moment by a ring at the door, which I opened, and as I was about going up stairs again, Miss Shapland called me to her and showed me the two packets from which the stamps had been removed, asking me at the same time if I had any objection to turn my pockets out. I complied with her request, and produced the five parcel wrappers. Upon Miss Shapland en<lb/>quiring where I obtained these, I replied that my father gave them to me with instructions to procure books, and send to their addresses. I have nothing further to say except what I said in my former statement."</p>

In consequence of instructions I received from Mr. Bell, I have been watching his oyster rooms (Pim's) in the Poultry—my attention was particularly called to the premises on the morning of the 15th January—Manning and Buckmaster were in Mr. Bell's employment—I saw Buckmaster come a little after 8 o'clock to the premises, with Pross and Watson, with a barrow—Manning came from the shop, and they commenced unloading the barrow—Buckmaster carried in the first sack of oysters—I saw the barrow unloaded till all but one sack of oysters were gone—I then saw Buckmaster and Manning come from the shop towards the barrow, Buckmaster carrying what appeared to be a bundle of empty sacks in his arms—Manning was close to him, on his left side—the bundle of sacks was placed on the barrow by Buckmaster—Manning took the sack of oysters which had been left on the barrow on his back, and went into the shop with it—an empty barrel and a basket were placed on the barrow afterwards—Buckmaster and Watson went away with the barrow, being followed at some distance by Pross—in Lombard Street Pross joined them, and they went on to Philpot Lane—Watson assisted in pushing the barrow and in coming likewise—half-way down Philpot Lane the barrow was stopped, and Buckmaster and Watson put on the head of Pross a basket containing a sack—Buckmaster and Watson went on with the barrow and I followed Pross—the sack appeared to have something in it, and it was taken from the place where Buckmaster had placed the sacks—I stopped Pross at the top of Talbot Court and told him that I was an officer, and asked him what he had on his head—he said, "Some oysters"—I said, "Where are you going to take them?"—he said, "To a Mr. Hughes, down here by the Monument"—I said, "Where did you get them from?"—he said, "Little <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, from Marlow's, gave them to me in Thames Street"—I told him I had reason to believe that the oysters were stolen from Pim's, in the Poultry, and I should have to take him into custody—I then took him, with the sack, to the police-station—the sack was opened, and it was found to contain 260 oysters, which were clean—I went again to the premises in the Poultry and watched.</p>

               <p>Pim's—Mr. Bell is one of the partners—Manning was a porter there, and has been in the employ about six years, and Buckmaster three years, to bring fish from the market with his barrow—Manning's duty was to attend with me at Billingsgate Market in the morning, and buy fish and oysters as re<lb/>quired, and it was Buckmaster's duty to convey them to the premises in the. Poultry, and Manning would be there to receive them—when I bought the goods, I used to meet him, and ask him what he had received, and if he had not received the quantity, I used to tell him the quantity he should receive and would tell him if he had received the right quantity—oysters would not be washed until I gave him orders for them to be washed—it was Manning's duty to wash them as they were wanted—the oysters were kept in a cellar by themselves and the fish in another place—Manning has the entire charge of the cellar where the oysters were deposited—he is responsible to me for them, and all oysters whether dirty or washed would be kept in the cellar, except those immediately in use up stairs—on the morning of 15th January he was with me in Billingsgate Market—Buckmaster was also there with his barrow—they were both present when the barrow was loaded—amongst other things, that morning I purchased two sacks of oysters which were put on the barrow with some fish—I left them to take the fish and oysters, and it was Manning's duty to assist in bringing them from the market and then receive them, and the oysters would be deposited in the oyster-cellar, and put under lock and key—the oysters I bought that morning were dirty, as they came from the dredgers—I know nothing of either the prosecutor or Watson—I have seen them about the market, in fact I had employed prosecutor about Christmas-time, when I was pressed, but I did not know his name—as regards Watson, I did not know him—I did not employ him on the morning of the 15th—after I had purchased the first I went to the premises in the Poultry—Manning was then in custody—Buckmaster would have access to the cellar when he was assisting Manning to carry the oysters in—the value of the 260 would be worth a little over 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

I said "The landlord will not be down till 9, but I will pay the train for you" I did not know—that the house had been broken into, or any money stolen.

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Dr. Blackman, a surgeon, of 18 High Street, Whitechapel—on Wednesday evening, 8th January, abou' 6 o'clock, I was in the back surgery having my tea; the boy, William Fayers was in the front surgery—the prisoner came in, walked round my back, and sat himself down by the side of the fire—he was an entire stranger to me—I spoke to him—I said, "Good day," he made no reply; then, thinking, perhaps, that he was a patient I had forgotten, I said, "How do you do?"—he immediately got up, and said, "That's it," and walked away, passing round the back of my chair into the front surgery—I then went on with my tea, but on looking round a moment or two after I saw him standing at my desk in the front surgery overlooking my books—I called to him, and said it was not customary to allow strangers to look over our accounts—he immediately moved away to the front of the counter, at the back of which the boy was placing a number of bottles in a cupboard—I heard a crash of bottles, and looking into the front surgery I saw that the prisoner had driven four or five dozen bottles off the counter—as I got up, the boy ran to me and said, "He has stabbed me, sir"—I told him to go and fetch a policeman—in passing from the back surgery into the front the prisoner overtook me, and he immediately began stabbing me, although I did not feel the knife in the first instance—he stabbed me in two places on the right breast and then on the left—the third time he stabbed me I saw the blade of the knife; I could not see the handle, as he had that in his hand—it was a pen knife—the blade was about two or three inches long—I received five stabs, one in the arm and one through the hand, which I think I received as I struck my hand up to knock the knife out of his hand—I had a desperate struggle with him in the passage—he ultimately broke away from me, and ran into the back surgery, apparently to get the fire<lb/>irons—instead of taking up the poker he took up the top bar of the grate where the fire was burning, and pulled it off—the moment I found him in the back surgery I closed the door on him, and kept him there at bay as far as I possibly could—it is a glass door, with short blinds—he immediately knocked the blinds all to pieces and broke four or five squares of glass, and attempted to stab me through the broken window, but I kept out of his reach—he tried to open the door, but, I suppose from his hands being burnt, he could not turn the handle; I had not locked it—this state of things continued until the police arrived—I lost a great deal of blood, so much so that I became unconscious, and do not remember anything more that took</p>

               <p>place—the wounds were all punctured wounds—they were serious, and very alarming, although not in their effects; I think the smallness of the knife was my safety, and the thickness of my clothes—it went through several folds of my clothes; through my coat, waistcoat, flannel shirt, and shirt into my chest—I have not yet quite recovered from the effects of the wounds, but I think they are progressing well.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187302030034"/>
               <p>he was not of sound mind at that time—he had considerable reasoning faculty, and talked very quietly and calmly to me, but he was evidently labouring under mental disease, which would render him liable to paroxysms of mania—he was in my opinion then suffering from mania—I ordered his removal to the lunatic ward of the Whitechapel Workhouse—assuming the facts to be true, he was, undoubtedly, then of unsound mind—I believe he had no control over his actions.</p>

On Friday night, 10th January, Mr. Pitt brought me a bottle half-full of liquid—I found a precipitate in it, and a deposit, which I examined and found to be white precipitate, ammonia chloride of mercury, that is poison—if the whole had been taken at one dose it would kill a person, but it causes vomiting, and therefore it is its own antidote—it causes a burning sensation in the mouth.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a banker, at Naples, one of the firm of Thomas D'Agiout, Père et Fils—in March, 1871,. I knew there was a firm of Bowles Brothers &amp; Co., carrying on business as bankers at 449, Strand, and we were desirous of entering into business negotiations with them for the convenience of drafts—we communicated with them, and received finally this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—in consequence of that We transmitted to them 300 obligations of the Lombardo-Venetian Railway Company—we afterwards withdrew 100, so that, in fact, only 200 were left—these are the bonds (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—my father brought the bonds over, and made the arrangements with Bowles Brothers &amp; Co.—we never authorised them to deposit or pledge those bonds with the Union Bank—in November, last year, I heard that the firm of Bowles Brothers had stopped payment, and I came to London from Paris for the purpose of making inquiries about the bonds—on 18th November I saw the defendant at the banking-house, in the Strand, and I asked him for the debentures—the first time I saw him he said he must ask his manager where the bonds were, but I had seen Mr. Keith, the manager, before, and he had said they were pledged at the Union Bank—it was after that I saw the defendant, and he said he must ask Mr. Keith where the bonds were—I saw him afterwards on the same day, and he then said he had asked Mr. Keith, and the bonds were pledged at the Union Bank—he said he did not know anything about the business of his house, and only had to do with the luggage and reading-rooms; the luggage of the Americans—I said I was not satisfied with his answer, and that I would come the next day to have an answer, and if he did not give me a good answer, I would go to the justice—I called the next day, and saw the defendant again—he said the same thing, that he had nothing to do with the business of his firm, and that he did not know where the bonds</p>

               <p>were; that his brother Charles and Mr. Appleton had left him in a bad position; that Mr. Appleton's property would be sold, and then I should be paid—he swore to me that he never had anything to do with the business of his house—I answered him, "Mr. Bowles, I do not believe you, because you are a man of forty-three years, and are the chief head of the house, and it is not possible that you do not know the business of your own house"—he became a little angry, and said "Well, it is a felony that has been committed, but you may be sure you will be paid"—I asked him how and when, and he said "I don't know anything about that"—I said "I don't believe you; I will go before a Magistrate"—I obtained a warrant through my solicitor to arrest him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My father made the arrangement in England, and brought the bonds over with him—he made the arrangement with Mr. Charles Bowles and Mr. Stetson—my father has not come over now, because it was not necessary—I had seen some of the parties in Paris and in Italy before I came over, after the stoppage—I had an account with Mr. Charles Bowles at Nice, and Geneva, and Paris—that was with Charles Bowles alone, in my own name, not in the name of my firm—I knew him personally, and saw him very often—our firm had no transactions with Charles Bowles alone; those transactions were between firm and firm—I knew Charles Bowles about the summer of 1871—there are still unsettled accounts between him and myself—I don't know where he is now—he owes me money—we have not had advances from the London firm, or from the Paris firm, but I drew upon them—those claims are not settled yet—we are not indebted to the Paris house, independently of the bonds; nor to the London house; not at all—when Mr. Robert Bowles said it was a felony that had been committed, he said "I know nothing of your bonds; I had nothing to do with them; but it is a felony that has been committed"—when I came to London I saw Mr. Sullivan first—he is a manager also—I did not ask him about the bonds, because I did not know he was a manager in London—I knew he was manager in Paris—I asked him where I could see Mr. Keith, and I went and saw Mr. Keith—I asked him about the bonds, and he said they were at the Union Bank—I said "But how have you done that?"—he said he was a poor man, and he was obliged to do what his master directed, and I must go to a lawyer; it was not necessary to see Mr. Bowles—I saw Mr. Robert Bowles about ten minutes after that—I asked where my bonds were, and he said "I know nothing about the bonds, but I will ask Mr. Keith"—when I saw him the second time, he said "I have spoken to Mr. Keith, and I find you are right; Mr. Keith says they are at the Union Bank," but I don't recollect whether I had told him what Mr. Keith had said to me—he said "My brother has left me in a bad position; I don't know what is to be done, but I will ask Mr. Keith if something can be done to get your bonds back"—there was a reading-room at the place in the Strand—I found Mr. Keith in the reading-room—I found the defendant on the third floor—I don't know that there was a warrant to take Mr. Keith up; that was after—I have heard that since, and that he cannot be found—there was one for Mr. Sullivan also, but I knew he was gone away, because I saw him in Paris.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I applied for the warrant against the prisoner, Keith and Sullivan were still in London; I heard afterwards they had gene away, and could not be found, and after that I saw Mr. Sullivan in Paris—I had not known the firm previous to the transaction on 18th March, 1871, when my father came over—that was the first transaction we had with the</p>

               <p>firm, it was made by my father, and embodied afterwards in this document—it was in 1871 that I opened an account at Nice between myself and Charles Bowles, after the transaction in March—the negociations that I had with Charles at Nice, Geneva, and Paris were private transactions between him and myself—I don't owe him or the firm at either of these places a shilling—the second time I saw the defendant in November he said he would telegraph to America, and he could get an answer the same night, and I said "I will call to-morrow and have an answer"—he told me the second time the securities were pledged at the Union Bank—he used the word "pledge" to me—he said that ours was a credit of honour, and that he would pay us, he did not care so much about the other creditors, as ours was a credit of honour—I had seen Robert Bowles in Paris at the banking-house previous to my seeing him in London to inquire about these bonds—I saw him every day—I did not transact business with him, but I spoke with him about the business—that was the month that I took away the hundred bonds, February last year—I spoke with him and with Mr. Appleton—I said "As I am in Paris now, we don't want to have 300 bonds with you in London, and I will take 100 with me back to Naples—that was part of the Lombardo-Venetian Bonds—I got the 100 bonds in Paris and took them away—I have never transacted business with Robert Bowles, but I have spoken to him of business.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow—I did reside in Ebury Place, Pimlico—I had known the firm of Bowles Brothers previous to June, 1872—I had done business with Mr. Keith and the prisoner previous to that at the banking-house in the Strand—I had generally seen the defendant in the reading-room—the business I have done with him has been with bills of credit, and I got him to sell a bond for me at one time—in June I had in my possession some bonds of the United States Government for 6,000 dollars, also some Massachusets bonds for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. sterling and ten South Lombardo-Venetian Central Italian Railway obligations; altogether my bonds were worth nearly 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—towards the latter end of June I took them to Mr. Keith and placed them with him for safe keeping—as he was managing clerk I gave them to him—he asked me to bring the bonds there; he said it was unsafe for me to carry them about with me, and he would place them in an iron safe for safe keeping—this is the receipt he gave me, signed by Keith for Bowles Brothers &amp; Co.—I did not give him, nor any one belonging to the firm, any authority to deal with those bonds in any way; merely for safe keeping—when I was in France I had 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in their hands—when I came back I went and asked Mr. Keith to give me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as I was going to Brighton—he offered mo 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he said he was very busy at the time, and I had better take the 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and when I came from Brighton he would settle our account—he gave me 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went to Brighton—I was there about ten days, and I saw the failure of Bowles Brothers &amp; Co. in the paper—I came up immediately, and went to the banking-house, and saw Mr. Keith—he said ho was very</p>

               <p>sorry—I did not say anything about the bonds at first, because I thought they were all secure—I merely went to get the money—I said afterwards "Will you be kind enough to give me my bonds?" and he said I could not have them at that time—I said "I demand my bonds, where are they?"—he said "I don't know"—I said "You don't mean to say that you don't know where thev are?"—he said "No; but I think they are in the Union Bank"—I asked him by whose authority they were put in the Union Bank—he said "I don't know, but they sent me away, and during my absence they were placed in the Union Bank"—he said he knew nothing at all about it, and I believe he was an innocent man—that was all that passed at that time—he said he believed I would get the bonds back again—I met a friend, and he told me to go back the next day and demand the bonds, and I went, and he said he could do nothing about it, in four or five weeks the matter would be settled—I said, "What are you going to do?"—he said, "God is very good, I rest my trust in Him"—I did not see any other person con-nected with the firm about my bonds after that—when I had been to the premises on former occasions I never saw any one but the prisoner—I have never seen Mr. Charles Bowles at all—the only member ox the firm that I had seen was the defendant.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Turquand, Young &amp; Co., of Tokenhouse Yard, accountants—I have been engaged in the investigation of the books and accounts of the firm of Bowles &amp; Co.—I have the books here which show the mode in which the partners drew out money—the firm consisted of Charles Bowles, Robert Bowles, William Bowles, Henry Stetson, and Nathan Appleton—I believe Mr. Keith and Mr. Sullivan were not partners, but managers—Stetson was engaged in Paris, and Appleton was principally at Boston, William Bowles at Paris principally, leaving the two other brothers as managing the London firm—they all visited the different places where they were transacting business—the drawings of the partners appear under the head of "Salary Account" and "Entertainment Account"—the "Entertainment Account" appears to have been drawn upon by the partners in London—the amount of that account from the 1st January, 1872, till the 9th November, when they stopped payment, is 1, 673<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that includes something to Keith—I don't know that I can separate his salary—the "Salaries Account" amounted to 2, 786<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Keith's drawings that year were 1, 322<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that is salary and entertainment—there is also a "Trust Account" and a "Suspense Account"—the debts of the firm by the London books appear to be 80,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the assets that could be estimated amount to about 3, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have here the press letter books of the firm—on the 16th January, 1872, there is a letter signed Robert Bowles, to the Manager of the Union Bank of London, Charing Cross: "Dear Sir,—Please discount to our credit in current account the following bills, amounting to</p>

D'Agiout's, they are not included in the 12, 128<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., because there is a debt balance in the books of 179<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. against D'Agiout—they were deposited at the Bank—Mrs. Gates' bonds are included in the list of bonds upon which they had no lien—I also find in that list the bonds of Robert M. Gardiner, which were deposited at the Union Bank on 27th July, 1871—they are included in the sum of 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the whole value of securities lodged at the Union Bank against which no advances were made amounted to 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the amount of the securities where advances have been made is 14, 476<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the amount of their own securities in the bank was 861<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have here the cheques which have been drawn—in the year 1872 the total cheques drawn by Robert Bowles were 123 on the two accounts at Princes Street and Charing Cross—I have made a detailed list of the amounts of those cheques—I have not got the aggregate amount—there are some very large cheques—they were signed "Bowles &amp; Co.," by Robert Bowles—the rest of the cheques were in the handwritings of Mr. Keith and Mr. Sullivan, with the exception of eight that are signed by Henry Stetson and William Bowles—I have not seen any in the handwriting of Charles—as to the acceptances, I have a list here—Robert Bowles accepted 1, 238 acceptances paid during the year 1872—I have not the amounts before me; the bills are in Court—I should think the whole amount was 50,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; they begin in January and go down to October—there were no acceptances drawn in that year by Charles; the others are by Mr. Keith, and a few by Mr. Sullivan—the largest number are accepted in the handwriting of Keith, 2, 959; 1, 238 by Robert Bowles, and none by Charles—in the year 1872 to the time of stoppage, there are fifty-eight letters signed by the defendant—there are seventeen signed by Charles, and between five and six thousand by Keith—I can't tell you how many Sullivan signed—I don't think he signed many in 1872, because he went over to Paris in the early part of it—there are three letters of January 17th, 20th, 22nd, relating to bonds, but they are signed by Sullivan—the bonds referred to in this letter of 16th September, 1872, signed by Mr.</p>

               <p>where the books are kept—the clerks' office is on the second floor; of course there were some clerks down stairs in what is called the banking-room—that was where the cash transactions were carried on, and where the cash-books were kept, I should think, because the safes were there—the registers and such things were up stairs—the manager's room was on the second floor—there were also rooms on the third floor—they were private rooms; there was one sitting-room—I can't say who that was for—there was a large number of clerks, about twenty, and most of them were on the second floor—a few were of course on the first floor—there were some adjoining premises, where luggage was deposited, but latterly I believe that has not been conducted by Bowles Brothers &amp; Co.—I believe many people did leave their luggage there—I did not know the business till after the stoppage—I have not gone into that part of it—I believe there was a large business of that kind conducted requiring an additional staff irrespective of those I have spoken of—I could not say how many—none of the letters depositing these securities of D'Agiout, Mrs. Gates, and Mr. Gardiner are in the handwriting of the defendant—I have not seen any writing of his in connection with those securities at all—Keith deposited D'Agiout's and Mrs. Gates and Charles Bowles deposited Gardiner's—the letters we have been referred to are about acceptances, discounting acceptances—that would be in the ordinary way of business—those two letters of his which speak of deposits don't refer to either of the three deposits complained off, and in the one which withdrew securities I find that loan was discharged altogether—I have not ascertained that the one where the securities are deposited were properly deposited—I have not found that there were securities deposited which had been placed with them, and permission given to cash the securities—on 14th February, Aaron &amp; Matini were debtors to the firm for 104<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but that is not deducting the bonds—the bonds don't appear to their credit at all—on 14th February their indebtedness was 104<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't know whether the bonds were held by them to liquidate the bill—that account had been closed altogether on 14th February—the account of Van Toile is closed altogether in the ledger, but I am not aware that those securities have been paid off altogether—I have not had any claim made by Aaron &amp; Matini—I believe they have since been returned—I have not had any claim made for any of the securities mentioned in the letter of the 14th—the 9th was the date of the stoppage, and I received the books shortly after that—I last saw Mr. Keith during the time the case was before the Lord Mayor—I believe he attended on two occasions while Mr. Robert Bowles was under remand, and the examination was going on against him—I did not see Sullivan at the Mansion House at all—I saw him at 449, Strand once, within a few days after the stoppage—they have since disappeared—I heard Mr. Keith had gone to Paris first, and from there he went away—I was not aware he was brought to the Mansion House as a witness for Mr. Robert Bowles—he was not brought there on the part of the prosecution, that I am aware of—I put myself into communication with Mr. Robert Bowles when I received the books, and he assisted me as far as he could—Mr. Young was present then—I believe that we received every assistance that Mr. Robert Bowles could give us, and when we came to the financial part of it he referred us to Mr. Charles Bowles, and for many things connected with the accounts, saying that he knew nothing of the financial part of it—I don't know that he referred me to Mr. Keith also—I did communicate with Mr. Keith also on the matter—</p>

               <p>about 6.30 in the morning, I saw Wheeler and Hart standing beside a barrow with a large case upon it—they spoke to each other and separated, Wheeler going across the road into a public-house, and Hart down the street—I got the assistance of three other officers—I saw Wheeler come back from the direction of Moorfields with Cocklin, and point to a barrow—Cooklin then went and wheeled the barrow away towards Finsbury, Wheeler following a distance behind—when they got to Ropemaker Street, Cocklin stopped, and Wheeler then went across to him and spoke to him—with the assistance of Outram, another officer, I took Cooklin into custody; prisoner Wheeler ran away—I took Cooklin to the station, searched him and found upon him a large key, 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a purse—Wheeler was brought to the station a few minutes after—at 3 o'clock on the 12th instant I saw Hart, and I identified him as the man I saw in company of Wheeler—he was charged, and in answer he said "About half-past 4 o'clock on Friday afternoon I got my barrow out of the Green Yard, I went over the water with the barrow for some empty cases, and took them to Snelling's &amp; Co., in Hounsditoh, and sold them. I took my barrow afterwards to the Swan, in Upper Thames Street, and there I lost it; that was about 7 o'clock, 7.30, or it might be 6.30"—this is the ticket I found on the case—I took it off and traced the owner through it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not remember him saying that when he lost his barrow he gave information to the police—he made some statement of that description—I first saw Hart with Wheeler, when Wheeler brought up Cocklin.</p>

On the 10th January I saw a costermonger's barrow and a case of goods upon it outside the Castle public-house in Fore Street, and I saw Wheeler and Hart standing outside—Wheeler went towards Moorgate Street, and shortly afterwards returned with the boy Cocklin, pointed out the barrow and case to Cocklin, and he wheeled it towards Finsbury Square, Wheeler following up—after Cocklin got past Ropemaker Street, Wheeler went up and spoke to him—Harding went up at the time, and I followed him and took Wheeler into custodv—he said "I know nothing about the truck"—I found a knife upon him when I searched him—he said he had no fixed residence.</p>

Debenham—I did not know where they carried on business previously, I heard of it afterwards, I did not know it at the time; I have heard it was in Fenchurch Street—the bankruptcy was in 1871 I think—I knew that he was trading in a different name at Finsbury Circus—I mentioned it in one case—I did not mention it to Debenham's, they were the agents of the landlord of the place in Finsbury Circus—I don't know whether he referred to anybody else; I thought he was a respectable man—I believed him to be an honest man, or I would not have given a reference upon any consideration—I believed that he was a very unfortunate but an honest man—somebody came to me from Messrs. Grant's, I did not give a written reference to them, I told them what I thought of them, that they were respectable people—I don't think I mentioned the bankruptcy to them—I also gave a reference to the Central Bank—I was asked by Wilmius to give these references—I gave the reference for Cramer &amp; Co.—I understood from Wilmius that he was trading under the name of Cramer &amp; Co., not being able, of course, to</p>

Cramer came, perhaps half-a-dozen or a dozen times; he came as a messenger from Wilmius—I am certain he came more than twice—Wilmius generally gave me the orders, but I understood he was in Ireland at the time of the order of 3rd August, and Cramer brought the order; nearly all the orders were given by Wilmius—I can't say positively whether or not Cramer gave the order of the 3rd August—my impression is that he did, but on behalf of Wilmius—I occasionally sell large quantities of goods to ship abroad, that is part of my business—if I deal with respectable persons I expect to ship to the ports they say—if a man bought goods to ship to Sydney and I found he sent them to America, I should fancy directly that there was something wrong—if people change the destination of the goods after they receive them I should think it suspicious—I have never known such an instance—I know many houses in London that trade with every part of the world, but we always know from the marks where goods are going—we generally ship them ourselves or send them to the packers, and they give us a mark.</p>

My business has been carried on now nearly forty years; twenty odd years by my father before me—we do 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year in shipping to Australia, South America, and New Zealand—there is nothing unusual in the practice to get advances on goods in the way that has been done in this case—I have over fifty firms in the City, of the highest respectability, for whom I ship in the same way—I never heard of any business transaction where they did not render account sales—they have not been rendered in this case, because I have only got a small return of goods—I have not got 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the whole of the consignments—when goods go out the consignee exercises his discretion as to whether the market is in a proper condition for the purposes of sale—he would hold them till the proper season—whatever the return sales will be over and above what I have advanced the trustees will get, whatever it is; whatever balance there is will be given to the trustees.</p>

I am a printer, of St. Martin's Lane—I have been in that establishment a great number of years—I became ac-quainted with the prisoner in the latter part of 1870—I do not know his family—in March, 1871, he made a communication to me about the state of his finances, and he brought an agreement from a house in New York, Tiffany's—he suggested that he had no friend, and asked me to take this matter up for him, finding the money, and giving him a salary of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week, and he would take the trouble off my hands, as I did not understand the nature of glass, and it was ultimately arranged that I was to advance him a sum to carry out the management—I said, "What sum?" he said, "1, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1, 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I agreed to do that—that was Tiffany's contract; there was no written agreement—he was to go into the business as my manager at a salary of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week, which was regularly paid to him—he had no authority whatever to endorse cheques for me; he was to attend to the glass business entirely, and had nothing to do with the financial part—it was his duty to account immediately he received money—supposing he received a cheque for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., he would have paid it to the cashier; he had no right whatever to use it himself—he had no right to make this endorse-ment—this "Jas.

S. Dobson &amp; Co."—Mr. Heritage was not my attorney then; he first became my attorney about June or July, 1872—I did not come to a fresh arrangement with the pri<lb/>soner after I learned of what I call the defalcations; it was precisely the same as before; we only had one arrangement—I got this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) signed by Dobson in July—I had not seen Mr. Heritage before I got it signed—I told you I saw Mr. Heritage in June; this is dated 5th July; I don't think I saw Mr. Heritage before that—I saw him every day—I met him occasionally at a chop-house, but I had not spoken to him about preparing a deed till after that—to the best of my recollection, it was afterwards—I cannot say whether I instructed him before or after I got this document—after I found that Dobson had taken money which had not found its way into the business, I did not tell him that I must now have security for the money I had advanced—I did not know the particulars of the defalcations before the prisoner wrote them down—the bookkeeper told me that there were defalcations, and then I spoke to the prisoner, and he made a confession—before this was signed I had made a rough draft of it all—this is my composition—he was not so much distressed as I was when I spoke to him about the defalcations—he felt his position—I did not then sit down to compose the rough draft; there was not a night between the rough draft and its signing by the prisoner<lb/>there was an interval of twelve hours; but when he made his confession I went home very ill, and in the morning I said "You had better make a clean breast of it what you have taken, and write me a note"—he said "I can't do it, governor; will you do it I" and I wrote what I thought was a proper letter for one man to write to another, and gave it to my clerk to make a fair copy—I went out, and when I came in he signed it, and said "Governor, you have given it to me warm"—I possibly did not mention before the Magistrate about his asking me to do it; but that is the fact—I did not prepare the rough draft without the slightest communication with him, he asked me to do it himself, it was his wish—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a fair copy by the clerk of the document prepared, and he signed it—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "July 5, 1872—I, W.

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Paul &amp; Trevor, of New Inn—in consequence of a communication from Colonel Ives I went to Praed Street, Paddington, to the publishing office of the "Paddington Times" and bought two copies of that paper, one of 21st December and the other of 16th December.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first saw the paper of 21st December, I think, a day</p>

               <p>or two prior to my purchasing it on the 23rd—I went to the Police Court on the Tuesday or Wednesday—I did not see the prisoner between the Monday and the time of my going to the Police Court—it is not the fact that in opening the case almost the first sentence of my counsel, Mr. Straight, was that no apology would be accepted—those were not my instruc-tions to him—it was at the close of the case that I instructed him to that effect—I think I can say positively that Mr. Straight did not say that it was a case in which no apology would be accepted—Colonel Ives heard him open the case—I never saw the prisoner before I saw him in the Police Court, nor had I communicated with him—it was not in consequence of Mr. Lewis's manner of cross-examining that I instructed Mr. Straight that no apology would be accepted, but after the close of the case I followed the instructions of my client—nothing was said about two years ago except that it was stated that some attack had been made upon Colonel Wood—I can scarcely form an opinion whether the words in the letter "as you very properly state ought never to have been said "refer to the article in the paper of 16th December; I have some doubt, because the paper of the 16th contains the speech, and the letter of the 21st is complimentary to the editor for not publishing the speech—I know that the letter refers to the article of 14th December—it was read by me on the application for the summons.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 41, Hereford Street, May Fair, and have been colonel of the 36th Middlesex Rifles between three and four years—their head-quarters are at Paddington—before that I was an officer in the Coldstream Guards, and served in the Crimea in 1864 and 1865—I have the medals of those campaigns—I am a member of several clubs, including the Guards and the Army and Navy—I never knew the prisoner till I had an interview with him to remonstrate with him about another letter in 1869—I then saw him as the editor of the newspaper, and the letter of which I complained was in relation to an order which I had issued—I think Mr. Paul, has a copy of that letter, and also of another one—I complained to the prisoner of that letter, and he assured me of his regret that it had been published, and that it should never happen again, and upon that I became a subscriber to the paper—he also gave me the name of Mr. Hope as the person who had written it—on the occasion of distributing the colours the place was crammed, and a great many ladies and gentlemen were present; there were several wives and daughters of gentlemen in the regiment—I made a speech in which there was not a single word or thought of indecency, or a word that I would not speak now before ladies or before anybody—not a single complaint was made of it by ladies or gentlemen—the letter was mentioned to me before I saw it, and then I read it, and considered the matter with Colonel Burnaby, and determined to take proceedings—an inquiry took place at the Police Court, and I was examined and cross-examined at great length—among other things I was asked whether I was drunk—at the end of the cross-examination on the second meeting Mr. Louis Lewis made a statement in the prisoner's presence, who I saw speaking to his attorney, and at the end of the case the attorney said "Will an apology be accepted?" and after questions had been put, such as "Were you drunk?" &amp;c., I said that I could not accept</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187302030063"/>
               <p>an apology—no apology was ever offered me before the intuiting cross<lb/>examination, as far as I know—I have no recollection of Mr. L. Lewis Baying anything after that—I think he shrugged his shoulders—at the end of the second examination Mr. L. Lewis said that he should bring forward the reporters of a daily leading journal and some members of the regiment to justify on the next occasion—no witnesses were called on the next occasion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was very angry with my cross-examination—I did not lose my temper with Mr. Lewis in the least, but I thought he did not understand me, and I contradicted him—I was asked if I referred to shop boys who ought to be drilled as animals, and if I used the words "little animals"—I admitted that I did, but I did not say that I meant him as well—I said just the contrary, but he had asked if I was drunk—he asked me if I had dined, and I believe he asked me directly whether I was drunk—one of my first answers was "I have not a perfectly dear recollection of what I said, "but I also said that I had a sufficiently clear one—I am certain that Mr. L. Lewis put the question to me "Were you not drunk?"—it was more than asking me if I had dined—his general tone injured me—my recollection was better on the second occasion than the first—I did not take the pains to write my speech—I am not a great speaker—this was at 10 o'clock in the evening—a great many volunteers were there for the distribution of the prizes; they had been there since 8 o'clock—Colonel Wood had spoken and given away the prizes before I spoke—there were cheers, but no violent cheering—I have said that the reporters must have heard indistinctly—I was speaking I should say about a quarter of an hour—what I saw in the prisoner's' paper was very offensive—the leading article was most offensive and untrue—the report of my speech on 14th December was neither agreeable nor disagreeable to me—I spoke more of the army than the volunteers—I spoke of a volunteer life improving their figures and their limbs—the little animals were simply indicated in a French phrase, which refers to little rich idle men who are to be found in the streets of Paris, who are of no service, but spend their time in complete idleness—I did not expect the audience to know about <hi rend="italic">petit creve</hi>—there are forty witnesses here who will say what I did say—when I was painting the picture I did not recommend the former to the consideration of the ladies—I never addressed the ladies till the last three or four words of my speech—I did not recommend to the ladies the manly and vigorous form of the volunteers—I possibly might have recommended the ladies to have a great regard to the military element, but I don't think I did—I presume there is no report of my speech longer than the one the prisoner published—the "Volunteer Service Gazette" gives a report—the "little animal" did cause some laughter—I spoke against the effeminacy of the age, and said that I knew some women who were one hundred times more manly than those little animals, and so I do—I do not know that there is anything wrong in that—I did not refer to Her Gracious Majesty—it is very difficult to know what causes laughter on such an occasion—when you speak to friends they are very apt to receive what you say with kindness—my expressions could only be misunderstood by a foul-minded man—I have never known instances where words used by me have been misunderstood by my hearers; never in the society of honourable men—I did not, speaking of the volunteers, say "Look at their everything," or "Look at their feet and legs;" I may have said "Look at their general appearance after drill"—on my first examination I did admit that I had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187302030064"/>
               <p>suggested the propriety of young ladies marrying volunteers, and after-wards I corrected that, and said that I wished ladies to marry men of manly character, but I never alluded to any visible part of man—my impression is that the paper was handed to me the very day I went to see Mr. Paul—I wrote no letter to the prisoner—I subscribed to his paper as a token of my forgiveness—the adjutant will tell you when I ceased to subscribe, because I sent to the office—Colonel Wood is very much my senior in years—I spoke with less energy than he did, I should say—he is a very energetic man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I consulted a good many members of the regiment, and there was no other course—I had appeared as a drunkard in the "Times, "and I thought I should put a stop to that.</p>

I am adjutant of this regiment—I was formerly in Her Majesty's 108th Regiment, in which I served nearly twenty-one years—I heard the colonel's speech, and paid great attention to it—I have a general memory of it—there was nothing in it but what I should say myself—my wife was present; she is here, and quite willing to give evidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not know that it was a very jolly meeting, but it was a very kindly one, and we were all in good spirits—I did not take notes—I did not know there would be any libel—I heard the laughter; I have often heard more—the first point which caused laughter was Colonel Ives saying "If you notice a man drilled he looks a man and he looks a soldier, and it is to the credit of the country that he should look so"—he said "Look at the man, look at his head, look at his shoulders, look at him all over, he is everything a man would wish to be"—he did not tell the ladies to look at him too or recommend them to marry him—I do not recollect his saying "little animals," but he said "lumps of men"—he said he should recom-mend the young ladies to marry men of manly character, and I believe the ladies do love men of manly character, for I have got a very good one; I am sure you will be very glad to see her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I went out as a private soldier and rose from the ranks—I have been thirty-six years in the service—there is no word in the British language which could express Colonel Ives' speech as an indecent one, and I consider this is the most blackguard attack I ever met with.</p>

                  </hi>. I am printer of the "Paddington Times"—the printing-office is at 15, Praed Street—I was there on Friday night, 20th December—I first saw the manuscript of this letter signed "Decency" about 8 o'clock on that evening—it came by a boy who generally brought, the copy from the publishing office—Mr. Ambler was not there at the time—the copy was set—it was not set by me, but I saw it set—I saw the-compositor actually put up the type—the boy's name is James Hazzard—he is not here—I do not think the prisoner was there at all before the publication of the paper—it was printed between 9 and 10 o'clock that night. (<hi rend="italic">The letter was as follows:</hi> "To the Editor of the ‘Paddington Times. '—Sir,—I was glad to perceive that there was one paper that would not lower itself by inserting the after-prize-giving speech of Colonel Ives. It was in every way of a doubtful character; it was in unquestionably bad taste, and such as you very properly state ought never to have been said. Having once begun to slide downwards, he appeared to enjoy his improper remarks, and I can assure you that the opinion of the men was anything but gratifying. How a man like Colonel Ives should lower himself to pander to a prurient taste is extraordinary. He must be aware such a speech could not in any way exalt him with all right-minded people, and those volunteers who had their sisters or female relatives there could and did have but one opinion of what Colonel Ives said. It was a gross insult to them, and if the Colonel was flattered by the laughter of the men, he may rest assured that there would be but one idea of what was said during that evening by the Colonel of the Paddington Rifles, and that was of the most thorough disgust and contempt.—Your obedient servant, <hi rend="smallCaps">DECENCY.

I entered upon the duties of the secre-tariat about the last day of October or 1st of November last—I have no knowledge of the female prisoners except during that time—one was acting as housekeeper, and the other as the niece living with her—I can't tell you how many rooms there are in the house—we occupy two rooms, both moderately furnished—our Mission is an advertised Mission—there is no committee—there is a treasurer, Mr. Bevan, the banker—I don't know that he comes there—he subscribes largely, and the account is kept at his bank—there are five referees, of whom Mr. Robert Baxter, of the firm of Baxter, Rose &amp; Norton, is one, and Rev. Daniel Wilson, vicar of Islington, another—they may come there occasionally—the object is to disseminate Evan-gelical principles in Spain—we issue circulars and appeals, and receive funds—Spain is the scene of operations—6, Duke Street is our address for the society—the letter-box to the outer door has no lock to it, nor has ours—I was never there before 10 o'clock in the morning—I remained sometimes two or throe hours—on 23rd December I arrived there about 12 o'clock, Mr. Thorpe was not there then—by pre-arrangement I have on many occasions found the post-letters on the table in my room when Mr. Thorpe has been there—he never opens the letter—there are several other offices in the house—I presume the housekeeper would take the letters from the street door letter-box, and deliver them at the different offices.</p>

I am clerk to the Spanish Mission, at 6, Duke Street—I have charge of a drawer there, of which I have the key—on 21st December I received instructions from Mr. Ormiston, in consequence of which, on 23rd, I went to the office and found in my drawer a letter addressed to him as secretary, and marked "important," and underlined—at 10. 30 or 10. 45 that night I dropped that letter into the street door letter-box of 6, Duke Street—it was fastened in the usual way with an adhesive stamp—I went again to the office on the morning of the 24th—the letter was not there—I have not seen it since.</p>

Mills, 36, Acton Street, Gray's Inn Road"—the officer then came in, and took possession of the cheque and the prisoner.</p>

               <p>my observation until 24th December—during that time I don't think I have seen Mills go there scarcely at all—I might have seen him once or twice only—I do not remember seeing him go there on the morning of the 24th—on that day, in consequence of instructions, I went to the Islington Branch of the London and County Bank—I saw Mills there, and asked him to account for the cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that he had submitted to the cashier—he asked me who I was—I said, "I am a detective officer from Bow Street"—after waiting a short time, he said, "I received it in the ordinary way of business"—I said, "What business?"—he then said, "I don't know where I got it from"—I said, "If you cannot account to me in a satisfactory manner how you became possessed of this cheque I shall take you to Bow Street Station"—he said nothing more—I took him to Mr. Ormiston to be sure about the cheque, and then went to the station—on the morning of the 27th I went with Hinds to 6, Duke Street, Adelphi, about 9.30—I directed my attention principally to the younger prisoner, Louisa Martindale—she came out of the kitchen and met me as I descended the stairs—I said, "Are you the niece of Mrs. Martindale?" or words to that effect—she said, "No, I am the grand-daughter"—she went into the kitchen—I fol-lowed her, and said, "Do you know anything about any letters missing from this house?"—she said, "No"—I informed her that Mr. Ormiston and Mr. Tugwell had made repeated complaints of letters being missed—she said, "I know nothing at all about them"—at that time she sidled away from me to the window-seat, which was about two yards; she then came towards me—I saw some papers in her hand, and I said, "What have you got there I"—she said, "It is only private"—I took them from her hand—they were the four letters that have been produced (1, 2, 3, <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 4)—this one, bearing the Charing Cross post-mark of December 25th was opened; the Preston one of December 24th had not, apparently, been touched—I told her the other two had, I believed, been tampered with—she said she knew nothing at all about them—I have seen twenty or thirty letters addressed to Mr. Ormiston and Mr. Tugwell that have been opened; that called my attention to these two—they have the appearance of having been opened and then re-closed—I then went to the same place where I thought I saw her take these four letters from, and there I found these two others (5 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 6)—No. 5 was partly sticking, and quite wet—the adhesive portion of the other was torn as it is now—the post-marks of those are Weston-super-Mare, December 24th, and Windsor, I think—I also found two others belonging to other persons in the house—I drew her attention to the one that was damp—she said nothing—to every thing that was said to her she said she knew nothing at all—these two (5 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 6) I fouud in the place where I saw her put her hand—there was a heap of books about a foot in height near the window sill—the other two were for Mr. Condy and Mr. Antonio, two gentlemen in the house—I found those between the books and a tea-caddy—they were both opened, just as they are now, one at the adhesive part and the other at the side—I waited until the arrival of Mr. Tugwell and Mr. Ormiston, and then took the two prisoners into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. Mr. Ormiston did not arrive at Duke Street till nearly 12 o'clock on the 27th—I remained there all that time, and Hinds also; he never left his chair—I left my chair repeatedly to search for things, but never left the house—I was examined at the Police Court—Mr. Vaughan put questions to me—I can't say whether I mentioned about the letter being damp until Mr. Vaughan questioned me—I should say I must have done so—I believe what I said to Louisa was, "You are, I believe, the niece of the housekeeper?" and she replied, "No; I am the grand-daughter"—I feel positive she said "grand-daughter"—before the magistrate I said "Are you the daughter," and she said "No; I am the niece"—I am under the impression now that she said "grand-daughter "I know she said she was some relation—it is a thing I should not bother much about in a heavy case like this—it must be a mistake—I have made mistakes before to-day in names and dates—I have been suspended by the Commissioners, about two months ago, in reference to illegally going into a house after stolen property—Sir Thomas Henry marked the sheet for invest<lb/>tigation, and I was suspended for fourteen days—T have been in the habit of working with Hinds nearly five years, and have given evidence in most of the cases where he has given evidence—he has been with me in lots of cases, and so have other officers; one is dead and another has resigned—Hinds was also suspended in the same case—the sheet was marked by Sir Thomas Henry, and the prisoner discharged—it was a woman—that is the only time when any stipendiary magistrate has expressed his dissatisfaction with my evidence—I swear that—when I first saw Louisa Martindale I said I had come to make inquiries about some missing letters; she said she did not know anything at all about it—I won't swear she did not say, "I don't know what you mean"—I can't say that I said "Never mind what I mean"—I did not hear her say, "Thinly letters that are here are on the window ledge"—I will not swear she did not—I did not push her away as she went towards the window ledge and take the letters myself from the window ledge—I swear that—she said she had been in the habit of taking the letters from the box and taking them up stairs to distribute—she said a good deal about that—both of them were talking for about two hours about these letters—she did not say the letters had come open by my handling them so roughly—I don't know whether Hinds saw the damp letter—she said she had never heard of any letters being miscarried—neither Mr. Condy nor Mr. Antonio are here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> My suspension arose in this way; I followed a quantity of stolen goods into the house of a notorious man, who had been tried here on two occasions for receiving stolen property, and aoquitted; the woman kicked up a row, and struck Hinds, and bit him through the thumb, and assaulted me and others, and she was taken into custody for the assault; the Commissioner said we ought to have summoned her, and not charged her before the Magistrate; and that was the reason Hinds got censured—I was absent when he took the woman into custody—she was a notorious character, and when, before Sir Thomas Henry, she tried to swear my life away, he did not believe her, because he ordered an investigation.</p>

               <p>was going on between Boyell and Louisa, I heard Susan call out "Who's there?" from a bedroom opposite where we were—Louis asaid "Two police officers"—I then went across the passage towards the door—Susan said "You can't come in here"—I told her I was a married man, she need not be ashamed of me—she tried to push the door in my face, I shoved it open and entered the room—before that she said something about letters; I don't exactly remember what, and she said "There are two here"—when I got into the room she handed me these two letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from a little dress ng-table under the window; one is addressed to Mr. Burnet, the other to Mr. Ormiston—from 20th November to 27th December I had that house under observation—I have seen Mills go there, I should think on quite ten or twelve occasions, between 8 and 10 o'clook in the morning; more fre<lb/>quently about 9 o'clock—sometimes he has stayed ten minutes, and some<lb/>times it has reached quite half-an-hour—I saw him go there on the morning of the 24th about 20 minutes to 9 o'clock—on the occasions when I have seen him go there I have seen him with the two women; I have seen him at the door talking to them, and part with them in a very friendly way—I have seen him go out with Louisa, and I think I have seen him about three times with Susan—the bedroom appeared to be used by both the females.</p>

We were there about three hours on the 27th—I think it was about 11 o'clock when Mr. Ormiston came—they were then given into custody—Boyell asked Louisa something respecting the letters that he took from her hand, and she said they were hers, her private property—she may have said she did not know what he meant about missing letters—he might have said "Never mind what I mean"—she said the only letters there were on the window-sill—I don't remember her saying that some had come on Christmas Day and some on Boxing Night, and that it was her duty to deliver them to the persons in the house; I won't swear she did not say so, but I don't think she did—Susan said that the two letters she had on the table had come that morning—the blue one was torn in the back as it is now—she did not hand it to me through the door, but when I had got into the room—she did not say "It must have been torn in your taking it"—I called her attention then to its being torn, and she said it must have been torn by a little nephew who had taken it out of the letter-box—he was not there—I never saw Mills go into the next house—he generally came from the direction of Charing Cross railway station—I have seen Louisa leave the house two or three times of a morning, as if going on an errand, and I have seen the</p>

I am a letter carrier—on Christmas morning I delivered three letters at 6, Duke Street, at the first delivery—at the second delivery I delivered the Irish and American letters—these are the three letters, to the best of my recollection; that I put into the box, and this one I put into the hands of Louisa Martindale between 10 and 11 o'clock on Christmas morning as she was standing at the door.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 27, Red Lion Square, and am a professional expert in handwriting—I have been engaged for many years in the com<lb/>parison of handwriting—I have had various papers and cheques shown to me in this case—as regards the post-office order signed "Burnet," looking at the cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., admitted to be in the handwriting of Mills, I believe they are the same handwriting—I don't form that opinion from those documents alone, and if I was only shown those I might be in doubt—upon examining all the documents I say that the post-office order signed "Burnet" is in the handwriting of Mills—here is a cheque for 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. signed L. S. Tugwell—I believe that is in the same handwriting as the signature to the cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., A. Burnet—I have compared this portion of a letter also with the en<lb/>dorsement of the five guinea cheque—in my opinion that is also in the same handwriting—there were two other letters; one signed "Ormiston," and a memorandum, I think, and some other letter with the name of Tugwell in it—it must have been a letter from Mr. Tugwell, but without those letters I am prepared to give my opinion just the same.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. I say those three letters assisted me in my comparison—the cheque with the prisoner's writing and the post-office order signed "R. Burnet" were the two documents that were first put into my hand—I formed my opinion upon them without the other docu<lb/>ments, but I said without I had further evidence I would not appear against the prisoner, from the small material I had before me; I said, privately I believed it was his handwriting, but I did not feel justified in giving evidence in a case involving a person's liberty upon such slender evidence—in my own mind I formed the opinion that they were the same hand<lb/>writing, and I expressed it—I had three letters, one signed "J. Ormiston," but I made no use of them on the first occasion—I found no available evi<lb/>dence in them until I had seen the torn letter—I had five documents before me, two cheques and three letters, but I only expressed my opinion about the two cheques—I thought there was another post-office order—I was under the impression that I had seen two—there were a number of docu<lb/>ments, and some were taken away and I have not seen them since, and I fancied there was another post-office order—I was deceived—I may have been confusing some other case—I saw the fragment of a letter after I had seen the two cheques, and that strengthened my opinion—I was not in doubt before in my own mind, but I said I would not give evidence until I had something to base my evidence upon—I said before the Magistrate, "A</p>

               <p>portion of a letter was placed in my hands, and comparing it with the other documents quite cleared all doubt in my mind," and I say so now—the signatures "R. Mills" and "L. S. Tugwell" are not the same style of writing, because "L. S. Tugwell" is assumed—the letter of 2nd November, "J. Ormiston," is a mixture between the two styles—I have examined the letters with very great care indeed—I have given evidence positively before, and verdicts have been found directly opposite to my opinion—I published a book about Junius.</p>

I am a beer retailer, and reside at the Swiss Cottage, Manor Place, Walworth—on the 11th of January last, about 11 o'clock at night, I was in Friar Street—two men got hold of me, one on each side, and a man who came round a corner tripped me up—I was thrown down—I said "Don't murder me"—one of them kicked me in the head whilst I was trying to shove him off—there is a hole now in it—you can put a nut in it—this collar (<hi rend="italic">produced, smeared with bleed</hi>) I had on at the time—they ran away—I felt them both have their hands in my pockets—I could not swear which of them took the money—when I came away from home I put 33<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket, and I had a silk handkerchief—before the men seized me I had two or three threepenny pieces in the right-hand trousers pocket, and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the left-hand pocket—while I was down, a little boy ran and called his father, who came to my assistance—the men then ran away—where they went to I do not know—I do not remember seeing prisoner before he was at the station—I said I would not press the charge at the station, as I did not want the trouble of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Coroner for the City of London—I held an inquest on the body of Robert Atkins at Guy's Hospital—the prisoner attended there and gave evidence—I took down in writing the statement that he made—he gave it on oath voluntarily; he was put forward as a witness by the solicitor who represented him—(<hi rend="italic">Read.</hi> "<hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN BUTLER</hi>, cap<lb/>tain of the 'Confidence' billy-boy, of Boston,—Atkins was mate of that vessel; his name was Robert Atkins, his age from 40 to 50 years; being cautioned, says: 'I am willing to tell the Jury all I know about this. I left the vessel at Blackwall on Friday morning, December 6th; the water pilot was to bring the vessel up at the next flood tide, and she would get to London Bridge next morning about 5 o'clock. My wife was on board, Atkins, and Gilbert, and the pilot. I went on board the same evening, and the pilot left, &amp;c. At low water, about 1 or 2 in the morning, I saw Atkins again, when the vessel swung, his head was not hurt. We had then to haul in the ropes again; Atkins had not then got on deck; Gilbert was down below. I knocked Atkins up; he had not come up when I ran for<lb/>ward. As I ran forward I accidentally catched my foot against something and knocked it down the forecastle. The hatch was off; I kicked a piece of iron; it was not the poker. Atkins then sung out to me; he said 'You have hove a winch handle at me.' I had not done it. He came up out of the forecastle; he went down again. He said his head was bleeding. I went down and looked at it; it was bleeding. Gilbert was then in bed; I think he was asleep; he never spoke. I told my wife that his head was cut, and she went to him. I did not heave anything at Atkins at all; when I stumbled over the iron I did not see Atkins, he was in the forecastle. I did not throw anything down the forecastle to wake Atkins; he remained in the forecastle, and left next morning. I did all the work myself; then I went into the forecastle. I found a piece of iron that had been a marling<lb/>spike that had been on deck, and that, I think was what I kicked. <hi rend="italic">By the Jury.</hi>—There is a combing about 5 inches deep. The piece of iron weighed, perhaps, 2 lbs."</p>

                  </hi>. I was house-surgeon at Guy's Hospital on 13th December, when the deceased was brought there—he had a suppurating wound on the left parietal bone, an inch and a half in length and half an inch in width—the bone itself was contused and inflamed—the skull was not fractured—the scalp was raised towards the middle line of the skull—in the evening he became delirious, and, on the following Tuesday, he was trephined—if he could be said to have a chance at all, that was the only chance—he afterwards died—the cause of death was inflammation of the membranes of the brain, the result of a blow with a blunt instrument—I think it must have been a blow either with an instrument held in the hand,</p>

               <p>workhouse—on 1st January, about 6 o'clock in the evening, the deceased, John Mahoney, was brought in—he was suffering from paralysis of the left side—there was a scar on the top of his head, in the middle line, of a recently-healed wound—it had been done from a month or three weeks to six weeks—he died about 11. 55 on the night of the 7th—I made a <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> examination—I treated him for paralysis—he made a statement to me—he said he was suffering from an injury received—at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> I found there was on the scalp a wound just by the centre of the middle line, and at a corresponding point inside the skull, the membranes of the brain were attached to bone, just at that spot; beneath that was a patch of organised lymph, and beneath that again, in the right hemisphere of the brain, was a large abscess, containing about four ounces of matter—the other organs were, generally speaking, healthy—the cause of death was the abscess inside the brain—I think that a blow on the head with a poker would be likely to have caused the appearances I found in the head—the abscess would take some time to form and develope itself—I should have expected to find the abscess in that state if the wound had been given on 30th November—it agrees with the testimony that I have heard to-day—I think such a blow, given on 30th November, would be likely to have caused it—I don't think it could have been caused by a blow from a fist.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Any blunt instrument would have caused the wound—from its position I think it was almost impossible it could have been caused by a fall against a wall or a fender, unless he fell head foremost; that would do it—I presume if it had been inflicted ten days or a fortnight, afterwards the appearance of the wound would be the same, but I think from three to six weeks would be the period in which it had been inflicted—that is a mere speculative opinion—I saw some white lines on the head, which were very old ones indeed—there were three I think.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). I saw part of the fight with Hall, not all of it—I am not aware that Hall had anything in his hand at the time; I did not take sufficient notice—they both fell during the fight—it was in the kitchen—I don't know whether he struck his head against the fender or anything—I only saw him fall once—I was busy lighting the people to bed.</p>

A man they called Church hit me over the head with a stick; that was just as the houses were shutting up. I gets up, and had two cuts on my head, and was carried indoors. I got up and went out to look for a policeman, and as I was passing Mrs. Doyle's door <hi rend="italic">Figgy</hi> Mahoney and two men lays hold of me; in the struggle I threw him on the kerb. I gets up and goes indoors to go to bed; the same three men came in where I was living, and knocked me down with a stick in the kitchen, and the landlady went and fetched a policeman, and he turned them out. On Sunday, again, the same three seized me and were knocking me about, and a policeman told them if they did not go off he would lock them up."</p>
