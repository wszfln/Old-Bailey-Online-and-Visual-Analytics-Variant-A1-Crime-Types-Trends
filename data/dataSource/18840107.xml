I saw a lot of men at the public-house, and some one said 'Look out, Jim, here is another one of these puppies coming.' Another constable was on the other side. I was on the south side of the Uxbridge Road. I arrived before the complainant fell down. I crossed over. I found the com<lb/>plainant and the constable there. The constable said the man had been making a great disturbance, and using abusive language towards him. I then asked the complainant to go away. On doing so he fell back on</p>

               <p>his hands. I suggested to take him to the station. He crossed over to the other men, and went into the public-house. The constable did not in any way strike this man. The complainant was walking backwards. When I went up he was using abusive language. I did not lock him up, because the other constable did not seem disposed to. "<hi rend="italic">By the Magistrate.</hi> "I came from the Askew Arms down Uxbridge Road, and on the other side.") That was all the evidence given on that occasion—the hearing was adjourned to the 9th October—the prisoner was again called and sworn—to the best of my recollection the evidence he had given on the 2nd was read to him again, and he added something, which Mr. Paget took down—Sharp was convicted in both cases, and had one month on each.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Sandell Thompson, who is in the employ of the Public Record Office—I live with him at 7, Askew Terrace, Shepherd's Bush—on Tuesday night, 23rd October, I was in the Uxbridge Road, near St. Luke's Church—I saw on the opposite side of the road a police-constable, who I have since ascertained to be Sharp—he spoke to me, and followed me, and committed an assault on me, in con<lb/>sequence of which I went on to the Victoria public-house—this was about 20 minutes to 12—I was waiting for my husband—Sharp followed me to the Victoria—I spoke to an omnibus conductor of the name of English, who I knew by sight by travelling in his' <hi rend="italic">bus.</hi>—at that time Sharp was standing at the corner—English was perfectly sober—he went across to Sharp—there was no other person there at the time; other people came up afterwards—English said to Sharp "I know this lady; she is a respectable married woman; what did you want to have anything to to say to her for?"—Sharp told him that he was drunk, and that he would take him to the station if he did not go away—he then knocked him down—I saw him do it—he struck out at him, and he fell—at that time the prisoner was not present—English got up and crossed over to where I was standing—Sharp went into the middle of the road and whistled—I then saw the prisoner cross the Victoria Road—Sharp told English that he would make him lose his badge—English said he could not do it by fair means, and he said "Well, if we cannot do it by fair means we will by foul"—they then walked away together—it is not true that English fell down in the presence of Whisker—I was present all the time—I left English standing near the public-house, and I went home—I afterwards went to the station and made a complaint—that was about 20 minutes past 1—my husband went with me—he was at home when I got home—the station was about 20 minutes' walk from our house—I was present at the Hammersmith Police-court on the hearing of the summons that was taken out by me against Sharp for the assault, and also at the hearing of the summons taken out by English—I heard the prisoner examined for the defence of Sharp—it is not true that Sharp did not hit English, or that English was drunk and using abusive language—I took Sharp's number at the corner of Askew Crescent.</p>

I live at 5, Victoria Road, Uxbridge Road—my mother is a laundress—on Tuesday night, 23rd October, I had been out to collect some money for my mother, and between 11.30 and 12 o'clock I was coming along the Uxbridge Road from the direction of Westbourne Park; when I got near the corner of Victoria Road, facing the Princess Victoria, I saw Mrs. Thompson talking to some' bus-men—I saw one of them, English, leave the group and go towards the constable Sharp—English was very excited; he was shouting at the top of his voice, and by his actions I should judge he was under the influence of drink—he said to Sharp "Come on, I have been longing to have a go at some of you b——<hi rend="italic">coppers.</hi>—Sharp at that time was in the act of turning to go across to Victoria Road; he turned round to face him, and English walked back<lb/>wards,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188401070009"/>
               <p>Sharp facing him, and as he was walking backwards it appeared as if he stumbled up against something and fell down—I was about ten yards off—I did not see any actual push; I saw him fall—as he was ad<lb/>vancing towards Sharp the second constable came up behind from the direction of Askew Crescent; that was before he fell—I am quite sure about that—he was about two yards behind him—I went to the police-court on the day the prisoner was committed for trial—I had seen the solicitor, Mr. Haynes, before that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I live with my mother—I went to the police-court three times—Sharp was convicted before I went; it was on a Wednesday that I went when the prisoner was charged with perjury—I offered to go down for Whisker—I told one of the constables on the Sunday night when I was out; he told me that the second man was charged with per<lb/>jury, and I said "Then I will go down for him as a witness, for I was there"—it was a constable named Allen, who I knew, that told me—I have known him about a year; not walking with him or chatting with him—I knew him to speak to about three times—it was some night after Sharp had been convicted that I spoke to him in the street—I asked him "Is it true that the constable Sharp is convicted?"—I only knew Sharp's name by seeing it in the newspaper—I had seen him—I did not know him—I don't remember having spoken to him before this occurrence—I did not know him as a friend of Allen's; I had never seen him with Allen—I had seen him—I spoke to him that night as I stood at the corner—I did not know him before, or the prisoner—I did not know him by sight—I spoke to Allen first—I asked him if it was true that he was convicted—I had seen it in the paper—he said it was quite true—I had not read it in the paper; I heard some one speaking of it who had read it—when Allen spoke to me, I went to the police-court—I was not called as a witness—I went there, but was not called—I saw Mr. Haynes before I went—I made a statement to him—I saw him that morning before I went to the police-court—I was going home on this night when I saw Mrs. Thompson talking to some' bus-men—I did not see her crying; I don't know whether she was crying—I did not go over to see—I was about ten yards from them—I saw English advancing across the road towards Sharp—he fell back in the roadway—I was about ten yards from him—I did not see any blow struck—Sharp was near to him when he fell; he was within striking distance—it appeared to mo as if he stumbled and fell. (<hi rend="italic">A statement of the prisoner's before the Magistrate was here read:.</hi> "I am innocent of what I am charged with. I reserve my defence on the advice of my solicitor.

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Morton Terrace, Greenside Road, Shepherd's Bush—I was in service as cook with Mrs. Stevens of Strathmore, 408, Uxbridge Road—Mary Ann Giblet was my fellow-servant as housemaid—on Tuesday, 23rd October, about half-past 11 or a quarter to 12, I was going with her to a chemist's shop near the Victoria—as we were return<lb/>ing I saw a woman followed by a constable—she went towards the Vic<lb/>toria, went up to a man, and then went on—I did not notice more than one man there—I did not hear anything that passed when she went up—we went towards home; we met the prisoner—I did not know him before—he was a short distance from where the woman had been speaking to the man, about 50 yards—I said to him, "You had better hurry on, as</p>

               <p>I think there is some jangling up there"—I said that because Sharp seemed to have been speaking rather loud to the woman—I saw Sharp turn the corner following the woman—the prisoner went on directly; I followed him back—I saw several men in the road, none of them were known to me—I saw a man fall, I did not see in what way he fell, his back was towards me—I saw the prisoner at the time the man fell, I should say he was about two yards off, he was just going up and I was close behind him—I saw the man get up again—I don't know what became of the people that were there, I did not take notice, I went home—I attended at the police-court on the occasion of the prisoner being committed for trial—I had previously seen Mr. Haynes and made a statement to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner came to my house about a week after—I had not known him before—it was on the Monday following, before Sharp had been convicted—he then asked me to go down to the police-court, and I went on 9th November—I was not called—I did not see Mr. Haynes before that; I saw his clerk and gave my statement—I did not know Sharp or Allen—the prisoner came and asked if we were the young women that he had met—when I first saw him he was, I should say, 50 yards from the Victoria—I was going towards Askew Terrace, and met him—I left Sharp and Mrs. Thompson standing against the Princess Victoria—she appeared to be crying—I returned with the prisoner because I wanted to see what it was—I was about two yards away—I did not see English knocked down, I saw him fall; I cannot say how he fell; I cannot say whether he was knocked down or not—Sharp was close to him when he fell.</p>

I was fellow-servant as housemaid with Pivot at 408, Uxbridge Road—on Tuesday evening, 23rd October, I went with her to a chemist's shop—on returning I noticed a woman turning the corner of the Princess Victoria, a policeman following her—I heard nothing that passed—I saw the woman go up to some men as if to speak, but I did not hear her speak; we passed on and met the policeman; we had not gone more than two or three steps—Pavitt told him to hurry on as there was another policeman on farther—he hurried on—he had not more than two or three steps to go to get round the corner—I did not see what happened then; I crossed the road—I did not see English—Pavitt followed the prisoner back; she rejoined me in about five minutes, and we went home.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I pleaded guilty in December, 1882, at Middlesex Sessions, to stealing from the Stores with Lloyd and Dixon—I was charged with embezzling 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. first, and then various sums, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. For anything I know—I was also charged with falsification of the accounts, putting in the pence and leaving out the shillings, and Winter sided us by bringing the amount of Lloyd's cash-sheet two or three times a day—I destroyed the papers—Dixon was sentenced on December 14 and I was sentenced in January—Dixon would see the papers—I did not introduce Wiinter's name before the Assistant Judge—I first made a state<lb/>ment Implicating him in July, 1888, at Mr. Dutton's office—I had a letter saying that he wished to see me, and I went with my uncle—that was the first time I mentioned anything about Winter—I made several state<lb/>ments, and they were several hours taking them down—I have received the Court expenses—I first gave evidence against Barge, then Mears, then Strange, and then Winter—Strange was acquitted; he was not in the employment, he was a bicycle maker at Kennington Gross—I attended nearly every time when Winter was examined, out I was not examined—I saw Cantle and Windus there giving evidence—the counterman would make a cash-sheet as well at the end of the day—he would enter all the bills he had made up—he would have the bills on the file as well—Lloyd was counterman and I was cashier—his sheet and mine would be compared at the end of the day.</p>

I am a solicitor, and am conducting this prosecution for the Army and Navy Stores—I was entrusted with the conduct of the case before the Magistrate, and when Mr. Netherclift had gone through his evidence, the prisoner, who had been sitting down in the dock, got up and said to the Magistrate "I admit those are my initials"—he was then stopped by his solicitor, Mr. Eymer.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman Y R</hi> 27). On December 6th I was on duty with Dinsmoor in the Prince of Wales—Ball came out, and Quack followed a minute after and joined him—I followed—they went to the White Swan, about 150 yards off—I went in about two or three minutes afterwards and spoke to Mr. Bastow—both the prisoners were there—I heard Quack call for a pot of old six—he tendered a florin—Rose served him, I believe, and put it on the sideboard at the back by itself—in consequence of something I said Bastow picked up the coin and brought it to me and bent it—Ball was sitting down; he did not ask for anything at this time—I said to Quack, "I am a police-officer, and shall take you in custody for uttering counterfeit coin"—I was in plain clothes—I searched him there, and found on him eight sixpences, seven shillings, 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze, two half-ounces of tobacco, three cigars, and some postage<lb/>stamps, no bad money—while searching Quack, Ball stepped out of the door—I took Quack to the station—the other constable apprehended Ball shortly afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not hear Ball ask for anything; I should have heard him if he had, except when I went out of the house to go into the other department to take Quack in custody—the other constable found the two banburys on Ball—Ball went out—it is a swing door to the public-house—he opened the door a little way and went out.</p>

What are you doing there?"—he said "What is that to do with you?"—I said "I live there"—he said "Oh"—Webb came out from the yard through the hole on to the towing path with a crowbar in his hand—he did not speak, but lifted it up, and held it at the back of his head—I said "Don't hit me"—he brought it down on my head, and they both assailed me—I received four blows on my head; the wounds are getting better now—I was knocked down with the first blow, and then they repeated it three times—I put up my hand to protect my head, and received seven or eight blows on my hand—one of the leaders has gone from my finger—I cannot bend it straight now—I screamed out "Murder!" and "Police!"and anything I could think of—they put their hands over my mouth to prevent me, and there are several scratches where they took the skin off my face—then one of them said "Let's throw him" in—the canal runs alongside—I said "Don't throw me in"—I was near the side of the water—one caught hold of me, and I struggled, and he went in head first—I could not tell which—the other let go, went, to his friend's assistance, and I went the reverse way to Bath Place, and kept on calling out, and when they got out they came towards Bath Place to the wall which I had previously got over—I got over the wall into my master's yard—I aroused Mr. Lisk—I was covered with mud and blood from my head to my waist—my things down here were all spoilt—Mr. Lisk's son took me to the Great Northern Hospital—I had seen Webb before the night of the occurrence on three or four occasions selling birds in Somers Town—I went to the police-station on the Wednesday after the Sunday to identify the man—I saw seven or eight persons, and picked Webb out without the least hesitation as the man who had assaulted me—on the night of 27th December I went to Caledonian Road Station and saw seven or eight men standing together—I picked out Willoughby as the other who had assaulted me—I had no hesitation in the least in picking him out—I had not seen him before—I swear they, are the men—I had given descriptions of both the prisoners at the Great Northern Hospital on the night of the occurrence.</p>

I have lived at 8, Dyot Street about eight months—three weeks ago on Sunday last I saw Willoughby in bed there at 11.35, and again on the Monday morning at 7.45—I left him by the bedside dressing himself—I slept in the next bed but one to him—I bade him good night as I left the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 41, Commercial Road, St. George's, where I and my husband, George Purchase, keep a dairy shop—on the 22nd December, at half-past 11 p.m., I was behind the counter, a man came in and asked for a glass of milk and tendered this bad half-crown—I bent it with a weight—the man left the shop after some conversation saying he was very sorry—my little daughter came in directly after<lb/>wards, and I sent her after the man—the prisoner was then brought in—he said to me "I am the man who gave you the bad money, ain't I?"—I said "No, you are not the man"—my daughter said "He is not the man, but he was in company with the man, and I followed him for twenty minutes and saw him in company with the man who gave you the bad half-crown"—I had pointed out the man who came in to my daughter.</p>

I live with my mother—on the 22nd December, about half-past 11, I came into our shop, and my mother pointed out to me somebody who went across the road and joined the prisoner, who was standing on the opposite side of the road—they spoke together—I followed them and spoke to a constable, and he followed them and brought the prisoner back to the shop.</p>

I live at Avenue Road, Harlesden Green—on 13th December the prisoner and my daughter came in together between 1 and 2 o'clock—the prisoner said "What are you going to hit this girl for?"—I said "I asked her to ask her mistress for a shilling of her money where she goes to work"—Mrs. Orkner is her mistress—the prisoner said to me "Here is a sovereign, and if you can get it changed you can have a shilling of it"—I saw something in her hand, but not what coin it was—she said she had been to the Crown to get it changed and they said it was not good—she did not say whether it was good or bad; she said it was her husband's own money—she asked me if I could go and change it—I said "No, for I haven't been outside the door for several weeks, since I went to fetch my children from the Small-pox Hospital; my little girl can go and change it"—as she couldn't go to the hotel without having something I gave my little girl a bottle and said "Bring half a quartern of gin"—my little girl went down to the Junction Hotel—the prisoner stayed till she came back for her, and then she went to the hotel and was taken in custody.</p>

I am the last witness's daughter—on 3rd December I saw the prisoner outside Mr. Stone's shop, where she lives—she said she had been up to the Crown—she gave me a sovereign like this and told me to go to Mrs. Anderson's, Junction Hotel, for half a quartern of gin—my mother was there—I went to the hotel with a bottle—I noticed the coin, and the "To Hanover" struck me; I had never seen it on a sovereign before—I asked the barman whether it was a good one—the prisoner did not tell me to ask whether it was a good one.</p>

               <p>my mind to take out a warrant against him, I don't remember when I took it out—I said before the Magistrate, "In March last we had a fire on our premises; the prisoner came and assisted me to make up our claim; we recovered 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. soon afterwards; the prisoner wrote to me claiming 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he said was due"—that had nothing to do with the fire; there was 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. standing to his credit in the ledger—that was done in his business hours; he came about 11 a.m., and went away about 2 o'clock—during the time he was away he had about 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I most certainly never paid him any claim with regard to the fire—I have not balanced accounts with him and paid him—I have claims against him with regard to money which he has embezzled, and there is a balance due to him now of about 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the accountant can explain it, I cannot—the entries in the rough cash books were generally made in pencil—he may have rubbed out the pencil marks, I never did; at times they were rubbed out—I never took the rough cash book home, or the fair cash book—I made entries in the fair cash book myself—if Dennis had received money and entered it in the fair cash book in pencil in my absence I wrote it in next day—I was only there an hour or two in the morning—the pencil entries ought to be there until inked over by me, if I had the opportunity—I don't remember saying before the Magistrate, "The pencil marks were erased on the items in the rough cash book being entered in the fair cash book"—there are a great many there now—there was no necessity for erasing them—I admit saying, "I won't swear whether I was absent or not when these amounts were paid"—the rough cash book has not been altered to my knowledge since it was at the police-court, unless the accountant has added any figures—no pencil marks have been erased—our books were only audited by Dennis from year to year—Kemp, Ford, and Co. did nothing to those books, but we had an extra business as wharfingers, the prisoner audited the books there, and we paid him extra for it—that firm never borrowed money of him or used his money for interest—he had a crossed cheque for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he paid to us, and he wanted us to lend him another 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to buy a house, which we agreed to do—he has not had his 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back—I used to draft our letters and leave him to write them—he had to attend to the banking and to all the supervision of the office—his duties were very multifarious—he was in the habit of supervising the books, and had to look after the other clerks and take charge of everything—Malden kept the petty cash; Dennis would hand him what money he wanted from money which he received on our account—Mr. Fred Fenner is my nephew—I did not know that he was in the habit of borrowing from the petty cash account, this is the first I have heard of it—if these sums, which we charge him with embezzling had found their way into the petty cash book it would be quite in accordance with the office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If Dennis supplied Malden or anybody else with petty cash it would be out of money which he had in hand, and it would be his duty to credit himself in the rough cash book with that payment—if any part of it was charged with petty cash the amount would go to his credit—here are three or four figures added together in my writing; on Sep<lb/>tember 9, 1882, a bill for 158<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., another for 76<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and another for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and there was 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. short—these figures in my writing represent the money that we had in the day produced by the prisoner, and which he told us he had received on 9th September—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Trinity House pilot, and live in West India Road, Poplar—I became acquainted with the prisoner at the end of September or the beginning of October, 1882—he was a commission agent, and had two offices in the City, one in Broad Street Buildings and another at 11, Coleman Street—in March last year I was with him at his office in Broad Street Buildings—he told me that there was a friend of his of the name of John Hammond, a retired publican, who required a sum of 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on mortgage for 12 months on some land at Solihull in the county of Warwick—he said that Mr. Hammond had bought the land in January and had paid 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and that it would be a good and safe investment for 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him that it was my wife's money I was dealing with as regards the mortgage—he assured me that it was perfectly safe, that I need not have any fear upon that score—he said Mr. Hammond would pay all expenses of going down to see the land—he said he was going down to see it, and that he would wire me from Solihull as to what he saw of the land, whether it was satisfactory or not—he said he would go down on Friday, and I got a telegram from him from Solihull on the Sunday—I destroyed it—the purport of it was that everything was satisfactory, and he would see me on his return to London—he did see me, about the 1st or 2nd of March to the best of my belief, at 2, Broad Street—he then said he was quite pleased with the land, that there was a tenant on it paving 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year rent, that it was a good investment, and that I could well let my money go in that direction—I agreed to make the advance—he was to have the mortgage deed prepared—I had nobody to act for me, I left it entirely for him to prepare it—before-executing it I gave him a cheque for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), dated 13th March, 1883. and endorsed, by him—I gave it to him because he said that Mr. Hammond required some money to go on with—he afterwards showed me this mortgage deed (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it is in his handwriting—that was about the 18th or 19th of March, the day on which I gave him the balance of the money—this cheque for 119<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., dated the 16th of March, 1883, is the cheque I gave him, it is endorsed by him—he produced the mortgage deed at the time I gave him the cheque—the balance was paid in cash before the deed was executed because I had no banking account at that time—the balance of 119<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to him at the time the mortgage deed was handed over to me—the money I gave him on account was before the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the balance made up the 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he produced the deed to me already signed in his office in Broad Street Buildings, it purports to be signed by John Hammond, whose signature is attested by L. Eaton Turner, 33, Bedford Road, W.C—there is also a signature of Mr. Hammond to the receipt of the 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. attested in the same way—I then signed the deed, and the prisoner's son Alfred Avis attested my signa<lb/>ture; the prisoner at the same time handed to me this deed, purporting to be a conveyance from John Williams to Mr. Hammond, dated the 5th of January, 1883, in which the property is described as Monks Park Priory Farm, Solihull, Warwick—it was put into this envelope upon which the prisoner wrote—I know his handwriting very well, the body of the mortgage deed is his writing—I also believe the signature John Hammond to be the prisoner's writing—I am certain of it, and this endorsement on the envelope also—I took possession of the conveyance,</p>

               <p>the mortgage deed, and the envelope at the time—I had a plan of the property four days afterwards when I went to his office in Broad Street—I saw him very often after that—I did not try to get my money back for the mortgage—I had lent him other money, and I asked him for that, and he gave me this cheque as further security—the whole of it is in his writing—he gave it me on the 10th of November, 1883; it is made payable to Percival Keller Landgate, 45, Bedford Road, W.C.—I tried to see the prisoner after that almost every day both at Coleman Street and Broad Street Buildings, but I could not find him—I then set to work to make inquiries about this property—I tried to find Mr. John Williams, of Ball's Pond Road, Islington, but could not find any such person there—I also tried to find Mr. John Hammond, of St. Luke's Road, Mildmay Park; there was no such road—I could not find Mr. Hammond—I did not look for the attesting witness, Mr. Burdon—I went down to Solihull, I found no Mr. Hammond there, and could not find the property there at all, there was no farm of that name—I could not find any such place as Monk's Farm Priory Place—I could not find Mr. Cornish, the surveyor, of Horn Green, or Mr. O.E. Smith, of Solihull, he had been out of the place for three years—it was in November when I went down—I did not find the River Cole, there is a Warwick Road—I did not find where the river was crossed by the Birmingham and Warwick Canal—when I made these discoveries I got a warrant and went and saw the public prosecutor, and the Solicitor to the Treasury took up the prosecution—I did not get any of my money back.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I had lent money on mortgage before I knew you on two occasions—I was in the habit of lending money between 1881 and 1882 on various securities—I lent money on two mortgages and several promissory notes which you have in your pos<lb/>session, it was done through an agent—I had reason to be dissatisfied with that agent's conduct—I did not contemplate prosecuting him—I had several transactions with a firm in Billiter Street on which I advanced money, they were not satisfactory or I should not have gone to you—it was in November that I became acquainted with you—the mortgage with Hammond was negotiated in March, 1883—you did not tell me that you had advanced 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Hammond—you did not show me any securities that you had of his—I let you have between 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. previous to giving you the first cheque for Hammond—I had no security for that but your word—you did not tell me that Hammond was introduced by a friend, you said he was a friend of yours—the City Bank was the first banking account I had—I advanced you some money, between the 1st and 6th in gold and notes—the cheque for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I gave you was to be given to Hammond, you told me to make it payable to you—I believe the mortgage and the conveyance was handed to me at the same time that I gave you the cheque for 119<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not tell you that I was going to deposit them with some person against an advance of 218<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told you that the 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was my wife's money—you served me with a notice to produce my pass book, and here it is—I was to receive 10 per cent, interest on my money—I received two quarters, the last must have been in September—that was not paid to me by Hammond, but by you—I cannot say in what form, but I rather think it was a cheque—I have had no communications whatever with Hammond—the plan did not come to you in a letter, you gave it</p>

The depositions are said to be taken before Mr. Registrar Hazlitt, but where parties do not insist upon the attendance of the Registrar, there is an arm-chair, and the Registrar is in the building, and if the parties wish for his attendance he always comes—the bankrupt is summoned to be examined by the trustee, for the purpose of discovering his estate—there is no examination in chief, but the person representing a defendant is now allowed as a matter of courtesy to put questions—that is the result of a gradual practice—you have to apply for it in some cases before it is allowed—it is an innova<lb/>tion on the old practice—it always follows when the person attending for the bankrupt states to the Registrar that the evidence has not been suffi<lb/>ciently explicit—if the Registrar was not there it would be necessary to send for him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Amsterdam—I have known Marcus Reens 25 years—I have only seen Joseph twice—in 1881 Marcus Reens brought me a present of some flowers as an ordinary act of civility, and in the summer of 1882 he came again, and every time he came he brought me a present of flowers—he said that his business was so large that he never had such a good year before, and he had been building a very large warehouse in Haarlem, paying for which made him rather short of money, having large orders in hand from England, and could I do him a favour and lend him 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him I had laid out all my loose money—he said "Could not you assist me with a bill, discount it?"—I said "I will see what I can do," and he brought me this bill not quite a week afterwards on the day after the date. (<hi rend="italic">Dated 29th June.</hi> 1882)—I said "I didn't promise to get you the money but I will do my best"—he invited me to see the building, and I went the follow<lb/>ing Sunday—the house and warehouse were occupied—he said it was newly built and there was no debt on it at all—I asked him if it was mortgaged—he said "No"—I wrote and told him I could not get the bill discounted, and he came to me nearly crying and asked me to assist him—I wrote a note to a friend in his presence and asked him to lend me 1,000 guilders, which I gave to Marcus Reens about 17th July, and on August 1st I gave him 2,000 guilders—he came again on 4th August, and I gave him 3,000 guilders, all in notes—Joseph was present on 4th August and once before, and he said to Joseph. "There are 600 guilders, keep that for the expenses of the bill"—I had not kept back 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or a penny, but the 600 guilders were left—the bill had not been discounted, I could not get it done, as it was a six months' bill; I kept it about three months and then got it discounted as it was only a three months' bill—I got 6,000 guilders for it, less discount—I had to pay it back when it was dishonoured—I wrote to the defendants and asked why they did not send me some creeping roses which they had promised me, but I got no answer—the bill was due on 1st January, 1883, but I had heard rumors in December of their insolvency—I had written to them constantly—after the bill was dishonoured I got a notice of liquidation—I did not see them afterwards—I have not got back any of my money—I know some people who have been paid back, I know Mr. Swede.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Willesden—I was on 8th December clerk to George James Saunders, who trades as Bacon, as a general merchant, at 14, Mincing Lane—on 8th December, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, I put this order for the delivery of nine casks of tartaric acid to the British and Foreign Wharf into an envelope addressed to Messrs. Crosby, of New Mills, New North Road, Shoreditch—to the best of my belief I posted it—the first endorsement on the back of the order, "Deliver to Misers. Crosby and Co.," signed "W. C. Bacon," is mine—Messrs. Saunders's office closes at about 3 o'clock on Saturdays—Crosby had some powdered tartaric acid to deliver, and on Tuesday sent down saying he was short, and then inquiries were made at the British and Foreign Wharf, and the police were communicated with—I have never seen tartaric acid in sacks; it would get damp and spoil—the police showed me a sample of the tartaric acid found at the warehouse; it is similar to what we should expect to have in the nine casks—the nine casks would weigh about 2 tons 5 cwt. a-piece—the value of the lot would be about 360<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the writing on the order to deliver to Newman's van is not in my writing—it was not on the order when I saw it.</p>

I am a widow, living at Boston Street, Hackney Road—Emery came and inquired about the workshop to let in Audrey Street—I gave him this order to the landlord and collector, and he afterwards came to me with this note from Mr. Oliver, and I gave him the key—I am the housekeeper—about a quarter to 12 the morning after I gave the key, it must have been Thursday, I saw a vehicle, a small van, outside the ware-house; there were two men with it—I did not take sufficient notice of them to say if I see them here now—I saw them lifting something out of the vehicle—about 2 o'clock Emery came to me to borrow a broom to sweep the floor to put some goods there—I gave it to him—the same day in the evening Abberline came—Emery did not tell me his name.</p>

I am a carman and fruiterer, and let out horses and vans at 375, Hackney Road—Emery hired a trap from me on Thursday, 13th December, about 10.30—he said he wanted a horse and van to go to the docks—he said he had taken a place at the back of Goldsmith's Road, and that he should be three or four hours—he gave me the name of Edgar and Co.—he gave me a card, which I have mislaid—he had a cob and light van about 10 o'clock or 10.30, and drove it away himself—the police brought them back to me with two plates of the springs broken—I called the attention of the police to it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Inspector H</hi>). On Tuesday, 11th December, this order was shown to me, and on examining it I found the name of Newman on it—I worked on that clue, exhausted the Newmans in the Directory, and eventually found there was a Newman at Stratford, where I caused inquiries to be made—as the result I saw Andrews on Wednesday, the 12th, about 5 o'clock in the evening, at his father's greengrocer's shop in Abbey Street, West Ham—I said "I am an inspector of police, and this is Sergeant Foster," he was with me; "I have called on you with reference to nine casks of tartaric acid which were stolen from the British and Foreign Wharf, Lower East Smithfield, on Monday last, and we have ascertained that you hired Newman's van, and we are also told that you kept the carman in conversation whilst the van was driven away and emptied of its contents"—he said "Well, I will tell you all I know of it. I met a man who I know by seeing him occa<lb/>sionally about here in the Bow Road on Sunday evening, about 5 o'clock, and he asked me if I could get him a two-horse van; I said I would try. I found that I could get a van, and I went back to the Globe public-house in the Bow Road some hours after and told him that I could get him a van; he then told me to bring it up to the same public-house about 7 o'clock the next morning. The next morning I went up to the public-house with the carman about 7 o'clock, and there we saw the man, and after sitting some little time two other men came in and we had something to drink. Some time after we were told to drive up to the King's Arms in the Mile End Road; we went up to the King's Arms, and whilst I and the carman were inside having something to drink, the men got up in the van and drove it away. That is all I know about it. I and the car<lb/>man went up and down the Whitechapel Road till about 2 o'clock, when we saw the van and the men with it"—I said "Well, that is a very different account to what the carman gave of it, and I shall have to detain you at present until I make some further inquiries"—he said "I will take you round to where the man lives, if you will go with me"—I and Foster accompanied him to 33, Market Street, 150 or 200 yards from his</p>

               <p>own house—he knocked at the door; a man came to the door—I was not near enough to hear what was said—he came back to me and said "The man is not at home; they call the man <hi rend="italic">Jack.</hi> but I believe his name is Emery"—he went back to his father's house; I allowed him to have some refreshment—he asked to be allowed to walk up to Leman Street, as he thought he might very likely run against the man who engaged him on Monday night—we walked from West Ham to Leman Street, and on the way he said "One of the men had a sandy moustache and weak eyes," and pointed to a man passing us and said he somewhat resembled Emery—he was taken to the station and detained—on the Thursday I, Foster, and Fordham kept on the look-out—we were not together—I sent them to keep observation on certain districts, and later on I saw Emery and Warren at Leman Street Police-station—in my presence four keys were taken from Emery, three on a bunch and this large one separate, and this piece of paper with the name Oliver on it—I went at once to Mr. Oliver, and from what he told me I went to a warehouse in Audrey Street—I unlocked the door with the key found on Emery, and in the warehouse I found 24 sacks and sugar bags containing tartaric acid, a little over two tons—the only other things in the warehouse were a new scoop and an old tarpaulin—I had it removed to Leman Street Police-station—I produce some of the tartaric acid—some of the sacks were quite damp at the bottom; we had to have it emptied into dry sacks—I have no acid here from the bottom of the van.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at St. Ethel burgh, Leytonstone, and am a collar manufacturer at Great Alie Street, Whitechapel—I have been about two years in the neighbourhood—on Boxing Day, about 4 p.m., I was going to my office from Mansell Street, and was on the pavement—some one tapped me on my left shoulder behind—I turned round and saw Donovan and Donohue—one held my right shoulder and the other hustled me on the other side—William McCarthy snatched my chain—I was dressed as I am now—he took hold of my left hand, taking a piece of skin off one of the fingers, put in his right hand, and took hold of my chain—part was hanging and part was on the watch, the middle part having been snatched away—they all ran down the pave<lb/>ment—I tried to go after them; I said "That man has got my watch," as I thought at that time it was gone—Donovan took hold of my left shoulder, Donohue hustled me at my right side; I broke from them, and was stopped by John Sullivan about three yards off on the pavement, who rushed against me bodily and butted me—I broke from him, and was</p>

               <p>stopped in the centre of the road by another man not here—I broke from him, and was caught by two others on the pavement, one of whom was Jeremiah McCarthy—at that time I saw William McCarthy about half way down the street; he stopped, turned round, and looked at me—I said "That man has got my watch" two or three times, nothing more than that—two or three other men followed him down, I went into my office, stopped a few minutes, came out, and went down Mansell Street, and saw a policeman in Commercial Street—I told him, and he persuaded me to go to Leman Street Police-station, where I saw Sergeant Upright in the street about 7 or a little before, and gave a description of all the men as nearly as I could—I went with him that same evening in search of the men, and we went to some public-houses, at one of which, I think the Blue Anchor, I pointed out Donovan and Donohue to Enright—that was about 8 o'clock—they were in the bar with a lot of others—whilst waiting for more police one of the prisoners came outside (we were standing outside), and I pointed him out, and the two were taken—I saw William McCarthy in another public-house with a lot of other men, and pointed him out as the man who snatched the chain, and he was taken also—on the 27th I saw Jeremiah McCarthy at Leman Street Station with eight or nine others—I pointed him out, and he was charged—I saw Sullivan the next Saturday morning, the 29th, at the station among 10 or 12 others—there were two others there who I knew by sight as well—I pointed out Sullivan as the third man who stopped me—I had seen William McCarthy before about the streets and in Great Alie Street—I have seen all the prisoners before at various times—I know their faces by sight—I am positive they are the five men who so dealt with me on that night—it took about a minute.</p>

                  </hi>. I am salesman to Mr. Day, a pawnbroker and furniture dealer, at 29, Croydon Road, plaistow—on Saturday, 1st December, about 1 o'clock in the day, the prisoner came to our shop and said he had got some furniture to sell, and asked me to go round and see it—I went with him to 19, Shepherd Street—I asked him why he wanted to sell the furniture—he said he was about parting with his wife, that he had had some difference with his wife, and he had agreed to part from her, and also that he wanted to make some money up, because he was going away—he said his wife was in the habit of spending all his money, and parting with everything, in fact he had hardly got anything in his place—he said he wanted 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I offered 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and to make up the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he pointed out one or two pictures over the mantel board—they happened to be portraits of children—I asked him if they were his—he said "Yes"—I said "I never like to buy portraits belonging to the family; if you are going away you had better take them with you"—he put his hand to his heart, and said "I will"—I said "I will run round and tell Mr. Day, and I will bring a van round presently"—he said "I wish you would leave it till between 4 and 5, or after dark at any rate, because I don't</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This stated:.</hi> "I have now a large order on hand and should be glad if you can begin work at once. Please send postal order at once, so that I can send you work on Monday. E.

I enclosed a postal order for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., stating that I was not able to send 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at present, but that it might be kept back from what I earned—I left that letter myself at 43, Skiers Street—I knocked at the door and Nethersole opened it—I asked her if any one named Clive lived there—she said "Yes"—I said "Is it a lady or a gentleman?"—she said "A gentle<lb/>man"—I asked if I could see him—she said "He is not at home; he will not return till late in the evening"—she asked me to come in and took the letters and read them—I said "Will it be all right if I leave the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. order?"—she said she would give it to Mr. Clive, and would see that he answered me that evening or next morning—she showed me some embroidery which she said was worked by ladies, and that Mr. Clive was her cousin—she handed me back the letters and envelopes and let me out—I waited a week and no materials or letters came—I then wrote this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was addressed to Mr. Clive, stating that as no work had been sent, she wished the </hi>10<hi rend="italic">s. returned to her</hi>). I posted that myself and got no reply; I called again in about a fortnight—Nethersole came to the door—I asked to see Mr. Clive—she said that he would not be home till late—I told her I wanted the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. back—she said she could not give it me because she had not got it—I said that I had received no work—she said Mr. Clive was very busy and might have forgot it, but she would tell him and he would send me work either to-morrow or next morning—he didn't do so—I complained at the police-court and a warrant was issued—I parted with my 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. because I thought I should be employed.</p>

I live at 10, Lavender Street, Stratford—on the 29th November I was put into possession of 43, Skiers Street, for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. rent—I remained in possession for a week, night and day, and saw the three prisoners there—Clive took in letters coming by post, and afterwards he wrote letters, and I saw Nethersole and Saunders both writing letters—after the post came Clive looked at some and tore up some, saying "Rotten," and threw them in the fender—he used to show them to Nethersole, not to Saunders, but he would look over sometimes—Clive put some pieces of embroidery into the letters which were written—I saw Clive and Nethersole opening letters on the 29th November—they used to commence writing after breakfast—Nethersole was busy about his work during the day—while Clive was out she took in the letters and used to open them at first, but afterwards he gave her orders not to open them, and she laid them aside for him—the two male prisoners used to return about 6 p.m.—Clive asked me if I could read writing, I said that I was very near<lb/>sighted—I could not always understand the language they talked in, it appeared to be a foreign language—after they used that mysterious language they cleared the table and took the letters to the post—there was a bed and bedstead in the front room, and a pair of sheets and a counterpane, a washstand, and a chest of drawers—the two male prisoners, I believe, slept there; there was a bedstead in the back room but no clothes on it—Nethersole told me she slept there with nothing to cover her but her dress, that was because I complained of having to sleep on the floor—when she went out she shut the door and told me to put the catch up, and she would knock twice and scratch with her hand when she returned, and I was not to open the door to any one else, but I used to at times—on the Monday morning, just before they went, Clive went</p>

I can read large print—this is a bill for sugar and tea—Nethersole did all the business of the house, and ran with messages at times; it was while she was out and while the other prisoners were out that I was not to open the door till she came back—I fetched beer in for myself—I only saw Nethersole open one or two letters all the time I was there, one of them had a black border—I have heard her speak of her sisters, but do not know that one of them is in Bethlehem Hospital—she used to talk about Wales, and I asked her if she was Welsh—I told them that I understood one word in Welsh—she said that she was out of a situation and had no place to go to, and came to live with her cousin as housekeeper—I did not take any letters to the post for them; they wanted me to leave the house, but I would not—they sent away a writing table, some chairs, and a fender—the beds and things were all seized for rent—no account has been given to the prisoners or any money returned to them—I did not ask Nethersole to give me the lace curtains, as I might as well have them as the landlord—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is an inventory of all the goods taken away—I heard Clive say to Nethersole on Thursday, "Louisa, will you write or copy a few letters?"but she was busy and did not do them, but after they had had their tea they all commenced writing, and pieces of embroidery were put in the letters—Clive used to show letters to Nethersole and she used to copy them.</p>

I went into possession on November 29th, and found Saunders there—Nethersole said that Saunders was a friend of Clive's, and that Clive was subject to fits—Saunders slept there every night except once, when they were both away—they might have private letters for anything I know—I never saw Saunders tear up any letters, he amused himself with a book of songs, and made cigarettes, and smoked; he took no part with the letters that I know of—I saw him write letters, but I don't know what they contained—Clive used to come down in the morning in a long night-gown and take the letters—he had a fit once.</p>

This receipt of Turnbull's is in Shadbolt's handwriting—Shadbolt was assistant foreman to Banks—the receipt was not written in the presence of Turnbull—I am not in the habit of writing receipts and waiting for two or three hours for the persons to come and sign them—this full receipt with no signature is the railway company's—one of their men comes round now and then and signs it; he does not sign it at the time it is drawn up—these goods have been delivered to the Midland Railway and not signed for—that receipt was not drawn up hours before Turnbull signed it, because it was only 1.15 when he applied for the goods, and 3.30 when they were delivered—I will not swear it was not drawn up at 1.15; I should think it was not—I will swear beyond all doubt that when Shadbolt booked the order Turnbull was present—I said at the police-court "I believe Banks and Turnbull were both in the office"—I will not swear at the time Shadbolt booked the order that Turnbull was in the office—an order by bulk is different to an order by sack; an order by bulk is by weight, by sack it is by the bag—I heard Turnbull say he had signed the receipt by mistake by the wind blowing over the leaves—I would not swear the two receipts are in the same handwriting—I saw him write this in the book from 1st to 5th January, when the leaf was blown over—I saw him write this one to had bolt—the shed where this was signed is a temporary box—there are two delivery foremen and two assistants—Mr. Davis is my superior—I won't swear he was there at the time it was signed—I have no clock in the office—I would not swear it was 3.30—I simply say it was 1.15 because it is so in the book in Shadbolt's writing—I am sure it was not so late as 3.45, because the goods were delivered at 3.30—our hours are from 9 to 4 o'clock—we have lights at the office; they were not lit at this time.</p>

Banks." That is underneath my entry—I will not swear Banks did not tell me to make that entry in the book, and book the order—this in the receipt book, a copy of the order, is my handwriting—it is Turnbull's signature at the bottom—I saw him write and sign it—it may have been before or after Banks had put his signature to that yellow book, I cannot say which—if Banks had not been present I should not have signed that order, I should have expected the man that delivered it—I cannot say Banks delivered it—it has occurred before with other goods—if the tallyman had delivered it and brought the book in, as he has done in many cases, and said "I have delivered so-and-so," I should have booked it for him—I would book the delivery if I did not see it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a foreman in the Dock Company's service, attached to warehouses 5 to 8—Banks had no right whatever in 6, 7, or 8—Dunn would be attached to any warehouse—I saw Banks and Turnbull about half-past one on 23rd November in the Customs House Hotel with Mr. Thompson; the three were speaking to one another—I did not know Turnbull as being in Thompson's employment—about 3.40 the same day I saw Banks wheeling a sack on a truck towards No. 8—I asked him what he had—he said "A sack of wheat dust"—later on I saw him either In the delivery box or outside the warehouse—I asked him then "What have you delivered to Miller's craft?"—he said "A sack of wheat dust"—shortly after 4 o'clock, in consequence of information I received, I went to Miller's craft and said to Turnbull "What have you received from Banks?"—he said "A sack of wheat dust"—before that I had noticed this bag of bone dust in the craft and some bone dust on the gunwale—the hatches were not down—I told him that was not bone dust—this bag of bone dust is the ordinary size and shape of a <hi rend="italic">gunny</hi> bag—when I pointed it out, he said that was what Banks had delivered—Banks came up during the conversation—I said to Banks "You have made a mistake," I did not mean anything more—he made no reply—I ordered the bag of bone dust to be taken from the craft.</p>

I could tell bone from wheat dust when I saw them on the gunwale—mistakes are made at the docks, they are not frequent—I have known delivery foremen fined for mistakes of that description—Davey has been fined for that—he is still in the service as foreman—if a foreman is told to send certain goods away and he does not find them in one warehouse, it is not customary for him to go to another warehouse to take corresponding goods—I cannot remember it's being done—Mr. Heath has supervision over me and has the right to give general directions as to how the work shall be carried on—I do not know that he told Banks to take a parcel out of No. 6 to complete an order, or that the prisoner refused to do it—I was drinking with Banks in the public-house—we did not go in together, he asked me to go in and I followed him—Dunn would act under the delivery foreman's orders—there were no contract 'men on the 23rd—I don't know, it does not come under me—if a delivery foreman was loading a barge and it was near 4 o'clock, it is very improbable that he would ask another tallyman or labourer to help his men; he would try to get done in time and would try to get more men—my first impression was that Banks had made a mistake—he has been there over 18 months—I have been there 11 months.</p>

What do you know about it?"—Dunn said "At a quarter before 4 o'clock I received instructions on the previous day, the 23rd, from foreman Banks to deliver a sack of wheat-dust; he let me have the book in which the delivery order had been copied, and sent me to see a man named Plantin, who would show me where the sack was. I went to Plantin; he pointed me out the sack of wheat-dust, which I took upon my truck and wheeled to the Nymph"—I said "What about a sack of wheat which had also been delivered by him?"—he said "I never took but one sack to the Nymph"—I said "Who was with you when you delivered that sack?"—he said "Turnbull went with me to the middle floor No. 7 warehouse, and was with me when the sack was passed out to me by Plantin, and was with me when I delivered it I saw Banks directly after I had delivered it, and told him that I had delivered it;" he said "Turnbull was in the barge when I delivered it into the barge; Banks was standing alongside the barge tallying other goods"—after Banks and Turnbull were in custody I again saw Dunn and said "I have come to see you again in reference to the matter I was speaking to you about the other day; I give you another opportunity."

I knew nothing more until I went to the barge and asked the lighterman Turnbull if he had received this sack of wheat-dust, and the lighterman said he had not. I then went in search of this sack of wheat-dust and found what I thought was the sack of wheat-dust in No. 8 warehouse; then I took the sack myself on a truck and delivered it to the lighterman Turnbull into his craft"—I said "There is something more with regard to a sack of wheat which was found there in the craft"—he said "I know nothing at all about a sack of wheat being found in the craft, and the bone-dust which I had delivered to Turnbull I believed to be a sack of wheat-dust, and had delivered it by mistake, but I afterwards went to the craft and helped to get out the bag of bone-dust with others"—I said "You went with Dunn to Plantin and must have known that the sack of wheat-dust had already been delivered"—he said "I was not with Dunn; he went to Plantin, and I did not go into No. 7 warehouse at all"—I brought Dunn, Banks, and Plantin face to face—Plantin first said he had already told me; then he said that Banks was with Dunn when he came to me for the sack of wheat-dust pointed out—Dunn said "Yes, that was so; we were together when we went to Plantin, Banks assisted me in getting the sack of wheat-dust down from the middle floor, No. 7"—Banks said "I was not there"—I said to Banks "What do you know about the lighterman Turn<lb/>bull?"—he first of all said "I don't know anything at all about him; I don't know the man"—I said "It scarcely can be believed that you were in a public-house on Saturday drinking with a man whom you did not know, and drinking with the same man out of the same pot the day previous to that"—he said "I had known Turnbull 10 or 12 days ago when I was in the Thames Police"—I said "What did you know him as then?"—he said "I knew him as a foreman lighterman"—I said "In whose employ?"—he said "In Mr. Frey's employ"—I said "What do you know about Mr. Frey's employes?"—he said "They then went by the name of the 'Forty Thieves'"—I said "Then you well knew that you were in company with a man and drinking with a man whom you had known 10 or 12 years ago as a foreman over 40 thieves"—he said "Well, I won't admit I was drinking with him in the public-house"—on Monday, 26th November, I saw Turnbull on board his craft Nymph in the docks, and said "Turnbull, I have come to see you with reference to a sack of wheat and a sack of bone-dust which were found in your barge on 23rd and 24th November; it will be very necessary for you to be careful as to what you say, because it is a very serious matter. You know who I am, of course?"—he said "Oh, yes, I know you, and I have given up all my old tricks, and I knew I had to receive a small parcel from the granaries, and whilst I was lying at 29 shed taking in the goods there, foreman Banks came and said 'I have a small delivery for you, will you take them in here?' I said 'I shall be very glad to take them in here, it will save me moving my craft round the corner.' A few minutes after that a little man brought me one sack and went away; a few minutes after that he brought me the second sack; after delivering it he went away, and shortly after that the foreman Banks brought me the third bag.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188401070127"/>
               <p>knew that she was in trouble—I can't exactly say how many times she has said that, but several different times she used the same words—on 2nd November she took the baby away from my house to her sister's, as she told me—she said she was going there—she left about 3.30 in the afternoon—she said she was going to her sister's at Naphill; that is about eight miles from Bagshot—I noticed how the child was dressed when she took it away—it had on a nightgown, a flannel pinch (that is a back flannel, a square of flannel which is put on the body), a little hood of flannel round its shoulders, a bandage round its body, and two little shirts—I cannot say whether they were both on or not; I gave her one of the shirts—I cannot say whether she put one in her pocket or whether she put both on the baby—one was on the baby when she brought it to my house—I think that was all that the child had on—I think that it had on its shoulders some cerise ribbons, and it had a shawl—the prisoner returned to my house the same afternoon—she had not the baby with her then—she brought the shawl back with her which the baby had had on, and I said to her "Alice, that looks bad to bring the shawl back"—that was the first thing I said to her—she said "My sister would not allow me to leave the shawl, as she has two old ones of mother's, and if she wanted to take the baby out she could wrap her in one of them"—I asked her what arrangement she had made with her sister about the baby—she told me that her sister was going to keep it at her own expense, and all she had to do was to find it in clothes—that was all that was said about the baby—I cannot recollect her saying anything else to me about it—she stayed with me till the 9th November—when she went away she said she was going to Aldershot—she did go to Aldershot; I went with her, to get her a situation—she got one at 40, Union Street, at a cook's shop—it was called Archer's Dining Room—she went to live there on 9th November—I next saw her on 11th December at my house—that is about 10 miles from Aldershot—I said "Well, Alice, have you heard from the baby?"—she said "Yes"—I said "Is it all right"—she said "Yes"—nothing else was said—she left my house on 11th December saying she was going back to Chertsey—she said she was with this man again that she had the baby by—I had a little girl of hers keeping for her during the time she was at Aldershot, and she came to see this child and took it down to the village, and she said she was with him again, and she took the child down to him in the village and came back again to me in the afternoon—I had seen some man with her that day; she was going to Chertsey to live with him again—he came to my house with her in the afternoon—I knew him by being about where I live—he goes by the name of Bob Brown—he came with her to my house about half-past 2 o'clock that afternoon—nothing was said by the prisoner about the child or about this man in his presence—nothing was said that day about him—I had the little girl with me for some time—the prisoner brought her to me before she went into the Union to have another one—I had her some time during October—it was nearly four years old—I think it must have been in September when she brought the little girl to me, it must have been in the early part of September—she was very likely then to have this baby, and the man had left her—she came and asked me if I would take to the little girl—I had half-a-crown a week while it was with me, and I kept it with that money until she took it away—she said that child belonged to a man named Holder living at Balham—I next saw her</p>

I am stationed at Bagshot—on 25th December, about 2.30 in the afternoon, I went to Lightwater Bridge and found the baby-clothing that is now produced—it was lying on the grass by the side of the road—they were then loose, not tied in a bundle—I took them to the police-station—on 28th December I saw Elizabeth Collier at the police-station—I then showed her these baby-clothes—on 29th December I received some information from Humphreys about 10.30 in the morning, in consequence of which I went with him to the Lightwater Grounds, and there saw the body of a child; it was about a quarter of a mile from the bridge—it was lying face downwards in water, the body was nearly submerged in water and mud, except just the back part of the head, and the hips and shoulders were out of the water—I took it out of the water, and it was taken to the King's Arms, Bagshot—Mrs. Collier saw it there on the following day, the 30th—there was nothing on the child when I found it—Lightwater Bridge is in Windlesham parish; the village is a little way off the road; Bagshot and Windlesham is all one parish—the boy Martin's description is correct.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner, at Windlesham—on 29th December, about 6 o'clock in the evening, I was fetched by Sergeant King to the White Hart, and was there shown the dead body of a female child, which appeared to be between three and four months old at that time—I formed a judgment by its general ap<lb/>pearance that it had been dead between one and two months—the child appeared to me to be older than it turns out to be—it was a well-nourished child—on examining the body I found the skin on the legs, feet, arms, and hands bleached; the abdomen was blue; the face and head was reddish; the skin was peeling off the feet and toes, also off the pubis, and slightly off the head—I noticed some marks on the body, one on the back part of the head, a little to the left side, somewhat slightly larger than half a-crown, circular, of a' punched-out appearance, removing the skin and muscle down to the bone—there was a similar mark on the side of the left buttock of the same size, and a similar one on the right—I believe those marks to be simply the result of decomposition—I found no marks on the body which in my judgment were not the result of decomposition—I found no marks of violence—there were two other marks—I must explain that I cannot swear positively in some of these instances, because the body was so far decomposed; putre<lb/>faction had set in considerably—on 1st January I made a post-mortem examination—the lungs were congested, but they were not gorged; the right side of the heart contained some blood; the left side was empty; the stomach was distended; it contained an ash-coloured fluid, which might have been milk mixed with dirty water; that is merely suggestion—there was nothing in the post-mortem examination which enabled me to assign the cause of death—there was nothing in the condition of any of the organs to account for death—the only inference I might possibly draw from the state of the lungs was that the child might have died from exposure. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing the child to have been placed face down<lb/>wards in a pool of muddy water, such as has been described, was there any appearance wanting which you did not find? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; had if</p>

               <p>been placed in the water recently there were appearances wanting. I mean by recently, before decomposition had set in; say a few days—there were indications wanting of a death by drowning—I cannot, say that it was not alive when it was placed there—I cannot form an opinion upon that point one way or the other, owing to the decomposition—that is the opinion I must give from the non-appearance of positive evidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The skin was bleached—I cannot say that that is an appearance often found in death from exposure—I have not had enough experience to enable me to speak of it—decomposition had set in about the head, not about the face; I think it had in the throat, I am not sure—I think it had in the stomach, I am not sure—the lips were not com<lb/>pressed, they were slightly open—from being some time in the water the flesh would come easily off with the touch, that is one of the signs which enabled me to determine the length of time the body was there—I saw the body before it was removed to the station and to the King's Arms—I went first with Sergeant King to the White Hart—I cannot say whether the child was alive or dead when in was placed in the water.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I did not upon the post-mortem examination alter the opinion I had formed about the age of the child—that was an opinion I formed on the view of the body, and that is the opinion I form now—from my examination of the body if I had been asked how old the child was I should have said between three and four months.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. My opinion on that subject was free from doubt, still children vary so much—it would be an exceptional thing for a child three weeks old to appear like one of three or four months—I would not say it is very exceptional; I think I have known such a case—I cannot give such an instance—I have seen fine children born—the hair of a young child comes off after a time—there was hair on this child—there are indications of drowning which I say were wanting—there was no water in the lungs—a very common indication of drowning is excoriation on the fingers and nails; there were no traces of that, I looked for them—the hands and fingers were in a condition to enable me to form an opinion as to whether excoriation had ever existed—there was no dirt about the hands; the tongue looked dirty, discoloured by external dirt, but no mud—mud in the mouth is a very common thing, I found none here, I should have expected to do so if a living body was placed on its face in a muddy pond—there was no other wanting indication—an inference might be drawn from the state of the heart and lungs that the child had died from drowning—to some extent indications of drowning were wanting, the lungs were congested, not gorged; that might happen during life, from cold, and a variety of causes—there was nothing that I observed in the body which was inconsistent with the fact that the child might have died a natural death, nor anything inconsistent with the fact of its being placed in the water after death—I should say it had been in the water between one and two months, more than one and decidedly less than two; that I can swear to positively—I do not think that all the appearances I saw could have been presented by its having been in the water a full month, I incline to the belief that it was nearly two months, it is impossible to say to a day—the body of a young child would become decomposed somewhat quicker than that of an adult—I have had no personal experience of the condition of the bodies of children that have been in the water for so long a period as a month—there were indica<lb/>tions here which enable me to say with certainty that the child had been</p>

I am barmaid at the Criterion Tavern, in the borough of Kingston—on the night of 15th December I was serving there between 8 and 9 o'clock—the prisoner came into the bar, and asked for two threepenny cigars—I gave him the two cigars, and he gave me half a sovereign in payment—I had some doubt about it, and handed it over to Mr. Porter, the proprietor, who is outside—the prisoner said "My change, please," or some remark similar to that—I don't think I made any remark—I did not say it was bad; I thought he would go if I said that—I gave the half-sovereign to Mr. Porter, and he went round to the compartment and detained the prisoner—I heard what was said—Mr. Porter said to the prisoner "Are you under the impression that this half-sovereign is bad?"—the prisoner said I had given him this bad half-sovereign in change that evening for a sovereign—I denied it—I said "It is not so; you are under a wrong impression; I did not"—I am quite sure I had not given this man change for a sovereign that evening—I gave change for a sovereign that evening to another gentle<lb/>man, a Mr. Duffell, who is a witness outside, and who was a regular customer known to me—that was between 6 and 7 o'clock—there were three men in the compartment with the prisoner, and I concluded they were his companions—I cannot say if they spoke to him—I gave the half-sovereign to Mr. Porter—a constable was sent for to the house.</p>

It's merely a case of giving your name and address, and I should like you to go to a constable"—previously to that I had seen a friend of mine; the prisoner did not hear what passed between us—I took the prisoner to a constable, about 20 yards off—he went out, and I with him, and we saw the constable on the way to the station—outside the house he said he had got the half-sovereign from my house—I had a friend with me—when we met the constable I said "This man has passed a bad half-sovereign, and I want you to come back to the house to take his name and address"—the prisoner came back to the house—in the house I said "I charge this man with uttering a bad half-sovereign"—the prisoner brought out six single shillings in good money which he had in his hand and put it on the counter, and then he said he got the half-sovereign from our young lady, Miss Tibey—I said "What did you want to change this half-sovereign for when you had 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in good money money in your pocket?"—he said he had some small amounts to pay away—this was Saturday night between 9 and 10 o'clock—I said "What did you do with the other money, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.?"—he said he went over the way and spent 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in a couple of pots treating some people—I asked him who they were—he said he did not know who they were, they had met him—I asked him if he could not name the house—he said "The house over the way"—"Which house?" I said—he said "It is round to the left"—there are about fourteen houses over the way—he gave his address at the police-station—he wanted the policeman to search his person and began to take off his dress at the bar—he was taken to the station—I heard him give his address to the constable at the station—I gave the half-sovereign to the constable that night.</p>

Burgoyne's, the boatbuilders—I could not state how many sovereigns I took off my till that night to one or two—before this I went to Saunders and got change, clearing in the sovereigns from the back—I took five or six—you were taken from the house to the station in company with myself and Mr. Merritt.</p>

                  </hi>. In November I was policeman 85 L—I have since left the force—on the afternoon of that day I was called to the shop, 177, Westminster Bridge Boad, by Mr. Barrett, and the prisoner was given into custody by Mr. Palmer for tendering a counterfeit sovereign in pay<lb/>ment for a pair of gloves—the prisoner said "It is not likely I should ruin myself and my character for life by tendering a bad sovereign if I knew it; you can go to the place where I have worked, and my lodgings, and you will find my character bears the strictest investigation," or words to that effect—I searched him at the shop, and found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver and 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze—on the way to the station the prisoner said he must have won the sovereign playing billiards at Wilson's in the Kent Road—he was charged before the Magistrate on two days, and subse<lb/>quently discharged.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in his defence, repeated what he had stated before the Magis<lb/>trate, denied all knowledge of the coins being bad, and stated that he had intended to bring an action for false imprisonment against Mr. Barrett, and went for that purpose to Mr. Willis, a solicitor in St. Martin's Court, who gave notice of motion. The florin he recollected afterwards he must have obtained from Mr. Bingham when he pawned his watch. He was just going to a new situation, and depended upon Mr. Rogers, who was a friend of Mr. Barrett's for a reference.</hi>
