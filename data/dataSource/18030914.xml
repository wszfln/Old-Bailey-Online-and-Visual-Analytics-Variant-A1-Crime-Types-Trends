               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. Did not the man prisoner say, the pin was given to him; by some body in the house? - A. Yes, he said it was given to him by the other prisoner.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Mulcaster, pawnbroker, in Chandler's-street, (produces a table cloth;) I took it in on the 23d of August, of a woman, whom I believe to be the prisoner at the har; she said, she pledged it for her mother or sister, I cannot say which, I did not know her before, it was a shortish young person.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that your only reason for believing it to be the prisoner? - A. Yes, I cannot swear positively to her person; I lent her seven shillings and sixpence upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that duplicate? - A. This is the duplicate that was given upon the pledging of the table cloth.(The property was identified by Mr. Doratt, and his mother.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Doratt. The man prisoner has lived with me since Christmas; the other prisoner, from respect to my father, with whom she had lived, and from charity to her, I took her into my service upon his death.</p>
               <p>Allamby's defence. The pin was given me two months ago by this young woman, and the table cloth was left in my box by mistake; the duplicate I don't know any thing of, my box has been left open many times.</p>
               <p>Prosser's defence. Mrs. Doratt told me, in removing from one house to the other, if there was any thing in the litter worth my acceptance, I might take it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Allamby called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Mr. Foulds. This is the same sort of tobacco that he was at work upon.</p>

             sworn. - I am a butcher; I saw the prisoner take the shoulder of mutton from Mr. Brignall's door, and go away with it; he then turned round, and went past the shop with the shoulder of mutton in his hand; I then went into Mr. Brignall's shop, and asked him if he had sold it; one of his servants went with me after the prisoner; I saw him turn into Bell-court; he had it then by the knuckle; we laid hold of him, and brought him back; I am sure the prisoner is the same man; he said he had bought it in Fleet-market.</p>

             sworn. - I am shopman to Mr. Brown, in Oxford-street; I was shopman to Mr. Carver; On the 18th of July, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner Bell, and a woman who has been discharged, came into the shop, and asked to look at some lace; when they came in Mr. Carver and myself were engaged with customers; I was at leisure first, I shewed them some black lace; they said they did not mean black lace, they meant white; I told them we did not keep white French lace, they would get it eight or nine doors higher; the woman that is discharged said she wanted a remnant of black lace, about two yards; I shewed them some; I observed the prisoner, Bell, draw a card of lace off the counter with her right hand, and drop it on the ground; the prisoner, Bond, was at a distance when the card of lace was on the ground; she came and sat down in a chair by the prisoner, Bell; I continued to shew them all three lace; when I found none would suit them, I put the lace by; I went round the counter to look for the card that was dropped, and it was gone; I said I had lost a card of lace; I then observed that the prisoner, Bond, was gone; I went into the back shop to tell my master of it; I then went out after the prisoner, Bond; when I came to Newman-street, I observed the prisoner, Bond, walking slowly up; I went up to her, and asked her to come back; she said, yes, is there any thing the matter; she turned herself, and came close to me; I drew away from her, and desired her to come along; we walked on together about three yards; I then looked back, and saw the card lying without the lace about three yards behind us; I pointed to the card and said, that betrays you; she then drew the lace out of her right-hand pocket-hole; I then picked up the card, and she gave me the lace, and I brought her back to the shop, where the prisoner, Bell, was; my master then desired me to go for a constable; a constable came, and they were all three taken into custody. The prisoner, Bell, came in about three minutes after the others, she had a child in her arms (produces the lace); I know the lace by my master's private mark upon the card C. C. A. C. and I know it by the pattern; I had shewn them that card, it is worth 3l.</p>

               <p>Q. About what time in the morning were you awaked? - A. I heard my name called a little before four.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you come down stairs? - A. I came down stairs directly; as I was coming down stairs, I saw one of the parlour windows open.</p>


               <p>Q. Had that window any shutters? - A. Yes, outside, and on the table I saw the knife case empty.</p>
               <p>Q. At what window did the person get in? - A. The kitchen window.</p>
               <p>Q. How was that window fastened? - A. The shutter was bolted with a bolt at bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that shutter forced? - A. It did not seem to me to be forced; there was a vacancy, owing to the sun having drawn it, by which an instrument might be put in, and it might have been opened.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that shutter had been bolted? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go in search of the person? - A. Yes; as soon as I had dressed myself I went in pursuit of her; I saw her in an alley about half a mile from my house; she saw me, and ran away; I pursued her, and called out, stop thief! I pursued her down the lane, and when she had got into the middle of the lane, she threw a brass candlestick at me; I still pursued her, and caught her; she asked me to let her go, and she would tell me where every thing was; she told me they were in a garden; I asked her if it was my garden, and she would not give me an answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take her back to your house? - A. She took me to the place where the bundles were.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that place? - A. In the alley where I first saw her; I found two bundles there; there was a low sence over the garden, where she had put them; I took her back to the house; there was a round table standing in the kitchen, and she took from her pocket three brass candlesticks, a decanter, two silver table-spoons, two silver salt-cellers, three glass salt-cellers, a silver tea-spoon, and two silver salt-spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you bring the bundle away which she had shewn you? - A. Yes; I led her down the lane to my house, and sent the bundles.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner as to the manner in which she got into your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before she said any thing, did you tell her it would be better for her to confess? - A. No, I don't remember any promise.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make use of any threat to induce her to confess? - A. No; she said she had no accomplices; there were a great many people about, who said, why did not she go to place, and earn an honest living; and she said, if Mrs. Gordon had given her a character, she could have got a place; I did not then know that she had lived<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140009"/>in my service; she told me she came in at the kitchen window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any poker found? - A. There was a small old poker found just by the window; I did not see it found.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it fitted to the window-shutter? - A. Yes, I saw the officer fit it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to have been an instrument by which the shutter might have been opened? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Q. Do you live in the neighbourhood of Kenton Green? - A. Not now; I was there on the 25th of July, about three o'clock in the afternoon; I was putting up a scaffold about one hundred yards from Mrs. Pring's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the prisoners? - A. Yes, I saw them both.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they are the two persons? - A. Yes, I am sure of it; I saw them go into the yard of Mrs. Pring's house; I saw them open the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they open the door? - A. They lifted up the latch, and both of them went in; the woman lifted up the latch, and went in first, and her husband followed her; the prisoner, Daniel, said the woman was his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you near enough to see whether they did more than lift up the latch? - A. I did not see them do any thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door shut when they went in? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any thing else? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any bundle? - A. No, I did not; when she came out, she dropped the canister upon the stones in the yard; she took it up again, put it under her arm, and went over to the public-house, and the man with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the public-house near? - A. Yes; about an hour after I went to the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not suspect any thing then? - A. No, I did not know but the young woman was at home; when I went to the public-house, they were both sitting against the door drinking beer; while I was there, the young woman came to the door into the yard, crying, and making an alarm; I then asked the man if he had been in the house, and he said, no, he had not; then I asked the woman, and she said, no, she had not been in the house; then I contradicted them, and said, they had, and sent for a constable, and took them into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they searched in your presence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing found upon them? - A. No, nothing belonging to the young woman; and after they were taken into custody, they offered to give the young woman something to make it up, and said, they were guilty of it, - that they had taken the tea-canister out.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the canister after they were in custody? - A. Yes, Lost brought it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. None of the other things were found upon them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you saw no other person near the spot at the time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You had made the man some promise of forgiveness, had not you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else hear him say that? - A. Yes; the young woman was with me; I don't know whether she heard it or not.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. I have seen him come backwards and forwards to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at your house on the 10th of August? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The day before he was taken up? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What business did he come upon? - A. He came to the bar, and asked for a glass of gin, and offered a shilling; I drew him the gin, and he gave me a shilling; I gave him the change, and he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the amount of the glass of gin? - A. Seven farthings.</p>
               <p>Q. After he was gone, did you turn your attention to the shilling? - A. I took the shilling from the bar, it being dark, to a window, and found it a bad one; I followed him towards Clare-market, but missed him; I returned, and put the shilling in a peace of paper, and have kept it separate from all others from that time to this; I crossed it at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again? - A. Next day, in the afternoon, on the 11th; he came for a glass of gin, which he was furnished with.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he make payment for that? - A. He offered me another shilling; I looked at it, and saw it was a bad one; I took him by the collar, and said, my friend, I shall stop you as a smasher, or passer of bad money; he had asked to look at the shilling, and then had it in his possession; I took him into a little room behind the bar, and set him down in a chair, while I sent for a constable; I sat in a chair next to him, in order to take care he should not throw any thing away; all on a sudden he put his hand to his pocket, took out the shilling, and put his hand quickly to his mouth; I took him by the gullet, but he swallowed it, in spite of all I could do; I felt it pass between my fingers.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was searched, what was found upon him? - A. Only six or seven pennyworth of halfpence; no silver whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he halfpence enough to pay for the gin, without offering the shilling? - A. Yes, and five-pence or sixpence to spare; he was then taken into custody, and sent to Bow-street. (Produced the counterfeit shilling.)</p>
               <p>Mrs. SOANE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys.</p>
               <p>Q. You are the wife of the last witness? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him the day before he was taken up? - A. I was up stairs at the time, but Mr. Soane called me down; I saw the prisoner next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him come in the next day? - A. No; Mr. Soane called me to mind the bar, while he set with the man till the constable came.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what became of the shilling? - A. No.</p>

The prisoner slept at home the night before the robbery, and said he was going out very early in the morning on board his ship; he went out about five o'clock, and did not return; he went with us to the pawnbroker's, and demanded the things, part of which were produced; he said he got drunk, and lost the rest, and that he brought them on a particular day, upon which the pawnbroker produced them.</p>

             sworn. - I have been in the Excise; I slept in the room where the boxes were found; I cannot say when it was, as I was there but five weeks; I have frequently seen the prisoner and Adams open the boxes in my lodging at the Red Lion, in Whitecross-street; the prisoner was in the hospital, but came out, and stopped a few days, and went into the country; he stopped there about ten days or a fortnight; he slept in the house where the box was, but not in the room; a young man and I were frequently disturbed by their coming into the room after we were in bed; the first part of the time there was no lock on the door; we had one put on; they frequently wished to be let in before we were up; I have sometimes let them in; the last time I did so, Roberts opened the box, and put some goods in it; one parcel appeared to be like a roll of linen, and the other was tied up in a handkerchief, which he took out of a flag basket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. When you first knew the prisoner he was in the hospital? - A. Yes; the box I understand belonged to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever go by the name of Isaac? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you taken into custody for the these? - A. Yes, I was, being in the room where the things were found.</p>

No; he told me a private house, but he did not tell me where; he told me he would shew me the house in about four or five minutes; I asked him when I was to meet him to go to join them; he told me on Monday, at seven o'clock, at the same house where we were drinking; I laid my cap and cane down in the box we were sitting in, and went over to the watch-house; I told him I had occasion to go out; I went to the watch-house, and the constable went over with me; I told him to take that man into custody; we took him to the watch-house, and I told the constable the same as I have told you now.</p>

               <p>Q. How many people were in the tap-room? - A. I cannot say, I did not take notice.</p>
               <p>Q. Give a guess? - A. I don't suppose there were above four, five, or six.</p>
               <p>Q. What size is the tap-room? - A. Not a very large one.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it as large as this table? - A. Yes, something bigger.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there were five or six persons beside the landlord? - A. The boy brought the beer; I did not see the landlord.</p>

               <p>Q. You say he invited you, and not you him? - A. He invited me; I was going home.</p>
               <p>Q. You had to go back a part of the road? - A. I returned back.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not pay for one pint of the beer yourself? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear he paid for both himself? - A. Yes, I will swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he paid for both before you went for a constable, or after? - A. He paid for them as they came in.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing due when you went out of the house? - A. No; there was about half a pint left of the last pint.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not go to the landlord, and inform him? - A. I did not know there was any occasion, the watch-house was so very handy.</p>
               <p>Q. How are the boxes formed in the room - are they all on one side, or opposite? - A. One opposite to another.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people were in the box opposite to you? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. How many boxes are there? - A. Four.</p>
               <p>Q. And how many people were in them? - A. Five or six; they were in the further corner box.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say the six people were all in one box? - A. I cannot say how many there were; there might be more or less than six.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say there was not company in any box but one? - A. I did not see there was; I know there was one box empty; I will not swear there were people in any other box.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he told you he would take you shortly to a private house? - A. Yes, and I told him I would meet him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you where it was situated? - A. No; he told me he would shew me the house in four or five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not the curiosity to go with him? - A. No, I thought it was a dangerous piece of business at that time of night.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not get some one to go with you? - A. I did not know were the house was.</p>
               <p>Q. You might have gone back without the constable, but have had him in waiting, and have got the prisoner to accompany you to the place? - A. He told the constable he could shew him the house in four or five minutes, as well as he did me.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not communicate what had passed to some of the people? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why? - A. I cannot state any particular reason.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140019"/>Q. The means of detecting the persons belonging to the society, would have been to have gone with him, and to have discovered the house? - A. I did not do that.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the constable asked him whether what you had said was true, and he said he could not deny it - did he not say he could not disprove it? - A. No; he told him he could not deny any thing.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he not say he could not disprove it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that the word was deny? - A. He said he could not deny it, that was the word.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that was the word? - A. I will.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in the regiment? - A. From the 18th of last March; I have been in the army thirteen years, and was in Ireland the last rebellion; I volunteered my services.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not think it very extraordinary, that he, who was a stranger, should take hold of your hand in the way you describe - did you shudder, and draw back? - A. He called for a pint of beer, and asked me to drink with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he told you there were so many people belonging to the society, he asked you if you would hurt him, when, in fact, he had said nothing for which you could hurt him? - A. He asked me to join him before; then he said, I hope you won't hurt me; I told him I would not; if I had told him I would, I should not have got out what I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the watch-house with the constable? - A. Nobody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Were you sober? - A. I was, as I am now.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your only reason for not telling the people in the house, the better to discover the intention of the prisoner? - A. I thought it better to do it; and any man, I think, would do it, or he is no Englishman.</p>

             sworn. - Q. Where do you live? - A. In the Old Artillery Ground, near Spital-fields.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - A. An ale and cyder-merchant.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the soldier who has been examined? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any knowledge of him before the evening of the 23d of July? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to be constable on the night of the 23d of July? - A. I am every Saturday night, and this was Saturday night; he came over to the watch-house about ten minutes before twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. What business did he speak to you about? - A. He asked one of the watchmen for the officer of the night; upon which I arose from my chair.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in your hearing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he desire you to do? - A. To go to a public-house over the way, to take charge of an Irishman.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go to the public-house with him? - A. Immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body in the same box with the man? - A. No; the soldier's cap and cane were laying on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. He came to the watch-house without his cap and cane? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give charge of him there? - A. Yes, and would have given me the particulars there, but I desired him to step over to the watch-house; we went over, and he gave me the particulars.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he state the man to have said to him? - A. He said the Irishman had met him in the street, and asked him where he was going; he asked him if he would go to the public-house, and take part of a pint of beer, which he accordingly did; and while they were drinking the first pint, the Irishman squeezed the soldier's hand, and said, he believed him to be one after his own heart, and begged he would not hurt him if he told him; he told him he would not, and asked him what it was; he said, that it was to join a club which he belonged to, and it should not be a farthing expence to him, if he would go; he asked him what the consistency of the club was; he told him, there were about one hundred and fifty of them to assist Bonaparte when he landed, and that he knew of several other societies besides that.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had said this, did you speak to the prisoner? - A. I asked the prisoner, as the soldier repeated the words, did you say that; he said, yes, I did; I desired the soldier to repeat it over again; he repeated it over three times, and the prisoner said it was right.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner at the bar appear to be sober? - A. I saw no difference in him between him then and the next day, or any other time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the soldier appear to be sober? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After the soldier had related this, did you put any questions to the prisoner? - A. No, nothing more than to know whether he knew it to be true.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he taken before the Magistrate on the Monday? - A. Yes; and he told me, that when he came there, he would tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you any thing explanatory of the business? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What distance is your watch-house from the public-house? - A. It may be thirty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. It was about half past eleven? - A. It wanted about ten minutes to twelve.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140020"/>Q. So that the watchmen did not go out of the watch-house to their round till after twelve? - A. They go every half hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How many watchmen were there in the house at that time? - A. Two.</p>
               <p>Q. They did not go out? - A. They went out almost immediately, while they were telling the story, after the man came back.</p>
               <p>Q. After the man came back, and while he was telling the story, they went out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are sure of? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are also positive there were only two there? - A. Only two.</p>
               <p>Q. You understand my question - they continued there till part of the story had been related? - A. Most likely, part of it.</p>
               <p>Q. If it has been sworn there was nobody there but you, and the witness, Hall, that cannot be true? - A. That never can have been sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. If it has been sworn, it cannot be true? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you asked the man whether what was stated was true, what did he say? - A. He said, yes, it was true.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the expression accurately? - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Then his words were not - I cannot deny it? - A. No, no such thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Are you sure the watchmen were not present during the whole time? - A. They could not be; they might be present during part of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. It has been said this man is an Irishman - is he or not? - A. He says he is.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you learn where the society was held? - A. I did not, I learned where he lodged; I asked him repeatedly where the house was, and he would not give me any answer; the night he was taken, he said it was the other end of the town, in St. Giles's, as I understood.</p>

Yes; and Lawrence bears an excellent character, as I have heard; he is a picture-frame maker; he was at work at the time we went in; I asked him who brought the things; he said that Leary came to him at a public-house, and asked him to lend him his key, to put some things into his room, - that he was afraid of being seized upon, and had got them away.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable: I went with Mrs. Lewis, on the 30th of July, to Lawrence's lodging; he said, it was his own; Leary was standing by the side of the bench, and Lawrence was at work; these two bundles (producing them) were laying on the tool-chest belonging to Lawrence; Lewis said, that is my handkerchief and property; I said to Lawrence, have you any thing more here, and who brought these; he said, that man, meaning Leary; I said, have you nothing more; no, said Lawrence, nothing more that I know of; I went into the bed-room, and found the bed, two blankets, two pillows, and a pair of sheets; I said to Leary, you must go along with me; he began to be a little rumbustical, but I tied his hands together, and searched him, and found a pair of black stockings in his pocket, and a pocket-book; this handkerchief was taken off his neck before the Magistrate, and was sworn to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. What time was it? - A. About nine o'clock; Lawrence was at work.</p>
               <p>Q. The account of Mrs. Lewis is correct? - Yes.(The property produced, and identified by Mrs. Livermore and Mrs. Lewis.)</p>
               <p>Leary's defence was read as follows: - My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, Having an impediment in my speech, and no Counsel or friend to assist me, but what I can adduce to give me a good character, I beg leave to state, that as I was going along, I met two persons, one of whom I knew; I said, I was going to Lawrence's; he said, it would be handy, and would be glad to leave some goods there, as he was going to be seized upon for rent; I went to Lawrence at a public-house, and, got the key of his room; the things were put in, and were to be called for next day, but were not.</p>
               <p>Lawrence called nine witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner coming to your house on the 31st of August? - A. Perfectly well, between four and five in the afternoon; she came to purchase some mourning; she said her husband's mother was dead; she was very difficult in her purchase.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she stay in the shop? - A. An hour and a half to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she buy any thing at last? - A. She purchased as many goods as came to the value of 12l. and upwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she pay you for them? - A. She did not; in the course of conversation, she said her husband kept a wine-vaults in Lime-street; that they had recently purchased the lease, and they had given 370l. for it; she went on to ask me for my custom, and I told her, I had no objection to give her a turn; as soon as the goods were looked out, I went to make out the bill of parcels, and I asked her what name I should make it out in; she told me Mrs. Allen; after that she entered into conversation where she was born, at Newbury, in Berkshire, and mentioned several people that I knew at Newbury; she then said, you may either send the goods home to my house, and I will pay for them, or I am going to Shoreditch to receive 15l. and I will call and pay for them when I come back; she said her mother had been dead about three months; she went away; I told her I should send the goods; I had not the smallest suspicion; I was behind the counter the whole time.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you missed any property? - A. I did not miss it; but as soon as she went out, my nephew, who is an assistant to me, said, uncle, I think that woman has robbed you.</p>
               <p>Q. He is not a partner with you? - A. No; I made answer, that it was impossible she could have robbed me, as I had never been from the counter, and there had been no person in the shop during the time she was there; I did not quit the counter, but my people reached me what I asked for; upon that he went out of doors after her, and in about two or three minutes after I got information from a neighbour's boy that she was stopped by my nephew; she was brought back in about ten minutes; my nephew had hold of her arm; he had the handkerchiefs and muslin in his hand.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140029"/>Q. (To Johnson.) Do you know these things to be your's? - A. Yes, they have my own private mark bot upon the ticket and upon the handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those things in your shop that day? - A. I believe they were; but where there are a hundred or a hundred and fifty handkerchiefs in a bundle, it is impossible for me to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know if you saw them that day? - A. I had not shewn them to any body that day; but to swear I had those handkerchiefs in my shop that day I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you such handkerchiefs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the muslin? - A. The muslin I can swear to, as having shewn her at the time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hart. Q. How many persons were there in your shop? - A. My nephew, myself, and another young man.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that young man here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. She was brought back about seven o'clock? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to put her in custody till eleven o'clock? - A. She requested that I would send to the butcher whom she said she was going to receive 15l from; she kept crying and taking on very much, and I was very much flurried; my customers came in very fast, and I desired her to walk into a back room, where I knew she would be safe.</p>

               <p>Q. All the time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see? - A. I saw her put her hand under her cloak, but I did not see any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the handkerchiefs that day? - A. Yes, I had seen them in the morning, and took particular notice of them; Mr. Johnson had been shewing them afterwards to the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you notice the muslin? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any thing in her hand when she put it under her cloak? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. From that it was that you suspected her? - A. Yes; when she went away I followed her out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep sight of her from the time of her leaving the shop? - A. Yes; I watched her into a pawnbroker's shop in Shoreditch.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she stay there? - A. I don't think she was there above two minutes, if so much; directly that she came out I ran into the pawnbroker's; I came out again, and she was then running.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she see you? - A. No; directly that I came up to her, I told her Mr. Johnson would be glad to speak to her; it was hardly a moment after I came out of the pawnbroker's before I laid hold of her, and as I was bringing her back she dropped the black cotton, but I did not see her drop it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she been looking at black cotton? - A. Yes, she had; soon after I saw her drop the silk handkerchiefs; a gentleman who was behind me picked up the black cotton and the silk handkerchiefs, and gave them to me; I brought her back to our shop, and gave her to Mr. Johnson; I don't know what passed; I had to attend to a customer.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these handkerchiefs? - A. They are ours, and so is the black muslin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. By the cotton that you speak of, you don't mean that muslin? - A. Yes, it is cotton muslin.</p>

               <p>Q. Should you know the cotton again? - A. I never had it in my hand; it appears to be the same cotton; I told her I never took in any black cotton, and then she offered three silk handkerchiefs, and asked me ten shillings upon them; I just gave them a slight look, and said three half crowns; she said that would not do; she took them up very quick, and was out of the shop immediately; Mr. Johnson's nephew came in to know what that lady had offered; I told him, and he went out immediately, and followed her; I went round to the door, and he had overtaken her just before; he brought her back to my door; I saw the black cotton drop from under her cloak upon the pavement; I then called to the young man, and I saw the three silk handkerchiefs in her hand, but did not see her drop them.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner live at the time this happened? - A. At No. 9, Buckeridge-street; I lodged in the same room with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Were both your husbands absent at that time? - A. No, she had her husband with her, and my husband was absent from me; I left the lodgings to go on board a King's ship to see my son; I left all I had in the world with the prisoner, locked up in a trunk, except what I stood upright in.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did the house belong to where she lodged? - A. I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago is it since you went away, and left this trunk in her possession? - A. Four months ago; I locked up what I had in the trunk before her eyes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the trunk contain? - A. There was a tin-box in it in the shape of a nutmeggraser; it had a 15l. note in it, a 10l. note, two twos, and two ones.</p>
               <p>Q. All Bank-notes? - A. Yes; there was a silver milk-pot that my son bought for me, a pair of silver buckles, and all my clothes; I put the tin-box into a tea-chest, and put it into my trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you return from the place where you went to see your son? - A. I think it is ten weeks next Sunday.</p>

               <p>Q. How long were you absent? - A. A month and a week; I found my trunk broke open, and my little trunk tore to pieces; I found three or four gowns in it, and two or three tea-spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner quitted the lodging? - A. Yes, she had run away to her sister's, and she was taken there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had her husband left the lodging too? - A. Her husband had run away; I afterwards saw my tin-box at Box-street; she was apprehended before I came.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Curwood. Q. You lodged with this woman and her husband? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Her husband was at home as well as herself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the husband up? - A. No, he ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not received the sum of 16l. 10s.? - A. It is in hand; the constable has it I dare say.</p>

             sworn. - I live in Whitcomb-street, Leicester-square.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your business? - A. A painter and glazier.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. I saw her at Bow-street; her husband worked with me as a bricklayer's labourer: On the 30th of June, about eight o'clock in the evening, he came to me when the men had left work, to a building I was repairing in Holborn; he had absented himself from me two or three days; I was standing in the passage to look at the building, and this man came down the passage very much in liquor; I asked him what brought him in that situation at such an hour; he said, he was come to take leave of me, he was going to Ireland: that he had taken his place to go the next day, as he was a freeman of the city of Cork, and could earn a guinea a week in Cork; he earned but fifteen or sixteen shillings a week with me; he said he had got money enough, and produced a tin-box that I suppose would hold an ounce of snuff.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the form of a nutmeg-grater? - A. I understand there are some made in that form; he pulled out of the box a one-pound note, and afterwards a 15l. note; I told him I was very sorry to see him with it in the condition he was then in, and recommended his leaving the money with me till the next day, which he did; after exhorting him very much to go home immediately, he promised me he would, and I gave him the notes back again in the box; on his quitting the building he turned the contrary way from home; he turned to go to Snow-hill instead of St. Giles's, where he said he lived; I was sorry I had given him the money when I saw him go the wrong way, and I sent another labourer after him, to tell him I wanted him; after an absence of a few minutes he returned, and to induce him to give it me back, I told him I had a bill to pay that night, if he would lend me the money I would be obliged to him, and he should have it in the morning when he came to work; the man very willingly gave me the money, and on the day following I brought the notes and the box with me to the building, expecting to see him there, and in the yard of the building I found Mr. Wildman, a next door neighbour, who said he had been robbed of a sum of money, which one of my labourers had found; I desired him to go to the Police-office, Hatton-Garden, and make his complaint, and I would attend, and shew the money; an officer of the Police came to me with Mr. Wildman, at the request of the Magistrate, for me to shew him the notes; I shewed the notes and the box to Mr. Wildman, and they proved to be of a much later date than the loss of Mr. Wildman's property; after that a Mr. Keeley, a publican, came the same day.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140031"/>Q. Where does Keeley live? - A. In Buckeridge-street, St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know his name? - A. I believe it is Lawrence; he complained of the robbery that the woman has been describing to you, and requested to have the property, as he had other property of the woman's in his care; I refused to part with the notes out of my hand, but by a course of law; I produced them before Mr. Bond, and by his order I gave them to the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the notes you gave the officer were the same? - A. I marked them the day after I received them; I have kept them always in the tin-box.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner's husband has never returned? - A. I have never seen him since.</p>

               <p>Q. Keeley's own house? - A. I believe it is; Michael Lahey and I searched the house; she was absconded from there; I found upon her bed a white muslin apron, and in a box I found two brass candlesticks, some caps and handkerchiefs; soon after that I heard she was at her sister's lodgings, at No. 6, Buckeridge-street; I went there immediately, and she was in bed; I came out of the room till she had dressed herself, and I took her into custody immediately; I took her to Mr. Keeley's, and she confessed there was a pair of pockets and an apron under the bed where she was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you had that conversation, what was said to her? - A. Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her it would be better for her to confess? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her she would be severely punished if she did not? - A. No; when I took her to Bow-street, she said she did not do it; her husband broke it open; Lahey has got the pockets and the apron; the prisoner was examined at Bow-street; Mr. Parker appeared, and I received from him this tin-box, with a fifteen-pound Bank-note and a one-pound note; I think that was at the second examination. - (Produces them.)</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, and tell us whether you saw him, and when? - A. Yes, that is the man; I never saw him before the 23d of July, on a Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time did you see him, and where? - A. Near upon twelve o'clock at night, in my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he alone? - A. He came alone.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he come for, and what passed between you? - A. He asked me whether I had any thing left; I said I had a little but not much; I pointed to a piece of beef, and asked him if that would do, that it should be sixpence halfpenny a pound, but I would take sixpence, it weighed eight pounds two ounces, I abated the two ounces, and said he should have it for four shillings; he asked me whether I could give him change for a note; I asked him what; he said it was a five pound note; I gave him change in three one pound notes, five seven-shilling-pieces, and a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you gave him change did you make any enquiries of him? - A. Yes; I asked him his name, and he said it was William Biddles, and he lived at No. 23, Drury-lane, and was a button-maker; he gave me the note, and I wrote his name on it; I asked him if it was a good one; and he said, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any request of him respecting the notes you gave him? - A. I asked him to write my name on the notes I gave him, as I had written his name on that note; he made answer, it did not signify, for he dared to say they were all good ones; he said, it was between two or three of them, and he dared to say they were all good ones.</p>
               <p>Q. When he left your shop, did you see which way he turned? - A. I asked him if he would have the meat chopped, because he was going without it being chopped; he said, yes, and I chopped it; he went away, and turned down Holborn-hill way instead of towards Drury-lane, it was directly the contrary way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that raise your suspicion? - A. Yes; I followed him a few yards, when he picked up some sort of lady; I followed him to Turnstile, with the lady and the meat in his hand; my shop is near St. Giles's; he crossed over from Turnstile, and kept on to Brownlow street. I heard him say, the poor fellow will rue this to-morrow, and d - n us, that made me more anxious to give charge of him; I went rather past Gray's-Inn-lane, and saw a watchman almost asleep; I said, I wish you would take charge of this man, I suppose he has given me a bad five pound note; he said he should not go off his beat, and would not take him; the prisoner went on and turned up Brook-street; the woman being with him he did not hear what I said to the watchman. I went on, and saw a watch-box; I asked the watchman to take him into custody; I suppose the lantern made a noise, or something, but they turned into a public-house; we waited for them coming out for some time, but they did not, as the man had gone out at another door.</p>
               <p>Q. You wrote the name the prisoner gave you on the note? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that, (shewing a paper) and say whether it is the note he passed to you? - A. Yes; this is my hand-writing, and there is William Biddles, No. 23, Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you written that address on any othe<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140040"/>note - A. No; I have not had a five pound note lately but that.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you first questioned about this? - A. I paid it away on Monday to Mr. Nott, who is a banker, and takes money for goods; it was returned to me on the Saturday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you applied to by Croker? - A. We went to No. 23; that is, the gentleman and I, who brought the note to me; we could not find such a person; and then we gave information to Croker.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after that was it you next saw the prisoner? - A. Three or four days; I saw him again in a public-house in King-street, Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not in custody at that time? - A. No; I was sent for, and went there, and sat down by him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him again? - A. I knew him again; he went out, and I went after him; he returned in again, and I with him; I then told Croker, and the prisoner was secured.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he passed the note, was Thomas Holstock in the shop? - A. He was in a little accompting-house with a window that sides up, and stood full facing the prisoner as he was standing in the shop, and saw him take the change.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Was the boy before the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you received the note, you wrote the name of the person who uttered it to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was the 23d of July? - A. Yes, I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. If I can read, this is the 26th of July? - A. That is the same note I will swear; those words,"received Gibbs," are not my writing.</p>
               <p>Q. After the man left you, and you heard the conversation, it necessarily excited your suspicion? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The man, whoever he was, absconded? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, he had intimation of the fact that you were in pursuit of him? - A. I imagine so.</p>
               <p>Q. After this you went to Smithfield, though you suspected the note to be a bad one, and offered it? - A. I shewed it to several people, and they said it was a good one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the man to whom you offered it that you suspected it to be a bad one? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the Bank, and communicate any thing there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When they came to enquire after you, then you told this story? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the watchman here you spoke to that night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. We have heard it said, by my learned Friend, in his address, that the man bought a very small piece of meat - eight pounds is a good allowance for a poor man, is it not? - A. I have often sold twenty pounds; but oftener less than more.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it from the time the note was offered to you till you saw Croker? - A. Eight or ten days; they sent Croker to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after that was it when you saw the prisoner at the bar, was it a day or two? - A. Three or four days.</p>
               <p>Q. Croker told you he had apprehended the man who paid you the note? - A. He sent to me to come and look at a man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not add, that he believed he was the man who had uttered the note? - A. I said it was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you again - Did he not add, that he believed he was the man who uttered the note? - A. He said, he thought he had got the man I gave information of; and I said it was the man.</p>

               <p>Q. At this time the man was in some public-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He saw you, did not he, when you spoke to Croker? - A. I did not speak to him at all, I said that was the man. I sat down by the man, and he went out and I followed him; we both returned in together, and I spoke to Croker.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always been as positive to the person of the prisoner as you are to day? - A. I said all along it was the same man.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always said it as positively as you do to day? - A. It is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always said so? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never spoke in doubt of it? - A. I knew it was the same man.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never spoke with doubt, as to the identity of the person? - A. No; I knew it was the same man always.</p>
               <p>Q. And have you always said positively it was the same man? - A. Yes, I always did.</p>
               <p>Q. Remember, you are upon your oath, did you or not, when you were examined before the Magistrate, say, you did not know that the prisoner was the man positively - but if he was not the man, he was extremely like him? - A. Do you mean to say positively you have never said that? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner say, he was surprised you could say so; and did not you make that answer? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Isaac Baxter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you upon the oath you have taken, whether you have never told Baxter that you did not recollect the person of the man? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said any thing to that effect? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never say to him, that if the prisoner was not the person, he was very like him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said to Baxter, that you entertained a doubt, and if it was not for the boy, you could not have sworn to him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You are asked when you put<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140041"/>this note off yourself, whether or not you knew it to be bad - to whom did you pay it? - A. To Mr. Nott.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you known to Mr. Nott? - A. Yes; I do business with him every Monday almost, and have for years.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at all in custody at the time you saw him in King-street? - A. No, perfectly to himself, not in custody at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You followed him upon his leaving the house? - A. Yes, he went to the door just to the step, and came back again.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had attempted to run away, you would have followed him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Isaac Baxter? - A. He is an acquaintance of mine, and I was telling him about the man; I said it was the same man, but I had not sworn to him.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man? - A. Yes, he is the man I am sure.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you take notice of him that night? - A. He held down his head, and looked very downy, and went the wrong way.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think he staid in your master's shop? - A. I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>Q. What did he say to you? - A. He asked whether I was sure that was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that? - A. When the officer took him by the house, and he said; I am sure, that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that is all he said to you? - A. Yes; all he said to me was, mind and be perfect in the man; that is all he said to me; and he said, he was sure to the man.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he not desire you to be perfect to the man? - A. No; he said that was the man, and asked me if I did not think it was the man; I said, yes, I am sure it was the man; when he came by, he asked me to look at him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not your master say, he thought it was the man, and asked you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to recollect it was the 23d if your master did not tell you? - A. I cannot tell the day of the month.</p>

               <p>Q. For both those reasons you took notice of the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you when he left the shop? - A. In the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of it? - A. In the shop.</p>

               <p>Q. You were in the shop when he went away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him going the wrong way? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How could his going the wrong way induce you to take notice of his person? - A. I took particular notice of him, because he would not sign his name to the notes my master gave him; I looked at him two or three times before he went the wrong way.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. You began yourself to have suspicions when he would not sign his name to the notes your master wanted him? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You are an officer belonging to Bow-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call upon Mr. Dear on the 1st of August, in consequence of what you heard from the Bank? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive from him any description of the man from whom the Bank-note was received? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after that did you see the prisoner at the bar? - A. In the afternoon of the same day.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of information you received, did you go to any place to enquire for the lodging of the prisoner? - A. No, not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What place did you go to? - A. To several places in Gray's-inn-lane, and about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Drury-lane? - A. Yes, to No. 28.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with Dear? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. What took place between you and the prisoner at the time you saw him, and where did you see him? - A. I went into a public-house opposite Gray's-inn-lane, at the corner of Middle-row, where I saw the prisoner; he asked me to drink, I declined it; as I was coming out he followed me, and asked me if I did not want a man, describing a man they call Ugly, but whose name is Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask you what you wanted him for? - A. No, I did not let him know I knew the man; he said, he thought he could find him: I asked him if he thought he could, and if I should call upon him where he lodged: he declined telling me where he lodged; I asked him where I should see him, and appointed him to meet me where I live; I asked him when he would come, and whether he would come in the morning following; he said it would not suit him, but he would come on Thursday morning; in the evening I went to Mr. Dear, and told him what had happened, and desired him to meet me on Thursday morning, at ten o'clock, at my place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner that day? - A. Not at the time appointed; it was five or six o'clock in the evening on Thursday; I had been out with Mr. Dear, and after I left him, I met the prisoner; said I, I thought you were to have called upon me this morning; he said, I could not, but I have just been to your house now; I went with him to the Turk's Head, in King-street, Holborn, and took an opportunity of sending for Mr. Dear to come down; when he came in the prisoner walked out of the door; Dear followed him out, and the prisoner came in again.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you at this time acquainted the prisoner with your suspicions of him? - A. No; when the prisoner came in Mr. Dear came in, and called me aside, and said, that was the man; in a little time after the prisoner wanted to go; I told him what was alledged against him, and he denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him where he lodged? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Did he not tell you where he lodged, and did you not go afterwards and search them? - A. He told about a week afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not search him in the public-house? - A. Yes, and found nothing but a dollar upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Which he told you where he had bought, I believe? - A. Yes; he said he had bought it at a silversmith's, which, upon enquiry, I found to be true.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were at the public-house, and the prosecutor came there, he set down by the prisoner? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. He went out a second time, and returned, I believe? - A. No, I don't think he did when he first went out the prosecutor followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came in first? - A. The prisoner did.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not attempt to abscond, or any thing of that sort? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you find his lodging to be at No. 23, Drury-lane? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You went away, and left the prisoner in the house some time, did you not? - A. I only went outside the door.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go out of sight? - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140043"/>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Where was the place he lodged? - A. At the Bell, in Newkener's-street, Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find his lodging to be in Drury-lane? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know him by the name of Biddles? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Newkener's-street is about a hundred yards from the prosecutor's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How many people were there in the public-house when you went in with him? - A. There might be six or seven playing at bumblepuppy in the back-ground; I took him there to engage his attention, while I sent for the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Mr. THOMAS BLISS sworn. - Q. You are an inspector of Bank-notes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that note? - A. It is a counterseit, the whole is a counterseit.</p>
               <p>Q. How is the name of the cashier? - A. It is not our cashier's writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. (To Croker.) When you went to examine whether he purchased the dollar or not, did you not discover he paid by a Bank-not, which turned-out to be a good one? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bliss. We could not ascertain that; we wished to see the note, because Mr. Dear always puts his name on the one-pound notes, and we were in hopes we could trace it.(The note read - No. 2269, dated Bank, 16th of February, 1803.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, I am entirely innocent of the charge. Croker has made the man and boy come round, and swear my life away; he has been with them every day, and told them I was the man. I never was in the man's shop in my life. He wanted me to swear against my wife; he would not swear against me at all when I was before the Magistrate; all he said was, that if I was not the man, I was very much like him.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What are you? - A. A cheesemonger, No. 6, Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you lived there any time? - A. Yes, two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a housekeeper? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prosecutor? - A. Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you known him any length of time? - A. Three quarters of a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. I never saw him before last Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any conversation with Dear about the prisoner? - A. Yes, about six or seven weeks before in my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the habits of visiting each other? - A. Sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say? - A. He came into my house about the Monday or Tuesday after he took the note; said he, a person came into my shop late on Saturday evening, and bought a piece of meat.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether it was the Monday or Tuesday after the note was paid him? - A. I think it was the Tuesday following; he said the person gave him a five-pound note to change; that he changed it, and gave him his address, No. 25, Drury-lane, a button-maker; accordingly I gave him the difference in change in some small notes, and asked him whether he chose to back them; he said, oh! no, it was no consequence, he should soon distribute them amongst his shop-mates; that the man went out, and instead of going to Drury-lane, he turned down Holborn, which led him to suspect the note was a bad one; then he said to his boy, d - n me, Tom, we are done, it is a bad note; accordingly he ordered the boy to take in the meat, and he went after the man. He told me the man crossed over the way, and went down a little below Gray's-inn-lane; that there was a watchman in his box, and he would have given charge of him, but the watchman would not take charge of him, as it was not done in his beat; that he followed the man down Brook-street, when he went into a gin-shop or public-house, where he lost him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say any thing, whether he should be sure of the person, or not, after he lost him - did you ask him whether he should know the man again? - A. He said he saw no more of him; it may be five or six days after; I saw him again, and he said, the note that man gave me is a bad one; I did not hear any thing particular then, but two or three days after, he came into my shop one evening, and said, I have been down to Bow-street, and a person of the name of Croker had apprehended a person on suspicion of being the person who gave him the note; says he, my boy swore to him hard and fast, he knows him to be the same; says I, what do you think of him; says he, if he is not the same, he is very much like him, but he has altered his dress; that is all I heard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. How came you to make your appearance here as a witness for the prisoner? - A. On Wednesday last, two or three friends of the prisoner came past my shop, and said, such a trial was going to take place that day; accordingly I said, I never was at any trial in my life, I should like to go.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them? - A. One of them, by dealing at my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name of that friend? - A. I cannot say; he lives at No. 26, Short's-gardens; it was a woman who asked me to go.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a woman was it? - A. A stout woman.</p>
               <p>Q. One of the friends? - A. Yes; and asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140044"/>me if I would go down to hear it; I said I should like to hear it; I came down with them on Wednesday, and understood it was not to come on that day; upon which, they asked me to go in, and see the prisoner, and I said I had no objection; I went in, and he asked me what I heard pass, and I stated what I have now stated.</p>
               <p>Q. You had before been an acquaintance of Dear's, and knew it was his prosecution - did you state to the prisoner what you heard Dear say? - A. Yes, he asked me what I heard; I told him I knew Dear, and stated what I had heard.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this application you have made your appearance here to-day? - A. Yes; I was asked if I would come forward, and say the same.</p>
               <p>Q. All that you could report to him was, that Dear said if he is not the man, he is very much like him, and the boy has no doubt? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And he told you all the circumstances of the case, as you have stated? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Dear.) You have heard what Baxter has said, that you told him, if he is not the man, he is very like him - did you, or not? - A. I said I was sure it was the man - that he was dressed in a brown great coat, and if I liked, I could swear to the coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever express a doubt? - A. I told Baxter all along I was sure it was the man, if I liked to swear to him, but I did not then, for he had not then been before the Justice.</p>

For that he, being an officer, and servant of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, was entrusted with certain effects belonging to the said Governor and Company, that is to say: a certain paper, partly printed and partly written, upon the credit where of, the said Governor and Company of the Bank of England had advanced a large sum of money, to wit: 500l. which remained unpaid and unsatisfied to the said Governor and Company of the Bank of England the holders thereof. The indictment then set forth the Bill, as also the two other Bills, mentioned in the first Count, and charged that he feloniously did secrete, embezzle, and run away with the same.</p>
               <p>Third Count. The same as the two former Counts, only describing the effects, setting each of them forth as a certain paper, partly printed and partly written, purporting to be a Bill commonly called an Exchequer Bill.</p>
               <p>Fourth Count. The same as the former Counts, only describing the effects, setting each of them forth as a certain paper, partly printed and partly written, upon the credit and security whereof the said Governor and Company of the Bank of England had advanced a large sum of money, to wit: 2500l. which remained unpaid and unsatisfied to the said Governor and Company of the Bank of England.</p>
               <p>Fifth Count. For that he, being such officer as aforesaid, was entrusted with certain effects belonging to the said Governor and Company of the Bank of England, setting forth a Bill, No. 2686, and charging that he feloniously did secrete, embezzle, and run away with the same.</p>
               <p>6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th Counts. The same as the first five Counts, only calling the instruments embezzled securities instead of effects.</p>
               <p>11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th Counts. The same as the first four Counts, but for feloniously secreting and embezzling two of the instruments, namely, those numbered 106l and 2686, and calling them effects.</p>
               <p>15th, 16th, 17th, and 18th Counts. The same as the first four, only calling the two instruments securities instead of effects, against the form of the statute, and against the King's peace.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140050"/>The Hon. Thomas Erskine. My Lords, in point of form I ought to postpone what I am about to state to your Lordships a few moments later, when the instruments which have been so distinctly stated by my learned friend would have been produced in evidence, and then have taken my objection; but I anticipate that; what I am about to say in this stage of the cause will not be considered premature, or at least will not be considered offensive to the Court, because it was not so considered upon a former occasion. I then had the opportunity of making my stand at the same period of the cause that I now make it, upon the same honourable, manly, and candid statement of the Learned Counsel on the part of the Bank that your Lordships have now heard. I agree with my learned friend, Mr. Garrow, that in presenting myself to a Court of Criminal Jurisdiction, in a case of such mighty moment as I admit this to be in point of magnitude, from the evidence that is proposed to be laid before your Lordships, that if we were in a case perfectly new, attended with considerations that required great difficulty in the examination and in the decision, I admit your Lordships might, however hard it may be upon the prisoner in his present anxious situation, in such a case think sit to reserve an opinion, which you could not form upon the argument you have heard to-day, until I have closed every thing I have to offer to your Lordships; and if, when you have heard, as I take it for granted you will hear an answer from my learned friend to what I am about to urge, your Lordships should find yourselves, with all the learning you bring into this place, (and there can be none greater) in no condition to give such a judgment as the public expect, unquestionably then would be the season for your Lordships reserving for further consideration the law belonging to the case; but if I find myself in a case altogether the same with that in which I stood before; if I find that, without perverting every idea I have entertained of criminal justice, the unhappy gentleman at the bar is arraigned for the same offence from which he has already been delivered, and that this indictment only gives the goby to the last in point of mere words, and remains the same upon all the substance of the transaction, I should think the prisoner had a right to complain of us, if we did not, upon this occasion, state why we consider ourselves as precisely in the same condition.</p>

               <p>My Lords, I wish in the first instance, and that is matter of private feeling, to explain what I mean when I say we are precisely in the same case, because it might seem that this kind of preface to what I am about to deliver to your Lordships, looked as if I meant to consider this as a vexatious proceeding, as if I wished to arraign either the want of learning or discrimination in the Learned Counsel, in not having in an earlier period proceeded in this form, or as if I meant to arraign persons whom I greatly honour and respect, who have conducted themselves in a manner perfectly honourable and correct, as it regards the public, who have been guilty of no negligence in their trust, and who have been sufferers by an act from which no human foresight could have delivered them: I consider, therefore, and I am not speaking altogether as a lawyer when I say so, but I take upon me as a man to say,(after the acquittal which is so much in all our memories, and after the facts of the case which are now before us) this is an indictment for the same offence; but the Directors of the Bank of England were determined rather to appear to act with severity towards the prisoner, than with injustice and negligence towards the public; it was decent and fit that there should be none heard to say, if the indictment had been preferred in another form, public justice would have been satisfied; and therefore I do admit that the proceeding is not severe, but proper in every possible respect.</p>
               <p>My Lords, it stands as a fact (and it stood exactly in the same manner before) that the Exchequer-bills, which the defendant is charged with having embezzled, were not Exchequer-bills.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Le Blanc. Not valid Exchequer-bills.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. Not Exchequer-bills. When I had the good fortune upon the former occasion to address the Court, I held in my hand an Act of Parliament, in which these are declared not to be Exchequer-bills; that to have made them Exchequer-bills certain forms were to be observed; that those forms had not been observed, as it has been stated by Mr. Garrow, and therefore Parliament, in its justice, declares they shall be considered valid to all civil purposes, but with this proviso, which is deserving of your Lordships consideration and attention, "Provided always that nothing herein contained shall extend, or be construed to extend, to prejudice or affect in any manner whatsoever any prosecution now depending, or which may be hereafter commenced for, or relating to any act done previous to the passing of this Act, touching, or concerning, or relating to the said Exchequers-bills, or any of them, so as aforesaid signed by the said

            , of his Majesty's Exchequer."</p>
               <p>My Lords, the first distinction I would take between these papers, which are described as purporting to be Exchequer-bills, and which are considered as effects, and which are also considered as securities, is between their being securities of the public upon which the Bank had advanced money, and the securities of private individuals, although I think that will make very little difference.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is not merely money advanced, but both; it is sit that should be understood.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. I put the distinction between the security of a private individual, in which there is any fraud of which that individual might avail himself, and securities to the public. In the case of an individual, if a promissory note was embezzled, the party might wave the objection which the law gave him from its having been altered; for instance, without the leave of the party subsequent to its being executed, from its being without a stamp, or any other informalities that might belong to it, which would enable the party to make a stand against the recovery, though he might wave the objection, and pay the money, it might be argued (though then the argument would come to nothing) that it might be considered as effects, as something valuable, as some benefit of which he had been deprived by its being embezzled or stolen; but, as my learned friend truly expressed himself upon the former trial in his reply, he says, "I must shew that this is an Exchequer-bill, and if it is not an Exchequerbill, for this purpose to make it the subject of a charge<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140051"/>upon an indictment, it is nothing," This is not the case of a private individual, for the moment this Exchequer-bill became no Exchequer-bill, in consequence of the necessary ceremonies not having been performed, from that moment the generosity of Government could have no operation, the justice of Government could have no operation, nor could the Lords of the Treasury make any payment upon it. No man would suppose the Lords of the Treasury would pay it out of their own private pockets, and they could not have charged it to Government. The executive Government of the country could not have been called upon to make the payment, nor could they be justified in making it. There was but one way, therefore, by which these instruments could be made valuable, there was but one way in which they could be made to differ from what my learned friend stated, that they are Exchequer-bills, or nothing - they are waste paper, or they are valuable to the extent they purport to be. It could only be done by Act of Parliament; as it has been done by Act of Parliament, it was Parliament alone that could give existence, not validity, (for validity is something that by making an addition to it may render it effectual) but it was Parliament alone that could give existence to the instruments now proposed to be put in evidence before your Lordships; and to deprive my learned friend of the argument that, Parliament might be expected to do it, or that Parliament would do it, or the anticipation that Parliament must do it, that that could make them be considered by retrospect as valuable ab origine in the hands of the Bank. This humane proviso is introduced, this Act of Parliament in making these papers any thing else but waste paper that I have described them, and which they were described to be by my learned friend upon the former occasion, in order to extinguish the argument in its birth, and to destroy every appearance of an ex post facto law, has declared, that they shall be for all civil purposes Exchequer-bills, and not only have Parliament cautiously put it for civil purposes, but they have introduced this proviso, "that nothing herein contained shall extend, or be construed to extend, to prejudice in any manner whatsoever any prosecution now depending, or which may be hereafter commenced:" that is to say, the whole would have been waste paper before the passing of this Act; but which, by the passing of this Act, becomes a security ab origine, but for the purposes of prosecution, it is a piece of waste paper, upon which you could not count in petty iarceny, which does not come up to the extent of any denomination which can constitute value, and therefore your Lordships will consider it, as far as relates to my client, as if this Act had never passed; that they are not Exchequer-bills as they relate to the unhappy gentleman at the bar. It may be said that Mr. Aslett received money upon them, and that when he disposed of them to his own advantage, he treated them as things that were valuable. The answer I give to that is, that but for this Act, which is still not in my way, it would have been money had and received by Mr. Aslett, to the use of those persons who advanced the money. I will endeavour to make your Lordships understand in a very few words the light in which I consider it: The prisoner is indicted upon the statute of the 15th year of his late Majesty's reign, and it was intended, in consequence of the momentous concerns of the Bank, (as it was correctly stated by Mr. Garrow) to give them a protection, which the law gave to no private individual till the 39th of the present King, chap. 85, in consequence of Beasley's case; so that your Lordships observe between the 15th of George II. and the 39th of his present Majesty's reign, that in all that long interval Parliament never thought of giving to private men the security it had given to the Bank; and at last did it only upon the spur of the particular occasion, urged and goaded on by the escape of a notorious offender, who could not be brought within the reach of the law. Then can it be doubted for a moment what the construction of this Act was? The Legislature said this, the Bank is charged with mighty concerns; it has in its care and its custody vast revenues; it is obliged to place that considence in their servants, which my learned friend with so much humanity was pleased to say (and I honour him for it) had been faithfully administered by the unhappy prisoner at the bar for five-and-twenty years; who had been entrusted with hundreds of millions floating before his eyes, without even the wish to appropriate a farthing of it to his own use. The words used in this Act of Parliament therefore are, any dividend-warrant, bond, deed, or any security, money, or other effects. In order to fortify the construction, I take the liberty of putting to your Lordships, not for the purpose of this indictment, but because I can put no other, Parliament, looking at the great securities which the Bank are possessed of, the deeds they have, the dividend-warrants they have, the bullion they have, the bonds, securities, and money they have, add the words, "other effects," by which can only be meant other valuable effects, other chattels, other things, which, if they were stolen, at the common law would have been a larceny, not something, which, if it be no security, is nothing, not that which I say could not be worth a farthing. I say it could not be the intention of this Act of Parliament, that while a servant of your Lordships, entrusted with your plate, with your jewels, with all that is valuable, and the loss and embezzlement of which might have reduced your Lordships to considerable difficulties in your families, he shall be only guilty of a misdemeanour; while a servant of the Bank, who has secreted a pen worn down to the stump, or half a sheet of paper loose in the office, would be within this law; or that Parliament, in using the words" other effects," could mean any thing else than those kind of effects to which the law gives the sanction of criminal justice to protect the property of private individuals; and, therefore, unless it can be made out that this is the meaning of the Act of Parliament, this prosecution must fail. In the first place, is this a security? It is a security for civil purposes. Would it have been a security for civil purposes without an Act of Parliament? Certainly it was not only no security, but it could not be recovered against a private individual, and the purse of the people could only be open to Parliament.

            . In Mr. East's late valuable book, which he has given to the profession, page 597, compiled from Hawkins's Pleas of the Crown, your Lordships will find this laid down as the reason of that statute having been passed, "In order to make the stealing of goods felony, they ought to have some worth in themselves, and not merely from their relation to some other thing, and therefore bonds, bills, notes, and other securities, which concern mere choses in action, were not the subjects of larceny at common law." Why were they not the subjects of larceny at common law? Because you could not count upon their value, but by connecting them with their value as securities. Suppose a man had stolen 50,000l. in Bank-notes which were cancelled, I do not believe there ever was an indictment for stealing them as paper.</p>

               <p>Mr. Justice Le Blanc. You are likening it to a case which was brought before the Judges, and never decided.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. My Lord, I do not mean to build upon a case which was considered of sufficient magnitude to be brought before the Judges, and which going off upon another point did not call for any decision; but in the case of Sutton v. Johnstone, in the House of Lords, it was held a strong reason why an action for a malicious prosecution could not be maintained against a superior officer, because there was no instance in which such a doctrine had been held, My Lord, here the statute law, supplying the defects of the common law, makes it for the first time a felony to steal a security, which could not have been considered as a chattel, though it might be of some imaginary value; but it may be said, that by getting a number of them together, it might become a petty larceny. But give me leave to ask, if your Lordships can conceive it to be the construction of this Act of Parliament, that if a person takes a thing as a security, which turns out to be no security at all, that that is "effects" in the contemplation of the Legislature at the time this highly penal statute passed? Can it be supposed that Parliament, when they passed this Act on account of the magnitude of the concerns of the Bank, meant to put your Lordship in this situation to say, that the stealing of a pen or a sheet of paper might be considered as effects within this statute? My Lord, there is one great stay to the human mind in this argument, and it is this, suppose this was a loose sheet of paper, suppose it had been no security at all, suppose it to have been distinctly what I have stated it to be, and what it only is, except by the authority of this Act, would my learned friends call it effects? No, and therefore they are obliged to mix it in your Lordship's mind, as being connected with value, as being considered by the prisoner as value, as having been made use of by him as value, and as having received that for it which was a valuable consideration, then your Lordships can only look at it in that aspect, by considering it as a security, and your Lordships will say whether it is a security upon which any action could have been brought, or for which any demand could have been made by any living being; and in a penal case like this, when your Lordships are to put the true construction upon this Act of Parliament, it will be necessary to come to a decision that will cover other cases; and, therefore, I say, this is not a case worthy of your Lordships wisdom to reserve: I say it is either a case in which your Lordships will decide against me and against the prisoner, and execute the law upon him; or else it is a case in which I have a right humbly to ask your Lordships to deliver him from the charge, as the other Learned Judges delivered him from the former. Surely, my Lords, it is very little consonant with the wife principles of British justice, where, if the bills of indictment had been the same, he could have pleaded autrefois acquit; that the law should be different, though the act is the same; and I sit down with repeating, that in my opinion and belief this prosecution is a determination on the part of the Bank not to suffer any man living to whisper away their reputation, by saying they fell one iota short of that which the law of the land entitled them to carry into effect against the prisoner; and there is another reason for thinking so; the moment Mr. Aslett was acquitted, he was detained for debt, though the Grand Jury were at that time fitting, and they could have preferred another Bill.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Le Blanc. That can have no effect as to the point of law.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. Certainly not, my Lord, but it shews that this did not at that time occur to the great learning with which the Bank are assisted, and there is none greater, at least that I am acquainted with, except as it exists with your Lordships on the Bench. I trust, therefore, this prosecution will take the same course it did at the former Session, and that your Lordships will be of opinion this indictment cannot be maintained.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Best followed Mr. Erskine on the same side.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow rose to reply, but was interrupted by</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Le Blanc. As it strikes me and my Brother, both as it respects the public and the prisoner, I should think it quite sufficient that either party should wish it to be submitted to the Jury. I was desirous of hearing every thing which ingenuity could alledge on the other side, in order to see whether any doubt that existed in my mind could be removed; but I confess it does not appear to me the clear case that it has been represented to be. The question turns upon this, whether, in the construction of this Act of Parliament, in which this general term "effects" is used, we can give that limited construction to the word "effects," as to say it shall not extend to any thing but that which is in itself of intrinsic value. The word securities as well as effects is used; but it will turn more upon the word effects, because that is the largest and most extended word. When it is compared with cases of larceny, it deserves a very different consideration; here it is not made a larceny, but the person is made guilty of felony, and therefore perhaps there is not so much analogy between the cases. At present, sitting here, I do not profess to be of opinion that every thing which is not in itself of value, or which cannot be called a security, does not come within the protection of the Act. I am, therefore, of opinion the trial should proceed.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the money business of the Bank intrusted to his care? - A. A good deal of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When the Bank has occasion to purchase Exchequer-bills, who was in the habit of giving the orders for the payment of those bills? - A. Either Mr. Aslett or myself.</p>
               <p>Q. When the Bank purchase Exchequer-bills in the market, who is the person that makes out the orders for the payment of those bills? - A. Mr. Aslett, or myself, signs an order for the payment of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these purchases kept in any book for that purpose? - A. Yes, there are three or four books, the bought book is one.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the person that principally kept the bought book? - A. It is sometimes entered into by one clerk, and sometimes by another, which ever happened to be at leisure, but I believe Mr. Kiddell, principally.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any suspicion, or have you any more doubt, than that you are now a witness under examination, that his whole conduct was faithful? - A. I believe, entirely so.</p>

               <p>Q. Your knowledge of the receipt of it, must have come either from Mr. Moxon or your books? - A. I am sure it was paid, because otherwise I must have been indebted to Government 85,000l.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know, except from the information of some other person, or your books, that it has been paid? - A. Yes, because we paid away the same money again.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you make out any order for the payment of 85,000l. Exchequer-bills? - A. I did.</p>

               <p>Q. How does he make the comparison? - A. He compares the total amount of the bill of parcels, with the order it is cast up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it your course to take the bill of parcels, and the Exchequer-bills, and the order to Mr. Aslett for signature? - A. Generally, not always.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mean that you did it when you wrote out the order? - A. Yes, I generally counted over the bill of parcels to see that it corresponded.</p>
               <p>Q. And did you take it to Mr. Aslett with the order for signature? - A. Generally.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enter the particulars of those bills so brought in a book, which is called the bought book? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Whenever you wrote the order for the payment of the money, did you examine the bill of parcels? - A. Generally, but sometimes another person counted the bills while I wrote the order, when we have had a great many. (The bought book shewn to the witness.)</p>
               <p>Q. Is that your hand-writing? - A. Yes, it is.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you make that entry from a comparison with the bills? - A. It is a copy of the bill of parcels.</p>
               <p>Q. After the order is given for the payment of the money, what do you do with the bills? - A. They are then given up to Mr. Aslett, or Mr. Newland.</p>
               <p>Q. What is done with the bills then? - A. They were generally counted up afterwards by Mr. Aslett, or Mr. Newland, and deposited in the chest kept for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that chest in the Cashier's-office? - A. Yes, in an interior room.</p>
               <p>Q. That bought book is also kept in the Cashier's-office, I believe? - A. Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. When those bills accomulate to a large amount, are they taken from the chest? - A. Yes, they are taken from the chest and delivered to the gentlemen in the parlour; they have sometimes been deposited as they have been bought, but of late they have been made up in large parcels, and delivered in very large parcels indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the mode of making up that parcel? - A. We used to deposit them according to the number of bills for the day, but since the bills have increased, they have been done up in sums of 1000l. or so on, they are wrapped in a cover with the amount generally endorsed upon it, and the date when deposited.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any description of the class of the bills upon the invelope? - A. Yes, always, whatever is the heading of the Exchequer-bill, for whatever services it may be.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose duty was it to take it from the chest to the parlour? - A. Either Mr. Newland or Mr. Aslett.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I understand that the order was generally taken by you, but in the case of the present business, it might be done by another person? - A. It might.</p>
               <p>Q. And you are quite sure your account of them is taken from the bills of parcels every time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You merely copy the bills of parcels? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any recollection of the Exchequerbills, accompanying this bill of parcels? - A. No farther than the day-book entry shews it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that day-book entry made by yourself? - A. Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. From the bill of parcels? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Giles. (To Mr. Cole, junr.) Q. Though you cannot at present recollect whether you or some other person received this money, should you have made this entry in the book, if you had not known it had been received? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mr. Eade.) Look at the back of this bill of parcels - whose hand-writing is that? - A. The hand-writing of one of the clerks in the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the other; do you know whose handwriting that is? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mr. Templeman.) Have you any demand upon the Bank now for these Bills? - A. No; the money has been received by one of the house, but which I do not know.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Erskine. Q. You don't know it of your own knowledge? - A. I have no reason to doubt it, on account of our cash agreeing at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive the money? - A. I cannot say; either Mr. Goldsmid or myself received it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you yourself deliver those bills to the Bank? - A. I cannot say that I myself delivered them.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor do you know, of your own knowledge, that they were delivered? - A. I made up the bill of parcels.</p>
               <p>Mr. Giles. Q. Look at that order - was that the order given for the bills contained in that bill of parcels? - A. It is the same amount.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. (To Mr. Kiddell.) Q. Look at that order, (the order of 
               <persName id="t18030914-86-person727">Cole</persName>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140056"/>Q. Have you entered the bills delivered with this bill of parcels in the bought book? - A. (Refers to it.) They are my entry in the book; it is a copy of the bills of parcels.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those compared with the bills? - A. I can say I compared one of them, because it has my initials.</p>
               <p>Q. Which is that? - A. 15,000l. I am sure we received of Messrs. Cole and Templeman 15,000l. of the description in this bill of parcels.</p>
               <p>Q. And were they paid for by that order? - A. They were paid for by this order.</p>
               <p>Q. When you made out an order of that sort, and took it to Mr. Aslett for signature, what did you do with it after he had signed it? - A. It was generally given to Mr. Cole, to apply at another office to receive the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any mark made upon the order at that office to denote the payment of it after it is paid? - A. There is no mark upon this order; we always answer the draft as soon as we pay it, by crossing the name.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that so crossed? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at that, (the other order), and see if it is so cancelled? - A. Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon looking at these documents, and your bought book, have you any doubt that all these bills were brought into the Bank and paid for? - A. I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. By the order of Mr. Aslett? - A. By the order of Mr. Aslett.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Best. Q. The bought book is a mere copy of the bill of parcels, and not copied from the Exchequer-bills? - A. It is a copy.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not compare that with the bills themselves? - A. Certainly, the numbers and amounts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, compare the numbers and amounts with the bills themselves? - A. They are compared, but not at all times, by the person who makes the entry.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, just now, from the press of business another person might do it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that frequently happen? - A. It has happened several times.</p>
               <p>Q. It might have happened in this instance? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon yourself to swear you saw these specific bills with the numbers upon them? - A. The 15,000l. I can positively.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is that one of the bills of parcels of Cole and Templeman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Giles. Q. Was it the duty of Mr. Aslett, before he gave these orders, to examine the bills, and to see that they were right? - A. It was his duty.</p>
               <p>Q. And was that done? - A. I cannot say he generally counted the bills after I had given him the order to sign.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you mean that he counted over the amount of the bill of parcels, or examined the bills themselves? - A. The bills themselves generally, but I believe not always.</p>
               <p>Mr. COLE, sen. sworn. - Examined by Mr. Giles. Q. Look at that bill of parcels, (shewing him, another), have you signed that? - A. Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of those Exchequer-bills having been sold at the Bank? - A. I certainly know that.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that order annexed to it - are you acquainted with the hand-writing of Mr. Aslett? - A. Very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that order signed by him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these Exchequer-bills paid for by that order? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have no demand upon the Bank for these Exchequer-bills? - A. I cannot say that I received it myself, but some of the firm did; I generally received the orders from the Governor himself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You don't mean that you delivered the bills with your own hand? - A. No; I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Giles. Q. You signed the bill of parcels? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Giles. (To Mr. Kiddell.) Q. Refer to the bought book, and see if you have entered that bill of parcels bought of Cole and Templeman on the 14th of December? - A. Yes, I have entered them.</p>
               <p>Q. That bought book was kept in the Cashier's office? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you write out the order for the payment of those bills? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that signed by Mr. Aslett? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that appear to have been paid? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. From the course of the Cashier's office, could a description of those bills have found their way into your bought book, unless they had been brought into the office? - A. I am well convinced these bills were brought into the Bank, because I examined them.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the amount? - A. 10,055l.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Do you mean that you compared, in that instance, the bill of parcels with the bills themselves? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As to numbers as well as sums? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know? - A. By my checking the bills of parcels.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that bills to these amounts came into the Bank that day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But do you mean to state positively, that the bill No. 562, for instance, or any other number, came into the Bank that day? - A. No, I did not look at the number; it is the general practice to read the numbers of the bills to the bill of parcels, but I cannot positively swear it was done in that instance.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you present on the 26th of February, assisted by Mr. Smith, another Director, - I will refresh your memory by giving you the book (hands it to him)? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it the duty of the Directors of the day, to receive, in that parlour, any Exchequer-bills that may be brought there for deposit from the Cashier's office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom were they generally brought? - A. Generally by Mr. Aslett.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon looking at that book, which is signed by yourself and Mr. Smith, are you able to say whether Mr. Aslett was the person who brought in Exchequer-bills upon that day? - A. The entry is his hand-writing: and I could almost positively say it was him, for I do not recollect for some time any one else coming into the parlour; certainly not when I was in waiting.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any person in the course of bringing them, except Mr. Newland and Mr. Aslett? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way are Exchequer-bills brought, for the purpose of being deposited in the strong closet? - A. In bundles, inclosed in a case, a paper enveloped containing the number and amount.</p>
               <p>Q. When they are brought in, is that book produced to the Directors, to compare the parcels with the entry? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When that is done, what becomes of the Exchequer-bills? - A. They are put by in the iron closet in their covers.</p>
               <p>Q. That closet has three separate locks? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can that be resorted to for the purpose of taking out its contents, but in the presence of two Directors? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. As you signed the entry of that day, you can state to us whether all the parcels of Exchequer-bills, that were brought in and examined by you that day, were safely put into the strong closet? - A. I believe they were examined by me and Mr. Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. When they are so deposited, these bought bills remain there till they are redeemed by the Government? - A. They do.</p>
               <p>Q. Turn to your entry - it will appear, I believe, as if four separate parcels had been brought in that day? - A. It does so appear.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the first parcel import to be a parcel of 200,000l.? - A. The first appears to be a parcel of 200,000l.</p>
               <p>Q. For what service? - A. The supply of 1802.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing that parcel to have been brought in upon that day, and with the others, to have been deposited in the strong closet, must it have remained there till the month of April following? - A. I apprehend it must, unless it was stolen out.</p>

               <p>Q. You are largely concerned in the purchase and sale of Government securities? - A. Frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar, Mr. Aslett? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any application to you in the month of March last? - A. On the 14th of March, Mr. Aslett came to me to know if I would make a purchase in the Stocks, as he and some friends intended to have a speculation; I told him it was a time when I thought there would be a very great variation in the Stocks, which might make it rather a matter of hazard; he told me I should be perfectly safe if he gave me security; he accordingly the next day gave me an order to buy 50,000l. Consols. for the approaching account, that was to be in a few days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. A purchase for time? - A. A purchase for time; he asked me what difference I thought there would be in the Stocks; I told him I thought there might be from five to six per cent. fluctuation; he then said, he would give me 3000l. Exchequer-bills for the whole, which would cover the loss of six per cent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he in consequence of that make any deposit of Exchequer-bills? - A. He deposited three Exchequer-bills with me of 1000l. each.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these, and tell me if they are the three Exchequer-bills he deposited with you? - A. These are the three.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. There is only one of them charged in this indictment, the one No. 2694.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence, of this transaction, did you at any time go to the Bank? - A. I sold that stock again to Mr. Aslett, and in fact bought and sold it three times over.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the transactions growing out of this deposit, did you go to the Bank? - A. Yes, I did.</p>

            , Esq. sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. You are the Deputy Governor of the Bank? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Bish at any time make any communication to you of any circumstances which induced you to see Mr. Aslett? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as state what passed between you and Mr. Aslett upon that occasion? - A. On the 9th of April, about twelve or one o'clock, I sent for Mr. Aslett and Mr. Newland; I began by asking Mr. Aslett what was the mode of taking the account of Exchequer-bills; I asked him whether it was possible, after the Exchequer-bills that we had purchased were either traced to Mr. Newland's iron chest, or removed from the iron chest to our parlour, that any of those bills could get out of the Bank again; he said, he believed it was not; I then told him, that nevertheless it appeared to me in proof, that there were bills out of the Bank that had been purchased by the Bank, and that were the property of the Bank; I told him I must go one step farther, and say, and I was very sorry to say it, that he, Mr. Aslett, was suspected of being the cause of their being so out of the Bank. I asked him then if he knew Mr. Bish; he said he did; I asked him whether he had placed any Exchequer-bills in the hands of Mr. Bish; he said he had, but that they were not the property of the Bank; he was then asked whose property they were; whether that question was asked him by myself or Mr. Watson, I am not sure; he said he had rather be excused mentioning names, but shortly after he did mention the name, and said, they were the property of Mr. Hosier.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he give any description of Mr. Hosier? - A. I do not recollect that he did; I think we then sent for Mr. Bish, and I think it was about that period of our conversation that Mr. Watson said, Mr. Aslett, I think it my duty as a Magistrate to tell you that you are not obliged to answer any questions, the answers to which you may think will tend to criminate yourself. Mr. Bish then came into the room, and stated to us what he has just now stated, that he was applied to by Mr. Aslett to engage in a speculation of about 50,000l. that he declined it, because there might be a fall in the Stocks, and that Mr. Aslett proposed securing him by a deposit of 3000l. When we had heard this, Mr. Watson told Mr. Aslett he was under the necessity of committing him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect in the course of that conversation any reference to the bought-book? - A. We had the bought-book in, in order to find out whether those Exchequer-bills at Mr. Bish's were really our property.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was directed to turn to the boughtbook to obtain that information? - A. We had the bought-book there, and were looking over the bought-book to find the numbers; we had two books in, and could not find them; then we had a third book in.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought in that book? - A. I believe Mr. Aslett.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it that turned to the first and second bought-book? - A. I think Mr. Watson; Mr. Newland-said, there is another book, Mr. Aslett, you had better go and bring it; Mr. Aslett went from the room where we were, and returned a little while after with the third book, and when he brought that third book, Mr. Watson opened it, and discovered the numbers, and then we saw that they were the same; Mr. Aslett said, he had no doubt if he could be permitted to go to his own house instead of being sent to the Compter, he should be able to clear up every thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present on the Monday when Mr. Aslett's desk was broke open? - A. I was not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Erskine. Q. How long have you known Mr. Aslett? - A. Ever since I have been one of the Directors of the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not his conduct perfectly correct up to this time? - A. I think no clerk could be more so; he was very much esteemed, very civil and complaisant to every one; we all regarded him very much.</p>
               <p>Q. In this confidential situation, I need hardly ask whether he had not daily opportunities of embezzling the property of the Bank to a very great amount? - A. He had great opportunities certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. And before this time no suspicion fell upon him? - A. I believe none, I am sure none with me; his knowledge was very extensive; he knew more of the business of the Bank than any other clerk in the Bank.</p>
               <p>BROOK WATSON, Esq. sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. Were you in waiting at the Bank in the month of April last? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. According to your recollection, has the conversation been correctly stated by the Deputy Governor? - A. The Deputy Governor has correctly stated it, with the exception of Mr. Aslett being sent out for the third book; to the best of my recollection the books were all there; that is, they were all brought in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to recollect whether, in speaking of Mr. Hosier, Mr. Aslett gave any description from which you knew what Mr. Hosier he was speaking of? - A. Mr. Aslett, speaking of Mr. Hosier, said, he was a partner in the house of Mr. Morland, the banker.</p>
               <p>Mr. Winthrop. When Mr. Aslett went out for the third book, the Governors said, we shall never see him any more; I expected he would go to his own office, take his hat, and go off; that was the impression upon my mind at the time.</p>

               <p>Q. Does that paper contain any Exchequer-bills found in that desk? - A. Yes; I gave it to Mr. Hess immediately, and desired him to make a list, which he did in my presence; he returned the list and its contents to me, No. 109; it contained Exchequer-bills to the value of 16,000l.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in your presence compared with the list Mr. Hess made? - A. No; I carried them into the parlour, and delivered them to Mr. Watson.</p>

               <p>Q. After he had given you out the bundle on the Saturday, did he lock the desk, and did you find it locked on the Monday? - A. It was locked when I saw Mr. Bodington come to it on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. (To Hess.) Q. Whose desk was it out of which the 16,000l. Exchequer-bills were taken? - A. Mr. Aslett's; it was the inner seat of two in the Office.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any other person access to that desk but himself? - A. I never knew of any body.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom did you receive that bundle of 16,000l.? - A. I saw Mr. Bodington put his hand upon the envelope, and I then lost fight of them; but in the course of two minutes they were put into my hand by Mr. Bodington.</p>

I do not recollect that I have examined it since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. (To Mr. Hess.) Q. After this matter was discovered, did you examine the different parcels of Exchequer-bills deposited in the parlour, to see whether you could find this entry of 200,000l.? - A. It was done in my presence by the Directors some days afterwards.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. They were missing, according to the Directors book? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. I believe you had occasion to attend the Directors in the parlour? - A. Very seldom; at that time I was not in a situation that required my attendance in general upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever, in their presence, access to the strong closet? - A. Never, till this circumstance.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Mr. Winthrop.) Q. From<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140060"/>what you have said of Mr. Aslett's situation, I presume he had frequent occasion to attend you, and the other Directors, in the parlour? - A. Very often.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Mr. Aslett ever access to that strong closet, in the presence of you, or any other Directors? - A. When he has brought in Exchequer-bills, he has deposited them in the closet, I believe, very often.</p>

               <p>Q. Were any other things, beside Exchequer-bills, deposited in that closet? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. In the interval of some months, Mr. Aslett must have frequent access to that closet? - A. Yes, in the presence of the Directors.</p>

               <p>Q. Had any person ever access to that closet, without two or three Directors being present? - A. I think not; such a thing never did occur, I believe, and never ought to occur.</p>
               <p>Q. It has never been left open? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. STEWART sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. Were you a clerk in the Cashier's office, on the 26th of February? - A. I was.</p>

               <p>Q. You have told the Jury, that in making the entries in the bought-book, when it came to you to make them, you did not always look at the bills themselves, but at the bills of parcels? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I desire to know whether you can swear positively that you saw the bill No. 2694, when you made the entry, or that you did not make the entry from the bills of parcels, and which, if the entries are correct, ought to correspond? - A. I cannot swear to it.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you swear, that in making that entry, you made it from your own occular inspection of the bill, or whether you did no more than make the entry from the bill of parcels, which ought to correspond with the contents? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Look to the 14th of December, 1802, you will find NO. 1061; I ask you the same question as to that? - A. I wish to see the bill of parcels,(looks at it;) yes, I examined the bills with this myself, I cannot swear whether I did the others or not.</p>

               <p>Q. With regard to the others, have you any doubt they were the property of the Bank? - A. I have not the least doubt they were.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. Q. When you counted the bills, did you examine them? - A. No, we took care that the amount corresponded.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you had occular inspection of the bill, and saw No. 1061? - A. I have not the least doubt but I counted the bills, and they amounted to the sum.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you examine that bill as to the amount, or only the numbers of them? - A. That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. You have said, that with regard to the bill of parcels, you had no doubt you examined it with the entry? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In what respect? - A. As to the amount.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you find the amount in the invoice correctly entered in the bought-book? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Do you find No. 2692? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nos. 2693 and 2694? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you are enabled to say those three numbers do not constitute any part of those lent by your partner to the prisoner? - A. No, positively.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. That is the case on the part of the prosecution.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. I understand it is admitted otherwise, I shall call Mr. Jennings to prove they are not bills legally signed by him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I take it, as admitted, that he was not legally authorized to sign those bills at the time they were issued; that he had no legal authority to sign them.</p>
               <p>Court. That ought to stand upon the evidence - I will take it upon the admission.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you give it him? - A. No; I threw it down upon the ground, he stooped to pick it up, and I made off for Kingsland; I thought he was coming after me, I looked round, and saw him running away; I turned back, and cried stop thief, murder.</p>

Yes; he asked me for more, when I threw the money down; I said I had no more; he asked me for a seven-shilling-piece; I said, I have got no seven-shilling-piece, you villain; that was all that passed till I called stop thief.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon after was he taken? - A. I believe, about five minutes afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him about five minutes afterwards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mark upon your money by which you could know it? - A. NO.</p>

               <p>Q. When you took him, did you observe him do any thing? - A. In the scussle we tumbled both together; he had got one of his hands shut, we were going to lay hold of his hand, when he drew his hand back, and threw some money against the pales; I immediately picked up a sixpence, a young man got over the pales and gave me a half-crown over, I saw him pick it up.</p>

He had not an opportunity; I collared him, and Atwell pushed out of his own house immediately and assisted me; I saw his hand closed, I said to Atwell, he has got something in his hand; I endeavoured to open his hand, and he threw himself upon the ground in the struggle; Atwell then left me and picked up some money, while I held the prisoner upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing else picked up? - A. No, I did not; I heard of a half-crown being picked up, but I did not see it; I did not see the knife taken from him, but I saw the sheath; he said, you may as well take this with it; that was while I held him by the collar.</p>

               <p>Q. Relate what you heard? - A. she was washing some small things for her family; you are d-d busy you bl-d b-h, were the first words I heard; she said, there are two nice cauliflowers, my dear, shall I boil them for dinner; he made answer, what do you think, you bl-d whore; upon which a violent noise ensued of blows, I heard no one scream out but the eldest daughter, who cried out you have killed her, you have killed her; I thought she meant the second daughter, because he has vowed he would take her life; I was frightened, went down stairs, and found it was his wife, when I saw the blood on her face, and that it had flew as far as the step outside the door; the prisoner was in the house, and said he would have dinner dressed by twelve o'clock, he repeated it I don't know how many times; and she said I will.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this after the blow? - A. Yes; he then went away, and came back exactly at twelve o'clock; I durst not go in while he was gone fearing he should come, but I talked to her through the window; when he returned, he swore he would cut her bl-y liver and tongue out, and would not rest till he had murdered her and the children. I met her father, and told him not to go in, for that the prisoner would kill him, as he had often threatened. I saw the deceased afterwards brought out like a dead woman, immediately as her father and others went in; she could not speak or do any thing, her face was so dreadfully cut; she was held up in a chair, and some time after she came to herself, and said she had got her death blow from her husband: her nose was driven on one side upon her face by a blow.</p>
               <p>Q. From all that you had an opportunity of observing, and from what she said, did she consider herself in a dying state? - A. Yes; from the 31st of July, she always said she should die, for that she had received her death blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her often? - A. Every day, and many times in the day: this was the way she stood,(putting her hands on the left side and stomach), she said, I am so hurt, and crushed inside, that I cannot live, he kicked me for with his shoe; that he stamped on her stomach in the passage, on the 31st of July, and knocked her down on this candlestick,(producing a flat japanned candlestick), which broke under her body in the fall, and run up her private parts.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether she said any thing else? - A. No; she always said she should not live; that is all I particularly recollect.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see her on the 2d of August? - A. Yes; I had been to market, and was going to call on my daughter to leave her what little portion I could afford, and when I got within ten yards of the door, somebody said, run, run, for the villain is murdering your daughter; I went in, in a great hurry, and saw her on the floor, and he laying down on her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body in the house beside? - A. There was one of the children, the other run out for a constable; Mary-Ann was in the room, who is near twelve years of age. I cannot tell whether the prisoner knelt on the floor or on his wife, but I pulled him up with all my strength.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she able to stir, or call out? - A. I cannot tell for my confusion; I pulled her up in a hurry into the passage, some men pulled him from her; I took her in my arms, and she dropped down on the floor like a log of wood.</p>
               <p>Q. After you got him from her, did you see him do any thing to her? - A. He punched at her with his foot and knee, as they dragged him from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see what part of her body he punched? - A. No, I was in too much confusion; in about ten or fifteen minutes she came to herself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him about it? - A. I said he had finished the job he had often promised to do; and he said, I'll finish your job too; I have heard him say many times, he never would rest satisfied till he had murdered her and me too.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that what you meant, when you said, now you have finished the job you have often promised to do? - A. Yes; and he said he would finish me too.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the fight of your daughter that he said it? - A. Yes; but she was insensible. They had him out at the door, and it was all confusion.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see your daughter from time to time after this? - A. Yes; every day till the day she died.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe she thought herself a dying woman? - A. Most certainly she did; when they took her out of the room into the street, there was a mob of about fifty people; she was like a corpse for some time. The prisoner came back again (for they had let him go), he came back again in half an hour; and when the alarm was made that he was coming, I was ready to lay hold of him; he came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140065"/>in, and said, he would have my heart's blood, in the hearing of Mrs. Myers, upon which I collared him, and threw him down.</p>

               <p>Q. Did your daughter say any thing respecting what she imagined would be the consequence of the blows she had received? - A. She said all along she was killed; but she wished me to get him liberated to save my life, which I did. She died on the 17th of August; on the 15th I went to see her, when she said - Oh father, why did you not come yesterday, for I have got my death blow, the villain has been and executed his work; I have prayed for death many times under my calamities, and should have died in peace then, but I can never die in peace now, since I have prevailed on you to liberate that villain. - She then put her hand on her stomach, and said, he had been on Saturday night, and finished the job. The night before he was liberated he swore he would not go near her, but he went on the Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. After I was liberated, did I not send home a pound note, and some oysters, to my wife? - A. You promised, if you were liberated, to send a two pound note; you wrote her a letter, saying, if she would endeavour to liberate you, you would send her a two pound note, and would not come near her; and if she did not chuse to consent to that, you had plenty of people to bail you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I sent my daughter back to know if my wife would have a glass of wine, she said she should like a glass of Lisbon; I sent for a bottle, and went home and kissed my wife, and took leave of her, as I was going away.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he send her wine, and call upon her afterwards and kiss her? - A. He sent a twenty shilling note, and promised not to come there at all.</p>

             sworn. - I live at the corner of Hull's-place: On the 2d of August I heard a great noise, between one and two o'clock; I went down the place, and saw the deceased sitting in a chair opposite her house, and a vast number of people round about; she was leaning on her eldest daughter's shoulder, not being able to support herself; her daughter said to her, here is Mrs. Graham; upon which she looked upon me with a very deadly look, took me by the hand, and said, - Oh Mrs. Graham, Mrs. Graham, fourteen years, more or less, I have borne this usage, but he has now given me my death blow; could you see from my anklebone to my private parts, your heart would bleed for me. - I bid her cheer up, and said she would get better; she said, no, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing about her nose? - A. I saw the bridge of her nose flatted to her face, and a woeful black eye on the right-side. I asked her if she would take any kind of refreshment; she said, her inside was so bad with his kicks and bruises that she could not; she said, he had kicked her so much about the kidnies, that she rather thought they had departed from their places, by the feel she had; she said he had many times threatened, but now he had finished the job, and given her a death blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her from day to day afterwards? - A. No, not till the day she died; about half an hour after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine her body? - A. Yes; I was the only person who proposed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the surgeon there? - A. No; I went to see her, and seeing the black eye still remain it hurt me; I returned home, and after weeping a little, I went back, and pulled the sheet down that covered the body: the first thing I saw was the black eye, and the nose in the same fituation I saw it the first day; and her body was just as she described it, for from her ankle-bone to her privates, was as black as my cloak; and the right-side of her privates was very much swelled, just as she had described.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you able to judge from whence it arose? - A. Apparently by a kick; On the right-side of her bottom was the mark of another kick apparently; there were little marks about her stomach, chest, and sides, but they were small marks.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long had you know her? - A. Ever since she had lived in the neighbourhood; about twelve months.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been in the habit of seeing them together? - A. No, never; she was a very close woman, and very careful of being at home with her family.</p>

I did, within about thirty yards; I heard the cry of murder, very loud; in consequence of which, I run; the door was half open, I pushed it back, and saw the prisoner seize the woman in a very savage manner; she was leaning and supporting herself against the wall, and he grasped her as though he would murder her.

               <p>Q. What would happen to you if you should swear that which is false? - A. I should be pillored in this life, and go to the devil in the next world.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at home when your father came home with the meat? - A. Yes; I ran out of the house into the garden when he came in, because he had threatened to murder me if I was in the house; I stood at the window, and heard my mother ask him if she should dress the dinner; he swore, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140066"/>got up and knocked her down by a violent blow, which broke her nose; when he saw me he came out, and I run down to a neighbour's house; I heard a scream presently, and I ran for a constable; when I came back, my mother was laying on the floor, and my father was kneeling upon her; he had got hold of an iron pot, that was on the fire, with one hand, and held her by the throat with the other, and had his knee upon her right breast, he holding her so tight by the throat as to throw her into convulsions; my eldest sister had run to the top of the street screaming out, and my grand-father was coming down, the people desiring him to run as fast as he could, for my father was murdering my mother; he run in and pulled my father off; several more followed, and my grand-father pulled my mother up, and she fell out of his arms; she came a little to herself some time after. My father went away but returned again, and took hold of my grand-father, saying, I'll have your heart's blood before I sleep; when the neighbours came in a second time, and took him off, as my grand-father had collared him to prevent his getting a knife; and the neighbours went to get a warrant for him.</p>

               <p>Q. Before he knocked her down, did he say any thing? - A. He ordered his dinner ready by twelve o'clock; she said there was not time to do it, but she would do her endeavours.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she said any thing more to him than that? - A.

               <p>Q. Did you see him near his wife the day he was discharged? - A. Yes; I saw him go by about five o'clock; he stopped some little time in the house, and then went away to the country. He came again on the Saturday before the Wednesday when she died, about six o'clock, when he returned from the country, and brought somebody with him. I heard some high words, and him threatening her, but I cannot say he struck her; I heard him use very abusive words and d-g and swearing.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you a pupil of Mr. Cline? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sent for to examine the body of the deceased? - A. Yes; on the Friday after the Wednesday on which she died.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the external appearance of the body? - A. It was in some part bruised, particularly in the face, and a slight bruise under the arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a violent bruise on the face? - A. It appeared to be very violent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the bridge of the nose? - A. No, not particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to be broke? - A. It appeared to be bruised, but I did not examine it, I did not take it to be broke; there was flight bruise under the left-arm, which appeared to have been there some time, and was dying away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see how the state of the body was from the ankle to the groin? - A. I did not examine the lower extremities at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you open and examine the chest? - A. Yes; the intestines appeared to be perfectly found.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the kidnies? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Or the spleen? - A. The spleen was found.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find the inside of the chest? - A. In a very diseased state.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the membrane that lines the inside of the chest? - A. In a very inflamed state, and the lungs adhering to it.</p>
               <p>Q. To what might the inflammation of the membrane of the chest be attributed? - A. It might be attributed to external violence, or cold will bring it on.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the lungs diseased? - A. They were very much ulcerated.</p>
               <p>Q. That was a disorder, perhaps, independent of violence? - A. Yes; and had existed for some time.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the state of the heart? - A. Very diseased, both in its external appearance, and internal structure.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it enlarged? - A. Yes, very much.</p>
               <p>Q. Would external violence produce that effect? - A. The appearance might, but the size would not be encreased to the extent that was.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it have been aggravated by external violence and alarm, in consequence of that violance? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Would the alarm a person might undergo, on being attacked by a person stronger than themselves, occasion an aggravation of those symptoms? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. To what do you attribute the death of the de<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140067"/>ceased? - A. The immediate cause of her death, I attribute to the disease of the lungs; but I think it was accelerated by the ill usage, I hear, her husband had given her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe the deceased would have met her death so early, were it not from the violence used, attributed to her husband? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you know the deceased? - A. I saw her once before, as I was accidentally passing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether she had any ailment of any kind? - A. Only from what I heard, that she had an asthma, and I could see that was the immediate cause of her death.</p>
               <p>Q. Would an asthma give that appearance to the lungs in the state you found them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Would an asthma have any effect on the enlargement of the heart? - A. No, I don't apprehend it would.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see, from your inspection of the body, any particular blow that you suppose accelerated the death? - A. No; what bruises there were, appeared to be dying away.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot six on any particular blow, or bruise, that you apprehend was the cause of her death? - A. No, I cannot.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you practice physic and surgery on your own account? - A. Yes, and have for near eight years.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard the description of the appearance of the unfortunate woman's lungs, and the injuries she received? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think the appearance of the lungs, which has been described, might be produced by external violence? - A. Yes; the time the blows stated to be given, being the 2d of August, and the death of the woman happening fifteen days afterwards, is about the period that the termination of inflammation would happen, arising from external bruises, and would be supposed to produce death. When a person does not die during the inflammatory state, there happens, what is called, suppuration, which, by producing so great an injury to the lungs incompatible with life, of course terminates fatally. When inflammation does not produce death during the inflammatory state, the disease will go on to suppuration, and the state of the lungs then can hardly be distinguished from the state of the lunges of a person who died of an asthma; with regard to the enlargement of the heart, I have opened the bodies of persons who have died of other diseases, and have found some very much enlarged, and some diminished, where persons have never complained of desection in the part.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the lungs had been in a reduced state previous to external violence, would not that external violence expedite the death? - A. Most assuredly; but admitting the person to labour under an asthma, the very alarm would accelerate the death; and I don't know whether without any external violence at all, it might not accelerate the death.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. From what you have heard, can it be distinctly said, the state of the lungs did not proceed from the symptoms of the disease, or that it necessarily proceeded from the violence? - A. I cannot say that; I can only say, whatever might be the state of the lungs, death must have been accelerated.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you examine her person at all? - A. I did not; I felt her pulse, and told her she seemed low and week, and desired my man to take away a small quantity of blood; I saw her once after, and my man saw her twice, but he is not here; when I saw her the second time, she was sitting upon a sofa, or chair, and appeared weak; she said her husband had ill-treated her, and that he had frequently done the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any medical man attend her? - A. Her father came down to us the day before she died, and my young man went to her; he said that she was very bad, and frequently expectorated that day, but next day it stopped, and she died.</p>

               <p>"Most humbly sheweth - That your petitioner standing indicted for the wilful murder of his wife, and being deprived of the means of seeing Counsel, by the prosecutor (petitioner's father-in-law) having purloined and embezzled his property fince his confinement, has thus ventured to submit his case for your Lordship's consideration, with a full hope of justice being done him. That petitioner is a journeyman soap-maker, and upon his return home from employment in the country in August last, to pay his rent, a trifling dispute had arisen between him and his wife, respecting her not having his dinner ready in due time, to meet his master by appointment, which had brought on some blows on both sides; and the affray having come to the prosecutor's knowledge, he, with three or four men, came to petitioner's house, and demanded entrance, which being granted, petitioner was struck down, his cloaths rent, and he was carried to prison for an assault on his wife, where, after remaining sometime, the prosecutor and petitioner's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140068"/>daughter came to him, and caused the warrant to be discharged, on giving them seven shillings, whereupon the petitioner went to his family, and reconciled all differences, after giving them some pecumary assistance. That soon after petitioner set off for his employment in the country, in friendship with them. That soon after he arrived there, the Excise caused a feizure to be made on his master's effects; and least the offence attached to petitioner, he abandoned the premises, and retired to a public-house in the neighbourhood, and was apprehended soon after, and brought to the public-office, Worship street, for the offence with which he is now charged. That a body of witnesses appeared against him:

             deposed that petitioner knocked his wife down; she heard the fall, but did not see the blow; she saw a flat candlestick in or near the deceased's body. On her second examination said, she deceased told her she had fallen on it. Mrs. Turnbull heard a noise only. The prosecutor (deceased's father) saw the abuse, but said, she had a consumption for twenty years. Dr. Smith's assistant, who attended the deceased, said, she spit no blood, but spit phlegm and corruption; heard nothing said of the candlestick, or disrespectful of petitioner by his wife. A number of low prejudiced witnesses will appear. Surgeon

            , who opened the body, saw no marks of violence to cause death; her lungs were quite decayed and ulcerated, and appeared to have been of long standing. Dr. Smith deposed, that no violence caused her immediate death; it might perhaps, in some manner, hasten her death; her heart was a little drawn, occasioned by a disturbed mind; blows could not have caused ulcers on the lungs, without a force on her lungs; a small black spot, skin deep, appeared on her side; she died of a natural consumption, of many years standing.</p>
               <p>"Such were the examinations before the Magistrate. Your petitioner further states to your Lordships, that the prosecutor gave out that petitioner absconded from justice in the country, and abused his wife after the warrant had been discharged: petitioner had no opportunity to abuse her, and his elopement was from a fear of being taken by the Excise, and he heard nothing of his wife's death till he was apprehended. That he was married to his wife fourteen years, by whom he had several children, five of whom are now living under the age of twelve years, whose dependence for support and maintenance rests on your petitioner, who always paid due attention to his family, and whose utter destruction he could not premeditate. The unhappy affair originated in a mere trisle, without any wicked intent, whatever may be given in evidence, before your Lordships, against their</p>

               <p>Q. Had she any thing asthmatical about her? - A. When she had a cold - may be once or twice a year she might have a cold, but she was quite a hearty chearful woman.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether she was complaining, or not, before this happened? - A. No, I never heard her; and, in short, she could work faster than I could, and she was obliged to wash every day, or every other day, for her children and herself, to keep neat and clean; she was a very bustling woman; in short, I never heard her cough till after the blows.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner coming to your Office upon any occasion? - A. Yes, perfectly; but before that, a woman, saying she was Mrs. Heasty, had come for a blank receipt; it is a custom to grant blank receipts when a man is incapable of coming himself: On the 16th of July, I received a letter, signed by Mr. Morgan, saying that this man had been dead a month; I therefore<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140069"/>provided an officer in case the woman should come to receive the money on the 21st of July, but she did not come, the prisoner at the bar came; I said to him, I don't think this is Heasty's writing; he said, yes, it is; I said, how do you know; he said, I saw him write it; I asked him how long since, and he said about a week or ten days; I then had him taken into custody. The receipt was filled up by one of my clerks before it was given to the woman; he is not here, but I can swear to his hand-writing; no person but myself or my clerks can get possession of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the receipt that was brought to you by the prisoner? - (Shewing it to him.) - A. Yes; I put my initials upon it; the name has evidently been penciled, and written over afterwards; this is not like his hand-writing; I never saw him write, but I have seen his writing; when a man is able to come himself the receipt is in a receipt book.</p>

He got up when I did, and said he had lost his wages out of his pocket; I and Mr. Powell and Cook went down Lambeth-walk; I left them at the public-house, and went to my brother's, and when I came back, Cook had left Mr. Powell; I came back in about a quarter of an hour; Mr. Powell desired me to go with him over the water; he suspected Cook; we went as far as Fleet-market, and saw Stoper, White, and Clark.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning was it? - A. About eleven o'clock I take it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew yourself to them? - A. No, we kept behind them at some distance, and by following them we found the property; I did not see Cook till I got to a public-house in Golden-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see them go into the public-house in Golden-lane? - A. No, my master saw them go in; I followed him; I was at some distance behind; I followed my master into the Angel and Porter, and found Cook and White there.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find Clark and Stoper there? - A. No; Clark then came in, and while the constable was searching him, Stoper came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any thing with them? - A. Not that I saw; the constable found my watch upon Stoper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that? - A. Yes; they were then taken to Clerkenwell Bridewell; I saw all the things after; they were found at Mrs. Munday's, in Golden-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. At a public-house or private house? - A. It is a chandler's-shop; they were in a cradle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of the prisoners lodge at that place? - A. No; it seemed to be a lodging-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the female prisoner? - A. She was in the room; she asked Stoper for the money that the things were sold for; I heard Stoper say, she was not in the room at the time the things were bought.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Peat, Counsel for Stoper Q. This transaction was in Surrey, was it not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The place in which the goods were found is in Middlesex? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Peat. Q. You made ample promises to Stoper? - A. Yes; I told him I would do all in my power to forgive him, if he would shew me where the things were.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable: On the 24th of July I was sent for to a public-house in Golden-lane, where I found Powell and Paint-house sitting in a box, with Cook, White, and Garlett, who has escaped; I searched Cook and Garlett, but found nothing; Powell said there were two more who had a bundle between them, and he could find them if they were near at hand; he went out, and brought Clarke in first; then he went out again, and brought in Stoper; Clarke had two shillings and a pocket-book: I searched Stoper, and found the watch and 1l. 14s. 6d. in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140071"/>three seven shilling pieces, ten shillings, two sixpences, and half a crown; Stoper went with us to shew us where the things were in Ball-yard, Golden-lane.(Edward Tring confirmed the testimony of the last witness.)(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Stoper. I have nothing to say for myself.</p>
               <p>Clarke's defence. I know nothing of it; I met with this lad and White as I was going to Shoreditch.</p>
               <p>Cook's defence. After I had left the prosecutor's on Sunday morning, I came home to my lodgings; I met with Garland, who asked me if I would go over the water with him; we went up Long-lane, and these overtook us just by Golden-lane, where we went into a public-house, and had some beer.</p>
               <p>White's defence. We met Garland and this young man, and went to have a pot of beer, when that man gave charge of us; I am innocent of it.</p>
               <p>Brennard's defence. I know nothing of it, or whether they were bought or stole.</p>
               <p>Catbcart. Stoper said, she was not in the room when the things were bought.</p>
               <p>Stoper called one, Cook one, and Brennard three witnesses, who gave them good characters.</p>

             Sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are the prisoner's brother? - A. Yes; I live at No.3, St. Ann's-street, Westminster, it used to go by the name of St. Ann's-lane: On the 18th of July, in the evening, I was in company with my brother at Mr. Walker's; I had breakfasted with him in the morning, and had seen him in the afternoon, and he was in my company the greater part of the Sunday evening, and slept in my house that night; my weddingday was the 19th, and he supped with me that evening.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Did your brother lodge with you at that time? - A. He has lodged at my house a great number of times; he was at my house a long while; it might be two months, or three months, I cannot say exactly, till he was taken up; he would sleep three or four nights, or a week together, at my house, and then he would sleep at my brother John's for one night.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his business? - A. A farrier.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he carry on his business at your house, or his brother John's? - A. No; his wife died at or near Oakingham, and soon after he buried her, he sold the lease of his house.</p>
               <p>Q. That was in March or April, was it not? - A. It is impossible for me to say.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he sold the lease of the house before your wedding-day? - A. I cannot say; it might be about two months.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any other residence than your house, and your brother's? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Mr. Weston.) At what time in the evening of Sunday had you seen your horse in the paddock? - A. About seven o'clock; I missed it in the morning between seven and eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Biggleswade from London? - A. The forty-five mile stone stands against the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this a good horse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In how many hours might a person come to town upon this horse? - A. If they rode it hard, I should think, about five hours.</p>

            , and lived at Brentford; he bought her with saddle and bridle, it was a hay mare, her knees had been broke, there was a lump of flesh upon the knee but it was well; he gave seventeen guineas for it, they asked me to witness the receipt, and I put my mark to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that receipt? - A. That is the mark I put to it; the room was full of people at the time.</p>
               <p>(The witness was desired to go into the Sessions-house yard and look at the mare - upon his return, he said it was the same.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. How long have you known the prisoner, Robert? - A. Nearly five years; he has got his living by horse-dealing for the last two years.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he before that? - A. I do not rightly know; he was a servant, and lived with me; he was recommended to me by one Barnard.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where he lives? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he had any fixed residence lately? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was the 19th of August? - A. By the orders I had to execute that day: I was then going to Bartholomew-close, to Mr. Robinson's a joiner.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you subpoenaed? - A. Last Monday week.</p>
               <p>Q. You were told what you were subpoenaed for? No; it was sent to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to find out what you were subpoenaed for? - A. Because they called upon me afterwards.</p>

             Sworn. - I am the brother of the prisoners; I live at No.3, Market-street, Westminster: On the 15th of August, the day before the Duke of York's birth-day, my brother, Thomas, came to my house between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, supped and slept at my house; he breakfasted with us the next morning, went away about nine o'clock, and returned between three and four in the afternoon. I came home from my work earlier than usual, and went with him that evening to Astley's, and when it was over he came home with me, and slept at my house; we had agreed to go on the Duke of York's birth-night, because Bonaparte's invasion was to be acted that night.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was your brother Robert at the time you are speaking of? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he? - A. He has followed horsedealing; Thomas is a farrier.</p>

               <p>Q. Does he carry on horse-dealing too? - A. Yes.</p>

            ? - A. No; her mother lodged with me; the girl came to her, to complain of the prisoner having threatened to shoot her, and behaved improperly to her, and of what he had attempted; I said, it was proper she should come away; her mother asked me to go with them to her place, which I did; when we went it was ten o'clock at night; I asked the cook and house-maid how it was; they said, they could not tell, but he behaved very indifferent; I asked, did he court her; they said, they did not know, but he was a very comical fellow, and had attempted her life, and wished her mother and I to talk to him; the prisoner was not at home when we went, but came home about half an hour after; her mother and I went into the pantry to him with the girl; I asked him what he meant by using the girl ill, and whether he wished to have her for his wife; he said, no, he did not; I said, how could you use her so, as to conceal two pistols in a pair of boots, and say, if she did not put her hand to a paper, you would blow her brains out, and locked her in till she did put her hand to it from fear; he said, he did take the two pistols, and that there was one for her and one for him; I asked him, how he could use any body in such a barbarous manner; he said, he would not talk to me, but to her mother, upon which I came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sober? - A. He was sober to all appearance; I told the cook, I did not like his behaviour, and should be glad if she would let the girl go home with us, as Sir Ralph was not at home, and there were only two women servants in the house; she at last consented, and I had hardly said, come, let us go, because it is late, when the prisoner came in with three pistols; he stopped, and said, now I'll let you see what a man dare do who is destitute in his mind; the girl's mother got up and ran away; he advanced to the girl, and the house-maid ran away; the girl ran behind the cook and me, and screamed and begged of him not to kill her; the cook covered her head, and then he pointed a pistol at her, which flashed in the pan; the cook then ran away, and none but the prisoner, the girl, and me were left. I took up one of the wooden-bottom chairs, and told him I would not run away, for then he would surely murder her; I begged for God Almighty's take he would not kill her, for we would settle it any way; he bid me take care of myself; I told him there was no fear, and as I came to defend the girl, I would stand by her; he shuffled about till he got the pistol between the spokes of the chair and my arm, when he shot her, and she fell down behind me; she was no sooner down but she jumped up again, and ran up stairs; I being a stranger to the house, did not know which way to run; he discharged the third pistol, and I thought he pointed it at his own head, but it did not take place, nor do I know where the ball went to. I never saw the prisoner before that time, therefore do not know the state of his mind.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Do you know what became of the prisoner, and whether he did not attempt to cut his own throat? - A. He did, but I did not see him.</p>

I went to the pantry and missed the things which I had seen the night before: I had lost three two pound notes, two five pound notes, nine guineas and a half in gold, a plain gold ring, half-a-dozen silver tea-spoons, a tea caddy-spoon, and a pair of plated tea-tongs, of my own; I alarm<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140077"/>ed the family, and immediately went to Bow-street.

             Sworn. - I am a private watchman in Carnaby-market; I was on duty on the night of the 21st of July, and called a man up at three o'clock in Brown's-court to go to Smithfield-market; going back to my box I thought I saw three of the prisoners pass me, one of them had a bundle; the first was Corty, the next White, and the other Kitchen; when they saw me they seemed to start a little, and then walked very quick into the house to one Skully, in Munday's-court, adjoining Brown's-court, and shut the door after them; I went to the market to tell the watchman belonging to the parish; I looked back, and saw Skully looking after me in his shirt, with his body about half way out of the street-door they went in at; he then withdrew inside, and shut the door, and I informed the watchman; while he was gone for the patrol I concealed myself, so that I could see Skully's door. About half past four, Lovatt, Warren, and I, saw Corty and Edwards come out, and go up Marshall-street, as if they were going towards Broad-street; upon which Lovatt and his nephew took them into custody; I continued on the watch till six o'clock, when I observed White and Kitchen come out, and Lovatt and his nephew took them also into custody, in Broad-street, and they were taken before the Magistrate. I will swear the prisoners are the four men.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (Counsel for Edwards.) Q. Edwards was not one of the three you saw go in? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long he had been in the house you cannot tell? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. It was quite light? - A. Yes; it had been light a good while.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say how long it had been day light before you saw four men go into Skully's house? - A. About half an hour; it might be about half past two o'clock when it was day-light, so that I could discern any thing.</p>

             Sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Marlborough-street: On the night of the 21st of July, I was called up about half past three o'clock in the morning, and about a quarter past four, we saw Edwards and Corty come out of Skully's house; my nephew and I apprehended them, and took them to St. James's watch-house; and afterwards apprehended White and Kitchen. I searched Corty and Edwards as soon as I got them to the watch-house, and found a great number of Banknotes, and seven guineas, upon Corty; and about fourteen pounds in Bank small notes on Edwards; I was desired to take care of three of the brightest of the guineas. I searched the others, and found ten pounds on White, in two two-pound, and six one pound notes; and a twenty pound note on Kitchen, and a pair of wet dirty stockings in his pocket; I desired Hillham to take particular care of the house while I got a warrant to search it. About half past six o'clock I went and executed it, and found a lump of what I conceive to be silver, rather warm, on the top of a bureau in the parlour, and a great number of things in the jewellery and goldsmith line, which I took to the Magistrates, and a crucible. Skully is a jeweller, and keeps four or five men at work; he was not at home then, nor have I seen him since, though I searched diligently after him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. It is nothing uncommon to find melted silver in a jeweller's shop? - A. I should think not.</p>
               <p>Q. As to the trinkets that were found, none were owned? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You found a twenty pound note on Kitchen, which was returned to him? - A. Yes; it was not owned, and I was ordered to return it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. (To Langdale.) Q. Look at those three bright guineas, - among the nine you lost, were there three such as those? - A. Yes; I had seven new, and two old guineas; three exactly corresponded with these.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. They are three common guineas, without any particular mark on them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoners said they were innocent, and left their defence to their Counsel.</p>

             Sworn. - I had the care of the house, and received two guns from the last witnes, about two hours afterwards, the prisoner came, and told my little boy, who opened the door to him, he came about two guns, one of which was left in mistake; I went into the hall myself, and he said he came from Mr. Parker, a gunsmith in Holborn, about a gun that belonged to Mr. Dorrington, in Devonshire-place, as that the man, who carried out the guns, had made a mistake, and placed Mr. Dorrington's gun with ours, and carried ours to Devonshire-place; he had untied the guns by the time I got into the hall; he then looked at one, and said, that was not the gun; he then looked at the other, and said, this is it, and took it away; I begged him to make haste with the other, for I should be uneasy till it came, as a cart was coming early in the morning to take them with other things into the country; I also asked him, why he had not brought our gun with him; he said, because our house was in his way, and he would call as he came back with it; I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You thought the person to whom you gave the gun, was the person who brought it? - A. No, I did not; I delivered it in consequence of the pretence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dusk? - A. No, quite day-light.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, you could not undertake to swear to the prisoner, and that you did not believe he was the man, but your boy should be sent for? - A. No, I did not; I was in hopes I should get the gun without.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the Magistrate say, that unless your son could say something more than you did, he must discharge him? - A. No, not in my presence; I did not like to swear to him, because his cloathes were different.</p>
               <p>Q. Why were you desired to bring your son, of ten years old, to swear to him, if you had no doubt? - A. I was told it was necessary.</p>
               <p>- WESTBROOK Sworn. - Q. How old are you? - A. Ten years old.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you go to school? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a good or a bad thing to tell a lie? - A. A bad thing; it is a public scandal in this world, and whoever swears false goes to the devil in the next.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you the son of the last witness? - A. Yes; I was at home when the man came for the guns; I let him in, and saw him afterwards at Bow-street, and am sure the prisoner is the man; he asked me if there were not two guns left; I said, yes; he said, the man who brought them, had made a mistake, - that one was for Mr. Dorrington, of Devonshire-place; I stood sometime before I let him have it, and then my mother came up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You were not sworn at Bow-street? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You then said, you did not know the nature of an oath? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not asked whether you knew the prisoner, and did you not say, no? - A. I said I was not sure, because I was afraid he would be hanged.</p>
               <p>Q. Your mother expected a good deal of anger for having lost the gun? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She often told you so? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you left Bow-street, your mother told you that was the man who took the gun? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. She has often told you so - has she not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you knew it was a bad thing to tell a lie, you told a lie at Bow-street before the Justice - had you ever been before a Justice before? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. When your mother spoke to you about this business, did she not tell you, if you should be asked here the reason you did not speak to the man when you were at Bow-street, to say, it was because you were afraid he would be hanged? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the fact is, you did not know the man when there, and only know him now in consequence of what your mother told you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know it is the man, in consequence of your mother telling you to say he is the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She has since told you he was the man, and you believe it? - A. Yes; I saw nothing but his face when he came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Since you were at Bow-street, your mother told you it was the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And she told you the nature of an oath? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You observed the face of the man who came for the guns? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner - are you sure he is the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any doubt of it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When? - A. I don't think I ever saw him before he came for the guns.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say you were not sure he was the man at Bow-street? - A. I was afraid to say it, for fear he should be hanged.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your mother told you any thing before you went to Bow-street? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say at Bow-street? - A. The gentleman asked me whether I remembered the man who came to our house; I said, yes; he said, look round, and point him out; I looked round, and pointed out the prisoner; he asked me if I was sure, and I said, no, for fear the should be hanged.</p>
               <p>Q. You have called God to witness you will speak the truth, and if you swear what is false, you will not only be severely punished in this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140081"/>world, but the next; having called God to witness what you say, are you sure the prisoner is the man? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was that ship lying? - A. Between Wapping Old-stairs and Wapping New-stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she lying in the County of Middlesex? - A. Yes, as far as I understand; I went alongside the boat, Simmons held out his protection-box, and said he was a Prussian; I observed he had something under his jacket; I told him I did not want to see his protection, I wanted to see what he had under his jacket; he said he had nothing; I then got into the boat, and searched his pocket, and in each pocket he had nutmegs, and between his shirt and his body he had a number more concealed; upon Cuepper, I found nutmegs between his shirt and his body, and likewise in the same manner upon the accomplice; then I took them to the office; I asked them where they had got them; they said they got them out of a prize from Cape Francois, and that they were going to buy stock with it.</p>
               <p>Q. That is, victuals, is it not? - A. Yes; the watermen pointed out that that was the ship; I took them into my boat; they did not say whether that was the ship or not; when I came past the Hoop, I asked them again if that was the ship, and they would not give me any answer; I then took them before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Cuepper understand English? - A. Just<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140086"/>as well as I do; he would not talk at all at first, till I brought him to it by degrees.</p>

               <p>Q. And they generally conceal their goods as much as they possibly can when they bring them on shore? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. There are as many thieves as smugglers on the River, I believe? - A. More thieves than smugglers.</p>
               <p>JOHN GOTTY sworn. - I am one of the surveyors of the Thames-Police: In consequence of information I received, I went, on the 7th of July last, on board the Hoop, she was lying between Wapping Old and Wapping New-stairs, in the parish of St. John, Wapping, in the county of Middlesex; I went on board the Hoop, I went into the cabin, and requested the captain to call the cook down.</p>
               <p>Q. The cook is one of the prisoners? - A. Yes, Tillman.</p>

               <p>Q. The captain, I believe, is not here? - A. No; the vessel has failed, and the captain with it; the prisoner, Tillman, immediately came down into the cabin, and I desired him to let me have the bag of nutmegs that he had stowed away in the fore peak; and I requested the captain to give him the same direction in his own language, for fear he should not understand me; he went up the ladder first, upon the ship's deck, and brought me a bag containing 14lbs. of nutmegs; I then took him and the nutmegs together to the Office. The next morning I went on board the Hoop again, to see if I could discover any bag, or plunder; as soon as the captain came on board we opened the hatches, and hoisted a cask of tobacco up, and on the larboard side, close to the foremast, was a case of nutmegs standing upon its end, covered with some coarse bagging-cloth, and the case broke; between the bagging and the case some loose nutmegs had got down, and some were scattered; we got it upon deck, we found a deficiency of about eight inches, they were nutmegs of the same quality with those that had been produced by Mr. Walker; I saw that case delivered into the charge of the searcher's waterman, he took it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the mark? - A. Yes; a bunch of grapes, No. 424; I then went to the fore peak, to search if any more were secreted, and on the larboard side, between a hogshead of tobacco and the lining of the ship, I found a pair of trowsers full of indigo; I then proceeded to look further among the cargo, and see if any indigo was missing; I found a case marked with two round O's and a stroke across, No. 297; I got that up upon deck, and found nine inches deficient.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Behrends.) Whereabouts was the whole of the deficiency of nutmegs? - A. They were worth about ten shillings a pound; the deficiency I cannot speak to.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HOLLAND sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You are one of the Thames-Police watermen? - A. I am.</p>

               <p>Q. What was he? - A. He was one of the persons belonging to the vessel; I took him into custody about half past eleven o'clock, and brought him on shore.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Bolton.) Q. Did you take the weight of the nutmegs, and also of the indigo? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who brought the indigo? - A. Mr. Little, I believe, but he is not here.</p>
               <p>HENRY-JOHN CUEPPER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What countryman are you? - A. I am a Prussian.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of July last, were you on board a ship called the Hoop, in the river Thames? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the name of the captain? - A. I don't really know.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the four men at the bar on board with you? - A. Simmons was mate I understood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he act as mate? - A. Yes; John Cuepper was foremast man, Tillman was cook, and Kuhlman was foremast man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember being taken in a boat by the Police-officers? - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present, before that, when any thing was done respecting nutmegs? - A. Yes; after dinner on Thursday, the day we were taken, the mate called us on deck, and ordered us to hoist out a cask of tobacco.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any body else on board? - A. Yes; there was a Custom-house officer on board.</p>
               <p>Q. But were there any other persons employed in shipping the cargo besides you five? - A. No; we all helped to hoist up a cask of tobacco, and then the mate ordered us to unstow the cargo, and cry if we could not put any more small things in between the goods that were in the vessel to make more room; Simmons, the mate, asked Tillman what kind of cargo there had been in the ship; Tillman told him, nutmegs, indigo, pepper, and other goods; in unstowing the cargo, Kuhlman said, I believe that is a chest of nutmegs; going on further with unstowing the things, Kuhlman said, the chest is open; then Simmons said, if it is not open enough we must break it open, and get some out; then we told him that it would not do.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told him so? - A. In general; at least me, and the man that stood next me, said so; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140087"/>said, never mind, there has been two or three steersmen before me, and I will make it good; then some of the nutmegs were handed up, I handed some up to

               <p>Q. Who opened the chest? - A. I cannot say; I saw Kuhlman with a crow-bar in his hand; I was standing in the hatchway.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it opened by one of those four? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other person there who could have opened it? - A. Not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took out the nutmegs? - A. They rolled out; Kuhlman put his hand to them, and they rolled out, and I handed them up in a hat to John Cuepper, and he handed them upon deck to Tillman, the cook; Simmons was standing by the hatchway upon deck, on the starboard side, and Tillman was on the larboard side.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he see what was going forward? - A. Yes, he was present all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had taken out all you wanted, what was done then? - A. Simmons ordered us to load the things again, and come upon deck; after we had stowed the things, we came upon deck again; Simmons then sent on shore for some gin, and he sent me up alost, but before I had my things ready to go up alost with, I heard Simmons order Kuhlman to break open a chest of indigo; I don't know whether he did or not, till I came down again upon the bowsprit; then Simmons called me, and ordered me to go down in the hold, and to empty a bowl of indigo, that was standing there, into a pair of trowsers, which I did; while we were hoisting up some other things that came on board, Simmons sent Kuhlman on shore; after we had laid the hatches on, Simmons told us we might dress ourselves, and go on shore; Cuepper and I came away; we left Tillman on board; Simmons ordered us to take some nutmegs and indigo, and bring them to his lodgings, which we did; Simmons had some in his pockets; I had no pocket about me, and so he told me to put them in my bosom, which I did, and Cuepper had some in his bosom; as we were going ashore, we were stopped by the officers, and the nutmegs found upon Simmons, me, and Cuepper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You did not think you were doing any thing wrong, as you were ordered by Simmons? - A. No; we thought, as he was commander of the vessel, we were to obey his orders.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long had you been on board? - A. I shipped myself with the captain on Wednesday evening; we all four did, in short, the mate and all.</p>
               <p>Simmons's defence. I know nothing of it; I ordered that man, Cuepper, to go up alost, and that is all the order I gave him.</p>
               <p>The other prisoners, in their defence, said, they only obeyed the orders of the mate, Simmons.</p>

               <p>JOHN HALEY sworn. - Q. What business do you follow? - A. Not any; I have been in business; I live in Marylebone-street, Golden-square: On the 12th of August, about three o'clock in the morning, I had been out to spend the evening, in Rose-street, Covent-garden, with my friends; I staid rather later than usual.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time in the morning, perhaps you were not quite sober? - A. I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober enough to swear to the person of a man? - A. Yes, I was sober enough to identify the person; I was going home from <placeName id="t18030914-110-crimeloc634">Rose-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. What had you in your pocket-book? - A. A two-pound note, some memorandums and a silver pencil-case.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not sober enough to resist him, I suppose? - A. No; I said, you have got my pocket-book; he made no reply, but knocked me down, and ran off; I halloaed out, watch, stop thief; I called, watch, stop thief, a second time, and the watchman called out, I have got him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was taken immediately? - A. Yes: the watchman asked me what I was robbed of; I said, he had robbed me of my pocket-book; the prisoner said, he had no pocket-book, nor he did not know me; the watchman searched him, and found none upon him; the watchman said, he thought he saw him drop something, before he crossed the way to lay hold of him; we all three went over to look, and on the iron railing of a window in King-street, we found the pocketbook; I said it was mine, and he was taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Your pocket was picked first, and you was knocked down afterwards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140088"/>Q. There was no force used to you till after the pocket-book was taken? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Your name is Haley, and you live where? - A. In Marybone-street, Golden-square.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning was it? - A. About three in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you had spent the evening? - A. I cannot exactly tell you myself.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you can identify the man? - A. I won't swear positively to his person; the only thing I can swear by, is his dropping the book at the place.</p>
               <p>Q. And that you did not see? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever robbed before? - A. Yes; I was robbed the same evening of my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where you were robbed of your watch? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman: About three o'clock in the morning, I heard that person cry out, stop thief; I then looked, and saw nobody in the street but the prisoner, coming down the contrary side of the street that I was going up; I called out, stop, and then he dropped his hand down from his breast, as if he dropped something, but I could not discern what it was; he was crossing the street when I grasped hold of him; I brought him over to the same side of the street that I was walking on, and kept him there till the prosecutor came up; he desired me to search him; accordingly, I put my hand into his pocket, but only found some halfpence; I then said to the prosecutor, if he has taken your pocket-book, we will go up the other side of the way, and perhaps we may find it; I took the prisoner on the other side of the way, and at the same place where I desired him to stop I picked up the pocket-book upon the iron railing; I then took him to the watch-house; I produced the pocket-book to the constable of the night; it contained a two-pound note, and other papers. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>(The note and pocket-book were identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming home from spending the evening; I heard a cry of stop thief; I walked up, seeing the watchman in the middle of the street, and asked him if he knew what was the matter; he desired me to stop, and I did immediately; a man then approached, and addressed himself to me, saying he had been robbed; he did not say I robbed him; I asked him by who; the watchman said, there was no other person in the street but me, and then he said, it must be me, and I was taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I am a widow, and live in Paul's-alley, Aldersgate-street; I know all the three defendants: On Monday the 31st of January, Mrs. Edwards came to my house for eight shillings to release Edwards out of prison from an execution.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she state any reason why she had a claim upon you for eight shillings? - A. No; she told me if I did not give it to her, it would be worse for me or other people that I should be sorry for before the week was out; she did not mention the name of any body; I told her I had not eight shillings to spare; I knew of no right that she had to ask for it; nothing farther passed; I saw Mrs. Bromfield, the defendant, on the Sunday after; she came to my house at ten o'clock in the morning, and asked for Mrs. Lyne's; I told her I was the person; she told me then she came to relate that there was a warrant against my sister for a little-go; I told her it was impossible, for I knew she was not guilty of any such action; I asked Mrs. Bromfield her name, and she told me her name was White; she said she lived in Short's-buildings; she had only been three weeks in town, she should be in London a few days; if I did not come forward with a handsome sum of money for Mr. Edwards, he would pull me out of my house and my sister too in the morning; I asked her where I was to go to see Mr. and Mrs. Edwards, to carry them the money; she said, to a chandler's-shop in the Broad-way, St. Giles's, turning up by the Black Dog; then she went away, and in the afternoon I went there, and saw a young person who passed for Mrs. Edwards's daughter; I was directed to go to a public-house opposite, and there I saw Mrs. Bromfield and Mrs. Edwards sitting together in a box, but nothing particular passed; Mrs. Bromfield said to Mrs. Edwards, she had had the pleasure of seeing me once before; Mrs. Edwards then asked for a private room, and I saw no more of Mrs. Bromfield; when we came into the room, I asked Mrs. Edwards what she wanted; she said, she had got a warrant against Mrs. Booker, my sister, for a little-go; I said it was impossible; she said it might be settled for a sum of money when Edwards came; some little time after Edwards came in, and said he would settle it for five quids; I asked him what that meant; he said five guineas; he said he acted under Mr. Wood, and the next day he said Mr. Wood protected him on the Sunday; I told him I had not so much money, or any thing like it; he then said he would call upon me the next day, and appointed his own time in the morning at ten o'clock; nothing more passed that night; the next morning Edwards and his wife both came to my house; I asked them if they would not drop it without that sum of money; he said, what could I give him; I told him it would be the destruction of my brother and sister if such a thing should occur.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation of life is Mr. Booker? - A. A very genteel one; he is an enameller, and has got many houses at the back of his own; Mrs. Edwards said to her husband, come along, if it cannot be settled, we will go to Worship-street, and follow them up; I then gave him a twenty-shilling note for fear of his going to do that against my sister which was wrong; he told me it was not enough; unless I promised him some more on Friday, he would not be satisfied; I told him I could not give him any more on the Friday, but I would give him another note on the Monday; he then said he would go and get Armstrong to file the warrant, and then both went away, and I saw no more of them till that day week; I met Edwards in Chiswell-street, and they said they were going to my house for the remainder of the money; Mr. Edwards said so in the hearing of his wife; I told him I should not be at home for two hours; they said they would not wait above an hour; I returned in an hour and a half, and they were at my house; I then gave them another twenty-shilling note; Mr. Edwards then said the warrant was done with.</p>

               <p>Q. What was it induced you to give first one note, and then the other? - A. For fear they were taking my sister on a false accusation.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they threatened to take her on a false accusation? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You never saw Mrs. Bromfield after the Sunday? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you had the conversation with Mrs. Bromfield, was any body with you? - A. Nobody but my own children.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect about the beginning of February having any conversation with her upon the subject of a little-go, or about Mrs. Booker? - A. On Friday the 4th of February, I had some conversation with her about Mrs. Booker; she came into my house, No. 6, Steward-court, Clerkenwell-green; she said, who do you think is taken up; I said, I don't know; she said, mother Booker; I asked her what she had done; she said, oh, she had done nothing; she said, she was sworn<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140092"/>against, and that was enough for her; she must pay 100l. or go to prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say at whose instance she was to go to prison? - A. I asked her what was the matter, and she said, it mattered not to me; she said, she would go, and seek about it; she came back in about an hour, and said it was all settled, they were to pay 100l. she said, the poor wretches, without mentioning any names, were in a starving condition, and she would go and see what she could do for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you mentioned the names of Edwards or his wife to her? - A. No; she said the informers, but did not mention any names; she said, they had a hundred a year from Government, and she called them informers; she came again in the morning, and said, they had settled it; she said, we have settled it, and got ten guineas; we asked her who had got it, and whether it was settled before a Magistrate, and she said, no, it was settled among themselves; Mrs. Bromfield said, she had got interest at Hatton-garden; her word would go further than half the parish; she said she had been at Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she mention the name of either of the Edwards's? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember having any conversation with them about a Mrs. Booker? - A. Yes, at my own house sometime after Christmas, but I cannot say how long after; I asked Edwards with what view he took out the warrant against Mrs. Booker; he said, he took it out for the purpose of drawing five guineas from Mrs. Lynes, the sister of Mrs. Booker; I said, I was sure that Mrs. Booker lived in too much credit to do any thing of the kind; he made answer immediately, no, I never did any thing with her; I did it on purpose to draw her sister in for five guineas, and he told me Mrs. Lynes promised him five, but he said he had got two out of the five, two one-pound notes; if he had not got that he should have got nothing; I said, if she had not given you any thing, what would you have done then; he said, I would have wrote it down, and his pal, Mrs. Knight, would swear it.</p>

            , and was employed as a letter carrier in January, February, March, and beginning of April, 1802; I had no Sunday duty, Chalfont had; he delivered letters to me many times on Sundays, which he brought from the Post-office, as he told me, and I knew it by the post marks; he put them into his pocket when he was sorting them on Sundays, as he told me; I was to cause them to be delivered on Monday in the regular course of other letters; they were not all in my district, and I delivered those that were in my district to whom they were directed; those that were not in my district I transferred to the carriers of the districts to which they belonged, and they accounted to the charge taker of the division, and he paid me the money; letters are frequently missorted, and these were treated as such; the money received for them, Chalfont had half and I half. I at that time kept a tallow-chandler's-shop; Chalfont bought soap and candles of me, and I have a book of the sums of the moiety of each in my own writing at the time - (produces his day-book.) On the 13th of January, 1802, I find a dozen of candles charged 10s. to him; on the 17th W. C. cash 1l. 7s. 6d. being half of the postage money of letters Chalfont brought on that Sunday; on the 1st of February<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140093"/>17s. 4d. is placed to his credit as a moiety of the postage he brought from the Office on Sunday; on the 8th, 19s. 6d. also a moiety; on the 16th, 19s. 10d.; on the 22d, 15s. 9d.; on the 8th of March, 14s. and 15s. 6d.; on the 22d, 18s. 4d.; on the 30th, 12s. 4d.; on the 5th of April, in my ledger 2l. 14s. all moieties; I paid him five guineas at one time, and 4l. at another, and he had goods from my shop, which are entered in my day-book; I paid him the money towards settling the account of the letters; Chalfont's account is drawn out from the day-book to the ledger by my order by one Berridge; I gave an account of these transactions in May last to the Post-office, near a year after it took place.</p>

               <p>Q. In plain English, you might steal it if you were so inclined! - A. I certainly might, but I defy any one to bring such a charge against me.</p>

               <p>Q. It was all secret? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you some receipts? - A. No.</p>

            , the witness, was employed, but had no Sunday duty. Buxton Webster was not in the Office in January, 1802; but previous to that he had Sunday duty; he was discharged the 5th of April, 1801. Any person employed on Sundays could take letters. The letters are sorted in twelve letter-carriers divisions, and are then sorted in to walks; mistakes are frequently made, and they hand them over to the charge-taker, and he gives them over to the others. Webster in January last made a disclosure after he was dismissed from his office; in consequence of his disclosure, Chalfont was sent for; Mr. Freeling, Mr. Parkin, and myself were present. Webster produced his daybook, and accused Chalfont of fraud in the course of his Sunday duty, saying, that he had taken letters for London delivery to Webster's-house, where they cast up the amount, and divided it on the Monday; such letters as were not in Webster's own delivery, he passed to the charge-taker, and such as wore he delivered himself, or by the persons under him. Items were read from the ledger and day-book, as sums Chalfont had credit for in respect of the amount of these letters, and was explained to be one half of the amount of the postage of letters taken away on the Sunday. Chalfont being confronted without any promise being made him, and being asked what he said to the charge, acknowledged he had participated in postage in the manner stated, but said the amount was not so great.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Q. Is there any situation of subsorter? - A. Yes, the defendant was a sub-sorter, which is perfectly distinct from a sorter; sorters are often employed in charging the number of letters that come on Sundays, which are told, and we know the amount of postage, and any deficiency would be discovered on the Monday upon the retelling the letters; we have no account of the number sent from the different places; they are first told, and then sorted. Webster was a discharged servant when he made the disclosure, and I have a recollection of his being suspended before.</p>
