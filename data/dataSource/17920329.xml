               <p>I am clerk to Mr. Holliday: I called up the boy, who lived with me as a servant about two years and a half; on my taxing him with it, he pulled out a key, which opened the lock; I asked him what he had done with all the money he had taken; he said it was up stairs; I went up, and found two guineas, eight shillings, and some copper, which he confessed was part of what he took out of Mr. Holliday's desk.</p>
               <p>Court. Was any thing said to him? - I said, tell the truth; the only way for you to find mercy is to tell the truth; he said he was tempted to do it.</p>
               <p>Court. Then we must not hear what he said after that.</p>
               <p>Silverlock. I do not know the guineas.</p>
               <p>Deposed to by Mr. Holliday. I did not make any marks on the gold any further than taking down the dates.</p>
               <p>Court. That is rather vague.</p>
               <p>Mr. Holliday. It is rather vague; I do not wish to press it: one of those guineas corresponded with the date I took down.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say; I was persuaded to do it by an old man; he said there was no harm in it, and I thought no harm: I have no witnesses but my master.</p>

               <p>(The indictment opened by Mr. Knapp: and the case by Mr. Garrow, as follows:)</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship. Gentlemen of the jury. I have been called upon in the course of my professional duty to state to you the nature of the case against the unfortunate men at the bar; and to persons of serious and sober thinking it must have excited sensations of a very uneasy kind, to learn that you are to day to pass on the lives or deaths of so many of your fellow citizens. Gentlemen, in our journey through life we are very often cast into very uncomfortable situations; but it is your duty and mine, as it is the duty of every man, to meet his duty manfully, and to discharge it honestly: I am perfectly sure, gentlemen, that the cause of these men will be safe under your consideration, with the directions you will receive from the noble and learned judge: on the part of the defendants, they have every claim to your best and most discriminating attention; because, undoubtedly, if you should feel yourselves called upon by virtue of the oath you have taken; if you should feel yourselves called upon by the obligations of conscience to pronounce them guilty, they will have little hope of mercy in this world: on the part of the publick there are claims<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179203290016"/>on you to attend to this case with the most serious and considerate caution, because it presents a murder of the most horrid and attrocious kind committed, with circumstances of defiance of all the attention of the police that have hardly been equalled in this country in modern times; there will be an end of all security in society, if crimes like this attributed to these unfortunate men should pass with impunity: gentlemen, to you I dare say it will be unnecessary to make the observation I am going to make; I make it because I know an occasion recent to us all, I mean the riots in 1780; vulgar minds were impressed with an idea that prosecutions like the present were unfit, indecorous, and not proper to be had; it has been supposed by such minds that to call on a jury to attend to the case of seven or eight persons together, is a thing not to be done in a country governed as this is by wife and just laws; gentlemen, it is of necessity that it should be done; if many persons engage in the perpetration of the same crime, they must be arraigned together, their guilt must be inquired into by the same jury, the same jury must do their best to find out and discriminate that guilt; therefore, gentlemen, it is no impeachment on the law, it is no arraignment of the proceedings of courts of justice that they should be tried together, in truth it is more beneficial for them, and those that fancy these things are injurious, if they considered the subject dispassionately, would discover, that in the way in which justice is administered in this country, it is in truth more beneficial to the parties accused than any other mode of proceeding could possibly be: gentlemen, I have the pleasure, on the present occasion, to assure you that the number of persons will not excite any difficulty in the decision; that it will be extremely easy to apply your minds to the cases of the several prisoners, under the direction, and with the assistance, you will receive from the Court: gentlemen, the first object of your enquiry will be this, whether Jordan Hosty came to his death by violent means inflicted upon him by any body; the indictment imputes that violence to the prisoner Hubbard; it will be, in point of law, perfectly immaterial whether that allegation in the indictment be true or not; because, if it should turn out that any other prisoner now arraigned gave the mortal wound, still, if Hubbard and the rest were associates in the guilt of that other person it will make no difference; but I believe it will appear from the testimony of very many witnesses, that the mortal wound, as alleged to Hubbard, is consistent with truth; you will have the goodness to direct your minds first to the enquiry whether he was guilty of the fact alleged against him, then you will see what share the other prisoners have taken in that guilt, whether they were present, whether they encouraged him, by adding to that force which he would not have had alone to perpetrate this crime, and whether they lent themselves to his guilty purpose: gentlemen, it is necessary I should state to you, that, in order to make persons accessaries, as we call it in common phrase, to the guilt of murder, it is not necessary that all of them should intend that a murder should be committed; if many persons are engaged in an illegal act, in a breach of the peace, or any assault which they do not intend shall end in murder, still, if murder is the event, it is equally murder in them all. Gentlemen, I shall now proceed to state to you the circumstances which led to this melancholy tragedy; on the 16th of February the prisoners at the bar, who had long been associates, and had infested the neighbourhood of Saffron-hill and Chick-lane, were assembled, all but Hubbard, in a publick-house at the corner of Chick-lane, known by the sign of the Crown and Anchor; about half past eight o'clock the prisoner Hubbard arrived: it is immaterial to state to you on what occasion he came there: the prisoner Frere brought in a cask of cherry brandy, which he desired the landlord to purchase of him; for reasons which were very good ones, the landlord refused to purchase it, upon which Frere spiled the cask, and gave some to the prisoners: about nine o'clock, inflamed probably with liquor,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179203290017"/>they all sallied forth to the door of that publick-house, and there they stood in a very riotous mob, accompanied by several prostitutes of the lowest order; while they were standing there a man of the name of Davis was passing along; the first act (and, gentlemen, I state this, not for the purpose of influencing your minds against the prisoners, but for the purpose of marking to you, that those who will come by and by to identify the prisoners, had the means of knowing them; they had the means of fixing their attention) a poor man, of the name of Davis, a coal-porter, was knocked down by some of this gang without the smallest provocation: I mention this only because Davis will be called to you as a witness; he will be called to identify some of the persons at the bar, and that they were so assembled: very soon after this a man of the name of Connor, a day labourer, was returning to his lodging, within a few doors, he was under the necessity, from the narrowness of the place, to pass through this gang of persons; they hustled him; and he made use of an expression, d - n you, what are you at? why do not you let people go along; upon this they fell upon him with their sticks; they beat him in a very violent manner, and he at last escaped into the Crown and Anchor; he represented his alarm, stated his fear of going home, and he begged somebody would protect him home, imagining that the presence of anybody with whom they were acquainted would keep them in order; the master was gone to bed, and the waiter could not leave the house: the poor man waited there till he thought these people were dispersed, and then he came out: I stated first these persons had beat him with their sticks, and at that time no other instrument appears to have been used; but on his coming out he found they were laying in wait for him; he found they were waiting for his coming; and as soon as he came within their reach they attacked him with drawn knives and sticks, and used him in the most cruel manner; the poor man scrambled to his lodging: he lodged at a house with a man of the same name, Connor; and Conner and the unfortunate deceased, Hosty, came out to his assistance; and as soon as they came out they were attacked by different persons, cut with their knives, and mangled in a terrible manner; at last Hosty, who had been cut and mangled, got to the door of a Mr. Carey, a grocer, he fell, and in falling, partly in the house and partly out of it, it will be proved to you by many witnesses, but particularly by Mrs. Carey, who has no doubt of the person; that as he fell, the prisoner Hubbard gave him the wound which occasioned his death; that he gave, as it appeared to her, the whole force of his body to the blow, and he accompanied it with the most horrid and violent expressions, which it is not material to state to you; they are such as make one's nature shudder, expressing the deliberate purpose of destroying this unfortunate victim: gentlemen, the poor man fell at the door wounded by the knife of Hubbard; he had pursued him to that door, he was followed by some of his associates, and he had the barbarity to jump and tread on the head and breast of the poor man; in this situation, glorying in what he had done, boasting of it, he will be described by several witnesses; gentlemen, at last the poor man was dragged into the house, and Mrs. Carey, imagining that her sex might possibly disarm the fury of these ruffians, went to the door, and desired them to go away; Hubbard was then dancing and jumping with his knife in his hand, and using the most horrid expressions, that he would have him out; he went away, and came back accompanied by several of his associates; he swore the b - y b - r was in the house, he was sure, and would have him out; gentlemen, upon this Carey and his family were alarmed for their own safety, and Carey went for a constable; and I mention this fact to you, cautioning you against accumulating this to the guilt of the prisoners at the bar; God knows, if they are guilty of the murder, it requires no aggravation of their case; but for the purpose of shewing that the witnesses who will swear to their persons, had the means<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179203290018"/>of knowing them; he made use of this expression to Carey, you will go for a constable, will you! blast you, we will give it you; and he immediately attacked Mr. Carey, and he was knocked down by these people; the wife and Fisher, a lodger, ran out to his assistance; he was laying on the ground, crying out murder, and the prisoner and some others kicking him as he lay on the ground; at that time Hubbard, Armstrong, and Jones were standing over him; Jones was attempting to jump on him; Fisher pushed him away, and had a violent blow on his head; at this time some of them exclaimed, d - n you, draw your knives: gentlemen, after this the poor man was taken to a house in the neighbourhood, and from thence to the hospital, for a few days, when he died most unquestionably of the wound that had been given him: the question, therefore, that you have to decide is, whether you can trust to the testimony of the witnesses; if you believe them, if you believe them persons deserving of credit, if you believe they tell their stories in a manner not to excite suspicion, not to excite an apprehension that they are imposing upon you, if you believe they are not mistaken, it will be your duty to pronounce him guilty of the murder, and it will be also your duty to pronounce what share all the other prisoners had in the transaction: the evidence against them is undoubtedly extremely different; as to some of them it will be proved by many witnesses, as to others there will be fewer persons, and those to whom they will swear will be less connected in the transaction: I will direct your attention to some of those against whom undoubtedly the evidence does not appear to be so pregnant; with respect to the prisoner Savage, he was one of those who composed the gang in Brewhouse-yard, but I am not able to connect him with the door of Mr. Carey, or with the actual time of the murder; I am sure if any merciful distinction can be made, it will be made, and urged to your consideration by the highest possible authority; gentlemen, with respect to one of the prisoners I shall be able to prove by one witness, that, if he was not connected with the murder, he was afterwards, while the windows were breaking, one of those that were standing there and laughing at the transaction; with respect to the rest, I shall prove them guilty, I am afraid, by many witnesses: and, gentlemen, it is lamentable indeed that the law has called upon you to make so many victims to publick justice; you and I have nothing to do with that; it is your duty and mine to attend honestly and fairly to the consideration of the facts; and though the consequence of your verdict may be the offering up to publick justice and society many victims, though it may inflict you with pain, yet it will not induce you to swerve from your duty; and though your situation be undoubtedly a very unpleasant one, yet you will meet that situation like me, and discharge it like honest men, looking neither to the right hand nor to the left, but doing your duty as the evidence shall compel you: gentlemen, I shall call the witnesses, many of whom have felt terror in coming forward; but I hope they will learn that they are under the protection of the Court, and that nothing can happen to them for telling the truth; and God forbid they should state either more or less: gentlemen, I shall now proceed to call the witnesses in support of the facts I have related to you, and I doubt not but on the result of the whole, your verdict will be such as to meet the approbation of the publick.</p>

               <p>I am a waiter at the Crown and Anchor the corner of Chick-lane, and was so the 16th of Feb. last; I know the prisoners, and saw all of them on that day; they were there the middle of the day and all the day but Hubbard, who did not come till eight or nine, some little I think before nine, and Douglas not after five or six. They staid in our house after Hubbard came in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179203290019"/>about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes; they, to the best of my knowledge, had a little bit of a cag with some liquor in it, that was Frere; they drank some of the liquor, and Dildale had some beer; I remember Armstrong going out first and they all absconded the house about ten minutes before nine; I never saw them again that night. After they were gone out about three or four minutes, I heard a woman cry out murder, and then the man that is here, Connor, came into our house running, with his nose and mouth bleeding, as with a blow, not a cut; I cannot say I know any of the people that followed him; I did not see Connor after that time; I did not go out after, I kept the door bolted.</p>

I asked Miles for his master; he was gone to bed; I went into the parlour; I continued a few minutes; I had not a mind to drink; I looked out and saw nobody; in going out in about half a score yards they attacked me a second time; I did not see the knife, but I saw the bludgeons; but I received this cut over the cheek (a long scar) and another cut over the mouth, either by a knife or a tool; I called out for relief; some of them were round me, and my landlord came and took me in doors; I did not see the deceased then; I observed

               <p>I am a butcher, No. 13, Field-lane. On the 16th of February, about nine in the evening, I heard a squall by a woman; I ran to the corner of Chick-lane, and saw a man run with a blue jacket and trowsers on, that was the deceased, and another man in a light-coloured coat, and I followed him; they ran up Saffron-hill, when they came to Mr. Carey's door the deceased slipt and fell down; the man that pursued him, whom I believe to be Hubbard, I cannot be positive to his face, but every other appearance was like him; he gave him three or four kicks, and gave him three or four strokes with his right hand on his right buttock, which was uppermost, drawing his hand backwards and forwards; he put his hands against the two half-doors and kicked him in doors, and the doors were shut; after that the man that I supposed to be Hubbard, I cannot say exactly, he called him a bloody b - r; he got into the middle of the road and called out you b - rs bring me a pistol, and he swore he would shoot the bloody b - r: he ran down Saffron-hill directly, I saw him come up the hill again in three or four minutes; there were several came with him, I do not know any of them; he returned to Carey's house and said the bloody b - r was there; he would have him out, and there was a skirmish some few minutes, then they returned down to Harris's shop; I cannot say I saw any of these people at the Taylor's shop. After the riot was all over, I saw Frere at the Crown and Anchor calling to them; he was in a smock frock, and five minutes after I saw him upon the hill with the smock frock off.</p>
               <p>Court. You seem to have been a witness to what passed for a considerable space of time; now making use of all your recollection, can you with moral certainty recollect the person of Hubbard? - I cannot say with certainty to any person; but this man Frere and Hubbard as I think.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you pretty sure it was him? - I really think it was him.</p>
               <p>Court. When you saw him at the magistrate's did you think he was the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you now any doubt about his being the man? - I have no doubt but what he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hubbard. Whether he knew me before, or whether he goes by my having a white coat on? - I never saw him before; but by every appearance of the shape and make of him, I rather think him to be the man, by rather bending his knees.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You said nothing at Bow-street? - I was not called to give evidence there.</p>

               <p>My husband is a grocer on Saffron-hill. On the 16th of February, about five minutes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179203290021"/>before nine, a man fell into the door: we were at supper: that person was Jordan Hosty, the deceased; as I was sitting at supper the prisoner Hubbard was stamping on him with the heel of his foot: the deceased's head and shoulders were inside the door, and the lower part of his body laying out: the prisoner Hubbard appeared to me to aim at his face, but stamped on the breast and stomach; I did not observe him repeat the blow, but he offered to strike him once or twice; I went to the door, and Hubbard rather drew back, and the deceased got up and passed me, and went up part of our stairs; then I pushed Hubbard from the door, and he caught hold of my hair, and pulled me off the step of the door upon the pavement; then he stood in the middle of the street, and swore he would have that b - y rogue out; I said the man did not belong to us, and he should come out, we did not want him there; he put himself into many attitudes, and put his hand into his waistcoat pocket and took out something, but I cannot tell what it was; he said, the first that came nigh him he would stab: he turned himself round after standing about five minutes, seeming to be in a great passion, and swearing he would have the man out, and ran down the street.</p>
               <p>I would trouble you to look at him again. - Sir, I am positive to his person.</p>
               <p>You are positive to his person? - Indeed I am, I am sure he was the man that was stamping on the man that lay on the steps; I looked particularly at him, he took up my whole attention by the manner of his behaviour.</p>
               <p>How soon afterwards did you see him at Bow-street? - I believe it was about a week.</p>
               <p>Did you immediately recollect him? - As soon as ever I saw him go up from the bench I recollected his person immediately.</p>
               <p>Was he sitting alone or pointed out to you? - No, Sir, he was sitting alone.</p>
               <p>Had you at that time, have you now, or have you at any time entertained any doubt about his person? - Not the least.</p>
               <p>During all this transaction were there any persons at the door? - I did not see any besides him: after he ran down Saffron-hill I went into the house, the deceased was concealed under the stairs, by Mr. Cary and Mr. Sheen (a lodger) I said now is your time to go your ways, for the man that has been using you ill is gone down the street; and the deceased looked very earnestly in my face but did not say a word; while I was talking to him, Hubbard was the first person that came to the door again.</p>
               <p>Were there any persons in company with him? - Yes there were some men came up with him but I do not recollect any of the others.</p>
               <p>Court. At this time, when Hubbard went, do you know whether the deceased had received any wound? - Yes, he had received a wound over the face, and I believe he had received the wound of which he died. - When Hubbard came back again he jumped and said the bloody rogue was in there, fetch him out: they would have him out; Mr. Sheen recommended to my husband to go for a constable, and they went away from the door; I believe Hubbard was the first that went after my husband; I heard they had knocked him down, and I went two or three doors and my husband was laying on the ground and holding up his left hand crying out murder!</p>
               <p>Court. Any thing that passed after the fatal blow is not material to be enquired into.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Carey. When I came back the deceased was gone, I never saw him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hubbard. You do not go by my having a white coat on? - No, I go by your face.</p>
               <p>I have lived three years on Saffron-hill, four doors from you? - I never saw you before.</p>

               <p>I was at home this evening; I went to the door, but not close: on the 16th of February last, a few minutes before nine, as I sat at supper, I was greatly alarmed by a man falling against my door; I went up, and saw a man with stout thick legs, and a lightish drab coat, but rather darker by wear, it was a very old one; I cannot be sure to Hubbard, but there is none other of the prisoners so much like him; I saw that man kicking the man that lay on the ground as hard as he possibly could; I then went towards the door, but my wife went first; she laid hold of the man that was kicking by the shoulders, and they both went out of doors; the man got up, and he ran up stairs; and a lodger of mine, whose name is Sheen, met the man, and said, you shall not come here; what do you want? For God's sake, says the man, do not turn me out; if you turn me out, they will murder me: I stood at the bottom of the stairs, and the man seemed to address himself to me; Master (he was an Irishman), do not turn me out, they will murder me; I have done nothing, I never touched nor offended any of them: I looked upon it as this, that they had been a fighting, and, as the common phrase is, the man had had enough, and gave out; says I, Poor man! you seem shockingly hurt indeed; for I suppose he spilled a pint of blood from his nose, for I saw no other wound; I observed the wound across the nose very plain, it seemed to me as if I could put my finger in it; at that time I was struck more with horror than pity, the man appeared so very ghastly; says I, poor man, go under the stairs, I will go to the door and see what is the matter; while I was talking to him, the man, who he was I cannot say, came back; says he, the bl - y rogue is here; the bl - y b - r, I will have him out: I went and fetched a constable; and the same man that was stamping on the other came up to me again; I have never seen a man since, in all the times since the affair happened, like Hubbard.</p>
               <p>Does he fully answer the impression which your mind made on itself at the time? - Yes; and another thing I took notice of, he spoke, for a little man, very strong.</p>
               <p>Then, upon the whole, you have a strong belief that he is the man, but you do not mean to swear positively? - No, Sir, I do not mean to swear positively; but, if he is not the man, he is as much like him as two peas can be matched.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hubbard. Is he positive it wanted ten minutes of nine? - Yes, I will tell you why; I seldom come from my father-in-law's till nine; but I had not posted our day-book, and it wanted nine minutes of nine when I came home, and I sat down immediately to supper, and I had not had any thing; I saw your legs kicking the man; I do not positively swear that you are the same, but I firmly and sincerely believe it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. What time did I leave your company after I was dismissed this Court? -</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I can say it was this day.</p>
               <p>Court. What time did he leave your company? - Very near nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - I live on Holywell-mount, near Shoreditch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Where did you go to from Newgate first? - Over the way to the public-house, and from thence to the Cock in the Corner on Ludgate-hill, and he stopped there and drank; he left us there.</p>
               <p>Before nine o'clock? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The Cock on Ludgate-hill every body knows is not two minutes and a half walk from Saffron-hill? - I do not know, I never was there before.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect seeing the prisoner Hubbard on the day he was discharged from this place? - Yes, I saw him between eight and nine in the public-house, the Cock in the Corner.</p>

               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury: we are now arrived to that period of the case that demands your attention; and by whomsoever it has been suggested, or on whatsoever occasion it may have been suggested, that it is uncandid to complicate together in one charge different persons, because it may distract the attention of jurors, it is ignorance, to say no more of it; for if the case connects them together, if the facts connect them, the prosecution arising out of those facts must necessarily connect them: where the facts may all of them be brought before the Court without complicating different persons in it, it is always convenient to keep the charges apart, that the attention of those who are to decide may not be distracted by different parts of the charge; but in this case it could not have been conducted otherwise than it has been; the case itself, as stated prima facie, attempts to connect all those persons in one integral act, committed at one time, and ascribing to all of them large portions of guilt, which is the guilt of some person; but, happily for those that are to decide, it is rid of all complicated circumstances; because it is fit to tell you, Gentlemen, that, as far as my observation has gone, I think that the prosecution, though fit to be inquired into with respect to all the persons that have been placed before you for your judgement, so far has failed, with respect to all except Hubbard, that I am not aware that there are any circumstances whatever that will warrant me in stating to you, in a question upon which you are to decide on the lives of these men - that there any circumstances that will attach on any of the parties besides Hubbard: Gentlemen, the law was with great accuracy laid down by the learned counsel, who opened the case on the part of the prosecution, with candour, with abilities, and with clearness; and he stated to you that which I do perfectly subscribe to, that if several persons meet together for any illegal purpose, although the purpose which they intend to perpetrate may not amount to felony, yet if so associated together, they are all of them intangled in the consequences, however enormous, however they may be enhanced beyond their first intention; and I concur further with him, in stating, that though the indictment may charge one person with giving the mortal wound, yet if the others are associated with him in the perpetration of their illegal purpose, it is of no consequence; though the mortal wound may be given by the hand of another, yet all of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179203290025"/>them are answerable, even to murder, for the blow given by another person: Gentlemen, I do this for the sake of stating to a pretty crouded audience, and for the sake of those other persons at the bar, that they may hereafter bear about them in their minds how necessary it is to refrain from keeping bad company, and embarking in any bad purpose; they ought to know in what peril they stand, if they associate with those who are embarked in illegal purposes, that it will be of no moment to say, I had no intention to kill; the answer of the Judge, by the Jury, will be, it is of no consequence your intention, you was embarked in illegal purposes, and all of you are answerable for the wound: Now, gentlemen, with that preface, I will proceed to state to you the evidence against these parties: [Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence, and then added] Gentlemen, this is the evidence which is called on the behalf of the prosecution; and, as I before said, I do not think this evidence contains any distinct facts strong enough to involve any of the persons in the guilt which is ascribed to them all by the indictment, except Hubbard; for it does not appear that, at the time when they were in the public-house, they had agreed to go out to commit violence; how the violence arose you are only to collect from the evidence given; and there is nothing, in my apprehension, that involves them: Now, with respect to the case of Hubbard, the lenity of the laws of the country in which we live, in various cases, though homicide happens, indulges the passions and weaknesses of the nature which we carry about us; it is not the consequence, that because a man is killed, that the hand by which he died is involved in the crime of murder; but it becomes the party to furnish the Jury with circumstances which shall in some measure apologize for what he has done, and reduce the offence to that of a less denomination than that of murder; now, in looking at this case again and again, I am not aware that any such circumstances exist; if there had been any provocation given, and men's minds had been heated, and the hand that gave the fatal blow is of his guard, owing to something that happened, this, though not sufficient completely to excuse his guilt, but to be some apology in the eye of that law which indulges the passions of men to a certain degree; if any such circumstances had existed in this case, they ought to have been laid before you; but I do not find that is the case; then how is the fact, if it comes unapologized for, and unreduced in the eye of the criminal jurisprudence of the country? That the deceased died by violence is proved, that he died by the hand of somebody is certain; but that will not be sufficient to impute blame to any person, unless the guilt of that particular person is ascertained by evidence; and, in order to do that, you have the witnesses, three or four of whom prove, and two of them speaking with positiveness, that Hubbard was the man that pursued him, that was upon him inflicting violence at the door of Carey; all the witnesses, and it is not at all to be wondered at, in a tumult, in the midst of a mob, that they did not distinctly see every act of violence that was committed; but, however, the case is not destitute of every degree of proof, because one of the witnesses, namely Hardy, swore, that, besides the kicking, he saw the hand of the person going backwards and forwards two or three times, and that that part of his body which was wounded was uppermost at the time; and though not of import singly, yet combined together it may be of much import; and you will recollect, that afterwards, when he was pursued, and apprehended the ministers of justice were after him, that he took something, which was not seen, out of his waistcoat pocket; but that it was something capable of stabbing is pretty clear, because he said he would stab any one that attempted to take him: You, gentlemen, are in arduous circumstances certainly; for though the case may not be of great difficulty, yet one pauses before one decides on the fate of a fellow-creature; and in this case are the issues of life and death, with respect to this man, in your hands; but you are not to shrink from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179203290026"/>your duty, you must meet it, as the learned counsel said, manfully and fairly; you must remember that, notwithstanding all the feelings of your minds, with respect to false mercy, you owe a justice to your country; and if this man is the man that shed the blood of one of his fellow-creatures, he must answer it with his own blood; and the good policy of the country, and the actual existence of a state of society, cannot exist, if, after such crimes are detected, they are not punished: you are to ascertain it: the circumstances are strong, they are given by witnesses not impeached; and the contradiction attempted to be given to them for the prisoner is certainly no contradiction at all; all that those witnesses have said may be perfectly true, and yet the case for the prosecution stand wholly unimpeached: Gentlemen, in your hands, it remains to decide on the prisoner's fate, discharging at the same time the duty you owe to the unhappy man, and not forgetting the duty you owe to the publick.</p>

            . On Tuesday, the 13th of March, Smith and Carr came to our shop; they both came in together, and as companions; it was between three and four o'clock; Carr desired to look at some gold seals; and I took out several, and I proceeded to a sixth, which he said was the right one; my attention was taken off to some other customers, of the name of Mr. and Mrs. Parker; Smith said to Carr, have you done? Carr said, yes; and they both immediately went out of the shop; they had not only not purchased, but not asked the price of any thing; I thought they left me very abruptly, and I looked on the counter and perceived there were only five seals, though I had taken out six: the two prisoners kept close together, but Smith generally stood with his back to the counter, which gave him a command of the other side of the shop, where Mrs. Parker and Mrs. Janaway were behind the counter; I told Mr. Janaway, who just then came into the shop; and that they had stole the seals; he went out and brought them back in two or three minutes; they both at first were accused of having stolen the seals; they both denied it: the constable, Hillier, was sent for; when they saw Mr. Janaway was determined to commit them, they both of them offered to pay for the seal, and desired to know the price of it; I cannot say which spoke first; I believe I told them the price of the seal, because I knew the particular one that was gone; the price was two guineas and a half; but Mr. Janaway said, he would not take any money; if they were to offer him one thousand pounds he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179203290049"/>would not accept it; they whispered several times together, and much wished to have private conversations with Mr. Janaway or Mr. Hilliard; Smith went once to Mr. Janaway into our private door passage, but I was not present; Mr. Janaway told them he was determined to commit them; but I should observe one thing, they took out their money and joined it together, which did not amount quite to twenty shillings; but one of them, I cannot say which, offered his watch as a security; that of course was undoubtedly refused; Mr. Janaway said, he only wanted his property; Mrs. Janaway was in the shop, and might see what passed; she is not here; on a coach being called, the two prisoners, Smith and Carr, Hilliard the constable, Mr. Janaway, and myself, got into the coach: it was ordered to drive to the Compter: Smith and Carr whispered together again in the coach; and then Carr said to Mr. Janaway, if the seal is produced shall it all end? will you let us go? Mr. Janaway replied, he would make them no promise whatever: Hilliard, I think, or Mr. Janaway, asked Carr if the seal could be produced immediately? Carr said it could; Smith proposed that Mr. Janaway should let him and the other prisoner go, and Hilliard to make himself answerable for the return of the seal to Mr. Janaway; Mr. Hilliard said, that was impossible, as he had never seen the seal, nor did he know it: the coach stopped at the Compter door; but instead of going in, Carr desired it might drive to the Cape Coast Castle, in Leadenhall-street; but Hillard said that was so bad a house that he would not go there; and I think Hilliard mentioned some house in Lombard-street; the coach went on to the publick-house in Leadenhall-street; there Hilliard and Carr got out for the purpose of fetching the seal, leaving Smith with us; they came back in about ten minutes; Hilliard said he knew the person that had got the seal, it was one Garland; two other men returned to the coach with Hilliard and Carr; one of them, whose name is Polock, offered to do anything to assist Carr; Polock was desired by Carr to go to the Half Moon, in Aldersgate-street, to see Garland, and to tell him to stop there till we come; the coach was then ordered to Aldersgate-street; as we were going to Jewin-street it stopped, without any orders from withinside; Polock, and the other man that we had seen in Leadenhall-street first, came up to the coach window, as it drew up to the pavement; they did not come close to the window, they stood opposite, with their backs against the houses; they were instantly joined by Garland; that was the first time I ever saw him; he looked into the coach, and then withdrew behind the back pannel of the coach; I was sitting with my face to the horses, so that I, in consequence, lost sight of him; at the very instant of his withdrawing almost, a glove was put into the coach by a hand, which came from the part to which he had withdrawn; I could see nothing but the hand; the glove was given into the hand of Carr, and in it I saw Carr take out of the glove the gold seal; it was not put in the glove, but wrapped in it; I wished to see Garland again; and I looked through the little round window behind the coach, and I saw him coming from behind the coach to the other side of the way.</p>
               <p>Are you positive then that Garland is the man that delivered in the glove at the coach window? - Quite positive.</p>
               <p>No doubt about it? - Not the least in the world. As the coach was drawing up Hilliard sat next to the pavement, and he said, here comes Garland with the seal; the prisoners wished to be released; Mr. Janaway said, he could not think of doing that, he should commit them, and put them under the jurisdiction of the Lord Mayor: I have the seal; it has been in my possession ever since; (produced and deposed to) I am sure that was the sixth seal which Carr approved off; it has been in the house I should suppose, six years; I have repeatedly brushed it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Leach, counsel for prisoner Smith.</p>
               <p>What time of day was it? - Between three and four.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179203290050"/>Smith never appeared in the character of a purchaser? - Not at all.</p>

               <p>I am in partnership with Mr. Wetherall. I saw six seals on the counter, and my man said, Sir, they have got a seal; Carr and Smith were standing near, but Lacey was standing, with his back to the other, seeming to me to wish to divert our attention from Carr; I pursued them, and told them they had taken a seal, and insisted on their coming back; they had turned up the passage to the market; they totally denied it both of them; I sent for the constable; I had them both searched; nothing was found upon them; Lacey, that is Smith, was the first person that called me aside; he asked me if the seal was produced, whether all would stop? I told him I would have no private negotiation whatever with him, and immediately withdrew from him; they offered to pay any money for the seal, and pressed me very much to take the money for the seal; I said, if you would give me a thousand guineas I will not take it; they both of them made me that offer; but Lacey was more solicitous than Carr; I think it was Smith that proposed the seal should be forth coming in half an hour; after some conversation, Hilliard said, can the seal be produced? and Carr said, it could, and if they would drive to the sign of the Cape Coast Castle he would get the seal; but Hilliard said, it was an infamous house, and my life would be in danger, and they would not permit me to go; then they drove to another house in Leadenhall-street, and Hilliard and Carr got out; and when they returned Hilliard said, I know who has the seal, a man of the name of Garland; two men were standing at the door of this publick-house, one named Polock, who is here; Carr desired Polock to go to the house in Aldersgate-street, where he would find Garland, and to tell him to stop there till the coach came there; going down Jewin-street the coach suddenly stopped; not by any orders from us; and immediately I saw two men come up, Polock and another man; Hilliard said, as the coach was stopping, here comes Garland with the seal; then I saw Garland come up; he went to the back part of the coach, and presently there came a hand into the coach with a glove, but whose hand it was I cannot say; that glove contained the seal; the prisoners were taken to the Compter; Garland was apprehended by order of the Lord Mayor, the next day but one; it is our seal, the property of myself and partner; I have had it five or six years; it is what we call an old shop-keeper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I ask you whether you do not know Carr to be a young man very respectably related and very decently brought up? - Yes; I am sorry to know it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Leach. I believe the prisoner Smith stated him to be a man of fortune and character? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did Smith appear at all to interfere with respect to the purchase of the seal? - No: I looked upon him as a thief when he came into the shop; he wanted to divert my attention.</p>
               <p>In the coach, as you was going along, I believe you thanked him, and was obliged to him for his interference? - I may have said things improperly.</p>
               <p>Did not you in terms thank him? - I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>Did not you say so in terms?</p>
               <p>Prisoner Smith. You will pardon me, Sir, when I observe he has a very convenient memory.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. When the man came into the shop, I formed a very different opinion of him to what I do now; I considered that victim in the middle, Carr, to be a guilty man; but I believe him now to be drawn in by the other two villains.</p>
               <p>Then there was nothing in the appearance of Smith of a guilty man at the time? - No; but he urged more particularly that it would be the ruin of him if he was to go before a magistrate; he said that Carr was a man of fortune.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Smith. Did not you say that you were very unhappy to have me committed, but that the next day you would do your endeavours to have me liberated? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179203290051"/>I did represent to the magistrate that it was through you I got my seal.</p>
               <p>I think you stated that Smith remained with you in the coach? - Lacey offered me any money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, prisoner Garland's counsel.</p>
               <p>How long a time might elapse from the time you set off from your door to Jewin-street? - About forty or fifty minutes.</p>
               <p>The person, whoever it was, that put the glove in the coach you did not see? - No; I only saw a hand.</p>
               <p>You understood that Polock knew Garland? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had the coach stopped in Jewin-street before Polock came up or afterwards? - Polock came up with another man, and I suppose was the means of the coach stopping.</p>
               <p>How long after do you suppose that Garland came up? - Immediately.</p>

               <p>When I went into the shop I saw Carr and Smith; I knew Carr very well; Smith I had seen: Mr. Janaway desired I would take these two men backwards, and search them; I searched them very correctly, and I was convinced they had nothing about them; Mr. Janaway did not seem satisfied, and thought they had it about them; I searched them a second time; in the course of the second search the prisoner Carr seemed desirous to make Mr. Janaway satisfaction for the seal, by offering to pay for it; Mr. Janaway declined it; and Smith repeatedly said, if you know any thing of the seal let the gentleman have it; we were half an hour in this way; Mr. Janaway at last gave me charge of them; the coach was called; we got into it; I desired Mr. Janaway and his young gentleman to accompany me to the Compter; the prisoner Carr said, if we go to the publick-house I think I shall be able to get it for you; where shall we drive to? says Carr, we will drive to the Cape Coast Castle; that is a house which I knew; it is frequented by several bad people; I did not think the place fit to take a gentleman to; and we drove to the City Arms, in Lombard-street; the person was not there, and we drove to the Bull's-head, in Leadenhall-street; when we got out of the coach, I said to Carr, where are you going, says he, I am going to Chapman's; says he, if I can see Garland I shall get the seal; I have known Garland a number of years; we went to Chapman's; he was not there; we returned to the coach and drove to the Half Moon, Aldersgate-street; turning the corner of Jewin-street I saw Garland at a distance; says I, here comes Garland: I had seen Polock in Leadenhall-street; the prisoner Carr had desired Polock to look for Garland; I believe I said here comes Garland with the seal; in an instant Garland came to the coach-door, Mr. Janaway and I and Gregg sat with our faces to the horses; Garland retired to the hind pannel of the coach, so that we lost sight of him, and in a minute a glove was put into the coach, that glove was given to Carr, Carr gave it to Mr. Janaway, and out of that glove came the seal.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe you know that Carr has been very well brought up? - I have known Carr, not intimately; but I say upon my oath I have been fourteen years with Mr. West, at the Poultry-compter, and I declare he has never been in custody there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Leach. Carr was seemingly very desirous to make satisfaction, and Smith said, If you know any thing of the seal, give it to the gentleman? - He certainly did.</p>
               <p>And seemed very anxious Carr should restate the seal, if he had it? - He certainly did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Janaway at that time did declare that he really thought Smith was innocent? - He did.</p>
               <p>Did he make use of any terms expressive of his satisfaction? - He said, he was very sorry for Smith.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Smith. Did you hear the prosecutor at any time say, Why give him trouble? - The prosecutor said, when terms were offered to him, I will accept of none; all I want is my property.</p>
               <p>Did you think Carr would have been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179203290052"/>liberated, on production of the seal, or detained? - Mr. Janaway using the expression, all I want is my seal: he always, from the first moment, seemed very favourable to you, but very much against Carr.</p>
               <p>Did he not say, that it was merely on my account, and my honest behaviour, that he had gone so far, and given himself so much trouble? - Something of that sort was mentioned, but the words I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Garland. Whether or not there were not three men at the coach side besides myself? - There were two or three; two I saw.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Smith. Did I at any time express my knowledge of those houses that you spoke of? - No, I do not recollect that you did.</p>

               <p>Do you remember being applied to by Mr. Carr to go any where on this day? - I was to go to Cape Coast Castle to see for Garland; I came back to the Black Bull, in Leadenhall-street, I said he was not there; he desired me to go to the Half Moon in Aldersgate-street to tell Mr. Garland to wait there till he came; going along I met Mr. Garland the corner of Philpot-lane, London-wall; says I, Mr. Carr wants you at the Half Moon, he is coming there in a coach; going along Jewin-street the coach overtook us, and Mr. Carr saw Garland, and he said Mr. Garland I want that there as I gave you; and Mr. Garland took a glove out of his hat that he had on his head, with a false lining, and put the glove into the coach.</p>

               <p>Did they appear to be looking about the shop in any way that made an impression on you? - Yes, I thought they looked rather suspicious; they went in together; they continued in some little time, not a great while; they came out again together, one after another, in a great hurry; I saw the stoutest of the two, that is Carr, give something to a tall person in the street, and that person immediately ran.</p>
               <p>How near was the other gentleman in blue to the short man at the time he gave something to the tall man? - They were running one after another as near as they could: Mr. Janaway brought them back again almost immediately.

               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, my friend has a great many more to character; I know Mr. North to be a very respectable man; as far as character goes, you may suppose he has called one hundred respectable witnesses.</p>

               <p>My Lord, if you will permit me to trespass on your patience while I represent facts, which, I trust, will impress your Lordship and the Jury with the clearest idea of my innocence; I had been returning from Greenwich, and unfortunately met Mr. Carr; he asked me to walk with him, I readily complied; I went with him; we had some little discourse respecting the lottery; he said he had great success; he had a watch without a seal, we went in to see some seals: however Mr. Janaway may prevaricate himself, they entirely exculpated me of any wish to divert their attention: on some disagreement Mr. Carr left the shop; I immediately left the shop, and followed him; prior to this there was a person in company with Carr; he did not go into the shop; he went to the front shop; Carr joined this man, shook hands, and bid him a good day: we proceeded a little way further, and Janaway followed us; he said he had lost his seal; and while I remained in the shop, the circumstance of this man being in company, I was under some agitation of mind; Mr. Janaway repeatedly exculpated me, gave me all those assurances that he wanted nothing with me, wanted nothing but his property; from those expressions, and the intimacy I had with Carr, induced me to say to him, If you have the gentleman's property, restore it to him: Hilliard joined in my entreaties, and said Carr, why not return the gentleman his property; under these solicitations, and under the influence as I then seemed, and as Hilliard repeatedly said at our examination; he said, you speak to him; I immediately said to Mr. Janaway, If Carr will produce your seal, will you drop the business; he said, I want nothing but my property; now they had entirely exculpated me with any knowledge of the houses to whom the coach was to drive to; at the time his seal was produced, I rather thought that Carr and myself should be liberated; I thought I merited thanks for the pains I took; he has thought proper since to change his opinion of me: whatever the verdict may be I must bow with resignation: the person's name in company was

               <p>I know the prisoner Smith; I was in company with him, Tuesday fortnight, the 13th of March, about nine in the morning, between nine and ten; we went to Greenwich together; he came to my house, and asked me to make him a pair of shoes; we returned from Greenwich, and were coming the right-hand side from Cheapside; we returned at three o'clock; there was Carr; he said, how do you do, Smith; it was in a passage, where they sell Burton-ale, in Cheapside; says he, I am going to buy a seal, I have had money in the lottery; I thought he was a gentleman that spoke to Smith; I heard every word that was said between them all the time; I think it was past three, to the best of my recollection; and they asked me whether I would go, and I said I must go home; another man came and said, how do you do altogether, or how do you do, gentlemen? Then I quitted them immediately: I know nothing of the felony, the least in the world.</p>
               <p>Did you, during this time, see Carr pull out a watch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Smith. Was it possible that Carr and I could have made any agreement to purloin any thing, without your privacy or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179203290054"/>knowledge? - No, I heard all the conversation.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What makes you recollect that it was the 17th of March in preference to any other day? - The 17th! it was the 13th, on Tuesday; I had an appointment, at home, with

               <p>Who is your landlord? - Mr. Martin; he is a taylor; I am a shoemaker; I work for my acquaintance; I do not keep any journeymen; and when I have not work enough of that, I work for any body that employs me.</p>
               <p>So then the first person that joined your friend Smith was Carr, and he pulled out his watch? - I do not know; that is him.</p>
               <p>Was that gentleman, the tall gentleman, Garland, the gentleman that came up? - I cannot say it was him.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, Sir? - I will take my oath that I never saw that man in my life till now.</p>
               <p>Very well? - That I will swear; what I say is not till now; and what I call not till now, is not to know him; I never was in company with Garland before till I saw him now, if I was to lose my life.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Lacey? - I do not know Mr. Lacey: I have known Mr. Smith near a twelvemonth; he has lived in Skinner-street, No. 2.</p>
               <p>Is he a married man? - For any thing I know; he is not my acquaintance or friend; I never was at his house, nor no where at all particularly.</p>
               <p>Why you have been at Greenwich together? - He lived at No. 2, Skinner-street, for some time, for any thing I know; I never was at his house I told you; he was married I always understood.</p>
               <p>And had many children? - I do not know that.</p>
               <p>How did you go to Greenwich? - Why, on foot.</p>
               <p>And returned on foot? - Yes, both of us together.</p>
               <p>Nobody else in company at all? - No.</p>
               <p>What trade did your friend follow, Mr. Smith? - A taylor.</p>
               <p>Worked for you? - No, never did any work for me in his life.</p>
               <p>How happened it now, think you, that the attorney found you out to subpoena you, because you never talked of this to any body? - Any body may find me out; I have lived twenty-eight years within five minutes walk of Charing-cross; I suppose Mr. Smith had told the attorney to go to Mr. Stout's.</p>
               <p>Was you here before ever? - No, Sir; nor never was in a cause, or a trial, before in my life.</p>

               <p>I live at Hoxton: I do not deal in horses. The prisoner was a servant of mine, he never brought me the horse, he came to me on the day after he should have come; I asked him where the horse was; he told me he had lost it: I asked him how; and he told me, a coachman was coming by, and frightened the horse so that he got out of his hand, and ran away, just before he got into Barnet: I turned away to let in a cart, and the prisoner was gone before I returned. I saw no more of him till nine at night; then I asked him where he had been; he said to Barnet, but could not hear any thing of the horse; the next day I went with him to Barnet, to make all the enquiry he could; I said, now shew me where you lost the horse; and he fixed on a place on this side of Barnet, which was the rising ground by the horse-fair; says I, you told me you lost the horse on the other side of Barnet; no, says he, I lost the horse here: I asked him what time he lost him; and he first told me it was just the dusk of the evening: the hostler at the inn asked him what time he lost him; and he then fixed upon between seven and eight at night. I enquired everywhere: he told me he had enquired at Whetstone turnpike, and at all the turnpikes; but the turnpike men denied it in his presence; but he said he did. I never saw the horse afterwards: I advertised him, and on Friday last a coachman came to me, and informed me of the horse.</p>
