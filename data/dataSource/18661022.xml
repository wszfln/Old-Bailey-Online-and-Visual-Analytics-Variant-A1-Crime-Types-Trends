I live in St. Helen's Place, Lower Whitecross Street—I live in the same house as Walter Mooney—on 2nd July it was as near as possible half-past ten when I came home from my work—I went to unlock my door, and his door was wide open—I spoke to his wife, and saw him lying on the bed as I stood at the door—I went to the chandler's shop to get some pickles at about a quarter to twelve o'clock, but was not absent more than four minutes, and as I came in I saw him still on the bed, which is opposite the door—I was about the passage or in my room the whole night—I went to the top to get some water, it was then past twelve, his door was open and I saw him again—he could not have got out of the house the whole night without my seeing him, because I have little things to do—I did not fasten the door—I can swear he never went out that night—I fastened up about twenty minutes past one.</p>

Put up your arms and fight if you are a man"—he struck Burke on the breast, and then on the mouth with his fist—Burke took him in custody—Pitfield then made a rush to seize Burke, but I caught hold of him to prevent his doing it, and as soon as I did that Pitfield drew back and struck me a blow across the head with Ashbrook's belt, which knocked my helmet off, which was taken away and has not been brought back—it stunned me, and the blood flowed—I was rendered insensible for a few minutes—I received several</p>

I am a clergyman of the Church of England, and reside at Ealing—I keep a boarding school for young gen<lb/>tleman—on Friday night, 28th September, I returned home by the half-past nine train from London—I reached home at ten minutes to ten—I found the house shut up as usual—the part of the boot-house that I examined was carefully shut up—it is at the extreme end of the house, doors open from it into the house—it is all under one roof—there are two outside doors to the boot-house—the one that opens into the open air was securely fastened—the other, which opens into the coal cellar, I did not examine—that door is fastened by a bar—that is the only fastening the coal house has—I was woke next morning about ten minutes to six by the ringing of the door bell—I went down and examined the premises, found the doors open, and missed eleven pairs of boots—a large portion of them I had not seen for some time before—they were the boys' Sunday boots—one pair I had seen the night before—I know both the prisoners, they have been in my employment and in the employment of other persons on the premises.</p>

I am a plumber, and live at No. 38, Queen Street, Brompton—about a little after eleven on the night of the 23rd Septem<lb/>ber I was in the Holloway Road, near St. John's Church, and saw the three prisoners coming up the footpath—I met them—Atkins came right up to me, and said, "We want some money"—I refused to give them any,</p>

I am a labourer, and live at No. 15, Brunswick Place, Upper Holloway—on Sunday night, 23rd September, from eleven o'clock to half-past, I was in the Holloway Road, and saw Atkins put his hands in the prosecutor's pocket—it Was a moonlight night, very clear—I stood about four yards from them—I did not say anything to them—I did not consider that the prosecutor was intoxicated—I was going home—when I saw Atkins put his hands in his pocket I went up to him, and asked how he came to do it, and then he went across the road and fetched the pole—I stood there all the while—they fetched the pole from a brokendown fence—when they said they would poleaxe him I went across the road, and said, "No, you won't poleaxe him while I am here," and Atkins said to the prosecutor, "If you touch me I shall poleaxe you with this piece of wood"—the prosecutor took hold of the stake, and Atkins again said he would poleaxe him.</p>

On Sunday night, 23rd September, about a quarter past eleven o'clock, I received information that a gentleman had been robbed near the "Horse and Groom" public-house—I went down the Holloway Road, and there saw the prosecutor standing in the road with the pole in his hand—from what he told me, I went and searched round several fields, but could not find the men—I took a description of them—at two o'clock in the morning I went to the back of the "Horse and Groom," and in a stable found all the three prisoners sleeping. together—I told them they were charged with robbing a man on the highway—Childs and Green said they knew nothing of it—Atkins made no remark in reference to the charge, but used disgusting language towards me—I got assistance, and they were taken to the station—Childs and Green there denied the charge, but Atkins said, "I admit to it, I did it, the other two know nothing about it; let them go and see after my horses"—that was when the charge was read over to him—the prosecutor had said in their presence, "I charge these three with stopping me and attempting to rob me"—Atkins had no horses of his own there—his master had some, that he was looking after.</p>

                  </hi> (Policeman 116 B). On the 23rd September, about two in the morning, I was with another constable in Queen's Road East—a woman told me something—I went towards George Street, and just before I got there heard some money rattling on the pavement—I turned the corner and saw Jones leaning against the shutters of a house—I could not see him till I turned the corner—Keefe was standing by him picking up some money, and Graham and another man ran away as soon as I ap<lb/>peared—I told Keefe to go away, because he had been creating several dis<lb/>turbance in the course of the evening—I did not know then what had hap<lb/>pened—Jones could not speak then, and I thought he was drunk, but after Keefe had gone, Jones made a communication to me, in consequence of which I ran after Keefe, and could not catch him, as he ran round into a courts—I went with Smith in search of the prisoners—I took Keefe, and shortly afterwards Graham—they were together when we took Keefe in the Grosvennor Road, but they were not apprehended together—that is about 200, yards from, where the robbery was—I did not take Keefe, because I had not had a description of him from Jones—they were walking deliberately along the street when I went up to them—Jones's trousers pocket was hanging out.</p>

Where did it happen?"—I said, "At the corner of George Street," and pointed out the spot—he said he was drunk on Chelsea Common at two o'clock in the morning, and that he could prove—Jones identified him as soon as he saw him.</p>

I was on duty in the Bridge Road about twenty minutes past ten, heard a cry of "Police!" and saw the prosecutor supported by two witnesses—the prisoner was pointed out as the man who stabbed him—I took him in custody, and Banks said, "He has the knife now in his hand"—I took this knife from his right hand—he said, "I have done it. What I have done I have done in self-defence. They had two knives"—he complained going to the station of being robbed of his money, which was in a red sock, by Banks—on searching him another knife was found in his trousers pocket—Chorley was sent away to the hospital in a cab—I was under the impression that I took a black horn handled knife from him, but he said, "No, it was the buckthorn handled knife I did it with."</p>

Mr. Neal said, "Yes, they are quite ready"—the prisoner spoke to the other man in a foreign language—Mr. Neal passed round the counter, and got this press and die and counterpart as it now appears—it is an octagonal die—the prisoner and Claramont examined it, and the</p>

               <p>prisoner said that it would do very well—Mr. Neal said to the prisoner, "Here is your screwdriver, for which I paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and gave it him—Mr. Neal did the press up with the die, and Claramont took possession of it, and took some money from his pocket, which he laid on the counter, and the prisoner shoved it up to Mr. Neal, who took it—they then turned round to leave and bade Mr. Neal good afternoon—the prisoner said that he should call again on Monday or Tuesday, and give further orders—I was all this time in the back parlour—I could not hear every<lb/>thing that passed—I left the shop two minutes after them, and found the prisoner, the two officers, and Claramont outside—I followed them to Tysoe Street, Wilmington Square, Clerkenwell, where they both went into Mr. Manuel's, a brassfounder—they were in there a minute and a half or two minutes—I was going in and met them coming out—I walked in front of them to Farringdon Road, and the two officers were behind them—the prisoner and Claramont walked arm in arm—on arriving at the corner of Calthorpe Terrace, Farringdon Road, finding they were close to me, I turned round and said, "I am a police inspector, and those are two police officers," pointing to the officers behind them—the prisoner said, "Oh! my God, it is a bad job"—I told them I should charge them with being concerned with a man in custody in committing frauds on the Spanish government—the other two officers took the prisoners, and I took this press (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from under Claramont's arm—he re<lb/>sisted, I called the assistance of some gentlemen passing, and then ordered the constables to search the prisoner—I searched Claramont, and found in his coat pocket this round die and the counterpart, one on steel and the other on copper, this pocket-book, containing a large portion of a genuine Spanish note with the signature torn off, this envelope, on which are the impressions of the two dies, the round die and the octagonal one, a number of letters, some Bank of England notes, and some gold, which has been given up to him—I afterwards went to 91, Guildford Street, Russell Square—I had previously seen the prisoner and Claramont go in and out there—the landlady showed me a bedroom there, in which I found a portmanteau containing this type case (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I also found some brass figures which fit into the type case, and will make figures similar to these large figures on the genuine note—I have tried them—I also found in a book in his box this piece of paper, with some figures impressed upon it in dirty blue ink.</p>

I gave Mr. Neal instructions in September, and with another constable watched his shop, 19, Perceval Street—on 24th September I went into the shop—Knowles remained out-side—I went into the back parlour, and while I was there the prisoner came in with Claramont—it was then a few minutes past three—I heard what passed—the prisoner said to Mr. Neal, "Good afternoon"—they went into the shop, and said, "Is the die as nigh like the note?"—Mr. Neal said that he believed it was—the prisoner then asked Mr. Neal the price of a press—I could not catch the price—he then asked the scale of it—Mr. Neal said, "15lbs." (the scale is the pressure)—the prisoner asked if that would be sufficient pressure—Mr. Neal said that he believed that it would—the prisoner said, "I suppose this one will be more money?"—Mr. Neal said, "Yes; 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more"—when they left I followed them into Guildford Street, where they joined a man not in custody, and when close to the doorstep of No. 91 I saw the prisoner put what I believe to be a die into the other man's hand—it was not wrapped up—the other man looked at it, and the prisoner said, "It is done very nicely"—they all went into No. 91, and remained there some time—the prisoner and the third man then came out, and went to No. 3, Guildford Place, where I left them—on Saturday, 29th September, Knowles and I were standing outside Neal's shop, when Potter went in—I saw the prisoner and Claramont go in about three o'clock, and saw them come out—Potter came out after them—I followed them to Mr. Manuel's, in Tysoe Street—they came out again, and went to Farringdon Road, where I took the prisoner—he said, "My God, it is a bad job, I am only an interpreter"—I searched him at the station, and found a complete note for 200 <hi rend="italic">reals</hi>—this wood engraving, with the name of Manuel Losada, was in his waistcoat pocket, and two pieces of a note, the filagree outside part—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the third piece, containing the name of Manuel Losada—those three pieces were all in the prisoner's pocket-book—I also found a bill, "Received 22nd September, 1866, of Mr. A.

                  </hi>. I am a die-sinker, of No. 19, Perceval Street, Clerken<lb/>well—on 17th September the prisoner came there—I asked him into the counting-house—he produced something like a note, and asked me if I could engrave a die or stamp the same that was on the note—this is the note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said that I could, but complained of its being rather an imperfect impression—he said, "If you hold it to the window and look on the other side you will see better." (That was looking at the reverse side). "If you use a strong glass you will be able to see"—he then asked the price, and I think I told him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said it was rather dear, and I agreed to do it for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he wanted it in two or three days—I said I could not do it in the time, and promised to get it done on the Monday following—he said he could not wait so long, and I agreed to get it done by Friday, by four o'clock—he then left—I saw two stamps on the note, and asked him if he required the second—he said, no, they would only require the one—it was plural, either "We" or "They"—I asked him if he required a press—he said, "No"—I put myself into communication with the police, and what I did afterwards I did under their directions—the prisoner came again on the Friday, and asked me if the stamp was done—I said, "No"—he brought out another note, and told me he wanted the round stamp engraved—he gave me a small piece of paper of the size of the round stamp, and the letters round it—that was for the size—I suppose he thought the impression imperfect, but he did not say so—this lettering was round it when he gave it to me: "Eliz. II. Dei Grat. Hispan. Regina"—the second note was produced, and he asked me which note I should require—I went to the light to look, and said I thought I had better have the two, the impression of one being perfect on one side, and the other on the other side—he asked the price of several presses, and picked up a very small one, and asked if I thought that would do—I told him the power was not sufficient, and showed him a large fly press, but he said that was too much, and took too much room, as he wanted it to put it in a box to send it abroad—I ultimately sold him the press at 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. with the die and counterpart all complete—he brought out a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and said he would pay me first—I gave him the change—he asked me if I could do wood engraving—I said no; but I had a brother-in-law in that line, and I gave him the addresses of several parties—I agreed to get the first stamping press ready by Monday, the octagonal one—he paid me for the press and die, but did not take them away—Ranger came to my place, by arrangement, on 24th September—the things were to be ready between three and four o'clock that day—I put him into a back parlour, and the prisoner and Claramont came about four o'clock—that was the first time I had seen Claramont—the prisoner asked me if the die was done, but previously to that he had given me his address as B. Claramont, Guildford Place, Russell Square—I do not know the number—he gave me that address in writing—I gave him a pen and ink, and he wrote it down—I do not know where it is—they had to wait ten minutes, as the press was not quite finished—I then took an impression of the die by the press which had been purchased, and showed it to them—I then gave him the notes to</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Manual, a type-founder, of 19, Tysoe Street, Clerkenwell—on 15th September the prisoner called there and showed me two pieces of tracing paper with figures drawn on them—he asked me if I could cut some figures exactly the same—I said yes, we had some already in stock in cast brass—he said that he was afraid they would not do, as he wanted them executed like the pattern—I showed them to him—he placed them together and said that there was not the same distance between the figures as there was in the pattern—I told him I would cut him some—he told me to cut five of each, and the figures 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, and 0—I asked him if I should cut the 4, 6, and 7—he said no, he would bring me the pattern for those—he mentioned a type case, but did not give me the order then—the order was to be executed on the next Wednesday—he called on Wednesday or Thursday, and I said that they were not ready, but I would do them next week—he called on the following Monday, they were not done, and he asked when he should have them for certain—I said on Friday—he said that they were for a shipping order, or were going abroad—he then showed me two pieces of tracing paper, with the letters B and J J on one, and Y and V on the other, and asked me to cut them exactly the same as the pattern, but on longer brass than ordinary, as he wanted them to place in a handle—he also ordered a type case to hold six of the figures—I pro<lb/>mised him that they should all be ready for certain on Friday night—he called on Friday about half-past seven, and asked me if they were done—I said that they were—the shop was shut, and he came through the side door—I gave them to him, and asked him what name I should make the invoice out in—he said "Claramont"—I did so, and he gave me the money—he then noticed that the V on one of the little letters was a little shorter than the other—I looked at it and saw that it was so—I told him I would alter it for him the following day at five o'clock—he then left—I have got some of the letters I made in accordance with the tracing—the type figures I made would make similar figures to these on the note—this letter B corresponds with the B on the torn note.</p>

I reside at Wednesbury, Staffordshire, and am an accountant in the service of Mr. James Russell, the prosecutor, who is a tube manufacturer there—I have been an accountant about ten years, during which period I have known the prisoner in Mr. Russell's service—he had a London house at Upper Ground Street, Blackfriars, of which the prisoner had the management—the accounts connected with that house passed through my hands—I produce the cash-book kept by the prisoner—the usual mode of business was for them to receive orders at the London warehouse, to transmit them to Wednesbury, and for us to supply those orders—they collected the money and remitted it to us at Wednesbury—we sent the goods according to instructions either to the warehouse, or to the party who ordered them—the course of business was for the prisoner to receive money and to remit it to the Wednesbury house, less any pay<lb/>ment for salaries or accounts that he might have in London—I produce a remittance note of 26th February, 1864, in the prisoner's handwriting—by this note he remitted 452<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

               <p>times, but I have never been there officially to go through the accounts—I have been upon pleasure, and called at the warehouse—there is no hand-writing in this book except the prisoner's, unless it may be some of the pencil entries—the ledger clerk must post into this book—there are many items in here which the ledger clerk has not posted—the three sums I have mentioned were posted by the ledger clerk into the ledger—they would be posted to the credit of the different parties—I believe he posted all the sums mentioned in those three weeks—it was not the practice in the Bir<lb/>mingham house to send at stated intervals in the year a copy to each customer of the state in which his account stood—that was left to London—we have not done so from Wednesbury for seven or eight years—it was my duty to make out the accounts at Wednesbury—if the prisoner was to keep back John Smith's cheque for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. we should not know any<lb/>thing about it at Wednesbury—I believe there was no document of any sort or kind sent by us from Wednesbury to Mr. John Smith, by which he would see that he had not received credit for the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque he had paid—there may have been an exceptional case if any inquiries were made—there was an account of money handed to Mr. Russell himself personally—that would be treated in the same way as if he had transmitted it—in the account that was just read, part of the money was handed to Mr. Russell—the letter states, "excepting the two first items, the others representing cheques and bills handed to Mr. Russell"—the money handed over to Mr. Russell is treated as remittance—there is no separate account of that—the prisoner rendered accounts to the Wednesbury house monthly—they were balanced quarterly, of course, in the ledgers—we have not had a monthly account rendered for three years—not since 1863—I have none of them here—I can't say how often Mr. Russell was in town—he did not take an active part in the business—the prisoner was at the London house two days after I came up—on the 25th June he was suspended—he was not told to go away—Mr. Baker, the solicitor, said in the prisoner's presence that he was suspended until the further examination of the books—that was on the Wednesday morning—I will swear it was not on the Monday—I re<lb/>member stating to the prisoner that I was about to send out a circular to the different creditors—he said, "You had better consider before you do that, for if you do I will send out a circular stating the circumstances under which your circular goes"—he also added that it should cost Mr. Russell 10, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more if he proceeded against him—it was said in Mr. Russell's presence that the prisoner had made improper use of Mr. Russell's money—what he said was that it was through some specula<lb/>tion which unfortunately had turned out wrong, but that had the tran<lb/>saction been successful he should have heard nothing—he did not say they were speculations of Mr. Russell's, I mean to swear that, most decidedly—Mr. Russell said he had no right to use his money to specu<lb/>late, and Mr. Baker made the remark that he might just as well take his money and bet on the Derby—the prisoner said they were specula<lb/>tions—he left the inference that they were his own—I understood that they were his own speculations of course—there was no allusion as to what the speculations Were at that time—the prisoner told me the day previous—the prisoner said, in the course of conversation, when Mr. Russell was there, that he believed to a certain extent he had Mr. Russell's authority—his words were, "I consider that I had to a certain extent your authority for what I have done"—before that</p>

Gentlemen,—We beg to say we will guarantee an amount not exceeding 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you may advance to Mr. W. C. Haddon on bills endorsed by him, presented at this bank to be discounted.")—I produced that—I was a party to that letter—the thing was canvassed over before it was done—it was done by letter, by Mr. Smith, the manager—after that guarantee a bill of Sullivan's might have come to us, a promiscuous bill, a bill bearing his endorsement—I cannot say whether Sullivan's accept<lb/>ances came in—there was a little confusion in the name, there being the father and the son—one was J. S. and the other J. G.</p>

                  </hi>. I am proprietor of this business at Wednes<lb/>bury, and at Upper Ground Street, London—rather more than twelve years ago, I think, I placed the prisoner in the London branch of the business—he was to conduct the London business entirely, to receive money, supply the goods when they were ordered, keep the accounts, and send down remittances to me—I treated London as one single customer, debiting the warehouse with the goods, and crediting the money received from there, knowing very little indeed about the customers which the prisoner had—I had every confidence in the prisoner until May this year—he had been with me rather more than 15 years—it was his duty to send down remittances as he received them, sometimes once a week,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186610220042"/>
               <p>sometimes oftener, and to send monthly accounts—he did that for some, considerable time—about three or four years ago they ceased—I have ap<lb/>plied to him for monthly accounts personally—the excuse he made was that as the warehouse was treated as a debtor, in some instances some of the goods were sold for more than the warehouse was charged, and on others there were drawbacks, and he had not made up the differences—if there was an excess it would belong to my firm—the prisoner had a salary of 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a house and firing—I asked very frequently for the monthly account—he should have sent nearly the whole of the cash weekly—he might have kept a small amount of cash back for the purpose of any little account that might come in, the ordinary expenses of a business—I did not know of his having received 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. during the week ending 25th February, and only sending 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I did not in any way authorise that—I did not authorise him to keep back moneys, except in one instance some months ago; that was for him to keep a certain amount of what he collected between the time of my writing to him and going up, and it was paid to me when I went up—I knew that he had a banker's account, inasmuch as I guaranteed a bank for an amount for himself, but after transferring it from there I knew nothing more—I did not know that he paid my moneys into any banker's account—I never authorised him to do so—I gave a guarantee to a bank for discount for a person named Sulli<lb/>van—his father had owed me a debt—I came up to London with the accountant—on the Saturday previous I had a conversation with the prisoner, which induced me to send for the accountant—I dismissed the prisoner—the accountant said the books were very far behind, and there was a considerable balance against the prisoner, and upon questioning him he gave some very evasive answers—he ended by saying that had things gone on right he should never have heard anything of this—I dismissed him at once—I told him he was suspended—he did not say what he had done with the money—he said if these speculations had gone on right he would have heard nothing of it—I had not authorised any speculations—there was only one exception, that was the Hanoverian—that had nothing to do with the moneys of the firm—I did not authorise in any way any ap<lb/>plication for speculative purposes of the moneys of the firm that the prisoner had, or for any other purpose, there was a special direction—I did not give any special direction about the application of my own individual money that I recollect—I bought some shares once, at the prisoner's request, in the Petroleum Company—I provided money of my own for an acceptance, bills met the acceptance, renewed bills took up the bills, eventually I took up the renewed bills out of my own funds—the prisoner did not, as far as my authority goes, ever apply a sixpence for those bills, or for any other purpose—the Petroleum matter was in September, 1865—Sullivan's bills had been sent down in 1863 by Haddon—it was for the purpose of providing discount to assist Sullivan that I gave that guarantee to the bank—Haddon had lent him some of my money, and in order to get out of that debt he said if I would guarantee the Alliance Bank for him he would work it out in that way, and that was done—I did not know at all of any of my moneys being paid into the Alliance Bank—up to May I believed Haddon was sending down to me all the moneys that he received.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I entreat you to reconsider that answer.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186610220043"/>
               <p>in that way—it is a fact that I told him to keep back from the weekly statements the receipt of any money I so applied, in order that my manager, Smith, might not know it—that was in writing, not personally—I can't tax my memory as to the time.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean money you applied in Sullivan's matters? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—moneys received on my own account, which he handed over to me on my arrival in town.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I thought the course of business was that all money handed over to you should go into the remittance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, decidedly, but this was a special matter—it was simply because I wanted the money for my own private purpose—I did not wish my manager to know that at the time—I knew he must know it at some time—I told the prisoner I had been engaged in speculations in London with accommodation bills and various speculations—the Hanoverian Petroleum Company was one, and the Bank of New Zealand, nothing else but what is gone past—I had no interest in Sullivan's matter—that was an advance made by him unknown to me in the first instance—I believe it was a speculation in the leather trade, or something of that kind—I know it was—I don't know that the speculations with which the prisoner had to do had nothing to do with the leather trade—I know he bought and sold shares—I knew nothing about our firm supplying tubing for the speculation in question—that I swear—I was not cognisant of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you never hear of Sullivan's steam-generating machine? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I beg pardon, I am speaking of the present Sullivan, the successor—that was the father—that I did know about—that was some years ago—I should think in 1861 or 1862, perhaps—I have no account of what is due to me from Sullivan, nothing more than what the books show, and that I have not looked at—I never got payment of profits made in that concern—I never had a penny—this is my handwriting (<hi rend="italic">Looking at a letter</hi>)—this has nothing to do with profit—this 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I expect, refers to a speculation that I was out of altogether, but that I can't recollect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just read the letter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> "Mr. W. C. Haddon. Dear sir, I wish you to take the accompanying papers and pay into the bank 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for me"—that was into my own bank—now I recollect what it was, it would be, I expect, Hankey's, for some shares—"first of all putting on a receipt stamp marked"—it was a banker's receipt for a deposit—"and also adding the date on the day of application. If you can't manage it in a day or two let me know, and I will send you a cheque. P. S. Don't forget Mr. Sullivan's 116<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, and that you owe me 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the bill"—I don't recollect receiving that as my share of the profit—whatever I have re<lb/>ceived from Sullivan was not as a partner—I have heard it insinuated that I was a partner with Sullivan—this was a personal arrangement, that on the condition of my giving the guarantee as a remuneration, one-half of the produce of the business of Sullivan should be handed over to me as a bonus for giving it—I can't say whether that sum was received upon the footing of that arrangement—I won't swear it was not, but I cannot say it was—I have a doubt that this came from Sullivan, certainly—I did not take a cheque of Sullivan's to the Middlesex Bank and get it cashed—I merely handed it over for them to do it, if I did send a cheque—I have not got a cash-book of these affairs, because I trusted to Haddon to keep everything—I can't say whether I received for the cheque a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, No. 89662—I won't swear I did not—I was not engaged in drawing or accepting or endorsing a large number of accommodation bills for</p>

               <p>Sullivan in 1864 and 1865, certainly not—I was engaged in accommoda<lb/>tion bills connected with the Hanoverian Petroleum, not Sullivan—I should think Sullivan's transaction began somewhere about 1861 and 1862—it has never been wound up—Sullivan became a bankrupt, and after that I knew nothing of it for some time—I did not know that my bills were being used to work Sullivan's business until after it was commenced—I knew it in 1862 and 1863—I know the account has not been balanced—I know Sullivan's is a different business now, but I did not know it was the same Sullivan—he was represented to me as a different Sullivan—Mr. Smith is here—this is his writing—you subpoenaed Mr. Smith, and me too—when I have been at the London house I have simply asked the prisoner for money, that is all—there was my brother-in-law in the country, whom I did not wish to know about these speculations—he was the manager too—I have written to the prisoner to write to me for sham excuses to bring me up to town that I might talk to him about these speculations that I was engaged in—he was not authorised to apply any money from the busi<lb/>ness, and was not to take cheques for any purpose, except on such an occa<lb/>sion as that special one—in one or two instances when I could not take up the accommodation bills I have made up the difference from the business—I have not complained to the prisoner that he has truly entered the amount, so that my manager found out I was speculating in London, nothing of the sort—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in my handwriting (<hi rend="italic">This letter was from the prosecutor to the prisoner, stating that he was very vexed indeed that he had referred to the bills or to the amounts in his letter to Mr. Smith, and stating that if he kept ang cheques or cash he was to debit him with the amount and let it go into the monthly statement</hi>)—with regard to that, it is very distinctly stated that I have given him permission to debit me with money—I told him to make the bills payable at Ground Street, and not at Birmingham—that was in order that they should be met there, in order to keep it from the manager, (take it that way if you like), and because awkward questions had been asked down at the bank there—I was asked by another house whether the prisoner had any authority to accept bills—I said he was authorised to conduct the whole business of the firm—I believe I have prosecuted him for forging the endorsement of a cheque received in London—that was previous to these transactions—this letter of 11th May, 1866, is in my writing. (<hi rend="italic">This con<lb/>tained a direction to the prisoner to write to the prosecutor a very urgent letter requesting him to come up to town.

                  </hi>. I live at 10, Conduit Street, Long Acre, and am a coster-monger—between six and seven o'clock on 28th September I was returning to my lodgings—just as I entered Conduit Street I heard a great disturb<lb/>ance, and when I got to No. 10 I saw the prisoner creating a great dis<lb/>turbance, and insulting every one who passed through the court—as I passed in the doorway she said to me, "Here's another b—gun"—I took no notice and passed into the kitchen—I sat down for a quarter of an hour—as I was coming out along the passage the prisoner was still standing at the door—she made use of some bad coarse language—I passed by out of the door—the prisoner then came up and struck me—I shoved her away—she came up again and stabbed me in the head—I bled much—I did not see what it was done with until the knife was produced after this happened—a witness found it—I had a severe wound in my head—the doctor saw it—I had never seen the prisoner before—she was drunk, but she knew what she was about.</p>

I am a widow, and live at the "Horse and Groom" public-house, Maiden Lane, Covent Garden—on Sunday, 9th September, the prisoner came to my house about a quarter to two o'clock—she had a baby with her—she called for half a pint of fourpenny ale—I noticed the child was ill, and asked her what was the matter with it—she said it was consumptive—I asked her if she had any advice for it, and she said she took it to the Charing Cross Hospital twice a week, and that they were giving it cod liver oil—she attempted to give the child some beer, and I said, "Don't give it some beer, I will give it some wine," and I gave it some—I told the prisoner if she came to my house I would give it a little port wine or arrowroot, or beef tea, seeing the child was so very debilitated—she came again in the afternoon, about ten minutes past five o'clock—she had half a pint of ale—she told me the child had been sleeping ever since, and I said it would sleep a long time before long, the child was very ill—she came in again about eight o'clock with a boy, and told me the child was dead—she was crying—I begged of her to go the union in the morning, because she did not seem very well clad—it was a damp sort of day—she said that her children sold fuzees in the street, and I said that was a very dreadful way of getting her living, and she had better go to the union—she did not make any remark.</p>

I am relieving officer of St. Martin's workhouse—I have known the prisoner close on two years—that is since April, 1865—her husband died on 14th April, 1865—she was admitted into the workhouse in that month—she was close to her confinement at the time she was admitted—the child was born after her husband's death—she was confined in theworkhouse, and remained there close on twelve months, down to 19th April, 1866—she applied to be allowed half a crown a week and a set of bedding, which was granted—they gave her two sets of bedding instead of one on account of her four children, because they did not consider one would be sufficient for her—the reason for her not receiving the half-crown a week any longer was that the board did not think proper to give it her, and said they would receive her into the workhouse, and she was informed of it by the chairman—I made the order—the allowance was discontinued at that time—she did not receive any more half-crowns after the 20th August—she did not avail herself of the offer to come in—I did not see her for some time after that—I saw her a week before the child died, in front of the railway station, Charing Cross—she had got some matches in her hand, but I did not see her offer any to any one—the blankets that were supplied to the prisoner were gone from the room that she occupied—I went to the room—I have never seen any of the bedclothes or bedding—the value of the bedding was from 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., flock bed and bolsters—no allowance was paid to her after she refused to come into the workhouse—her own statement to me was that she did needlework—her allowance had ceased for three or four weeks at the time I saw her at the Charing Cross Station—it was on 20th August that I went to her house—I saw her standing in Bedfordbury nursing the child—the last opportunity I had of noticing the child's features was on 20th August—it looked delicate, but did not appear to be ill—she was nursing it as a mother would do—I should think it had been delicate since its birth.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just give me an idea of this prosperous bank down to 1864, what profits did you divide last year? what did you get out of it yourself for the year 1863, ending 1864? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot recollect the amount of dividend, without reference to figures—I cannot answer without making a calculation, but possibly about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—about twenty per cent. per share on the original capital on 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that is including bonuses—I was paid for at<lb/>tending as private Director of the bank—I did various matters—I was un<lb/>doubtedly paid independently of a Director of the bank to investigate the accounts and see that the matters were rightly returned—it is the manager's duty to examine the weekly accounts—I did not take on myself to perform that duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that you did not perform that duty? These banking companies are attracting public attention; we want to know what Directors do. Did you as a paid Director never look at the weekly returns? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never looked at the weekly returns—I never verified them—I may have casually looked at them—I did not take care to inform myself of the correctness of the half-yearly returns.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then what did you do? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had a great variety of duties; I can<lb/>not enumerate the whole of them—I did not ascertain the state of the bank, the state of the issues, or the state of the assets—I took my money when it was offered to me—I do not mean to represent to the jury that I entirely neglected the duty that I undertook—there were a good many duties in advising the manager of the bank.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How could you advise if you did not make yourself acquainted with the state of the bank? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not inform myself of everything—Mr. Wilson was a paid director, equally efficient with myself—his duties were the same as mine—he and I did not meet and have any conversation in relation to the issues of the bank—there were five other directors—we had board meetings once a month, and occasionally—I was nearly always present, and the others were generally present—all the books were not laid before us—I am not aware of any book being asked for and not produced by the manager—it was a rule of the bank that the general Directors should not look into the books at all—that was an original rule—the private Directors had to look into the books—we actually had a rule excluding the general directors from looking into the affairs of the bank, and we two gentlemen are the only persons who did it, and were paid for doing it—the bank went to ruin on the 19th September, 1864, and since that time it has been in the hands of the liquidators—I do not know whether 13, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been spent on the liquidators.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there a complaint made against the defendant about the mode in which he managed the affairs of the bank long after this affidavit; do you know that an action was commenced against the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it was brought in my name, but beyond that I know little about it—in ad<lb/>dition to being a paid director, I was a paid plaintiff—I know nothing more than that—the action was compromised, I have heard by the prisoner</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">It all turns upon the question whether the case is one which, in the words of the statute, is</hi> "<hi rend="italic">not otherwise expressly pro<lb/>vided for." This is an indictment for perjury, which cannot be supported at Common Law, nor is there any cause pending; therefore, to constitute perjury, it must be made so by the words of an Act of Parliament, and the question is whether the perjury is created by this section. The affidavit is totally illegal from beginning to end, because it is the duty of the bankers to make the affidavit together with the defendant. The question has been raised whether the prisoner is a qualified person for that purpose; but, without going into that at present, the question now is, what is the jurisdiction given by this section to adminster an oath? has it been given? and how are these words to be interpreted? and, also, if there is to be a verification on oath, what is to be the verification, and who is to administer the oath? The</hi> 9 <hi rend="italic">Geo. IV., c</hi>. 23,<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7, <hi rend="italic">says that any Justice of the peace is empowered to administer it.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Then I will call the attention of the Court to the other point. At the time the Act passed there was no such person as the manager of a bank in the sense in which it is now understood. He is a new. officer, performing duties of a different kind, resulting from the formation of joint-stock banks. The</hi> 9 <hi rend="italic">Geo.

Therefore, unless the Commissioners choose to interfere, the banker would produce either of those three parties to join in the affidavit. In that affirmation the only person who acts is the manager. In this case the only person who makes the affidavit is the manager, and he does not declare himself to be either cashier, account, or chief clerk. Altogether the transaction is utterly informal; the Directors have not been sworn to the affidavit, and the manager is not the person intended. He is in the place of the proprietors or owners of a private bank; he is, in fact, what bankers were before joint-stock banks existed</hi>.</p>

               <p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you betray the man whom you had been acting as an accomplice with? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Immediately the bank stopped there was a meeting at my house—I live at the bank—I will not swear whether I then said that I had been making all these false returns, or whether it was found out by Turquand's people, because I am not quite sure—there were 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. re<lb/>issues, and I think Mr. Charles Butler found it out—I, of course, then owned to it—he found out that we had not notes in the bank anything like what the issue was—he knew what we had a right to issue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did he find in the books that was false? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He would know what notes we had in hand by the books, and he knew what notes were issued—when I was told to take from the Bank of England notes and add to our own I made false entries in one book—if Somerset House wanted to look at my books they would have confirmed the returns.</p>
               <p>

               <p>to prevent anybody abstracting any notes from your book and putting Bank of England notes instead? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> it was merely in figures, not in cash—though I could make one false result, I could not make another in actual cash by taking away part of our own notes, and filling up with Bank of England notes—it was only in one book—the "notes in circula<lb/>tion" here is all false—the only way to show what our circulation was would be to take the addition of these three.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Which is the book you made the false entries in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This book—it is called the circulation account—it is not all my writing—this is one of my false entries (<hi rend="italic">pointing it out</hi>)—this is a false sheet as far as notes are concerned—this, "Particulars of cash in hand ending 14th December, 1861, notes 14, 595<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," means our notes in our own hands—it is not 14, 595<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in circulation, but in hand—this entry of 19th November means the same—the whole of this entry is false—I can scarcely tell how it could be corrected, or how an accountant could find out how much of this is false—if 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of our own notes actually in the till had been abstracted I could tell it, because this book is of no use in the actual cash transactions of the bank, it is only for the Inland Revenue—the only other book that I kept is our cash-book—that will not show what cash we had on 18th November, 1861, but the earlier book will—this is the true book, and this is the false book, and by comparing one with the other you see the difference—I had a similar book before me when I made the entry—when I saw that I had only in my till 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes, and that if I returned that I should be above the issue I added an imaginary figure to make it up 11, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., so as to make the issue below the proper sum.</p>

I am a share broker residing at Leeds, and was one of the shareholders in the Leeds Banking Company—I held sixty original shares when the bank failed—I remember the stopping of the bank in September, 1864—after it stopped I was present at a meeting of the com<lb/>mittee—that was on the Wednesday, three days after it stopped—Mr. Greenland was not present—he was present about a week after that—we had several meetings, and it was several days before he attended—Mr. Kirkby was present at the bank every day, and was at the committee meet<lb/>ings, and Mr. Biggs and, I believe, Mr. Butler—I remember Mr. Green-land being asked with respect to the over issue of notes—I am not sure who asked him; it was one of the committee—he was asked if he was aware that the notes were over issued, as Mr. Kirkby had stated that such was the case—he said that it might be so, and that what Mr. Kirkby said would no doubt be correct—I am not certain whether anything was said as to the amount of the over issue—we had the matter talked over so often at every meeting that I cannot say—Kirkby had made a statement at that meeting and at a previous meeting—I believe he was asked to repeat in the presence of Mr. Greenland what he had said previously—he said there had been false returns made to Somerset House, and that the over issue of notes was something considerable—Mr. Greenland said to that what I have said before, that he had no doubt that what Mr. Kirkby said was correct—I do not recollect that anything was said as to the time during which there had been the over issue—I do not recollect that anything was said in the presence of Greenland with reference to the over issue—we were in and out of the room constantly, and it might have taken place in my absence. <hi rend="italic">Cross-exmined by</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then "instigation" is your own word? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, he may have used both—there were a great many questions asked at the time—Mr. Greenland sat in the room, and I really thought he was ill at the time—he asked to go out of the room, and said that he would go and get a little fresh air and return shortly—he said, "Perhaps it might have been so, and if Mr. Kirkby says so it must be so"—he did not say, "Perhaps it may have been so"—I did not understand it so—I understood it was, "If Mr. Kirkby says so it must be so"—I am not one of the prosecutors—I am not contributing to the prosecution, and I have never been asked—I am not going to do so.</p>

I live at Kingswood Cottage, Walworth, and am a reporter at the Middlesex Sessions—I knew the usher who administered the oaths in Mr. Payne's court, his name was Henry Minton—he is since dead; he committed suicide—I was present in my official capacity at the trial of Dye and Pearce, who were charged with attempted burglary—I recognise Barry as a person who gave evidence in that case—I was present when the oath was administered to him—I heard the oath administered—I took down shorthand notes of that trial myself, and have them here—I took all that was said as far as the police were concerned—William Barry said, "I am a police-constable, 99 S—I recollect the night of 30th August, it was a Thursday—I remember Small coming to the station—in consequence of something Small said, I was sent with him to join Hayes in Mornington</p>

               <p>which I tried—when I returned into the room I fastened the catch, and I found that it required a very great effort on my part to push it back again when once it was properly closed—the force required to open that catch with a knife would, in my opinion, produce a mark on the edge of the knife—this knife has never been out of my possession—there are no marks at all on the edge of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 63, Gloucester Crescent—on the night of the 30th August I retired to rest at half-past eleven, as near as I can remember—on that night I slept in the back room on the first floor—I have a garden at the back and in the front of my house, the front gar<lb/>den is where the prisoners are said to have been taken—I heard nothing at all that night—nobody slept on the ground floor or in the front of the house on that night—I first heard anything about this matter, as nearly as I can remember, at a little before five in the morning, from my servant—the servant woke me, and I came downstairs almost immediately afterwards—I went into the room where the window was and saw the two police con<lb/>stables, Hayes and Barry, and a policeman in uniform—they pointed out to me the marks on the sash, and showed me that the window was open—the window was open then—there were some slight cuts on the bottom of the middle rail of the sash—I know a carpenter of the name of Hearne—I was in the kitchen when somebody came in and brought this model (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>) with him, but I am not aware that he made it in my kitchen—my window has not been altered at all since—I remember Mr. Ivory coming to my house the day after the trial at the Middlesex Sessions—to the best of my belief I had not seen Barry and Hayes that day—Mr. Ivory went down into the kitchen, and, fastening the bolt of the window, tried with a table knife whether he could open it from the outside—he was not able to open the fastening from the outside—the hasp of the window goes stiffly—the entire height of the wall that the boys are alleged to have gone over is more than six feet to the top of the coping—it is six feet from the pavement from the outside—I think it is such a wall that a man, placing his hand on it, could leap over, because there is a little set-off in the brickwork out-side, a man stepping on that could get over—there is an entrance gate—I believe on the night in question that gate was bolted on the inside—a person might get out of the garden that way by pulling back the bolt.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Hayes describe any persons to you when you first met him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I described them to him first—when I came back with Barry I left him by himself—he went on faster than me—I told him I should be at the top of the street—about six o'clock on the following morning, after I had come off my beat, I saw Pearce and Dye at the station-house—I then recognised them as the two boys I had seen on the previous night, and the boys I had described to Hayes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a traveller, at 13, Milk Street—on Saturday, the 22nd of September, about aquarter past ten, as I was crossing Westbourne Grove to Paddington Green, I saw the prisoners with these nine rolls of crape in their possession, and, knowing that to be a very large stock for any one in that neighbourhood, it attracted my attention—one was carrying five pieces, and the other four—I followed them, they went into a wardrobe</p>

               <p>shop in Salisbury Street, and came out again with the parcels—I called a policeman, who took them into custody.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 23rd September, I met the last witness, and we followed the prisoners—I asked them how they could account for the possession of this crape, William Moore said he had receded it from a Mr. Williams, in Praed Street, and he was going to take it to 73, Cannon Street, City—I asked him if he worked for Mr. Williams, he said he did not, but that he was passing through Praed Street, and Mr. Williams had asked him to take it to 73, Cannon Street—I told them I was not satisfied with that account, and I took them into custody.</p>

I met my brother at the corner of Tottenham Court Road, where he gets his living by selling newspapers, and he went with me; he knows nothing of it, and I had no knowledge whatever of its having been stolen.<hi rend="smallCaps">

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Statement before the Magistrate</hi>:—"I was in the West India Docks, and Slater said, 'I have an order for two pounds of meat; will you get it for me?' I said, 'Why do not you get it yourself?' He said, 'I had two pounds of meat there yesterday, and am ashamed to get more there to-day.' He said Mr. Thompson sometimes gave him an order, and 'If the butcher asks if Mr. Thompson gave it to you, say yes.' I was to ask for the meat first and give the order afterwards, or I should get inferior meat. He stopped at the corner, and Mr. Shephard gave it me; he said it would not do. Mr. Slater has been to Dr. Thompson's house, his wife has been lately confined."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I went down to the West India Docks on 20th September. I got there at twenty minutes past seven, and saw Slater; he said, "I have got an order for two pounds of meat; will you go and get it?" I asked him the reason he could not get it; he said, "I had two pounds yesterday, and am ashamed." I did not at first consent, I had to get work, and it would not be any benefit to me, but he wished me so that I consented. I walked up the Commercial Road, up Jubilee Street, and went into Mr. Shephard's shop and asked for the meat before I gave him the order, because Slater had told me if I did not ask for the meat first I should get inferior meat. When I gave him the order he said, "Did Mr. Thompson give you this?" I said, "Yes, sir." He said, "N shall I take you to Mr. Thompson, or will you go about your business?" I said, "Not without the meat." I thought it was a genuine order, and if I went about my business he would have the money and no one would have the meat. He took me to Mr. Thompson, who gave me in charge. This Slater, in his evidence before Mr. Woolrych, said that I said when he showed me the order, "It is strange that he should give you an order like that; any<lb/>body could make one, "and that he said, "No, I suppose there is a mark about it somewhere, "trying to make out, because I said that, that I had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186610220119"/>
               <p>forged the order, but anybody can discuss upon the probability of making a bank note without the least intention of doing so, and I would not do such a thing. Mr. Woolrych said, "Had you got a genuine order about you?" He said "No," but if he had not, what was I alluding to when I said it would be easy to make one like that." Therefore it must have been the forgery, and if he did not give me the order I must have gone home and written it. Now I had not been home since I left home in the morning, I had no paper about me, and if the constable had searched me effectually he would have seen that I had no blue paper. That is not my writing, I should not have been able to write it; there ought to have been some of this person's writing produced to see whose writing it corresponds with. Slater has been under six masters in the docks, and industrious persons do not change about like that; he is associated with a prostitute and a thief, his wife told me so, and that she had no longer any faith in him. He told me that he should never buy sugar while he was in the docks. It may suggest itself to your minds that if he is such a bad person I ought not to asso<lb/>ciate with him, but I did not know him to be a forger or perjurer, and in the docks you cannot speak to whom you please. I thought the order was genuine, and therefore I took it; he told me a dozen times that if Mr. Shephard asked me if Mr. Thompson gave it to me I was to say "Yes," and I did tell him so once, but I meant all the time if there was any bother about it to say who gave it to me, and I did so. I should not have run the penalty attaching to forgery if I had not believed Slater, nor should I have gone to Mr. Thompson and to the police-court. This lawyer makes up a case against me, but it is like the fog that comes over London, a few words of the wind of truth will blow it all away. If I am convicted I shall add another to the names of those who have unjustly suffered.<hi rend="smallCaps">

I said, "For opening my shutters and window, and attempting to steal my hat, scarf, and pin"—he said, "I know nothing about it; look at my hands, I go to work"—I said, "What are you doing up at this time?"—he said, "I have been to call two or three fellows who work with me"—I gave him in custody and said, "If you will tell me the names of the persons you went to call up I will fetch them as your witnesses"—he said, "I never said anything of the kind."</p>

I became curious, went out a few steps, and saw Nieffer falling down, and I, being frightened, wanted to run away; but when I was about three yards from my home, going back, six men rushed upon me. I foolishly had the knife in my possession, and they ran on it. I went indoors, and three or four policemen came and took me. There is no truth in the statement that a knife was passed to me, and I did not throw it away, I took it inside with me.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 83, Gower Street—in August I advertised a hat manufactory for sale in Charles Street, Middlesex Hospital, and several persons called upon me, and among them the prisoner Rowley—he looked at the goods very particularly, and said that he had come up from Manchester to work up his business, but that the tools would be of no use to him, but he had a friend who would buy them—I refused to divide them—he said that he represented a Manchester house, and gave me to understand that he was a manufacturer in a large way in town—he came again next day and introduced Barnes as his friend, who looked over the goods very particularly—Rowley asked him whether he would like to go into the steam rooms again—he said, "No, I have seen it all, I know it all," and said he would let me know on Monday the highest figure he would give for it, that he had a place in Clerkenwell where he usually received his letters, but they had had a place at the West End, but were about to give up their retail business—he spoke of Mr. Heath, of Oxford Street, and said that they had several retail shops, but he did not care about that—I enclosed a list of the articles on the Saturday, and on Monday Barnes came and made me the offer of 175<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he wrote it and left it in an envelope—I agreed ultimately to accept that—the money was to be paid on the Friday and the goods to be cleared on the Saturday—but he said that his broker had disappointed him in selling some Metropolitan shares, and urged me to accept a draft on his banker at seven days, and I agreed to take it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and this is the receipt I gave</p>

               <p>him—this bill is all I got for the 175<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Barnes came next day and fetched the goods away—I presented the bill at the bank on the Monday week following, but there were no effects, and they did not recognise the signature, and advised me to go to a solicitor—I found Barnes at the shop in Clerkenwell, he said that the bill was not due till next day—I said that I always had the money when I presented a bill—he said that the bank were offended with him because he withdrew his money at the time of the panic, but he was sorry I should have the trouble, and he would pay me the extra cab fare, and be with me next morning at eleven or half-past eleven—I did not get the cab fare—I went to the bank again, but could, get no money, and never got any—I went again to Clerkenwell, and found the shop closed and everything moved during the night—I could not find Barnes there—I have seen some of my goods in the hands of the police, but there is a deficiency of 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I am the wife of the last witness—West was with my husband all the evening of this 22nd September from one o'clock till ten minutes to five—between four and ten minutes to five my husband paid him—I saw him again at ten minutes past five with Ingham—he was in the road between the Rutland Tavern and Sykes's—I know the "Two Brewers"—that is Sykes's—I saw West there at ten minutes past five—the "Two Brewers" is five minutes' walk from my house by the road—it is the opposite way from the railway.</p>

I keep a loan and discount office, 69, Oakley Street, Lambeth—I have known the prisoner about two years, his family longer—on 9th May he came to my office and handed me this bill of exchange (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said he was desirous of introducing to me a very good transaction, the acceptance of Major Curzon, that he was the son of Lord Howe, and a very first-class man, that the major was in want of a little ready money, and he had desired him to get this discounted privately if he could—he was not to leave it with any of the regular discount people—if he could not get it done privately he was to return it to the major—I asked him if he knew the major—he said certainly—I asked if he saw the major sign the bill—he said certainly—I asked him the same question several times, to which he made the same reply, and pressed very hard that I would do it—he said that I could deduct 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the discount, and Lieutenant Burgess would pay his bill of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I held, and I could give him my cheque for the difference—I asked him, "Does Lieutenant Burgess know the major?" he said, "Oh, yes, they are friends—I assented to the terms and gave him this cheque for 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I also gave him Lieutenant Burgess's bill for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is a cheque on the Lambeth branch of the London and County Bank—it has been received by my bankers as paid—it is endorsed "A. Wright," in the prisoner's writing—there was no endorsement on it when I gave it him—I know the prisoner's writing—the body of the bill is his writing and his signature as the drawer—I have a very strong opinion that the acceptance is his writing, in a feigned hand, and written with a quill—the body is ap<lb/>parently written with a steel pen. (<hi rend="italic">The bill was dated May 5 th, 1866, at six months, drawn by the prisoner, and accepted, Ernest G. Curzon, Major, 52nd Light Infantry. Payable at Cox &amp;Co's., Craig's Court</hi>.) On 18th September I accompanied a police officer and Mr. Charles Wright, my solicitor, to 70, Horseferry Road, Westminster—I and the officer remained outside, and Mr. Charles Wright went into the house—I afterwards went in and found the prisoner and Mr. Wright in conver<lb/>sation—he was about to say something about Lieutenant Burgess, and I told him I had come to give him into custody for issuing to me a forged bill of exchange knowingly—he said, "Well, make no fuss about it; come along"—I then gave him into custody (<hi rend="italic">looking at some bank notes</hi>)—here are three notes bearing the prisoner's signature, numbers 61355, 61360 and 61359, all dated 12th March—I speak to his writing from my general knowledge of it—I have had letters from him, and I have seen him write.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Has he been in the habit of bringing bills to you to be discounted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I first knew him from a small loan transaction for himself—I charged him about fifteen per cent. interest when paid by instalments, which made a larger rate of interest, that is about my usual charge on small loan transactions—I think there were two transactions which ran over the time; they were paid, the last on the 20th March—I</p>

               <p>first commenced discounting other bills through him about March this year I think he has brought six bills to me to be discounted—there were other bills than those for Lieutenant Burgess—most of them did not turn out good bills, two were paid, and two were bad bills—I mean dishonoured—they did not all come from Aldershot—they were principally officers—there were two of one party's, they were both paid—the last of the other two was paid, but it was under very peculiar circumstances the prisoner paid it—I might have charged at the rate of sixty per cent. interest for those bills—for the first one I charged 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—the prisoner first brought me a bill of Lieutenant Burgess's on 30th April, that was for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was the one that merged in the transaction we are now speaking of—2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was charged for the discount of that—there was one other bill of Lieutenant Burgess for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were both done on 30th April, about that time, or two or three days afterwards—the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was not met when it came to maturity—nothing was paid on it—I hold it still—I believe Burgess has taken the benefit of the Act—I know he is a bankaupt—I did not know it till recently—it escaped me in the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi>—I did not know it till August—I did not take any steps with regard to that 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—that was done through the prisoner, he brought it to me—I charged 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. interest for that—he had 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, it was a three months bill—the prisoner brought this bill of Major Curzon's to my office—25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was more interest than I am in the habit of charging, between 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more—I asked him at least three times if he saw Major Curzon write it—he pressed it very hard, and reiterated the respectability of the acceptance several times, and I said, "Now, did you see the major sign that bill?"—he said, "Yes, certainly," and so forth, and pressed it very closely—he did not say, "Well, as to seeing him sign, I cannot be sure of that, but I was introduced to him in a room by Lieutenant Burgess, and I was going in and out, and it was handed to me by Lieutenant Burgess, and I believe Major Curzon signed it"—I swear most positively no such words were uttered; this is the first time I ever heard them—he did not tell me that Lieutenant Burgess had introduced him to Major Curzon—I did not ask how he came to know Major Curzon, and I will tell you why, because of his knowledge of military men, he told me he was in the army and navy agency, and travelling for them, and he knew these gentlemen so well, having business with them, and they often asked him to get a matter of that kind done—I asked him the question three times, because I had a little hesitation about doing it—I do not employ agents or advertise to lend money—I may sometimes—I do not regularly—I send out circulars and such like—I have never lent money to officers before.</p>

               <p>Friday, the 21st September, I went to 70, Horseferry Road—I left Mr. Woodgate and the officer outside the house, and I went in—I saw the prisoner—he asked me to be seated in an armchair the moment I entered the parlour, and he then went to a desk opposite to me to show me a list of debts that were owing to him, before I said a word to him, which amounted to about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then said to him, "How about that bill of Major Curzon's? Did you see the major sign it?"—he said, "I did. I am privileged to go to the camp privately.

Q.</hi> I may take it, I suppose, that you don't know any<lb/>thing about the fight between the two lunatics on the night before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I can see that plan, that is the gallery—I was on an oblique direction to No. 10—I was towards No. 1 way—I was working opposite the next room to No. 2—I was at work at the door which opens into the gallery—the door was open, and I had got my back turned to the gallery—I did not see everything that took place in No. 10—I did hear the lunatic use violent language; he said he would strip his b—self, and show himself to the doctor—he swore very much—he was excited, of course—it was after he left the cell that he threatened to murder anybody who came near him—he refused to get up—he went into the recess alone—I was still at No. 2—I did not feel at all alarmed—he could have struck me with the chair as well as anybody else—there was a chair standing near the glass door, very handy—he seized that chair—how he took it up I cannot say, I did not turn round to look—Sims, the attendant, then blew the key, which acts as a whistle—I turned round and saw Burton throw Tite down, and Morgan came in at the door and fell on him and punched him—Sims was close handy when I saw the man seize the chair—we commenced painting in that ward on the Monday morning—I believe this was the fourth day we had been there—there were other painters at work; one was in the room directly opposite Tite, that would be No. 4, that was a man named Conn; the other was at the fireplace—this was between six and seven in the morning—the first time I talked about this was on Saturday morning—this happened on the Thursday—my mate Conn talked about it when we got out to breakfast, and we said we did not think it was right, we thought it was ill-treatment—no notice was taken of it—the conversation was re<lb/>newed at dinner-time—we did not tell it direct to anybody, but there was a man sat in the shop at work who has been there for a number of years, and it appears that he afterwards made a report—he is a bricklayer—I told the doctor on the Saturday when I was sent for.</p>

               <p>on 20th September in doing some work at the County Lunatic Asylum—I went to work about ten minutes past six in the morning—I was working in this gallery No. 2 at the fireplace—I could not see into Tite's room from there—I had a full view up and down the gallery—between six and seven in the morning, while at work, I saw Tite walking about the gallery in an excited state, and he walked towards the end of the gallery, took up a chair and raised it over his head—the next instant the door of the gallery opened—a patient entered, and an attendant, Morgan, afterwards, who rushed at Tite and threw him down—he put his knee on his stomach and punched him the ribs—he struck him four or five times, but the whistle was blown, and the other attendant came—Burton and Sims were there at the time this was being done by Morgan, and Hunt came afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter, of Streatham—on 20th September I was working at the Surrey County Asylum, No. 2 ward—I was at work at No. 4, opposite No. 10—the door of No. 10 was open—I could see into it—the first thing that attracted my attention was the patient hallooing—I turned round, looked into the cell, and there saw Morgan kneeling on the patient's ribs with both his knees, striking the man with his right hand on the breast, and holding him by the throat with his left—this was between six and half-past in the morning—I heard Tite complaining of the ill-usage he received—he got up and stood on the floor, and said that he would pull his shirt off and show the doctor—then Morgan threw him again, and rammed his head on the floor, and the blood flew out of him on to the floor—he knocked the blood out of the side of his head—while this was going on Burton and Sims were standing looking on—this took place in the cell—I then saw Burton take Tite by the back of the neck and drag him to the sink—a very little while afterwards I heard a whistle blown—within a few minutes—it was all done in a few minutes—when Burton took him to the sink I heard a choking sound, like a man being half strangled—Sims and Morgan went towards that way, but whether they went to the sink or not I cannot say—after that I heard the whistle blown—I came out, and I saw Burton take the patient by the back of the neck and throw him on the ground three times—I could not say what Morgan was doing then—I was so upset that I cannot say whether I saw Morgan or not—Tite was then put into his cell again, I believe by Burton—I could not be positive—I could not say exactly whether it was by Burton alone, being upset—I could not say with certainty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You did not see this affair of the chair then? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I saw nothing done with a chair—I was at work inside—I don't recollect seeing the man who was at work at No. 2—I was not aware he was there—the two first <hi rend="italic">rounds</hi> commenced in the cell where Tite was—there was Morgan and Tite, and Sims and Burton were looking on—only Morgan and Tite were in the cell—Sims and Burton were standing looking on at the door—I could see between them—I saw Morgan kneeling on the patient in the cell on the floor—the patient was naked—it went on I suppose five or six minutes before the patient came out—he came out dressed—Burton was with him then, and took him to the sink—they were there perhaps four or five minutes—I did not see them come out of the sink—the next I saw was Burton take the patient by the back of the neck and chuck him down on the floor—that was in the gallery No. 2, near No. 1—they were close to No. 1 door—I know now that Kennedy was at work at No. 2 cell—I was not aware that Fraser was at work—the patient was not violent until after he had his walloping.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he violent at any time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never saw him violent, not at all, not till after Morgan and Burton had done with him. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he was violent in his room, because he said, after the first round, "I will pull my shirt off, and I will show my body to the doctor," and then Morgan threw him down again and hit his head on the floor, that was when the blood spurted out of him, not from his eyes or nose, only from a scratch—the blood came out of his head from the ramming on the floor, from his eye and his forehead—I have never said anything about blood before—I was never asked the question—I did not see them beat him again when they got him into the cell—they put him in, and locked him in—that was after they brought him from the sink—I have been working there since June—I am only a casual hand—I never saw any cause for beating Tite—he used threatening language afterwards—not in the cell—I never heard him there—he said he would kill the doctor, and so he would the attendants—he didn't say anything about a fight he had had the night before with a patient of the name of Burgess—it was after all was over that he threatened to kill the doctor—not in the cell, in No. 2 gallery—Tite told me that privately—I had a private conversation with him—he said so in the gallery after this affair, when he was sitting in the recess lamenting his pain.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>Morgan about seven months—a person named George Tite was a lunatic in the asylum—I believe Sims was the person who had the charge of the ward in which Tite was—it was the duty of the prisoner to assist Sims, if he required them, certainly—on the morning of the 20th September I saw Tite in the airing yard—I saw him first at six in the morning in bed—he was then asleep—I inquired about him, in consequence of having heard something that had taken place the previous night—I did not speak to him then—I saw him at nine o'clock in the yard—he was limping about, and very much bent—in consequence of some communication he made to me, I spoke to Burton—I stated to him that I heard that he was concerned in the affair which took place between six and seven that morn<lb/>ing, and asked him to let me know what it was—I stated to him that I had heard there had been a disturbance in the ward in the morning be<lb/>tween George Tite and his attendant, and that he had been called to assist and was present the whole time, and I wished to know the whole parti<lb/>culars of it—Burton then stated that he saw George Tite in the adjoining ward in an excited state, and that on heating the alarm whistle given he went into the ward to assist the attendant Sims, who was then in charge of the patient—he said that Tite had a chair in his hand, and was threat<lb/>ening to strike somebody, and that he along with Sims went to take the chair from him, and that a scuffle had then ensued between the three parties—he said that he did not use any more force than what was necessary to place the patient in his own room—when I said to him that Tite had received very considerable injuries, and that something more than mere restraint had been resorted to, he said that he had not done anything more than what he considered to be necessary for placing the patient into a single ward—that was all that took place between me and Burton—I had no conversation at all with Morgan—I saw Burton frequently about the asylum about seven and nine in the morning—I did not see Morgan until nine o'clock—Burton made no communication to me previously to my speaking to him—it was Sims's duty to have stated the occurrence that took place to me—I have been seven years head attendant in the asylum—I have not heard the evidence given here to-day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical attendant at the County Lunatic Asylum, Wandsworth—about half-past nine o'clock on Thursday morning, the 20th September, Tite came and asked me to examine him, and I did—he had rather a severe abrasion on the cheek bone, and various bruises on his body, the worst of which was over the breast bone, and his mouth was very sore—he complained very much of the inside of his mouth—I did not see any laceration, but his gums appeared swollen—I think they were in such a state that blood might have flown from then an hour or two previously—his mouth was so sore that I ordered him beef tea for his dinner—the bruises were very lightly apparent at that time, but a day or two afterwards they became much more developed—he was bruised on the hips, and he complained of his right arm, but there was nothing of importance to be seen on the arm—I think some of the bruises must have been inflicted as recently as that morning—the discolouration of a braise is usually complete in about six hours after, if it is not a very deep-seated bruise, and in this case the discolouration was not complete on that mor<lb/>ning—my examination was about twenty minutes past nine—I think if the injuries were inflicted about seven o'clock, or a little before, in my judg<lb/>ment that would coincide with the appearance that I saw—the one on the cheek bone I would not be certain about—I think that might have been caused the night before—I will not speak at all positive as to that.</p>

I am an attendant in the Surrey County Lunatic Asylum, in ward No. 3, and have been so for sixteen months—on the night of 19th September last, about seven o'clock, I saw the patients Tite and Burgess together—as I and Morgan were passing we heard a rush and a fall on the floor—I went immediately to the spot, and saw Tite rising from the floor very much excited—Burgess wag in the act of kicking him at the time—I stepped between them and parted them—the contest between them lasted some five or ten minutes—when I first saw Tite he was on the floor—there was a struggle between them—I think they were about equally matched—they were both down—I did not see Burgess kick Tite, he was in the act of kicking at him when I stepped between them and separated them—some few minutes afterwards they got together again, and I saw Burton, Morgan, and Sims with them—Tite was very much excited, and he threatened to kill Burgess the first oppor<lb/>tunity he had—they tried to pacify him, but it appeared in vain, and they undressed him and put him to bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an attendant in this institution, and have been so upwards of three years—I was in charge of the attendants over the patients—on Wednesday, 19th September, about half-past seven o'clock, I saw Tite and Burgess fighting—Tite picked up a log of wood to strike at Burgess, and Burgess, to defend himself, closed with Tite, and they both fell down together—Burgess recovered his feet first, and kicked Tite several times on different parts of the body—they were then separated, and Burgess was taken away—Tite was very much excited—Burton told him to go and sit down, and keep himself quiet—there was a bruise on Tite's cheek, slightly bleeding—he refused to sit down, and we undressed him and put him to bed—we were obliged to use force to do so—I afterwards examined his pockets and found upwards of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money and a sharp instrument, a piece of steel between two pieces of stick—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he must have made it himself—I reported this matter to Dr. Anton, the same evening, verbally—I believe Burgess did not receive any bruises—I did not see or hear anything of it—we put Tite into a room by himself, and locked him up—it was not a padded room—he was not so violent as to require that—next morning as I passed his door I said, "Tite, it is time to get up and have a wash"—he gave me no answer—some few minutes later I spoke to him again, and requested him to get up—he did not move, and I went and took the bedclothes off of him, and then attempted to dress him, which he</p>

               <p>resisted and refused—at the same time Morgan was passing the door, and I asked him to assist me, and he came to do so—as we were pulling his drawers on Burton was passing—Tite then flew at Burton and caught his arm in his mouth; then, loosing the hold of Burton's arm, he caught Morgan by the testicles—he was very much excited—Morgan left, and went away to the laundry—Burton and I took him away from Morgan, and at last succeeded in dressing him—Morgan cried out for help, and he said he felt sore afterwards—after Tite was dressed he walked to the sink in front of Burton and me, with Burton's hand resting on his jacket collar—I searched him after his clothes were put on—he took the jacket off to wash himself, and after that he went and sat down and was quiet for a minute or so—he sat on a settee in a recess opposite the attendant's room door—he le left the sink and went quietly back to the recess—I am sure of that—he then came to me at the attendant's room door opposite the recess, and asked me for his money and his knife—I told him it was all right, the doctor had it—he made no answer—he was quiet then—he turned away and went to the other end of the gallery, near to No. 1, where there is a glass door—I did not observe that he said anything as he went along—he might have been talking to himself—I saw him pick up a chair, and he stood near the door of No. 1 and said that he would smash any b—man that came near him—he was very violent indeed, and very much excited—just at that moment Morgan came through the door from the laundry, the door near the sink siding with No. 1 glass door—Tite was against the glass door, there was about two feet between the door Morgan came through and the glass door—Tite said, "Now, you b—I will do for you"—Morgan, to defend himself, closed with Tite, and they both fell on the floor—I blew my signal whistle for assistance, and Burton came up immediately; it was his duty to come, he was bound to come—he assisted in taking Tite from Morgan—they were on the ground together—Morgan held him down while I took his shoes off—that was after we took him into the single room—it is not true that Morgan knelt on his chest and punched him in the ribs—Tite was very strong when excited, most patients are—he did not display considerable force that morning—they merely fell together, and then Tite was taken from Morgan—there was a struggle while they were on the ground—when we succeeded in getting him away wo took him to his room—he was violent going along—we merely shoved him before us—he was in front of the three of us, Burton, Morgan, and me—I don't remember that he said anything—when we got him into his room he sat himself on the floor, and I took off his shoes while Burton and Morgan were holding him—he kicked at me once, and he struggled with his feet to prevent my taking off his shoes—I took them off one at a time and threw them on the floor—we only took off his boots, neck-handkerchief and braces—that is a usual thing to do to prevent the patient strangling himself—during the whole time none of us used more violence than was necessary to control him—we merely held him, and kept him from striking us—when they use force to us it is necessary for us to use force—we succeed in quieting them by that means—they are susceptible to fear—I reported the case to the head attendant at the time, directly he was locked up, after the boots, handkerchief, and braces were taken from him—I gave a full report of what had happened verbally—Tite is violent at times—this was one of those occasions.</p>
