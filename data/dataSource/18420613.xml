In consequence of losing mo<lb/>ney from my till, on the night of the 7th of June I marked 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of silver, placed it in the till, and locked it—the prisoner came to work a little before seven o'clock next morning—between eight and nine I went to the till—it was still locked—I opened it, counted the money, and five half-crowns and two shillings were gone—I called in Horsnell, who was waiting outside, sent for all my men, and had them searched—they all agreed to be searched—nothing was found on the two first—the prisoner was then searched, and in his pockets were found the identical five half-crowns and two shillings which I had marked the night before, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. besides—I told the prisoner that I little suspected it was him, but it appeared he was found out at last—he made me no answer—he was taken into custody—I suspect he opened the tif with a false key, as there was no appearance of force—I have lost between 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi> and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the till—and if it had not been for the constable, I might have lost 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi> or 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received information from him that I was being robbed.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 194.) About twelve o'clock in the morning of the 22nd of December last I was in Church-street, Shore<lb/>ditch, and heard the springing of a rattle, which took me to Nicol's-court—when I got there I saw my brother officer, James Carroll, <hi rend="italic">H</hi> 160—he had hold of a man, who was struggling to get away—I went to assist Carroll—there were other persons around them—I and Carroll succeeded in getting the man about thirty or forty yards along—whilst we were doing that, the persons around were hallooing, and closed in on us, trying to get our prisoner away from us—when we got near the Knave of Clubs I saw a person named Thomas Smedley—he knocked Carroll down, struck me, and rescued our prisoner from us—I told Carroll if we could not have the prisoner, we could have the man that rescued him from at—we followed Smedley, and succeeded in getting him to the station—he was committed, and convicted here—while I followed Smedley the mob were crying out, "Don't let the b—s take any of you, give it to the b—a"—they fol<lb/>lowed us when we were taking Smedley—we never lost sight of Smedley—we took him in Turville-street, and took him along to Old Nicol-street—the mob still followed, making the same noise—when we got to Turville-street, another constable, named Ffelan, came up and took hold of Smedley, who made several blows at Carroll, over Ffelan's shoulder——he did not hit him that I could swear to—while he was doing so, I saw the prisoner, and beard him say, "Give it to the b—s, don't let them take any of you"—shortly after he said that, Carroll fell—I cannot say what made him fall—there was a great mob—they were very violent—I and Carroll were struck, but by whom I cannot say—I do not know who lifted Carroll up again—I saw him when be was up—I saw him bleeding from the head—I called a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and put him into it—I afterwards took Smedley to the station.</p>

I am superintendent of Galley Quay, and live in Portland-place North, Clapham-road; Mr. Joseph Barber is the proprietor of the wharf; the goods on the quay are under my charge. In consequence of what Moss said, I accused the prisoner of baring robbed the basket—be pulled two packages of screws from his left-hand pocket, and said he was very sorry, he hoped he should be forgiven, he had not had any work for the last fourteen days, and in consequence of that he was induced to do it to find him bread—I insisted on searching him, when he took three more packets from the other pocket—if these things had not been forthcoming I should have been answerable for them, indeed we have paid the value for them—they were goods in transit, about to be shipped for Guernsey.</p>

The prisoner was in his service for eight months, be left on the 21st of February—about ft fortnight after that, between one and two o'clock in the afternoon, I was going up stairs, and saw the prisoner and another boy behind a door in the passage—I went up and told my master, then came down, and pursued the prisoner—he ran into a court, and I lost sight of him—I fastened up the house on the night of the 15th of April, as soon as it got dark—I dare say it was after eight—it was all fast about ten, when I went to bed—I came down in the morning, at five o'clock, and perceived the area-door open—it was fastened when I went to bed the night before—the kitchen drawers were opened, and the things pulled out, and also the things out of a work-box which was in the window—a few halfpence were taken from the work-box, and twopence from under an egg-cup on the dresser, which was there the night before—a piece of mutton, a pud<lb/>ding, a loaf of bread, and some cheese were taken out of the safe—Mr. Musprat has an office on the first-floor-a desk of his was broken open—it was supposed the thieves had got in from the churchyard, over the shed into the area—a board had been taken out by the side of the area-door, and the canvas was cut through—that would enable a person to put his hand in and undo the fastening—any person who had been living in the house would know where the fastening of the door was—the opening was just by the fastening—I found a pair of shoes on the shed</p>

Mr. W. begs to say, Thomas is a base, ungrateful villain; no other master would put up with his conduct for some months past. Mr. W, has kept him till he has stolen every shilling he had in the house. Should he call on you, I have no wish to punish him, provided he returns the pro<lb/>perty stolen; if not, he may depend on transportation. The officers are every where in search of him, and I hope many days will not be over be<lb/>fore he is taken.

               <p>afterwards—they went away together to a public-house near—they came back again to the door, but not into the house, they spoke to me in passing, then went across to Mr. Griffiths, the pawnbroker, where some handker<lb/>chiefs were hanging up—the prisoner came in again for some porter—I went to the till to change 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and when I got there, I found the money stated gone—no one but the prisoner and his companion had been in from the time of my seeing the money, and missing it—I told the prisoner I was robbed, that there had only been him and his companion there—I said there was a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece I could swear to, because it was particu<lb/>larly marked—a person went to Mr. Griffiths, and returned to my house—that person said nothing in the prisoner's presence about a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece to my knowledge—the prisoner had a handkerchief in his hand—I had noticed marks on the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece I lost—when the prisoner heard that I had missed a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, he went over to Mr. Griffiths, and retained with the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—he asked if I knew the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—I said, "It is mine"—he put it into his pocket, and said, "It is in my pocket now, and you shall not see it again"—I sent for a policeman—I sent a person out of the shop to see what he had paid for this handkerchief, and the person returned, and said he had paid with a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—he was given into custody.</p>

I was in the Park on Monday, the 30th of May, from about a quarter before six till about a quarter past six o'clock—I saw the prisoner there, leaning on the pump, about the centre of Constitution-hill—I was there merely for a walk—I saw her Majesty's carriage passing. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What distance was you from the carriage when any thing happened?</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184206130040"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between twelve and sixteen paces behind the carriage—just as Her Majesty's carriage got past the pump, I saw him take two or three paces from the pump towards the wall nearest Buckingham Palace gardens—I saw him hold his arm out, and directly after saw the flash of the pis<lb/>tol, and heard the report—the pistol was directed towards her Majesty's carriage—I saw the fire, and heard the report—I have been in the army about eighteen months, or rather better—I have had experience in firing ball as well as blank cartridges.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From what you could judge, was the pistol which was discharged loaded with ball or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say it was. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From what circumstance should you form that judgment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A piece fired off with a ball is somewhat sharper than with blank cartridge—I should say the prisoner was about three paces from the carriage when he fired—that is what is commonly called yards—I was on the same side of the way as the prisoner was—her Majesty sat on the same side as he stood on—when he fired I saw the policeman turn to the side, and catch hold of him, and seeing there was no other policeman handy, I ran up and have assistance directly,</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where were you recruited? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At Abingdon, Berkshire, some time in February, last year—I cannot say how long I con<lb/>tinued to drill—it is generally three or four months—I was a tailor be<lb/>fore I joined the army.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COLONEL ARBUTHNOT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you be so good as to tell us whether you could form a judgment, from the report of the pistol, whether it was loaded with a ball? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why, my Lord, the report was sharp and loud, but I did not hear the whiz of a ball, in consequence of the noise of the carriage and eight horses—my opinion is the pistol was loaded with some matter, from the sharpness and loudness of the report—I cannot form a stronger opinion as to its being loaded than I have already given-it is a mere matter of opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing there what nothing in the pistol but gunpowder, would that make such a report as you beard? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Decidedly, my Lord, the re<lb/>port would not be so sharp or loud—the report of a pistol with blank cart<lb/>ridge is a mere evaporation of the powder—the report was of a pistol well rammed down and charged—I cannot swear it was loaded with more than gunpowder and Wadding rammed on it; but, as I have already stated, it was well rammed down, from the report, that is my deliberate opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> We want to know whether the pistol fired from the place where the prisoner was, although only loaded with wadding and powder well rammed down, as it fired at such a distance from the Queen that it might pro<lb/>duce bodily harm to the Queen, or wound her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My opinion is it most have produced injury to the Queen, even though only rammed down with gunpowder and wadding at the top of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">LIEUTENANT PATRICK FITZGERALD</hi>. I have served in the Spanish and Portuguese armies. I was on Constitution-hill on Monday evening, the 30th of May—I was waiting to see the Queen return to the palace—shortly before her carriage came up I was standing close to the pump, on the foot<lb/>path, on the side of the road close to the brick wall of the Palace garden, the same side as the prisoner—before the carriage came up I saw the prisoner, and observed him particularly—he was walking about—I was four or five yards from him, on his right, when the Queen's carriage came up, nearer the Palace—as soon as the Royal carriage came up in a line where the prisoner standing, I saw him, in this attitude, discharge a pistol—I saw it in</p>

                  </hi>. I am equerry to his Royal Highness Prince Albert, I accompanied the Queen on Monday, the 30th of May—her Majesty went out in an open carriage, that will not shot up, and sat on the right-hand side—in the route from the Palace towards Constitution-hill there is a wall on the left-hand side—it is the wall of the Palace garden—there is a space between the wall and the carriage road—I should think the space is six or eight yards from the wall to the carriage road, including the foot-path—there are several trees there—there is the carriage road, and on the other side a foot-path, and the iron railing inclosing the Green Park—I saw the prisoner after he fired—he fired on the Queen's side, on the right-hand side—she was returning to the palace at the time—it was on the right-hand side of the carriage—her Majesty was in the same situa<lb/>tion in the carriage in returning home as when she went out—she had not changed her position—anybody who had seen her go out might expect her in coming back to be on the wall side—she always sits on that side of the carriage—I was riding as nearly as possible abreast of the Royal carriage, on the near side—a communication had been made to me, which induced me to keep very near the carriage during that time—the first thing that attracted my attention was a sharp report of a pistol—I pulled up short on that report, turned round to my right, and saw the prisoner—the carriage had then passed a few yards, going at the rapid pace it was—I saw the pri<lb/>soner, with his hand down, and something in it—a policeman almost im<lb/>mediately seized him, and a guardsman on the other side—I rode up to him, and desired them to bring him to the porter's lodge at the Palace, that I might examine him, or see him examined—I saw the pistol—(<hi rend="italic">Inspector Rusell here produced a pistol</hi>)—. this is it—it was taken from him in my presence, by the policeman—I am able to recognize it again—I have not a doubt of its being the pistol.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I do not know whether yon are acquainted with this sort of fire-arm, how far it would carry? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh yes, it depends much on the elevation, but it would carry fifty or sixty paces—it might be made to carry more—it depends on the elevation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it as dangerous when discharged as a larger one might be at the distance it was fired? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly, at a short distance—so good an aim could not be taken with it as with a larger one, hot at a short distance it is as destructive as a larger one—I cannot state exactly how far the prisoner was from the Queen at the time it was fired, as I was on the opposite side of the carriage—a pace is thirty inches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the distance of about seven feet would the wadding even of the pistol, if well runned down, be competent to do any personal mischief? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly, any exposed part of the person, if it was wounded, and it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184206130042"/>
               <p>would be very likely to set fire to the dress; but it would decidedly wound the skin, or any part only covered with thin muslin it might wound—it was a very sharp loud report for such a pistol.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you form any judgment whether it had anything in it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>. No further than from the sharpness of the report—it must have had some<lb/>thing to compress the powder strongly to induce it to make such a report, either very strong wadding, or a bullet—something to compress the powder very considerably.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing it had not a bullet, but an irregular piece of lead or metal, was the pistol competent to do mischief in that way? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Most certainly, or if a stone, either round or of an irregular shape, had been in it—from what I heard of the report, in my judgment, the powder certainly must have been well runned down with something—I saw the prisoner searched—an empty pocket-book, and some powder screwed up very tight in paper, and some trifling things were found on him—nothing else of any moment—I think there was a penny or twopence found on him—he did not appear much excited, very firm, I thought; I observed some agitation about his lip and nose—I asked his name, where he lived, and what he was, but he remained silent—he gave no answer whatever—I took him through the palace to the equerries' door in Pimlico, and, accompanied by inspector Russell, saw him put into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with the guardsman and policeman, and conveyed to Gardener's-lane station-house—I accompanied him on horse back, and in the cell I star him stripped and better searched than he was before, and there I left him—the policeman put some questions to him there—he merely stated that he had a father and mother alive, also brothers and sisters, and that he lived about two miles off—he would not tell where, nor say anything else.</p>

Q.</hi> When the pistol had been taken from the prisoner, do you happen to know whether it had been unscrewed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know—it would not unscrew at the time I took it from him, for I twisted it in my hand, and could not unscrew it.</p>

On the 18th of May, I had been to a wedding in Leman-street—I left it about three o'clock in the morning, and was returning home—as I was going down Rose-lane, Spitalfields, the prisoner came from the door of a house, flew upon me, caught hold of me, by. the handkerchief, made use of a very bad expression, and said, "I must have your money, I have come from Stratford, and have no money"—she put her hand into my right hand coat pocket and took out a half-sovereign, and one shilling—when I was at the wedding, I had asked my uncle to oblige me with change for half-a-sovereign—he had not change, and I put it back into my outside pocket—I had my money in my hand, and my hand in my pocket, when she caught me by the throat I pulled my hand out, as I thought I should be strangled, to try to save myself—she put her face very near to mine at the time—I went into the house afterwards, but the passage was so dark, I could not perceive where I was. going—I came out again, and left the door a little way open—I got a policeman—I saw the prisoner about two hours afterwards, at the corner of Rose-lane, and he went into the same house which she had come from when she assaulted nw—the policeman went in and took her there.</p>

On the 30th of May, about eleven or half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, I was going along Lisson-grove and saw the prisoner and four or five others with him—they were coming towards me—I passed them—as I came opposite to the prisoner, he took my handkerchief out of my left hand side jacket pocket—I turned round and saw it in his hand—I had nothing hut the handkerchief in my pocket—he threw it down and walked on—another one picked it up—I caught hold of the other one with my right hand, and held my left hand out to take the handkerchief from him—he threw it down in the scuffle and I picked it up—he began to knock me about with a bone which he had in his hand—three or four of them came round me, and threatened me if I did not let him go—I did let him go, but kept the handkerchief—I afterwards saw the prisoner in custody—I am quite sure he is the person that took my handkerchief—I did not know him before.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 5th of May I was a policeman of the N divisions and was on duty that afternoon, at Hornsey, by the side of the wood—I met a gentleman there, and observed that he had a large bunch of seals—previously to that I had received information of robberies having been committed in that neighbourhood, and a description of the man suspected had been read at the station—in consequence of this I turned round, in the direction the gentleman was going—I did not see any person, and was going on my beat again—as I turned round to go from the gentleman towards Hornsey-wood-house, I saw the prisoner about the middle of the road, walking towards me—I was in my police uniform—when he saw me he ran to the opposite side of the road, and went down a little bank, into the adjoining field by the road-side—I followed him into the field, but saw nothing of him when I first came into the field—I found him, stooping down by the hedge—I saw that he had two pistols laid down before him on the ground—I asked him what he did there—he answered, "Nothing particular"—I then told him if he did not give a better account of himself than that, I must take him into custody—on my saying that he sprang from the hedge, and stood before me—he then had one pistol in his right hand, and one in his left—he then aimed the pistol in his right hand at me—it was apparently aimed at my head—I put up my left arm to save my head, and put the pistol on one side, and he then fired it—I might then be about two yards from him, as near as I can judge—he fired the right-hand pistol, and something from it went into my arm, and came out just above the elbow—he then stepped backward two or three steps, changed the pistol in his left hand to the right, and the right to the left—I advanced towards him—he aimed the pistol which he then had in his right hand at me—it appeared to be at my head—I was then rather closer to him—he pulled the trigger of that pistol then, and I heard it trig off, but it was not dis<lb/>charged—I then rushed at him—he then, with the pistol which he had in his right hand, struck at my head, but only knocked my hat off—he and I struggled together for a short time—during the struggle his hat came off—I was obliged to let go of him, for I found I bad not the least use of this arm—I did not observe that it was bleeding at the time—when I let him go, he ran ten or fifteen yards from me, and turned round—I went to pick up my hat, that he had knocked off, and he said if I attempted to follow him, or make any alarm, he certainly would shoot me dead—he ran away without his hat—he had a pistol in each hand when he used these threats—I pursued him, calling out "Murder!"—when he had got about half way along the field, he stopped, and put the pistol in his right hand into his breast—he had his coat buttoned, with a button or two at the bottom—on putting it into his breast he pulled out a large knife, appa<lb/>rently from his watch-pocket—I do not exactly know where he pulled it from—it was a large carving-knife, as it appeared to me, but I was not close to it—when he drew that knife out, he said if I followed him any further, he certainly would do for me—I stopped then, and pulled out my staff—he put the knife back to where he took it from, and ran off—I con<lb/>tinued</p>

               <p>across the field, a very little distance from Howard—he was running to the left of the road to Hornsey—I saw he had a pistol in each hand—I went towards Highbury-barn tavern to get a policeman, and found the policeman Daly, the deceased—I told him to take a man coming down the lane with two pistols in his hand, to take him in charge for the murder of a man at Hornsey-wood house—I thought he had murdered him—I left Daly to go, and I went for assistance to Highbury-barn tavern—when I got more assistance, I went to Highbury park south, and there saw the prisoner again—it is no thoroughfare there—he was standing with his back against the paling, with two pistols, one in each hand—there were about twenty persons round him, or there might be more—nothing was said about shooting a policeman that I heard—Daly was there—the prisoner stood with a pistol in each hand, first looking on one side, and then the other, in this position—(<hi rend="italic">holding both arms out</hi>)—I heard Daly say to him, "I don't think those pistols are loaded"—the prisoner said they were, and he would shoot two more—Daly said, two or three times, he thought those pistols were not loaded, and the baker ran into him—Daly said, "Surrender, I don't think those pistols are loaded"—then he said they were, and he would shoot two more—the baker then ran in to him on the left side—he ran in with his head down, trying to get his arms down—I did not see a stick in the baker's hand—when the prisoner found he was secured on the left-hand side, he partly got his arm down, lifted his arm up, and shot the baker through the shoulder, and as Daly advanced, he extended his arm, and shot him through the body instantly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From the rapid way this passed, could you or not judge whether he took an aim at Daly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I should say he did—he appeared to me to do so—he was immediately seized, and taken into custody by the people—I went to the station when he was taken there, and saw two ballets taken from his fob pocket—the boy Hewson handed a hat to me at the station—I showed it to the prisoner, and asked him if it was his—he said, yes, it was—I saw Mr. Drewry, the surgeon, with Daly before I left.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You know the ground in the neighbourhood of the tavern perfectly well where this occurrence took place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Pretty well—when I went out, I found Moss about twenty yards from Hornsey-wood house, which stands by the side of a road—the lane goes off at oblique angles from that road, at the end of it is the Seven Sisters-road—nearly opposite Hornsey-wood house is a stile, and a foot-path from it down into a valley—you cannot see into the valley from the house, the road, or stile, without going to the top of the rising ground—there are palings or hedges in the valley, running along, and going off rather south-west—there is a lane not far from Hornsey-wood house, leading into Hornsey-wood—any body might pass me, and go into the wood very quickly, or down into the valley, and down by the hedges, and be out of sight in an instant—the second field joins the one the stile enters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now a person running along those field?, and towards Highbury, was likely to have been kept in sight all the time, or near it, for a considerable distance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If they were close after him—from the second field the pri<lb/>soner ran from, there is no rising ground for a considerable distance—I know the black ditch which runs towards Highbury—it is from fourteen to eighteen feet broad, and wider at some places—in the course the prisoner took, he must have gone over that ditch—at some places it is not so wide—I saw him cross the ditch, but do not exactly know the part—I went across the ditch after him—he jumped from one side of the ditch to the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184206130055"/>
               <p>other—it may be half a mile from the second field, or three-quarters of a mile—in going towards Highbury he would run behind some gentlemen's gardens, Highbury-park-terrace, and so on—the course from the second field to the lane spoken of is all open to the left of Hornsey-road—to the right of the field towards Highbury, and then to the right it is all open ground—there is a hedge or two to the right—these roads are rather un<lb/>frequented—the lane Daly was shot in, is called Highbury-park south—round at the end of that is an enclosure—there are two enclosures—there it a high paling to one, and over this paling you get to another one which lies immediately at the end of the lane—from that enclosure the ground lies down towards a woody part, trees and bushes, and a paling at the bottom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing instead of going to Highbury-park south he had gone down this declivity, there was no one to stop him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the gar<lb/>deners were in the garden-ground working—it was more open to the right at the end of the lane—there is a declivity, and at the bottom of that trees and bashes—there was nobody to stop his going down there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were the persons in the first or second enclosure after him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were in the second enclosure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing he had run down the declivity, would be not soon have been lost among the bushes and trees, unless you had gone down after him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—people were there at work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the bottom of the declivity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He could not have got out of light—the people at work in the gardens were not to the left of the enclo<lb/>sure coming from Hornsey, but on the right as I ran after him—he must have passed between them and Mr. Wilson's—they were at work, I believe, in Mr. Wilson's garden, which is to the left of Highbury-park south coming from Highbury—leaving the palings to the left, there is a falling ground, and at the bottom trees, bushes, and palings—if he had gone down the declivity there were the gardeners to stop him in Mr. Wilson's garden—that is surrounded by a paling, but they were at work in the garden, and would have taken him if they possibly could.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you say he was looking from right to left, was not he throwing his bead backward and forward as fast as he could? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he was doing so full ten minutes after Daly came up—it was ten minutes before any body offered to take him—he was throwing his head backward and forward in that manner at the moment Mott rushed on him—Mott tried to take advantage and seize him just as his head was away, and the moment after<lb/>wards his head came back to where Mott was—I had a gun—it was handed to me by Mr. Simmons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not just about that time that he fired when he saw the gun in your hands? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the baker had not a broom handle in his hand to my knowledge—I did not see any—I saw nothing done with a broom han<lb/>dle—I saw Turnbull with a brick in his hand—he was going to throw the brick at him—that was nearly at the same moment as I had got the gun—he was seized directly after he fired, and his arms held.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live at Hornsey. On the day this happened I was in Hornsey-road in a cart, and was spoken to by Young—in consequence of what he said to me I drove along the Hornsey-road, and saw the prisoner close to the field running towards Highbury College—he had no hat on—I cannot say whether he had any thing in his hand—I pursued him—I got out of the cart, and went across the fields in the same direction as he was taking—I called out as I went along to induce people to join in pursuit—I called out, "Stop that man without a hat, he has shot a policeman"—there is a broad ditch in the way he was taking—I did not see him clear that—I went over it—he got over a fence leading to an enclosure—I did not get over myself—I was let through round by Highbury-barn—I was then inside the enclosure—I observed the prisoner then pacing up and down—he was ramming his hands up and down inside the breast of his coat—this was when he was in the enclosure close to Highbury-park South—I observed one person get over and go up towards him while he was in the enclosure—he got within a few yards of him—upon that the prisoner took two pistols out, one from the breast of his coat, and the other from his pocket—he presented one at me—I did not see him do any thing with the other—I did not hear any body say any thing—I then lost sight of him for a minute or two—I was let through round by Highbury Barn, and lost sight of him for that time—when I saw him again he was standing in the lane called Highbury-park South—there were a few people about him, and they kept increasing—he was standing with his back against the palings, and his arms extended with a pistol in each hand—I saw the policeman Daly there—Mott was standing by the side of him—I was not near enough to hear any thing said—I saw Mott make an advance towards the prisoner while he was so standing—upon which I directly heard the report of a pistol—I was thirty or forty yards off—I cannot say for a few yards—I taw the smoke of the pistol, and saw the pistol in the prisoner's hands—it was pointed in the direction of Mott</p>

Q.</hi> Supposing you had a patient who exhibited great want of sleep, should not You attribute that to some affection of the brain, to a diseased action of the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not in all cases, certainly not—continual excitement will keep sleep away—it is not always to be attributed to inflammation, because in affections of the brain we have <hi rend="italic">coma,</hi> and a perfect <hi rend="italic">comatose</hi> state of body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If a patient showed great wakefulness beyond that of an ordinary person, would not you attribute that to an extraordinary and unusual action of the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It depends very much on circumstances—a constant stimulant will some times keep persons swake, but in affection of the brain we have a very different state—the brain would sot be wrong in all cases of wakefulness—there are many cases of fever where there is great wakefulness—that may be to a certain extent caused by the action of fever on the brain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing the absence of any artificial stimulant, and a person in an ordinary degree of health, showed great wakefulness, should not you attribute that to something wrong in the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it may be, but not in all cases—there are cases in which you might have action going on in the brain, and yet wakefulness kept up—if a person exhibited great wakefulness for years, without any symptom of disease, I should not attribute that to an affection of the brain—some people can do with two, or five, or six hours' sleep out of twenty-four, and go on in that way for years—I should say that was natural, unless explained in some other way—we have so many cases of the sort—I should attribute sleeplessness beyond the ordinary course of nature to a good mental activity—I should refer it to the operation of the brain, of course—if a person had a kettle of boiling water fall on his arm, and exhibited no signs of pain, I should not say it was natural or unnatural—I should say he would feel it, but whether he expressed what he felt would be another thing—he certainly must feel it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing he does not appear to feel it, is not that at variance with the ordinary course of nature? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I do not say it is perfectly consistent with the ordinary course of natural feeling—I say he would feel the pain, but whether he expressed it is another thing—if he has great moral courage he need not express it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe there is a disease in which the patient is excessively ravenous, and can hardly get enough to eat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There are occasional symptoms</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184206130062"/>
               <p>of that kind, called <hi rend="italic">bulimia,</hi> in which ravenous eating is the principal symptom, it is a depraved appetite—a want of control over the evacuations is certainly not usual.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing an individual in apparent health exhibited great sleeplessness, was excessively ravenous in his appetite, very dirty in his habits, said he was converted and a child of God, called himself Dick Turpin and King Richard, and wanted to dig his father out of his grave, because it was no use he should lie there, would You be prepared to say he was in a sound state of mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would depend very much on the circumstances—if satisfied those things existed, I should say there might be some peculiarity about him—he might have some of those symptoms without having the mind affected at all—if they all existed, I should say he was not in a sound state of mind—an alienation of the natural affections, a person fond of his relatives at one time, and subsequently exhibiting great violence to them, is one symptom of insanity—continual expressions of weariness of life is not always a symptom of insanity, it is at times certainly; an attempt on life may or may not be so—coupled with the other circumstances, I should say it was a symptom of unsound mind—an acute state of fever generally affects the brain, as putrid fever, and a malignant form of typhus—the brain is peculiarly liable to be acted on in that disease.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And sometimes the effects of the disease do not pass rapidly away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, they last for a considerable time—I have known that disease, and disorders of that character, affect the brain for some years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a person affected in that way, and a year or two after<lb/>wards had another severe illness of an inflammatory kind, that might increase the effect produced by the fever? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly—insane persons are particularly prone to resist aggressive attacks or violence—it is characteristic—wandering about without an object, is a symptom of insanityquiet and repose are favourable to the restoration of reason—in a person of unsound mind it is quite uncertain at what time the disease will reach the period of mania—any circumstance may bring it forth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It may come out at any time, and particularly when acts of violence are threatened? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—a great many individuals only exhibit unsoundness of mind on certain subjects, that it <hi rend="italic">monomania</hi>—it is quite uncertain how soon a limited insanity may assume the form of a general one—the bodily faculties, in cases of mental derangement, are very considerably stronger than in ordinary persons—wakefulness is a symptom of deranged mind.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Assuming a person had committed several robberies, noticed a po<lb/>liceman coming towards him, to jump through a hedge into a field, and conceal himself, would You refer that conduct to a diseased mind, or a consciousness on the part of the party so acting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perfect consciousness—supposing him to be followed by a policeman, and to disable the policeman in pursuit, by firing at him, I should refer that to perfect consciousness of what he was about</p>

The prisoner was twenty-three years of age last January—when young he had a severe illness—he had the putrid fever—he was about one year and eight months old then—previous to that he was like other children, as fine a child as was ever born, and had every symptom of being a fine, sensible child—after that illness he presented a different appearance—he never seemed to take any rest at all like another child—as he grew up he always was very restless—wake when we would, we always found him awake—up to this time he never to say, would rest half-an-hour at a time to my knowledge—since I have given tap housekeeping, we have slept in one room, and wake when I would, I always found him awake—it was a matter of observation with others besides myself—the old lady that is living with me now, and another that was with me five years back, when my husband died, knows that I have gone down to him many times in the night—from the time of his having this fever up to lately he has always exhibited this restlessness, and want of sleep—when any thing struck him, or he was scalded or burnt, he never appeared to care about it—he never appeared to have any feeling—once when he was about twelve years old, when I was up stairs with his father, when he had the gout, he threw a saucepan of broth all over his arm, and scalded himself, and the skin came off with his jacket and shirt sleeve—I applied oatmeal and water, and vinegar to it—he did not appear to care in the least about it—I cried bitterly to see it so—he said, "Never mind, I don't care much about</p>

               <p>it; I don't feel it"—he said he did not feel it but very little, and I was not to cry—when he was thirteen or fourteen years of age, he got up to some hooks at the top of a paling, and tore his arm and jacket—he said he did not feel it—he has from that time never seemed to care for hurts or scratches—however he hurt himself he did not seem to feel it—up to a late period of his life he has shown that disregard of hurts—when he was a child he fell under the grate, and burnt all the skin off his neck, and then he did not even shed a tear—that was after he had the putrid fever—with regard to his appetite, he was always very ravenous, very hungry—I could never give him enough—he never knew when he had had enough—that has continued down to a late period of his life—all the money he could get he would spend on cannons, pistols, and fire-arms, and buying and selling watches and Dutch clocks—I have taken cannons and pistols away from him, and bid them from him—he has missed them, (in the mean time I have had them in my possession,) and if he has earned enough money he has gone and bought more—that has continued to a late period of his life—he works at his business as a bricklayer when he can get it to do, when he was allowed to work—my husband was a bricklayer—frequently after I have been to bed, I have been disturbed by the prisoner's getting up, and walking about the room—he has many times said that there has been something lifting his bed up and down, and he could not sleep in it, and I have frequently made him up a bed in my back parlour where I sleep now—that has happened many times—he has often jumped up, and said he was King Richard, and Dick Turpin, when he was sitting in a chair—at that time he had no weapons—some times he had a pistol in his hand—that has happened more than once—he would often say he was King Richard when he had nothing in his hand—when he had, I made him put them away for fear he should do mischief with them—I have known him lay out his money in pistols, cannons, and so on, when he has not had a bit of bread to eat—he would go without a bit of shoe to his feet, and then buy pistols and watches—he has always expressed an indifference to life, always wishing to make away with himself—he was always tired of his life, from being quite a boy—he has said so many times, more than 100 times—when I was confined two years ago come the 4th of August, he got a bottle with some arsenic and laudanum in it—I got out of bed, and knocked it out of his hand, or he would have taken it—he was in the room at the time, towards the fire-place—I saw the phial in his hand—there was a white powder in it—I asked him what it was after knocking it out of his hand, and breaking it—he said it was arsenic and laudanum, for he was tired of his life, and if he did not do it then he would at another time—he was in his shirt at the time—he took none of it then—I knocked it out of his hand—between five and six months back he took 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of laudanum—he bought it a penny-worth at a time, and drank it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did You see him buy it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but he owned to it after<lb/>wards—I saw him drink it.</p>

HORRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He told you he had bought it a pennyworth at a time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I sent to Mr. Griffiths's, of Clerkenwell-green, for some castor-oil, and poured it down his throat out of a tea-cup—I made some water hot, put a great deal of salt into it, and made him drink it till he was sick—he was ill more than a fortnight on that occasion—he vomited blood all day on Sunday and Monday—about five years back a boy of the name of Gaulley,</p>

               <p>who is here, told me something, in consequence of which I went into the kitchen and saw the prisoner—he was then thrown on the bed by his brother, who is here—he was black in the face, and in a fit—at that time he was ill in bed, confined to his bed through illness—he had not been in Bartholomew's Hospital before that—it was shortly after that, I dare say two months afterwards—I put him into the workhouse before I put him into the hospital—I said it was because he was ill, but it was because he attempted to hang himself—I could not keep a watchful eye on him—his father (my husband) was then lying on his deathbed—he came from the workhouse without leave or liberty, and after I put him into the hospital, he came home from there one day without leave—he was never discharged at a patient—he came home without leave, the moment the music played op for the fair—when he was put into the hospital he was very ill—I believe he had the dropsy—he was swollen all over, and he was the same when he came home—his feet were wrapped up in pieces of carpet—he had no shoes on—he was swollen so that he could get no shoes to fit him—he could get no shoes on—once, after his father's burial, he fainted away—I was not at home when it happened, but after I came home he said he was going past the burial ground, and he saw his father come out of the grave—he said he wished he himself could die—I do not know that he said any thing about doing any thing to his father—since my husband died I have got my living by going out washing and charing, and part of the time I kept a little coal-shed—from the time the prisoner had the putrid lever down to the present time he has been very dirty indeed in his habits—he appeared to me to have no control over the natural motions—he would do hit occasions, and shake them out of his trowsers, as he went along, when he was fourteen years of age, and when he was older than that—when he was young I always used to put him in a coarse sheeting bag when I put him to bed, and when he got up, I always had to put him in a pail of water, and sluice him well—I could not put him in any thing when he grew older, but he has been very dirty up to this period, for if he was close to the place he would do it in a <hi rend="italic">po,</hi> and set it away under the bed, even latterly—his behaviour to me and my other sons has been pretty quiet in general, if he was not put out of the way—he has threatened me with violence when I have put him out, when I made him angry, when I wished to have any control over him—he has ill-used me on more occasions than one, once particularly, when he wanted to buy a watch, I had not got the money to give him, and he gave me a heavy blow on the side—at other times he would get and cry, and be as fond of me—about two years back he jumped out of bed, and threatened to blow his brother's brains out, and his own too—he frequently jumps out of bed and walks about, and sometimes when be does so he is violent—he was violent when he jumped out of bed and said he was going to blow his own and his brother's brains out—he has not slept out of my house for the last fifteen or sixteen months, except on one night, and that night he said he had got a check, and gone to the Surrey Theatre—he said he had come borne and knocked at the door, but could make nobody hear—that was about sixteen months ago—I remember his taking two Dutch clocks, one from the front kitchen and one from the back parlour, and pulling them to pieces—they had belonged to my husband—he took the faces off them, and said they were two skeletons—he took the weights, ropes, and the pendulum off, put the clocks, one on one side of the fire-place, and one on the other, set fire to them, and said he was burning</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184206130066"/>
               <p>down two castles—he would sometimes pawn his pistols, and sometimes sell them—I remember on one occasion, when he earned 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at his business, he went and bought a silver watch for 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he picked it to pieces, and put it together again—he then went hack to Petticoat-lane, and sold it for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was not with him, I think his brother was—he brought back another watch, a metal one, which he also picked to pieces—he put that together again, so that he went and sold the movements for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was not with him, I believe my other son was—I know he pulled it to pieces, put it together again, and went away with it—that was on the same day—it is between three and four years ago, as far as I can guess—he has had very bad health lately—he is very weak, but he seemed very careless over it.</p>

               <p>mentioned to-day, but Mr. Mountstevens came in at the time when he was going to hang himself—he was in the habit of pawning pistols—he used to say he pawned them—I remember attending at the second examination before the Magistrate—I know Waddington the gaoler—I remember seeing my son there—I advised him to pray to God for his soul—that was one of the first things I said to him when I saw him—I do not know what answer he made me exactly, but he always considered he had got no soul—I really do not know what answer he made me—he did not tell me he had been bothered enough already with other persons—I never heard him say such a thing to my knowledge—he did not say words to that effect—nor that it was no use my preaching to him—nothing of the sort—I never heard him say so—I never heard what his answer was, but it was nothing of that kind, I am positive—in fact I do not know that he answered at all—he made a face with the poison working up—that was all the conversation I had with him—he did not tell me he wanted me to get pair of pistols out of pawn—he told me he had pawned two; that was at the time I was advising him to pray to God for his soul—he did not say that in answer to my advice—I do not remember what he said to that—after<lb/>wards in the course of the morning, he spoke to me about having pawned some pistols—I do not remember Waddington asking him why he bad pawned those pistols, why he did not keep them, and not buy fresh ones—I do not remember his saying they were too small for the purpose—he did not say so—he told Waddington they were a pair of pretty little pistols, and if he liked to have them he might, and Waddington said he would, and keep them for his own use—he asked me if I had seen a duplicate—I said I had not—I told him it was burnt, I dare say, for a person in my house had burnt one, and I thought that was it—he did not upon that desire me to make an affidavit in order to get the pistols from the pawnbroker's—he told Waddington he might do so—he has been several times in the custody of Waddington on suspicion—I have been in custody once, not sereral times—I cannot say how often he has been in Waddington's custody—if anything was lost in the neighbourhood they used to drag him off, knowing he was not quite right in his mind, on suspicion, to get revenge on him for something or other—I do not know that I ever made any suggestion to Waddington that he was not of sane mind—I do not know a medical man of the name of Elliott, that I know of—I do not know of any such person having been applied to.</p>

               <p>time when I told him to pray to God for his soul, he said, he would do what he could, but I was not to fret about him, he did not wish to live—I told people nothing about his conduct because I did not with him to be made a finger-point, and run after, for they did so without my making them acquainted with it—I kept his conduct concealed as much as possible—the boys used to run after him from the school, and tease him, and the boys in the neighbourhood used to tease him, run after him, and call him <hi rend="italic">Dolly</hi> Cooper, catch hold of his clothes and take the life out of him almost—I told him the duplicate was burnt, because I believed one was burnt—I was taken in custody once—just before that I sent my son out with a gown, I gave him leave to pledge it—I went out for half a day's work directly after I had sent him, and I was fetched home, and taken into custody—I came home and found the policeman is my place with my son on a charge of stealing the gown and two waistcoats of his own—we were both locked up from Wednesday at three o'clock in the afternoon till Friday, and then I was discharged, and he had twenty-eight days for an assault on inspector Penny, because these were proved to be our own—he was discharged on the charge of stealing the gown—I was there in custody at the same time—I heard him charged with assaulting Mr. Penny, and he was committed for twenty-eight days on that, but never for stealing—I have not told Waddington he was not of sane mind, unless I have done so since he has been takes now—my reason for not telling him before was the same as for not telling other persons, I wished to keep it as quiet as I could, for he was ill-used quite enough.</p>

I have known the prisoner about seven or eight years, or longer—I am going on for fourteen years of age—he asked me to fetch arsenic when we were in the rains along with his brother Edward—I said I would not go for it—he threatened to beat me if I did not, and offered to beat me—that was about three or four weeks before he was taken into custody—I remember when Mrs. Cooper and the prisoner lived in Pear Tree-court, about five months ago—the prisoner, his brother Edward, and myself were playing in Mrs. Cooper's room—the prisoner wanted me to stand up in the room for him to shoot at me—he did not offer to give me or his brother Edward a pistol—I ran away—we went down stairs—I said, "No," and he said, "I thought you was not <hi rend="italic">game</hi> to let me do it"—he did not say any thing about having a bit of fun.</p>

I was with a boy, of the name of Gaulley, when I alarmed my mother and Mrs. Southall—they came down stairs together—I called out, because Gaulley, when he went down stairs to fill some coke into a bag, saw my brother with a rope tied round his neck—I saw him with the rope round his neck—it was in the kitchen—when I came into the room he was standing on the foot of the bedstead—I saw the rope round his neck, and I loosened it from him—he was not black in the face at that time, not particularly—he was in a fainting state—he did not appear like a person who had been hanging himself—he had not been hanging—he was only attempting to do it—it was Gaulley that alarmed me—that is about five years ago—he was ill in bed at that time—I have repeatedly heard him speak of seeing his father come out of his grave, and have heard him ask for a spade to dig his father out—he gave no particular reason for that, only that he was a good parent—I was in the room when he came home from St. Bartholomew's Hospital—he was very ill at the time—he had the dropsy about him—his feet were covered partly with rags inside the shoe, which was cut—it was a list shoe, I think—now I remember he had carpet inside his shoes—he could not get a pair of leather shoes on—I know of his taking poison out of a bottle—I was present at the time—it was about six months ago, as near as I can guess—I came home from my work one night, my brother was sitting on a chair, all at once he jumped up, with a bottle in his hand, swallowed off the contents, and then said, "Now I have taken enough to takeaway my life," and then he told us he had swallowed five pennyworth of laudanum—my mother directly gave him three pennyworth of castor-oil, and we walked him about the room almost all the remainder of the right—in the morning he became a little more composed, and went to sleep—he was ill for eight or nine days after that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know now he would dispose of his money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—some three or four years ago he was very fond of going into Petticoat-lane—I have repeatedly gone with him—two or three years ago he went into Petticoat-lane, and purchased a silver-watch for 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., he then went home, and picked it to pieces—I saw him do it—he tried to put it together again, but he could not—he then went and sold it, and exchanged it for another, and paid 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I was with him at the time—he went home, and picked that also to pieces in the same way, and afterwards sold it for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he has threatened to blow my brains out—when he has done that he has been in bed, and jumped up—I have seen pistols in his possession repeatedly—he has got out of bed with the pistols when he has threatened to blow my brains out—I had not done any thing at that time to provoke him.</p>

P. on it—I showed them to him, and after that he kept disputing and saying it was his—he said he had pledged it for 15 guineas, and it was let in with gold—it was a very remarkable one—I have had opportunities of seeing the pri<lb/>soner—he used to use my place when I kept a beer-shop, and two or three times there he played some very curious pranks—he once took a skittle-ball, and said he would have a <hi rend="italic">lark,</hi> and threw it through a wall—it was a bricked-up window—he once came, and nearly pulled all the tiles off the skittle-ground—I was going to call a policeman to give him in charge—he said he should make away with himself if I did, and a young man came and paid the damage, and said he was often taken in that way—at the times I have seen him he was certainly more like a man out of his senses.</p>

I attended in Newgate on the 4th of this month, in consequence of an appointment—Mr. M'Murdo, the sur<lb/>geon of the gaol, and two gentlemen of the name of Elliott, were also in attendance—those two gentlemen attended on behalf of the prisoner's friends,</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see the prisoner in company with Mr. M'Murdo and the other two? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I entered into conversation with him—I was a whole hour with him—after the conversation that we all of us had with him I was clearly of opinion that he was of sane mind—my opinion is that he is perfectly sane.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is not confinement and repose the very situation in which a party, supposing he has been insane, is likely to sink into a quiet state, and</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing on a commission of lunacy you were to give an opinion as to a party being sane or insane, would you consider your opinion satisfactory unless you had heard something of his previous life from his relations, and persons in the habit of seeing him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should certainly like to get all the information I could, for the purpose of forming the best opinion—I consider myself capable of pronouncing an opinion as to the pri<lb/>soner's sanity, as far as the hour's conversation went—I also saw him at the police-court before the Magistrate, the day after the affair took place—I was there accidentally—I went to speak to the Magistrate on other business, and I advised the Magistrate not to continue the examination on account of the prisoner's state of health—I did not go there to pay any particular attention to the state of his mind, but being there I did attend to the state of his health—he was very ill, lying on the sofa, and I advised the Magistrate not to continue the examination—I put qnestions to him at that time, which he answered rationally, with regard to the poisoning—if a lunatic was allowed to commit indiscretions abroad, he would be less rational than if he was in confinement, and under control.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would he not be more likely to be coherent and rational when in Confinement than out of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Inasmuch as he would be quieter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon of the gaol of Newgate, and have been so a little more than twelve years—the prisoner has been under my care and observation since he has been confined on this charge; my attention has been directed to him, with a view to ascertain the state of his mind—my attention was not directed to him during the first few days, but it was afterwards—I have had conversations with him constantly—I have not from first to last noticed any thing irrational or unusual in his manners or mode of conversation—I have not observed any thing to lead me to suspect that he was a person of unsound mind.</p>

Elliott attended—I met them by appointment—I had a communication with the solicitor for the Treasury to that effect, and I attended on that occasion by their desire.</p>

               <p>my presence that the defence would be insanity—I have not seen any of the prisoner's relations except to-day—I am not aware of any offer being made to me to see them if I pleased—I had some information sent me by the solicitor for the defence, as to the ground of some questions which were put by the Messrs. Elliott in my presence—I do not recollect any thing further than that—I never asked to examine the relations, nor do I recol<lb/>lect having had any offer made me of doing so—I had forwarded to me a number of the ground, on which it was believed that insanity exited—I have the paper in my pocket, with a abort note from the solicitor—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I think quiet and repose is favourable to the restoration of rationality—a person who has not been subject to confinement or restraint of any kind will feel uncomfortable in consequence of being confined—I should not suppose that an imprisonment was likely to induce a quiet state of mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a person of unsound mind at large, and violent, would not confinement be more likely to restore him to reason than leaving him at liberty? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would depend on the nature of the confinement—I should not assent to that proposition if the confinement were in Newgate—he would be subject to regular diet and regimen in Newgate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, coupling that with the fact of his confinement, would not that he more likely to induce a sound state of mind than irregular living, and being at large? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not with the concomitant circumstances of the imprisonment, and the accusation that bung over his head—I think the imprisonment would not have the effect of restoring quiet.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HORRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has the prisoner beep in the Infirmary the whole time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, during that time he has had regular living—he has been constantly discomposed by his situation—there has been no inducement to acts of violence that I know of—being in confinement on a charge would weigh on a man's mind, and he has been discomposed—cases are on record of lunatics being rational when under restraint, and being the reverse when set at large—I was in Court when Mr. Drewry was examined—I heard it said that excitement, restlessness, and abstaining from sleep is one among other symptoms of insanity—that may exist during insanity—I do not think that is an unerring sign of a disordered brain—if I found a patient go without sleep beyond the ordinary course of nature, I should think it a sign that he was exceedingly anxious or he might have some local malady, he might be ill otherwise—I might refer You to many diseases that would keep persons awake, by the pain they would cause, by the operation of the malady on the whole nervous system, without acting on the mind—if I saw a person exhibiting the ordinary symptoms of health, without any local malady, abstaining from sleep beyond the time of ordinary individuals, I should not necessarily suppose a disease of the brain—I should watch the individual to see what I could observe—if I saw unnatural sleeplessness without any apparent illness, I should say that the whole nervous system was out of order—the brain is the principal part of the nervous system—I have seen patients sleepless night after night where I could not ascertain any particular cause, and I have not seen them exhibit disease of the brain, or insanity afterwards—if I could not detect any cause at all after a considerable time, I should be inclined to suppose that there was some impression on the man's mind.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184206130078"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If a person was in ordinary health, and You found he exhibited extreme restlessness, could You refer it to anything else than the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should look to the brain for it, and see if I could detect any cause for it—I should not necessarily draw the conclusion that there was an unnatural action of the brain—I should endeavour to find out the cause, supposing the brain to be in a disordered state, intimated by extreme restlessness, disturbance of any sort would be liable to increase the unnatural action of the brain—if a person's brain was disordered and he was exposed to the circumstances You allude to, I should of course suppose the disorder would be aggravated—unnatural sleeplessness is given in the books as one of the symptoms of insanity—extreme voracity is also occasionally given as another symptom, also extreme dirtiness, and alienation of the natural affections.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing, then, that a person showed this sleeplessness, ravenonus appetite, dirty habits, and also an insensibility to hurt, would You say that that person was of sound mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should not necessarily say from hearing that, that he was of unsound mind—I should ask for further information—I have had no information of any kind from the prisoner's relatives—insanity sometimes gives greater mental and bodily power than under other circumstances—I have heard all the evidence on the part of the defence, except the medical evidence—from the evidence I have heard on the part of the defence, and from what I have observed, I believe him to be of Bound mind—if I had merely heard the trial and not seen the man, I should still have thought him of sound mind—that would be my opinion, and that is my opinion from what I have heard to-day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Sleeplessness will proceed from a variety of causes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It may—if a man was to be kept in total want of rest for many days, it would be likely to cause insanity instead of being a symptom of it.</p>

I know the prisoner and his brother, named John—he is not here—the prisoner is a labourer—I was at Hanworth on the 22nd of May, about six o'clock in the afternoon, when they were both together at the Bear, at Hanworth, and quarrelled (they had been at Hampton all the evening, and came to the Bear, and drank there, about half past ten o'clock) the prisoner got the worst of it—John knocked him down, then kicked him and stamped on him—he then left to go home—the prisoner was down when he left him—after he was gone the prisoner put his hand into his pocket, pulled his knife out, and said he would go and stab his brother before he got home—it was a clasp knife—he went after him—I followed, and saw him stab his brother in the stomach directly he got to him—the policeman came up, and sent me for a doctor—the prisoner was not taken till next morning—when he stabbed him, John said, "He has stabbed me"—I did not hear the prisoner say anything.</p>

I was sent for, and saw the nature of the wound—he was wounded on the right side, below the ribs of the abdomen—I should say a knife most probably did it—it was done by a cutting instrument—when I went into the room I found him lying on the bed in his clothes, which were saturated with blood, but the bleeding had then ceased—I closed the wound, dressed it, and went home—I was called between five and six o'clock the next morning, to say the bleeding had burst out again—I was obliged to open the wound, and apply different remedies—in the afternoon I gave the case up to his club doctor—I dared not attempt to ascertain the depth of the wound—a wound in that part is certainly dangerous—he was in imminent danger, and must have continued so for some time—there were also two small wounds on the back besides—they were slight wounds, only skin deep—they were recent wounds, and, I suspect, stabs.</p>

On the 23rd of May, between twelve and one o'clock in the daytime I was over at the ale-house, taking a glass of ale with my husband—somebody came over and said, somebody was doing something to my child—I went out and found the prisoner at the top of the court—I said to him, "You old villain, You rascal, what are You going to do to my child"—I laid hold of him on each side of his collar—he used a bad expression, and said, "I'll let you know," and put something across my face, which cut it where it is now cut—I did not see what he did it with—he was given into custody—I do not know who by—I was taken over to a surgeon.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 9, Bull-yard, Fann-street, Goswell-street. I am employed on the premises of Mr. Richard Beard, the photogenic plate manufacturer—his premises are No. 70, Wharf-road, City-road—part of the premises are in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch, and part in St. Luke's—the part this property was deposited in, I believe, is in St. Leonard's, Shoreditch—I always considered so—on Saturday evening, the 7th of May, I left the premises about a quarter to eight o'clock—nobody slept on the premises at that time—I left them all safe and locked up—I went there again on Sunday morning, between ten and eleven o'clock—I entered by the keys which I locked the gates up with—I unlocked the gates, entered the premises, unlocked the second gate, and got in through a door, which I unlocked—I found the doors as I had left them the night before—I went up stairs, and found the door forced open, two boxes and a desk forced open, and property taken out—there had been large sheets of plate metal there the night before—the metal is prepared on purpose for the photogenic likenesses—nobody, to my knowledge, prepares it in London but Mr. Beard—they are copper plates, covered with silver—I had left the room locked the night before—I went down stairs afterwards, and discovered another portion of plate metal, about twenty or twenty-one</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Fox and Wheatsheaf, Three Colt-street, Old Ford, near Bow, in the parish of St. Mary, Stratford-le-Bow. On the night of the 1st of April I was the last person up on the premises—I retired to bed, as near as I can recollect, about half-past twelve o'clock—I fastened up—all the fastenings were secure all the way through the house—I make it a general rule to fasten up myself—the grating at the back of the house was secure—it is a fixture in brick-work, a flat iron grating, which yon may walk on—it goes over the kitchen area—the back-door was shut and bolted—there was no fastening to the window, but it was close down—I left the premises in that state when I went to bed—my servant came up about half-past five in the morning, and in consequence of what she said, I went down stairs, and found all the lower part of the premises in confusion—the iron grating was pulled up, and the brick-work which held it down was broken away—the window was open—the back door was fast—I did not find any other door open, except the cupboard and parlour doors—this was before six, as soon as the alarm was given—I searched and missed the property stated in the indictment, which is worth about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have since seen the liquor-bottles and stand, work-box, one hearth-rug, the mouseline-de-laine, the white stockings, the picture, two volumes of Cook's Geography, and the two gallon bottles.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Messrs. Thomas and John Venables, of High-street, Whitechapel. About seven o'clock, on the 23rd of May, the prisoner came into the shop in company with another woman, who bought something and paid for it—the prisoner asked to see some gentlemen's colored silk neck-handkerchiefs—I showed her six or seven pieces—I then showed her some figured black satin ones—while doing so I noticed the prisoner's hand under the handkerchiefs—I suspected, and pressed her to buy—she would not—she asked to look at some black ones—I went to fetch some black ones, and took the others up—I took particular notice of what I showed them—I got some at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. then some at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she then thought she should like to look at some lower priced ones—I opened one at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she said she would look at one lower, and I cut her one off—I thought I perceived her hand under the handkerchiefs, and in getting them up I missed one at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I stated the case to Mr. Venables, and he accused her of it—she denied it—he told me to take her into the bonnet-room-as she was going up into the bonnet-room I saw her throw the handkerchief down at the corner of the bonnet-room—it was not the one I had cut off for her to purchase—I called out to Mr. Venables, and picked up the handkerchief—the prisoner still denied knowing anything about it—this now produce is it.</p>

About eleven o'clock on Tuesday evening I was on duty in Brewer-street, Somers-town—I heard a cry of "stop thief," and saw people running in the direction of Pancras-road—I immediately ran down myself, and in about three or four minutes I came up with the prisoner—Marshall had got hold of him, and said he had been and stolen a quantity of plate—the bundle was afterwards delivered to me—I took him to the station—this chisel was given to me by the prosecutrix, with a lucifer-box—I afterwards went and examined the door, but found no mark—there were marks on the drawers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am agent for Mr. Crudis, who lives at North Shields. I am his agent for an estate which he has in Eagle-street—I let this house in Eagle-street to Harper, I think in the Spring of 1839—I believe He took possession of the house—after a short time I found that he and Phillips were quarrelling about the house—I told them if they did not settle the quarrel I should turn them both out—after that I received the rent from Phillips, and have done so for a very long time, I should think for full two years and a half—I received 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-week rent from him—I have considered him as my tenant, and treated him as such, at 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-week—it was a weekly tenancy—I should say 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-week was a very excellent rent for that house—he also held of me the next house to it, for which he paid 16*. a-week—for a portion of the time I gave receipts for the rents of those two houses in different books, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in one book, and 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in another, but to save trouble, I told him to get a new book, and I put both down in one book—the terms on which the house was let to Harper was in writing—I received rent from Harper for some time—I understood it was sent from him—I never received any rent direct from him himself, that I am aware of, but I considered it as received from him—Phillips made a</p>

               <p>representation to me, in consequence of which I treated him as my tenant—I should say he did not show me this receipt at the time he made that representation—this receipt is my own handwriting—I gave it to <hi rend="smallCaps">HARPER</hi> for the fixtures—I should say this was one of the documents which was made at the time the agreement between myself and Harper took place—I should say decidedly that Phillips did not show me this document—I never saw that document since I wrote it till I saw it at Clerkenwell—I would not swear it positively, but such is my impression and belief.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Jones, tailor, of Charterhouse-street. On the 28th of May, at a quarter-past ten o'clock at night, I was coming down Butcher-hall-lane—I got opposite Angel-street-four men were standing there, and the instant I passed, they followed me—when I got to the Blue-coat-buildings, I felt a drag at my pocket-hole—I turned round, and instantly touched the prisoner's hand—one of his companions trod on my dress, to attract my attention—I did not regard it, but went after the prisoner, and I said, "You have robbed me"—he said, "No such thing, what does the woman mean?"—I said, "You have"—he went back—his companions joined him—they went up the street, and turned back—I said, "Go where you will, I will follow you till a police<lb/>man comes"—I followed him half-way up the street—he there passed something to his companions, but I cannot say what—the prisoner was the only one near me when I felt this tug—I lost eight shillings, six sixpences, and two farthings—in a few minutes the policeman came up, and I gave the prisoner into custody—the policeman said, "I don't see that you have any particular charge against him"—I said, "I have lost my money; this man has stolen it from me; if that is not a charge I. don't know what is"—we walked on to near Bartholomew-close—the persons in the crowd said, " Don't leave him, you had better see him to the station-house"—I said, "You see this policeman is not willing to take him, what can I do?"—the policeman said, "I don't see that you have any particular charge against him; you had better make it up quietly," or o' comfortably"—I said, "If you will come to my husband, I will state the case to him, he can do as he thinks proper; if he feels inclined to make it up, I have nothing farther to do, but remember he is the man who has stolen iny money."</p>

I am an innocent man."</p>

                  </hi>. I am eleven years old. On Thursday morning, the 12th of May, my mother gave me a half-crown in a purse, to go to the pawnbroker's to get something out—as I went the prisoners and a little boy overtook me—the little boy took the handkerchief from me, which contained the purse and money, and gave it to Morriss—Tyrrell was with her—the boy ran away—the prisoners kept together—I ran and told my mother, and got a policeman—the boy was close to the prisoners when he took the money—there was a duplicate in the handkerchief.</p>

I live in St. Mary Axe—about eleven o'clock in the morning of the 19th of May, I was at the parade in St. James's park—there was a review by Prince Albert—at the moment the Prince went by I felt a pull at my cravat—I then looked, and the prisoner was by my side, and had his hands up—he had a dark handkerchief or cloth, and in that cloth was my diamond pin—I saw it in the cloth in his hands, that I swear—the pin was worth fifteen guineas—I said to him, "Where is my pin?"—he immediately threw it down, pointed to it, and said, "There it is, sir, I picked it up."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a print-dealer, in partnership with Mrs. Tregear, and have been so since the 27th of last September. On the 8th of February the prisoner came to my shop—I was busy, and he spoke to Mrs. Tregear—she referred him to me—he said, he was travelling for Messrs. Shepherd and Button, in Foster-lane, that he was going on a journey into the country for them, and he thought he could do some good with one prints if we would allow him specimens, to show in the country—I said it was against our rule—he said "I am sure they have not been shown in the country; if you could make it convenient, I think I could introduce them, I am going to Bath"—I said I would see what I could do—I had known him some time, or I should not have trusted him—I directed our young man to look up one of each as samples, about 440 prints in all—I valued them at 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the full price is 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he called in towards evening, and said, "Are these prints ready?"—I said, "They ue not" he came in again about six o'clock, and the folio of prints was ready—he took them up, and said, "I will try and do all I can, and you must do as much as you can for me, and I will push your business in every direction"—he said, "If I do do so, perhaps you will think nothing of these patterns I have got"—I said, "Understand me, these are not to be sold, but returned," and if they were a little soiled, we could varnish them again as we do soiled prints—I then took a memorandum of them, which he calls an invoice, and I wrote "samples" on the paper—it was for the samples he had with him, and the fall price attached and no other—it was to guide him in the full price of the prints—he took the prints and went</p>

               <p>away—the firm of Shepherd and Sutton sent a lad a few days after for dozen or two of characters—in consequence of information I had received I had reasons to doubt whehter the prisoner was living with Shepherd and Sutton—I sent to his lodging, with a message to return the prints immediately—they did not come back—I lost sight of him till Tuesday evening the 24th of May, when I saw him at Mr. Brogden's in the Strand—I said "I did not expect to see you here, is this your shop? he said, "No it is not"—I said, "I have been looking for you some time"—he said, "what for"—I said, "In consequence of those samples you had"—he said, "I will see about it"—I said, "That will not do, these goods must be returned; I have sent many times to your house for them, and could get no satisfactory answer, and these prints which are hanging up are part of the prints I sold you;" they were part of what I had delivered to him these 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. prints were marked up there eightpence—the prisoner denied every thing for some time, till Mr. Brogden stated, that he did not believe a person like me would come and make such a charge-he then said, "These certainly were the prints; the fact is, I hare got the invoice at home; I have sold some of them to Mr. Brogden, and I will arrange with you"—I appointed ten o'clock, on Wednesday morning, for him to come to my house in Cheapside, and bring him invoice with him, and we would go into the business, and see whether he had a right to sell them—he came about ten next day, with Mr. Brogden—I referred to the books in his presence—I have got 379 of the prints here—the book which I referred to is here—it is headed "Samples—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"Mr. North to sundry prints as patterns"—there is no price to them—if I had sold them to the prisoner on his own account, I should have given him an invoice, and then there would not have been the full price—I went over the books with him—he said he had a right to do what be pleased with them—I asked him for the invoice, and after some time be took it out, and showed it me—I told him we must go by our books—he threatened me with an action if I gave him into custody—I said, "I shall go by the books"—I conferred with Mrs. Tregear, and said "We have made up our minds to give you into custody"—he said, "For God's sake, Mr. Lewis, don't do anything of the kind, you have known me some time, I will pay you half the price marked down there and in fact I will pay you the full price"—he begged very hard for mercy—some of the prints I saw in the Strand were delivered up to the police<lb/>man by Mr. Brogden, and after that I went to Ford's, and found ninety-five prints there—they were our property—I took them in stock when I entered the firm—they were all prints which belonged to Mr. Tregear's estate—I took all the stock remaining.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What was the stock valued at? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—I have only the agreement to show what these prints were valued at—we put down the amount at 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of which I have to pay for going into partnership—we valued it mutually between ourselves—I swear they were brought in as part of our partnership stock, for our prices are upon them—these have never been sold—I have purchased them—I have not paid my share—there was a specific time fixed for payment of my 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—if I do not pay it, the property is to be considered as Mrs. Tregear's, and till I do pay it is to be considered as mine—if I do not pay in five years Mrs. Tregear is to have 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the stock—we have published many new songs, and new pieces, all of which come in my share of the</p>

               <p>stock—the written agreement will show how the property was to be transferred, and how paid for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there any arrangement that you are not to be considered as a partner till she has settled her late husband's affairs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She administered to a certain sum, and that sum has been paid—she administered to 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we estimated the stock at 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and she is to retain one-half, and I <hi rend="italic">was</hi> to have the other if. I pay 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the end of five years, but the other property coming in from September last is a new concern, and new life altogether—these are coloured prints—there are no paintings among them—I have known the prisoner for eight years—I did not know him in business for himself—when I first knew him he was principal man at Mr. M'Cormack's, of the Strand, and I was shopman to Mr. Tregear—I then left him, and after Mr. Tregear's death I thought it would be a good opportunity to go into business, and some friends offered to lend me money to purchase the concern, but Mrs. Tregear would not sell the concern, and I went into business with her—I did not know where the prisoner lived—our young man is his brother-in-law, and the address is at the bottom of the account in the day-book—his-brother-in-law put it down—there was an understood price between the prisoner and me—I was to charge him one-third of the price I put down, and he was to take all expenses, and all risks—he was to sell for ready money, and to remit the money before the good were sent—he was not to sell the patterns by any means—I did not sell them to him—they could not be sold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not say, "The prints hanging up are what I sold to you?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I might have said so, but I cannot swear to it—he was not to pay me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for these things, nor any price at all then—he was to pay one-third—if a print was 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the price to him was to be 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did that to increase our country trade.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not charge these prints at 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—that I swear—I gave him a memorandum for them, but no invoice—this is the paper I gave him—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—this is not an invoice—here is my writing on it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Samples. Mr. North, London, February 8th, 1842, Bought of Tregear and Lewis, 96, Cheapside, Roadsters, &amp;c. Agreed price 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—at the time the prisoner was begging for mercy in our shop he wrote this on it—"Proposed addition, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,"and he said, "I will pay another 25 per cent, sooner than be given in charge"—he said he would pay that, and come into our service, and travel, or do any thing if we would allow him to pay 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week off—I sent to his house fifteen or sixteen times—I never went myself—I found him at Brogden's—he said there that he had sold them, and he had a right to do so as he had received an invoice which authorized him to do as he pleased with them, and then the appointment was made for him to go to my house next morning to make a settlement—he came at a quarter or twenty minutes past ten o'clock, and Mr. Brogden came in soon after—the prisoner came for the purpose of settling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you met the prisoner at Mr. Brogden's, did you walk with him to Shoe-lane? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He walked with me—I was walking home—I said, You come to-morrow, and we will see what is to be done"—he walked by my side—I went a little way back with him—he begged I would not do any thing—he said he had committed great faults and errors, and this was one—we parted at last nearly opposite St. Bride's church, nearly oppo<lb/>site Shoe-lane—we did not part on affectionate terms—I was not harsh</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184206130130"/>
               <p>at all with him, for fear he would not come in the morning—I had been looking for him for five months, and I was rather dubious about this little invoice, I thought we had neglected to put "samples" on it—he threatened me with an action, and I thought I would be as sharp as he was—we certainly did not part affectionately—that I swear—I did not shake hands with him—he held his hand out, but I avoided it I said, "Come in the morning, Mr. North"—he importuned me to for. give him—he confessed it, and I wish he had confessed it now—I did not give him into custody then, because he threatened me with as action for false imprisonment if I gave him in charge, and I thought it was prudent for him to come and see our books—I cannot remem<lb/>ber that he threatened me with an action in my shop that morning—I did not ask him in the shop to pay me any money, that I swear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not, in your own shop, that morning, and in the hearing of Mr. Brogden and Wolf, your shopman, say, that unless he returned what he had on hand, and paid for the remainder, within twenty-four hours, it would be the worse for him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not, I said no such thing—I told him, in Mr. Brogden's shop, that if he did not send me back the prints within twenty-four hours, he should be in the Computer—I did not say, if he did not return the prints he had, and pay for the rest—there was a great deal said when we were at Mr. Brogden's—we were there two ✗—I said, if he did not come forward at ten o'clock on Wednesday morning he should be in the Computer within twenty-four hours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not, at your shop, after the invoice was shown, ask him to pay you for these prints? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—I did not say, "If we take the money from you, how much can you pay down?"—I swear that—I did not ask him if he could pay half down—he said he had not a penny in his possession, but he would pay by instalments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came he to say that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because he had a wife and family; as he had been a very bad man, he had taken the prints and sold them, and his children were wanting bread; and he said, as a father, I must know it was very hard—he said he had pawned some of them at Kirkman's, in the Strand—he told me that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now I ask you this, did you not, after conversing with Mrs. Treges, say, that as he could not pay any thing down, you should give him it custody <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—Mr. Brogden was present the whole time—the prisoner did not say, that although he felt confident the charge could not be sustained, yet rather than suffer the disgrace, he would pay the full price, nor any thing of the kind—here is, in his own handwriting, what he had done with the prints—he stated where he pawned them, and where I should see them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you not very much afraid this man will not be convicted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> am in the hands of justice, I hope—the name of our policeman is Hampton, I think—I have spoken to him many times—I have promised to give him an accordion after the trial, as he has been very kind, but not if the pri<lb/>soner should be convicted—it has nothing to do with the prisoner—I did not know him before he took the prisoner—I told him I would make him a present of an accordion after the trial, as he had been very civil and he played it—I did not promise it him if he came and swore on the trial—I said after the trial, because I had not spoken to Mrs. Tregear about it—I promised it him yesterday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not agreed that the partnership was not to commence between you and Mrs. Tregear, till she had settled her husband's</p>

Tregear—the price is charged here—this ledger has been used in Tregear's shop for some years—I think it was used while Mr. Tregear was living—I do not think he ever wrote in it, but I know it was in the shop—when the prisoner had the prints he lived in the last house in Kennington-lane—that address is down in the book—I was in the shop on the morning on which he was given into custody—I heard some part of what was said—I did not hear Mr. Lewis ask him what he could pay down, or how much he could pay—I am rather deaf—Mr. Brog<lb/>den was present—I think the prisoner came first, and Mr. Brogden after<lb/>wards, in about ten minutes—I have not got an accordion—I do not know any thing about one—I know Kirby—he is a brother-in-law of mine—he is in the newspaper line—I know Hampton, the policeman—he said to me</p>

I am a print-seller, in the Strand About a fortnight before the 28th of May, I remember the prisoner com<lb/>ing to my shop, (I had known him some time before)—he asked me to purchase a quantity of prints, which I did—I got them from Mr. Wassell's shop—I remember Mr. Lewis coming to my place, and having an interview with the prisoner there—I afterwards went to Mr. Lewis's, and saw the prisoner there, and he was given into custody—I afterwards delivered to the policeman some of the prints I bad purchased of the prisoner—I had sold some of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wire-weaver, living in Mark-lane; Berry was my servant. In consequence of information I went into to parlour on the 5th of June, and called her up—I said I had had a very awkward charge brought against her by the policeman; that he had suspi<lb/>cion of her having given to Allen two bottles of wine, and some sugar—she said she knew nothing of it—I asked her if she knew Allen—she denied ever having seen him in her life—I asked how she came to admit the man into the yard—she said he rang the bell, and forced his way in, offering some wine to sell to her—I put samples of the sugar in my pocket, and went with two friends and the policeman, to see whether it corresponded with that found on Allen's person, and it did—the wine I believe to be some of a very old wine I had in my cellar.</p>

I live in Mark-lane, near the prosecutor's, About four o'clock in the afternoon, on the 5th of June, I was sitting at our drawing-room window—I saw Allen sitting on the corner of the corn-market stairs—half-an-hour after, all of a sudden, I observed him run to the gateway—I ran down, looked under the gate, and saw the prisoners together—there was no knocking or ringing.</p>

               <p>they said—I returned, and as I passed the gate again it was opened by some person, and I saw both the prisoners talking—I crossed on the right side, and Allen then name out—I saw he had something about his coat different to when he sat on the corn-market steps—I overtook him, and in his left coat pocket I saw the neck of a bottle—I took the bottle out of his pocket—I said, "Where did you get this from? you come back to the house where you came from, and give an account of it and yourself"—I went back with him to the house—I pulled the bell, and Berry came to the door—I said to her, "Do you know this man?"—she said "No"—I said, "Do you know this wine?"—she said, "No, only he came and offered it for sale"—I said to Allen, "You have got something else on the other side"—I took this bag of sugar out of his pocket—the name of "Carter, bread and biscuit baker, 28, Great Tower-street, London," is on it—I asked Berry if she knew anything of that—she said "No"—I asked if her master and mistress were at home—she said "No"—I took Allen to the station, and found another bottle of wine in his right-hand pocket—I asked if he knew Berry—he said, only from her lodging in a house that he did, in the Borough—the wine has been very much shaken—these are the same corks that were in the bottles—I sealed them up at the station.</p>

Between six and seven o'clock, in the evening, the prisoner was in the tap-room—he had a red handkerchief which looked as if something was in it—he first placed it on the table at which he was sitting, and had a pot of beer—there was a little disturb<lb/>ance in the parlour, but not in the tap-room—somebody present spoke to me—I went and sat opposite to the prisoner—I saw the handkerchief on the table—I took it up, and found a pint pot in it—I asked if it belonged to him, and if that was the trick he had been up to—he made no reply—he got up and went towards the door—as he got up I saw a half pint pot on the stool, which I had seen half an hour before on the table, opposite to where he was sitting—I took it up, and gave it to my mistress—the pot on the stool was open—the pot in the handkerchief was wrapped in paper, and then in the handkerchief—nobody was sitting by the pri<lb/>soner—House detained him—the pint pot belonged to Mr. Knight, the landlord of a public-house—the other pot is James Maskell's</p>

I was many years chaplain, and house-governor of the London Hospital, and am now incumbent of the new church of St. John's, Stepney, I had books in my library, which cost me upwards of 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I trans<lb/>mitted about half of them to Mr. Evans, to be sold by auction—among them were the books that have since been discovered and produced—amongst others I sent Ritson's poems (which is a very valuable work—perhaps worth a guinea) Butler's Hudibras, and Lovelace's Lucasta, Littleton's Poems, and a translation of Caraoens—the books I have missed are worth 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-in about a fortnight after, Mr. Evans sent me a catalogue—I saw there were many books missing, and I sent for him—I did not hear of any being found till the 14th of May—I have known the prisoner for several years—he must have known me well—I have sent books to him, and purchased books of him—he has sent them home—he keeps a book stall nearly opposite the hospital gate—I went to prisoner's stall on the even<lb/>ing of the 14th of May (in consequence of a communication I had from a person named Lewis, and after having been at Mr. Gladdin's) I saw nine volumes at the stall, belonging to me—among them Lovelace's Lu<lb/>casta—I put my hand on eight of the books, and said, "This is my</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to Mr. Evans, in Pall-mall. I was employed to remove the prosecutor's books from the London Hospital to my master's premises—the prosecutor unlocked the bookcase, and pointed out these books to me—there were several bundles tied up, before I got there—I put them in bags, and the bags into the cart, and took them to Mr. Evans—it was stated ion the newspaper after that one of these bags was stolen from the cart, but I am positive it was not from the time they were put into the cart, till I got to the end of Aldgate, as I walked on one side, or behind the cart, and from there, to the best of my recollection, I got into the cart—I should think there was no opportunity for any one to steal them while I was in the library, unless they were stolen after I bagged them, and went out to get some refreshment—to the best of my belief there were none untied from the time I went out—I deposited the books in my master's premises, locked the door, and gave the key to Mr. Evans.</p>

               <p>I sorted the whole of the books, which were brought by Gorman—there were a great many valuable works—after that was done, I prepared a catalogue, and sent it to the prosecutor—I know Ritson's Scotch Poems very well—the two volumes would produce 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in a sale—the Byron, in the condition this is, would be worth about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it is six volumes, bound in green morocco; and Butler would be worth about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

"I have, sir," said I, and I took the lease and mortgage-deed out of my pocket, and handed them to the elder Mr. Chapman—he took them in his hand, opened them, looked at them about a minute, and laid them down on the table—the prisoner then said, "I want to look at these things"—he took them off the table, and opened them and read them, I should think for about a minute—he then got up, and he and his uncle went out of the room together—the uncle was out of the room for it might be a minute, or a minute and a half—he then came in by himself—I said, "Where is he gone with the leases?"—the mother said, "I don't know; father, you had better go and see"—the father went <hi rend="italic">to</hi> see, and while he was absent, the prisoner came in, sat down in the chair that he went from, and said, "There shall be no more bother about these things; I'm d—d if I have not burned them!"—I have never seen the deed since—I said I would not believe it, and asked him what he called himself, whether he called himself a gentleman, or what he called himself—I do not know what he said, but his mother made answer, "What a shameful rascal you must be to serve Mr. Green in this kind of way!"—his mother then went</p>

About twenty minutes before six o'clock in the evening of the 4th of June I saw the prisoner get over a wall and building belonging to Thomas Cubitt, which is opposite where I live—the workmen had left about a quarter of an hour—I saw the prisoner come back with a cap in his hand, which he had on his head when he went over—I followed, he saw me, and ran away—I took him, and found in his cap about 1000 nails—he said he picked them up among the rubbish—I said, "What, new nails?"—he said "Yes"—I gave him to a policeman, and went to the building, and saw the nails had been shifted—I found some nails in the premises similar to those found on him—part of them were scattered on the floor—I compared those in his cap with what I found, and they cor<lb/>responded—they were Mr. Thomas Cubitt's.</p>

               <p>I saw them a second time, and asked what they were doing—the prisoner answered that Thompson, who was with him, had dropped his handker<lb/>chief and cap down the area—I looked, and saw these two handkerchiefs down the area, this yellow one and this red one—I said to the prisoner "Well, if they belong to you I will see you harmless, you may go down and get them"—he crept through one of the broken rails, went down, and brought them up; but immediately he got into the area he took up this yellow handkerchief, and put it into his own cap, and the cap that was down the area he gave up to Thompson—he then came out, and walked with the other three about forty yards—he then started off running, and so did the other—my suspicion were roused, and I pursued, and caught the prisoner in John-street, New-road—I asked him how it was he ran away—he made no answer, but went on—I followed him to York-street—I then told him he had been doing something wrong, and to give me up the pro<lb/>perty—he gave me this yellow handkerchief—I said, "Where is the other!" and he gave it me—I said, "I believe this is what you call a <hi rend="italic">diver,</hi> is it not?"—he said it was—it has a piece of list tied to it, and some pins at the other end, to serve as hooks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, living in Tothill-street.

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Plaistow. I saw the deceased first on Monday, the 6th of June—he had then been ill a week—he had symptoms of effusion of blood, or fluid on the brain, pro<lb/>ducing convulsive spasms and fits—he was sensible, but only at times—when I first saw him, I told him to put out his tongue, which he did—he appeared sensible then, but that morning he had two or three fits—he died on the 8th—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> exam<lb/>ination—on removing the skull cap, I found lying on the left hemi<lb/>sphere of the brain, from one to two ounces of coagulated blood, between the <hi rend="italic">pia mater,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dura mater,</hi> which accounted for his death—he had a small wound at the back of his head, it was nearly well—there was a bit of plaster on it, which I took off—I did not apply anything fur<lb/>ther—there was not much concussion, and no external swelling—there were evidently several other blows on the back of his head—I apprehend that concussion was the cause of the extravasation of blood—I consider a blow or fall was the cause of it—I do not know that a blow under the left ear would produce it without a fall, but accompanied with a fall it would—such a blow and fall as has been described would be sufficient to account for what I saw, and the man being partially intoxicated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You could not trace the extravasation to the wound at the back of the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It led me to know that he had had a severe blow on his head—there was no fracture—the blow was between the hemispheres of the brain—the blood was all in one hemisphere—ex<lb/>travasation may occur without violence—it is more likely to occur during intoxication—I do not think he could have recovered under any circum<lb/>stances—the extravasation had most likely existed for some days, but I cannot state positively how long.</p>

On the 25th of May I apprehended the prisoner at Newbury, on another charge—in searching him I found in his pocket, among other things, this chain—I said, "Halloo! what do you call this?"—he said, "Oh, it is nothing but an old chain that I found on the road"—he said nothing about Merritt having given it to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coachmaker, at Greenwich. The prisoner was in my employ for about a week—I had a pair of chaise springs in my shop—the prisoner said he knew a person at Woolwich, where he had been at work, that wanted a pair of springs, and he repeatedly asked me, in the course of the week, if I would dispose of them to his friend—I said they were disposed of to another person, which they were—but as the per<lb/>sons did not come for them, and thinking that the sale of these would enable me to make a new pair, on Whit Monday, the 16th of May, I trusted the prisoner with them to take to Woolwich and show his friend—he said he did not know the man's name—the prisoner had repeatedly asked, in the coarse of the week, to buy them himself, which I refused, and also refused his taking them to Woolwich, till the Monday morning—they were worth 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have a copy of the account which I gave him with the springs—I did not tell him what to do if the man did not pay for them—he took them from me, in the full confidence that the man would take them at that price—it was to be a ready money transaction, of course.</p>

               <p>I went to Reading after the prisoner, seeing his description in the"✗ and Cry"—I said, "I want you for a robbery at Mr. Gower's, at Green<lb/>wich, for a pair of coach-springs"—he said, "Oh, he can't hurt me for that, I bought the springs; in fact, he gave them to me to sell, and I sold them to a man on the road, in a horse and cart, but I don't know the man, nor where he lives."</p>

The Magistrate said he believed my statement was true, as he had been there before, trying to cheat his men, who had summoned him for their wages, and put him in the court for it. He told me he had a boy coming to work for him; and when the boy came, he said, "Oh, I am not going to work for him; they tell me I shall never get any money." He had no money to give me on the Monday morning, and he said if I had a friend to buy the springs, I should have them. I met a man on the road, and he said, "Those springs would look well under my cart;" I said, "You can have them," and I sold them. I was going home to get work where I served my time.

                  </hi>. I am the son of William Morris, of Lee, in Kent—the prisoner was in our service between two and three months, at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week. On the 31st of May he went with a wagon to town—I saw the wagon go out of the yard with a quantity of hay in it, which he had no right to have—in consequence of suspicion, I followed him, and saw him deliver the hay at the Rose, just by New Cross-turnpike—he remained there some time, and then drove away, leaving the hay behind him—I have since examined that hay, and it is of the same quality as the hay on our premises—it was a truss—I followed and overtook him after he left the Rose, and asked what he had done with the hay he had in his wagon—he said he had left it at the Rose to bait his horses on his return from London—I asked what quantity he had left—he said a small parcel, a quantity that he could put under his arm—I asked if he had not left any more—he said no—I said, "I am sure you are telling me a story, you left more"—he denied it again—I said, "I am convinced that you left a truss, for I saw you deliver it"—he denied it—I had seen him put it out into a rack which they feed the horses out of, and a bundle of hay besides</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184206130218"/>
               <p>—I gave the hay in charge of a policeman—the small bundle was quite sufficient for the horses, with the corn he had, independent of the truss—they could not have eaten the truss in the time they would be gone—they left our yard at four in the afternoon, and would return about twelve—they had three nose-bags full of corn, besides a bushel of corn, the bundle of hay, and the truss.</p>

On the 31st of May I re<lb/>ceived information, and watched the prisoner—I saw him at the Rose-he stopped the wagon, and called the ostler, who brought the rack—the pri<lb/>soner got up into the wagon, and put down a small bundle of bay, and a truss—he then got down, untwisted the two hay-bands, and the horses eat some of the truss—he went inside with the ostler, came out in about ten minutes, and went on—the bundle of hay was removed by the ostler to the side of the house, and put into another crib—I took the prisoner into custody next morning—I asked if he knew what I wanted him for—he said he did not—I said it was for stealing a truss of hay from his master's premises—he said he did not, what hay he had taken, he meant to bait his horses with, when he came back from London—I said, "Did not you see me?"—he said, "No"—I said, "I saw you deliver a truss of hay to the ostler, besides a small bundle"—he said he did not—the weight of the hay I took possession of, including two halters, with which we tied it up in<lb/>stead of the two bands, was 541bs.—the three horses had only fed on it ten minutes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waterman, and work on the water, at Putney. I live in Coltman's buildings, Greenwich. On Thursday, the 26th of June, I was in the tap-room of the Red Lion—the prisoner was in the room—I threw some ale out of a glass towards the fire—it was not intentionally done—I think a little of it touched the prisoner—I had seen him before that—I had no quarrel with him—I did not intend to throw it over him—he ran towards me, I turned my back to him, and perceived a knife cut me in the back—my brother said he had a knife in his hand—I did not see it taken from him—I was wounded with it—it has got better now—I did not go to the hospital—the injury was not sufficient.</p>

On the 23rd of May some sugar of his was put on board a barge called the <hi rend="italic">Grace,</hi> to be taken to the West India Docks—Jackson alarmed me on the rooming of the 24th, and I missed a bag of sugar from the starboard-quarter of the barge—I went ashore, and ran up along the water-side to Battle-bridge plying-place, and when I got down to the stair<lb/>head, I saw the prisoner <hi rend="italic">shoving off</hi> in his boat—I went to Beale's wharf, and watched the prisoner to Hayes' wharf-tier—he made fast to the tier, and began to bale the water out of his boat—I borrowed a ship's-boat, went off to him, and all at once he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> off his boat, and got up the side of a schooner next to him—I got up after him, collared him, brought him down, and found the bag of sugar in his boat, covered over with an old coat—I told him he must come with me—he begged and prayed of me to let him go—I said, "If you had got away with the bag of sugar, I should have had to pay for it"—he said if he had known I should have had to pay for it, he would not have taken it—it was the one we had lost from the barge—it is marked "S. and J. H."—the tally was on it, and I have one like it with me belonging to another bag—the bag itself was marked "A"—they were all marked alike.</p>

               <p>to go out—he said he did not know that he was, and we went—my mother returned home first—when I came home the prisoner was gone, and I missed my watch from the top drawer of a chest of drawers, some tea<lb/>spoons from a drawer which was left locked, some table-spoons, a mourn<lb/>in? ring, a brooch, a red silk shawl, a white silk shawl, some neck-hand<lb/>kerchiefs, three pocket-handkerchiefs, a linen sheet, some stockings, one sovereign, two half-sovereigns, and 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. odd—part of the things belonged to my mother, Phoebe Robinson—I also missed some waistcoats and a pair of kerseymere trowsers from the drawers, and another pair from a box in the room, with a brown Taglioni coat, a pair of blue braces, a knife, a pair of scissors, and some razors from a drawer in the room the prisoner occupied—the drawer which contained the plate was opened by a knife, which I found by it—the blade was broken in two—I have part of it—the officer found the other part—the property I lost amounts altogether to about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went down to Liverpool, and saw the prisoner in custody there—I recognized this piece of leather as the piece which had contained the spoons—I found this other piece of leather, and this paper, which had contained the spoons, on the prisoner's bed, after he was gone—I found the house safe when I came home.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Johnson, who is a linen-draper's shopman; our house is No. 5, Riley-street, in the parish of Bermondsey, I believe. On Wednesday morning last, between three and four by my clock, I was disturbed by the fall of a box in my room—I got up a little alter four, and found my room in confusion—most of the things were in the passage outside the door—the passage was strewed with trifling things.—the street-door</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184206130239"/>
               <p>was open—it had been safe at ten at night—I missed a mahogany box off the table, but found it in the room—its contents were gone—I missed a dark shawl, which hung up behind the room-door, and half-a-crown and two pence off the mantel-piece—the things altogether are worth 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have recovered them all.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you see see anybody in your house when you awoke? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—none of the persons in the house were up when I arose, and no person in the house, I believe, would wrong me of anything—I have got four lodgers—I am sure they did not take the bundle out and leave it any where—there was nobody awake in the house—all their doors were locked, and I awoke them and disturbed them.</p>

I tried the doors in Riley-street, to see if they were safe that night—No. 5 was safe—about a quarter past three o'clock I saw the two prisoners together within about a hun<lb/>dred yards from No. 5, going in a direction from the house—I was near enough to hear them—I could not hear what they said, but I beard they were speaking—I saw them together again, about a quarter before four, by Bermondsey New-town, about two hundred yards off—I had missed them from about a quarter-past three till then—I apprehended Lyons about two hundred yards further off, in Great George-street—Jones made his escape—he walked at first, and then ran towards the railroad—I called out, and the night-sergeant followed him—on taking Lyons to the station I found this shawl wrapped round his loins, buttoned inside his trowsers; the piece of calico in his hat; this bottle and calico in his right-hand coat-pocket; these two silk scarfs, and this handkerchief, in the front part of his trow<lb/>sers, concealed, and this gown in the seat of his smallclothes.</p>

I then left, and came towards home; Jones came part of the way with me, I being in liquor; when we came within about My yards of this place, Jones went behind a heap of rubbish for a certain purpose, he called me, and said," Look, here is a bundle." I went, he opened it, and it contained these things; he said, "It is a wrong time to walk through the streets with these, we had better put them out of sight some where; "so we put them up in this way; he said, "You had better come home to my place and sleep, as you are in liquor;" another thing was brought against us at the station; the sergeant found a blunderbuss under the rail-road, but a man came and owned it; now if I had picked that up, I should have been blamed for that also.</p>

                  </hi> I am in partnership with Mr. Simpson—we are Japan hat and cap manufacturers, in Farnham-place, South wark—we have be<lb/>tween seventy and eighty persons in our employ. The prisoner was foreman of the cap department, and had been so about seven months—he kept a shop of his own in the London-road—he dealt with us for Japan hats, but never for caps, or buttons, or velvet—on Sunday, the 15th of May, in conse<lb/>quence of suspicion, I marked a quantity of tassels, ribbons, and chene velvet, and packets of buttons, in the gross packets—I afterwards missed some packets of buttons, and twenty-four inches of two pieces of this vel<lb/>vet—here is a pattern of it—it is a cotton velvet, not very valuable—this piece was found at the prisoner's house, and this is the piece it was cut from—the prisoner was taken into custody on the 27th of May—I accom<lb/>panied the officer to search his house, and found these three gross packets of buttons—I can swear to two of them, from having the mark I put on them for detection—the other packet I believe to be ours, from its being a Kind of button not generally used in caps, but we bought it as a job—we found</p>

               <p>nine tassels, the whole of which belongs to us—there is a pencil mark a the button of each, which is covered by the silk (they were marked as Sunday, the 15th) and some ribbons, one of the ribbons has not ur mart on it—the only reason I have to suppose it is ours, is that we bought what we call four pieces, and we never used a whole piece—we used a portions of a piece, and one piece is gone—we never sell ribbons, except made up; nor tassels, but as forming part of a cap; nor valve, except made up—we found some caps—they are not marked, but from the particular quality of the cloth, and their appearance, I have no doubt they an ours—I believe all these caps have had our stamp taken. off then—it was a paper stamp stuck on with gum—when we took them, one of them had our stamp it, but before we left his premises his wife concealed it—I saw it, and called the attention of the inspector to it, but it was taken away—the stuff of these caps is particular—it was made by brother for shipment, but it was not ready when his other goods were, and we bought it of him.</p>

Muiler and Simpson sometimes make entries of the articles they sell—the prosecutors are not in the habit of selling. materials to their workpeople—we have never done so—I told the prosecutors of the cap the prisoner ordered, on the day of his commitment—I told Mrs. Harris, the forewoman, I wanted a cap of a certain size, and she got it made for me—I paid the prosecutors for it—the prisoner made some allusion to a cap, and I said the only cap I sold him was the one I had entered—I entered it at the time I bought it, before I had it away from the premises, after I had ordered it—I left Mr. Wilson's employ about eighteen months ago—I had been in his service three years—I collected orders for him, and occasionally received cash—I left him suddenly—I was out of employ six months before I got to the prosecu<lb/>tors'—Mr. Gibbs, Mr. Wilson's partner, gave me a character to the prose<lb/>cuton—I swear I referred to them for a character—I had a dispute with Mr. Wilson before I left, about money matters—he was my partner at that time—I swear that Mr. Gibbs was not partner with me, but he was with Mr. Wilson—I was in business in Castle-street, Southwark, as a hat-manu<lb/>facturer, and Mr. Wilson was my partner there—"Edwin Hunt" was over the door—Mr. Wilson's name did not appear—his partnership with Mr. Gibbs was not made public, and mine with Mr. Wilson was not made pub<lb/>lic—I was in partnership with Wilson—our term was seven years—the business did not answer—Mr. Wilson got the money—there were deeds and an agreement—I left Mr. Wilson because he charged me with misappro<lb/>priating his money—I am not aware of the amount—it might be 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I left him the next day—I had been two years in his employ, receiving no salary—I was his partner and his servant—I have not taken any proceed<lb/>ings against Mr. Wilson to enforce my partnership agreement—I at one</p>
