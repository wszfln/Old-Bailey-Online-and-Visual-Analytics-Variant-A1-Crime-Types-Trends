The Prisoner in her Defence said that the Child was Still-Born; and called the following Evidence to prove it, and her having made Provision for it. Her first Evidence deposed that the Prisoner sent for her, and told her that she was in Labour; and bid her take the Key of her Trunk to fetch the Child's Linnen, that when she return'd the Child was born, and she turning up the bed clothes perceived it to be a wrong Birth, and still Born. Another deposed that she was with her about a Fortnight before, owned she was with Child, had made some Preparation, and would make more, and take a Lodging (being then at Service) and desired that she would come to her Labour when sent for; that she was sent for and found her out, but it was over before she came, and the Prisoner told her the Child was still born; that she saw the Child's Linnen: Another Evidence deposed that she complained she was not well all Day, went to Bed in the Evening, and desired her to send for her Sister, which she did, and when her Sister came, this Evidence went to Bed and Saw Linnen the next Day.

The Prisoner denyed the Fact, and said that he bought and sold Old Clothes about the Streets, and sold a Man a Coat for 10 s. and went into the King's Head in Cross-Street Covent-Garden to drink with him, and when he was gone another came in and said his Wife was dead and he must dispose of some of his Effects to raise Money, and offer'd him the Gown and Quilt for 4 l. than shewed him the Plate, and he bought that also at 5 s. 1 d. an Ounce; he called one

It appeared that the Prisoners came to the Prosecutor's Shop and cheapen'd some Yard-wide Stuff, and that Godfrey bid Money, but so low that the Prosecutor's Wife would not take it; that they went away, and Mrs. Oliver missing the Goods followed them, and saw the Stuff under Arm under her Riding-Hood; whereupon she took hold of her by the Riding-Hood and the piece dropt from her. Asbby deny'd the Fact, or that she was in the Shop, and said that the Prosecutor would have made it up for 12 l. saying he could have so much for a Certificate; that he had 4 l. and if they could have made it up 12 l. he would not Prosecute. The Prosecutor deposed that he never offer'd to make it up, but that 4 l. was brought him by an unknown hand, and when he had open'd it, the Person who brought it was gone; whereupon he went to a Justice of Peace to know what he should do in the Case. Godfrey's Sister deposed that Ashby told her the Prosecutor would take 6 l. to make it up, which was to be the Prisoners 40 s. a-piece, and that it was to be carried and put into his own Hand without taking any Notice, or saying any thing to him; that she thinking by that means there could be no further trouble, carried 4 l. to the Prosecutor, 40 s. of her own and 40 s. of Asbuy's (the other 40 s. was to be sent by another) but finding that she was deceived, went to the Prosecutor and had her Money again.

He said it would be a great Detriment to him if he had not one that Night, for he had been engaged for a Friend for 10 l. who was run away, and could not go home for fear of the Officers; at last it was agreed that he should come that Night, and be brought the Prisoner with him as his Wife, who appeared in such a mean and draggled Condition, that she had a suspicion of them; that she lockt her Doors and took what care she could of her House that Night; but so soon as her Husband was up and gone to work in the Morning, they went away with the Goods: that when the Prisoner was taken about three Weeks ago, she offer'd to make it up.

The Prosecutor deposed. that it being too late for the Coach, she and a Gentleman's Daughter at London went to see one Mr. Poole over the Fields from Hampstead towards London, and when they came to the bottom of Haverstock Hill, while they were taking leave of her, the Prisoner came by from London; and knowing him, she call'd to him and ask'd if he was going to Hampstead, that if he would stay a little, she was taking leave of her Friend, and would be glad of his Company; that her Friend gave her her Rings, a Guinea and a Shilling for fear she should meet with any Rogues going to London, which they look'd upon to be the most dangerous Way; having taken leave of their Friend, they came along with the Prisoner to Hampstead, and as they came along, he said he wonder'd their Friend would venture over those Fields by her self so late, for it was very dangerous; the Prosecutor reply'd that she fear'd nothing, having left her Money and Rings with her, least she should meet with any Rogues: That when they came to Hampstead he offer'd his Service to go with them to West-End, saying it was dangerous, and that his Father and Mother were robb'd there: She thank'd him, and said she would not give him so much trouble, for she had a Friend in the Town who was to go thither , so parted; that she went to one Mr. Dring's a Taylor's and staid there about half an Hour; but her Friend she expected was gone before she came; that then she went to a Chandlers Shop and staid there a little; and then <placeName id="t17191204-38-crimeloc222">going to West End</placeName>

The Gentleman's Daughter that was in Company confirm'd the same, and the prisoner acknowledged it with this Variation, viz. That it was at the prosecutor's desire that he was to call on her at Mr. Dring's to go home with her; and that meeting with Harris and Lewis, who ask'd where he was going, (and would have otherways engaged him,) he told them he was going to see the prosecutor safe home to West End, she having Mrs. Pool's Money and Rings about her; that he did not communicate it with any ill Intention, but carelesly and innocently: He called several people to his Reputation, who gave him the Character of an Honest Industrous young Man.
