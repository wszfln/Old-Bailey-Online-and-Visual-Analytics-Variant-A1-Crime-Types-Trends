                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Wood, a tailor, in Howland-street, Fitzroy-square. On Saturday, the 18th of August, I met the pri<lb/>soner in Holborn, and spoke to him—I had been acquainted with him some years—he said he was going to Jamaica, and asked if I was in business for myself—I said no, but I was in a situation, and if he wanted anything, I had no doubt my employer, Mr. Wood, would be happy to wait on him—he said he was in want of things, and should be happy if I could make them, but he was afraid the West-end prices would be too high—I said we would charge him as a regular outfit—he said he would let me know—I received a letter that same evening, and went to the Saracen's Head, snow-hill, at ten o'clock next morning, with Mr. Wood, who showed the prisoner some patterns—he ordered several pairs of trowsers, waistcoats, and coats to be brought to the Saracen's Head on the Saturday following at ten o'clock, and every thing would be paid for—we stated to him it would be a ready money order—that is the only way we do take orders for out<lb/>fits—he called at our house on the Wednesday to try some of them on—on the following Friday Mr. Wood told me something, and I took one suit of clothes to the Saracen's Head, and asked the prisoner to let us have 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—he was in bed at the time—he said he had been out the over-night, but he would get up about twelve o'clock, and send me a cheque up—I left him and left the clothes—I went the next morning with Mr. wood with the rest of the clothes—we found him at the Saracen's Head—I told him he had not kept his word, as we had received no cheque—he said he had quite forgotten it, but it did not matter, he would give a cheque for the a whole amount—Mr. Wood asked him on what bank it would be—he said on a bank at Liverpool—Mr. Wood said that would be no payment at all, and objected to appeared much offended that his word should be doubted—I had some conversation with Mr. Wood, and the result was, that on the prisoner giving his word as a gentleman that he had effects there, either 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Mr. Wood took the cheque—he gave his word that he had either 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the Northern and Central Bank at Liver<lb/>pool—on</p>

                  </hi>. I live in St. Paul's Church-yard. About nine o'clock on the 22nd of September I was walking through Leadenhall-street—I felt a tug at my coat pocket—I looked over my left boulder, and saw my handkerchief passing from my pocket—I had a lady on my left arm, and I saw the handkerchief passing behind her—the prisoner was endeavouring to pass by the side of the lady—I reached across, and seized him—the handkerchief was then on the ground—I did not see any person but him near it—I held him—he said it was not him that took it—he said, "Here is your handkerchief," and kicked the hand<lb/>kerchief to some other boys—the other boys took it up and said, "Here is your handkerchief"—I said, "Thank you," but still held the prisoner—he seized me by the collar, got from me, and ran off—I pursued, and he ran into a policeman's arms.</p>

There was no one on the side that he and the handkerchief were—the others were on the other side of me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an apprentice to Mr. Collins, of Leather-lane, a butcher. On the morning of the 21st of September I was putting out a board in front of the shop—there was some meat inside—I saw the pri<lb/>soner just inside the shop while I was taking the board out—when I came into the shop again, I saw him take a shoulder of mutton, put it into a cloth, and then put it into a cart which he had at the door—he was a slaughter<lb/>man to Mr. Collins, and had brought home a caroass of beef that morning—I</p>

               <p>think he had been there about ten minutes—a man was with him, who was in the shop on the left-hand side, when he took it—I then went to my master—he looked out of window, and then came down stairs, and as<lb/>sisted in taking one hind-quarter of beef out of the cart—he had some conversation with the prisoner—my master afterwards took the shoulder of mutton out of the cart, and said, "It is not the first time by a good many that I have missed meat out of my shop"—he held it up to the pri<lb/>soner, and asked me whether it was his property—I said, "Yes, mas<lb/>ter"—the prisoner came to the door, and said to me, "It is half a neck and a shoulder of mutton, tell him it weighs 9 1/2 lbs."</p>

On the 21st of September I gave some directions to my apprentice, as I had missed something the preceding morning—on that morning, in consequence of something the apprentice told me, I looked into the cart, and found a cloth with a shoulder of mutton in it—I had not authorised the prisoner to take it—I held it up, and said, "This is my shoulder of mutton; this is not the first joint you have taken by a great many; there was half a leg taken yesterday morning"—he said, "Well, don't prosecute me, I will pay you for that, and I will pay you for this; I will give you 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if you won't prosecute"—he had no authority to go and help himself to mutton.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a slipper-maker, and live in Rose-lane, Spital<lb/>fields. On Friday, the 7th of September, after I had done work, I went out to get a pint of beer for supper, and at the top of Rose-lane, I met my sister, who lives three doors from me, and we had the beer between us—we were coming home together, arm in arm—it was rather before eleven o'clock—I saw the prisoner in the middle of the road—it is a very narrow street, and there is only one footpath, to it very narrow—he was in the middle of the road with a large knife in his hand, and said he would run it through either man, woman, or child, that came near him—I was about six yards from him—he was jumping about the road, and ran after several people—I and my sister were coming past him on the pavement on the flag, as far as we could walk away from him—my sister was nearest to the wall—as we came opposite to him, he said nothing to me, but ran towards my sister, and made a blow at her, saying nothing—I saw he had an open pocket knife in his hand—he made the blow towards my sister's breast—I immediately pulled her away by putting my arm across her breast, and in so doing, I received the blow in the thick part of my arm, below the bend of the elbow—he did not say any thing—we went towards my door, and I did not know I was cut for five or ten minutes afterwards—I was going home, and on opening the door, I heard the blood go splash in the gutter, and found I had received a cut—I was taken to the London Hospital that night—I had never seen the prisoner before, and know nothing of him—he was rather in liquor, but not so much, but he knew what he was about—he was taken into custody—I saw him at Worship-street, about our weeks ago—he was sober then, and seemed steady like other people—never had any quarrel with him, nor ever spoke to him in all my life.</p>

On the 8th of August, in the afternoon, I saw my watch and guard-chain on a nail, by the side of the mantel-piece, in the parlour—the prisoner was in the shop—I missed it about four o'clock—the prisoner had left the shop without his hat about three o'clock—I afterwards saw him in custody, and asked him why he did this—he said he did not know, but that he pawned the property himself—he came to me on the 4th, and went away on the 8th.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Shepperton-place, New North-road, and am a surgeon. About twelve o'clock at night, on the 2nd of October, I met Johnson, in the Strand—I walked home with her to No. 1, Little Catherine-street, where she stated she rented a room—I went into a room, on the first floor—I had in my pocket about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, I do not know which, and silver to an unknown amount—I gave her a half-crown for wine and water, and immediately after, a half-sovereign, and a little after, I gave her 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to get brandy and water—I partook of it—half-a-crown was the charge for one glass of wine and water—my purse and money was in my right-hand trowsers' pocket—I was going to leave, when she made a demand of more money, for the use of the room, which I refused to give—the half-sovereign was for her—I thought I had paid enough—the prisoner Abrahams came up, stood between me and the door, and talked a great deal—at last, I gave her a sovereign, on condition that Johnson was to refund a part of the money, and she brought me back 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I then sent for more brandy and water—we all three drank it—that cost half-a-crown—brandy and water was sent for again—that was another half-crown—it was then approaching to two o'clock—a man made his appearance, who was stated by Abrahams to be her husband, and he joined in consuming the brandy and water—I sent again for brandy and water—the man then left, and I undressed and went to bed, by myself—I was considerably drunk—I was very sick—I was lying quiet in the bed, when something attracted my attention, and I saw Abrahams in the room, with</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tea and sugar broker, and live at No. 14, Minc<lb/>ing-lane. I have three partners—I have known the prisoner from about three months before the 11th of August—he was a wholesale grocer and tea-dealer, carrying on business in Botolph-lane—my partners have done business for him-purchased tea and sugar for him—on the 11th of August he brought me this bill of exchange, and said he had large payments to make, and wished to discount this bill with others—I discounted this bill for him, with others, and paid him the money, minus the discount—he said he had taken all the bills in the course of business from his customers, and that his cus<lb/>tomers would not accept bills unless they had the goods in their possession.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Hillingdon. On the 7th of September I was at a beer-shop near the turnpike at Hillingdon, and saw the prisoner there—I never saw him before—he was inquiring if any body had a horse to sell—I told him I had—it was about twelve o'clock in the day—the pony was at my house about a mile off—he asked if he could see it, and I fetched it—it had a bridle and saddle on—I rode it part of the way up Hillingdon hill in his presence to show it to him—there were a few</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183810220089"/>
               <p>people present at the time—when I came back from riding it he asked me the price of it—I told him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he would give me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him I would not sell it at 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he then asked if he might ride it a hundred yards to try it—I told him he might if he liked, and I let him—he rode it a little way up the lane, and got off to tie or fasten the girth, I cannot say which—I went to walk towards him—he mounted the horse again, saying he should be back again directly, and rode off—I never saw him again till the policeman took him a month and a day after—there were others with me at the time he rode away—he went as fast as the pony could go—he started at a gallop—I gave information to the police—the pony was worth something less than 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have never seen it since—it was about thirteen or fourteen hands high—I thought I had seen the prisoner before at Uxbridge fair, but I had no conversation with him—I do not know what be it or where he comes from.</p>

On the 7th of September I was with Smith at the beer-shop—the prisoner came in while I was there, and inquired if any body had a pony to sell, as he wanted one—Smith said he had one to part with—the prisoner asked where it was—Smith said he could soon fetch it, and he fetched it—Smith tried the pony up the hill, and rode back again to the beer-shop—the prisoner wanted to know the price of it—Smith asked 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—the prisoner said, "I will give you 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—they stood awhile, and he asked Smith if he might ride him 100 yards—he said he might—he mounted, rode up the lane, and away toe went—I was almost close to them while they were bargaining—I did not see him get off, as I was then at the bottom of the lane—Smith was nearer to him than me—I did not see him after he started—it is a public lane.</p>

On Saturday, the 22nd of September, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was in John-street, Adelphi, going towards my home, which is in Denzell-street, St. Clement's—I was alone, and perfectly sober—the prisoner accosted me—I never saw him before—I am confident he is the man—he overtook me, took me by the collar of my coat, put his foot in a certain position behind me, and said, "I want some money from you"—I said, "Certainly not"—he then gave me a violent blow in the face, knocked me down, knelt on my breast, and endeavoured to rifle my coat-pocket—but I was too powerful for him and resisted—he knelt very heavily on my breast, and gave me two more blows in the face, which stunned me—I called "Police," and he made his escape—he felt no other pocket but my coat-pocket—I ran after him, overtook him, and called "Police"—a constable came up and took him into custody—I was completely saturated with blood—he was never out of my sight from the time of my getting up—I had six or seven shil<lb/>lings in my trowsers' pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a policeman at the time of this transaction On the morning of the 22nd of September I heard a person call "Police," in Buckingham-street, Strand—I was close on the spot—I went up, and saw the prosecutor, whose face was very bloody—the prisoner had passed by me about a minute before—the prosecutor said, "Policeman, that man who passed you has knocked me down, and attempted to rob me"—I fol<lb/>lowed the prisoner, who was in company with two prostitutes, and took them all to the station-house—the prosecutor was about twenty yards from the prisoner when he gave me the information—the prisoner had turned the street, and got on while he was talking to me—he was out of sight about a minute, while he turned the corner—I am quite sure no one passed in that direction but the prisoner—the prosecutor was very bloody, and had got a cut on his nose and cheek—I saw his coat was torn at the pocket—when I took the prisoner, I asked him how he came to strike the man—he toned round and said, "I never saw the man in my life before."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a silversmith, and live in Tottenham-court-road. On the 17th of October the prisoner came to my shop about twelve o'clock in the day, and offered to sell part of three silver boxes, broken, and eleven silver tops of bottles—he came in and asked if I bought old silver, and produced the parts of boxes from his hat—I put them into the scale, and asked if he had any more silver, and he brought from his pocket the eleven tops—I then asked him if it was his own property—he said it was—I said I did not purchase silver of anybody unless I knew who they were, and asked his address—he said he lived in Curzon-street, May-fair—I told him I should give the money to my man, who should go with him, and see if his address was correct, and if so he should pay him there—he objected, and said he wanted to go quite another road—I said if he would wait an hour, I would send my apprentice to the place, and if it was correct, I would pay him—he changed countenance, and said he would go provided I let him take the plate, and come back—I said "No, I am afraid you came dis<lb/>honestly by it"—he said, "I will tell you the truth, I do not think it is exactly honestly come by, I have had it in a way I think not altogether honest"—I shut the door, sent for an officer, and gave him in charge, with the property—it appears to have come out of a dressing-case.</p>

                  </hi>, the younger. I am the son of Mr. Samuel Cart—wright, a dentist, and live in Burlington-street. The prisoner was a sort of confidential servant and butler upwards of eight years—he had fifty guineas a year—he lived in the house in the day time, but slept out, being a married man—my father placed every confidence in him—my father dis<lb/>charged him about a fortnight ago—about the 10th of October some articles of plate were missed—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>)—I believe this letter to be the prisoner's writing—I received it myself, and caused him to be taken into custody—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>.)</p>

               <p>"18th October, 1838.</p>
               <p>"Sir,—In my present distracted state of mind, I scarcely know how to address you; I can only implore you in my fallen condition to look on me with mercy and compassion. It is not for myself I ask this, but for my dear wife and children; they are at present strangers to my disgrace, and how shall I look upon them when they do become acquainted with it? I have got my account-book, but my mind has been too distracted to com<lb/>plete it. I have not tasted food since I left your house, neither have I closed my eyes—I have nothing to look forward to in this world but shame and misery. My home, once peaceful and happy, must for over beareproach to me; and the other branches of my family, although poor, vir<lb/>tuous, and respectable, will never again look on me. To pass the rest of my days in slavery and bondage in some foreign clime, would be happiness in comparison with the misery I have to look forward to. You kindly and most humanely interceded with the Government for one unfortunate wretch, and restored him to his country and friends; do interest yourself for another, and get him out of his country in some humble capacity, and the after part of his life shall be worthy of your kind consideration. I must now confess that I have appropriated to my own use six forks, three table spoons, and two dessert spoons—they shall all be restored to-mor<lb/>row—I cannot to-day, for I have not the duplicates in my possession—they are sealed up in a packet, in the possession of a friend, and he is from home for the day. I must also give you the most solemn assurance, in the face of my God, that no creature but myself knew anything of this matter, and that I never removed the soup ladle and fish slice, which it seem I was suspected of doing; indeed it was this very circumstance, with King's carelessness (nothing else) that suggested the means of raising money, and saving my furniture from the hands of the broker, who had a man in pos<lb/>session. I will make every reparation by confessing everything when I am sufficiently collected to write more; at present my hand trembles, and my mind is bewildered; I can only again express my gratitude for every kind<lb/>ness, and subscribe myself, your once faithful, but now disgraceful,</p>

               <p>"J. Reitterhoffer again promises, if the Marquis of Downshire return him his character, or give him the opportunity of justifying it, to destroy, or even give up, all letters and documents which substantiate his publication.—J. R., presuming that the feeling entertained towards him by the Marquis of D. is such as to preclude the possibility of a personal interview, suggests that his wrongs should be inquired into by two gentlemen, the one to be appointed by the Marquis of Downshire, and the other by himself, whose decision J. R. will willingly abide by. Should this suggestion meet with approval of the Marquis of Downshire, a com<lb/>munication to that effect, addressed to the care of A. Renton, 210, Piccadilly, will be immediately attended to.</p>
               <p>"P.S. Whatever further exposal, for my justification, this unfortunate affair (about the sudden and mysterious death of poor Lady Mary Hill) may incur, the Marquis of Downshire will have, no just complaint of having been taken by surprise."</p>

Without further alluding to the generous and honourable feeling such conduct de<lb/>notes. I will at once acknowledge that, compared to the conduct pursued towards me by your father and uncles, it is meritorious in the extreme;—for you only seek to exterminate me by a sudden and positive death, and not to torture and rack me by cruelties unparalleled in the history of aris<lb/>tocratic villains. In order to show your lordship that your threats cannot intimidate me, whatever effect they may have had upon the weak parties whose agencies I had employed to dispose of my pamphlets, I beg to inform your lordship, that I shall shortly open a shop, where I shall in person superintend the sale of my pamphlets; when the spot is decided upon, your lordship shall have the earliest intimation of it; when the world shall see who has—the most courage—your lordship in attempting to carry your threats into execution, or 1 in resisting them. But should your lordship thirst for immediate revenge, your wishes can be gratified if your lordship will send a line to the above address, appointing a place and hour where and when, I shall be happy to attend your lordships com<lb/>mands. The enclosed handbills will convey to your lordship something of my intention, the completion of which has only been delayed by the diffi<lb/>culty I have experienced in finding an eligible public situation for vending the pamphlets. In conclusion, I reiterate what, upon every occasion I have alluded to in my communication with your father, viz., that I seek but for justice; and until I have it, I will pursue every legal means within the compass of my ability to attain it.</p>

The prisoner and his wife Mary Ann Grout lived together in the same house, two pair of stain above me—they came on Wednesday, the 5th of September—on Sunday morning, the 9th of September, about ten o'clock, Mary Grout came into my room—she was sitting discoursing with me when the prisoner came into the room, and asked her to fetch an ounce of tobacco—she said, "I shall not"—he said, "Send one of the children"—she said, "I am ashamed to send the children, they are so deplorable"—he shut the door, and as he shut it she said, "Go to h—, you vermin"—in going along the passage he said she was fit for nothing but sitting gossiping in a neighbour's house, and if he caught her that day he would give her a poke in the eye—the was as he was going up stairs to his own place—she remained a very few minutes in my room after that, and then she went up stairs—I remain in my own place—I saw her again in about twenty minutes at the farthest, running down stairs and crying out, "Oh, help, help!"—she came into my room—she had a cut under her left eye and a bruise over the eye—she complained that her ribs on her left side were broken, and held her hand to her left side—this was between ten and eleven o'clock—she was taken to the Whitechapel Hospital a very few minutes afterwards—I heard nothing during the twenty minutes she was away, but "Help, help" called—it was</p>

I remember, eight or ten months ago, their selling an inkstand to Mr. Guest—I cannot say that I saw it there afterwards, but I believe it was there to have a crest on it—I saw it on a glass case on the warehouse, done up in a parcel, directed for Mr. Guest—that was about a month after the sale—I did not see it put into the parcel, but it was directed for Mr. Guest—he was not a baronet then—I know the inkstand well—I have seen a portion of it since, the bottom of it, in the pawnbroker's possession—I think it was on the 2nd of October.</p>

"—I asked who it belonged to—he said it was not his, but belonged to the house-maid—I asked him what he called it—he said she used it as a work-box—I asked him if he had the top of it—he said he had, but he did not bring it as it was a glass top, and he was afraid he should break it—I asked if he knew how the house-maid became possessed of it—he said he did not know—I asked where he lived—he said at No. 13, Grosvenor-square—he said, "You know where I live, I pawned my watch with you some time back—I live at the same place"—T said I thought it very suspicious, and sent for an officer, and gave him into custody—while I was gone up to get my hat to go with the officer he made his escape—I went next day, with an officer, and apprehended him at the Barley Mow, to Duke-street, Grosvenor-square—I knew him before—in its present state this is worth 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as old silver.</p>

About twelve o'clock on Tuesday, the 23rd of October, I was in Covent-garden market—I bought twelve cabbages and twelve bunches of turnips—I told the prisoner, who is a ticket-porter, to take them to my place in Bartholomew-close—I had other business to attend to, and did not return home till the evening, when my wife said she had not received them—I was surprised—the prisoner knew my place three years, and had been there—I took him on Thursday informing—he said he had delivered them, he could take his oath, and that my mistress had taken them in, and paid for them—Mr. Long says he did deliver them to him—he is not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am horsekeeper to Mr. Freeman, at Ilford. On the 19th of September Mr. Harding sent for me, and in the presence of the prisoner put some questions to me—I did not receive any sack of corn from the prisoner on Tuesday, the 18th of September, nor on the 19th—I had no sack of Mrs. Boyce's in my stable—I received three sieves of the prisoner, which was not quite one bushel.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 23rd of September, during church time, I was sitting at my window, which com<lb/>mands a view of the road, and of Mr. Booth's house and of Floyd's garden sideways—I saw Cunliffe cross the road into the prisoner's gate—she stopped there from five to ten minutes—I saw the prisoner at the gate during that time, opposite the door of Mr. Booth's house—I could not we whether he was watching the door—he was about five yards distant, looking down the road, not towards the door—I could not see Mr. Booth's door, because it is on the side—I saw a man enter the house—he came from the church-yard on the left of the house—the prisoner was looking down the road from the way the man went up—he was looking up in the direction the man came—I cannot say he must have seen him, but I saw him—the man entered at the front door—he must have passed within five yards of the prisoner to enter the door—I saw him come out of the house in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—I did not see the pri<lb/>soner</p>

"—he said he had no money—she said, "Yes, you have silver, and gold, and half-pence"—he knocked her down three times into the chair against the door—he went and sat down in his chair again for a minute or two, and then got up in a violent passion, caught a knife off the table, and stabbed at her momentarily—she put her hand up to save her face—he pointed the knife at her face—it went through her left hand—I screamed out, "Mur<lb/>der"—my husband burst the door open, and saw him coming at her again with the open knife—he knocked the knife out of his hand, secured him, and held him in the corner—I picked the knife up and put it on the table—I attended to my sister—she was not sensible—a policeman came in, and the prisoner was taken to the station-house—I went with my sister to the hospital and saw her into bed.</p>
