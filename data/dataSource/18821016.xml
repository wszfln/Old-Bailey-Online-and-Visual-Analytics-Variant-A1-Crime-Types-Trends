                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Barnard, Bishop, and Barnard, iron founders and manufacturers, at Norwich—we also have a retail business there, and showrooms in Queen Victoria Street, in London, where we supply goods from the country on orders received there—the prisoner entered our service originally by this letter of September 19th, 1877 (<hi rend="italic">This proposed a salary of</hi> 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a year, and a com<lb/>mission of about</hi> 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">per cent</hi>)—he continued in our service from that time until the period of these proceedings, but his remuneration was increased—there was then some over-drawing on his part, and we agreed, to let him repay the amount by instalments—we increased his salary, and he was to pay off 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month (<hi rend="italic">A Utter from the witness to the prisoner, dated December 1st,</hi> 1877, <hi rend="italic">was read; it expressed a willingness to accede to the terms proposed by the prisoner——namely, a payment of</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">on the 1st of the month, and</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">on the 15th; that this was not to be looked upon as a fixed salary's but that they wished him to have a fixed salary, and a commission on his sales, which were working satisfactorily</hi>)—these letters of 10th and 14th March are in the prisoner's writing, also this account referred to in the letter of the 14th (<hi rend="italic">These letters were appeals to the prosecutors consideration in consequence of domestic expenses, and a debt for furniture, and expressed a hope that he might not lose their confidence, which he would do his best to regain</hi>)—the account he enclosed shows his indebtedness to us to be 407<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think the increase of his salary to 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was settled at that time with our chief clerk—the course of business after that was that he was to send down to Norwich a weekly. account, and he did so very regularly—there were two cash-books, one of which was kept at Norwich, and the other in London, and they were exchanged weekly—that was arranged in February, 1882—those books showed the amounts received and paid, including the petty cash—besides those two books there was an official order-book, and a weekly sheet showing the receipts and payments—I have here the sheet of 17th April, 1882, in which the entry of the 17th ought to be, also that of 13th June, 1882—there is no entry in any of the accounts of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Mr. Ryall on 13th April, 1882, or of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 17th April from Mr. Forbes, of Bolton Gardens, or of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Ablitt, of the Borough—I have gone through all the accounts, and am able to say that no such entry appears—I have not received those sums; they have never been accounted for—the cheques received by the prisoner should have been remitted to Norwich as speedily as possible—the cash he received he used to fend to the Cheque Bank and obtain cheques for it,</p>

               <p>which should have been sent to us by post—part of the cash he received he would use for sundry expenses; the other portion he would obtain cheques for from the Cheque Bank, and remit to us by cheques of his own on that bank—he was allowed to retain a floating balance of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the name of the customer paying the cash would not necessarily appear—I see the names are mentioned here, and the prisoner debits himself with the amounts on the other side.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> No calculation has been made as to what commission was due to him at the time he sent in his account, which showed his in debtedness to the firm, but it is shown on the document itself—it was 103<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on one account, and 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the other—from April, 1877, to October, 1877, when the arrangement ceased, no new arrangement took place with regard to his payments; the commission altogether stopped in October, 1877, and he was paid 540<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I state in the letter of 1st December, 1877, that we were looking forward to arranging the com<lb/>mission with him, and we were working out the results—we did work them out—it was never gone into further than October—on 1st De cember, 1877, I wrote, "Trusting it will develop"—I meant by that that he would get more commission, but the arrangement come to was that he was to have 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year without any commission—that was arranged with our head clerk orally—at that time I was thoroughly satisfied with the work he had done—in January, 1879, I went through the accounts of the firm—I believe the returns during the previous 15 months averaged within 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of 13,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—at that tune I may probably have expressed my sense of the value of his services, and that I would leave the matter of remuneration open for the present—I was not present at the arrangement made with the head clerk—I think his payment was increased to 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month in March, 1879; at any rate there was a rise in his salary at that time; before that it had been 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month was deducted because he had overdrawn his account—he has not repaid it yet—the increase was made to enable him to wipe off the overdraft—he had borrowed money since then—I believe only one 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>/. was sent to him—I have not got his salary account here; it would be somewhere in the books—between March and December, 1879, 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was sent to him; I am sure of that—this is a copy of his salary account copied from our cash-book in Norwich; it is in the handwriting of our clerks—in December, January, and February, he had three cheques of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. sent him, and after February we commenced to deduct 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month, but he had other loans, two of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that is shown on this paper—the account against him stands slightly less than it did originally, because he paid off some—I have never gone into his com mission since the first six months—he continued to enjoy my fullest confidence up to June this year—one of our assistants made a communication to us in June—the business continued to be fairly successful—I never found a penny wrong in the accounts he sent to Norwich; we found nothing wrong in the arithmetic—the expenses he would have to pay would be salaries of the young men, postage stamps, and so on, petty cash disbursements—the balance of cash that he had he would pay in to the Cheque Bank, and send his own cheque to us—he did that from time to time—I do not think you can write a cheque over 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Cheque Bank—there was 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 14th June; that was in two cheques I cannot tell how many 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheques he has sent to us at one time-he</p>

               <p>may have paid in 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to his account in the course of a week, and then sent it to us by his cheques—if he received a cheque and had no cash, he was not supposed to cash the cheque and apply the portion he wanted to the business—all cheques were supposed to be sent direct to Norwich—he had a floating balance of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. always in hand—he had to keep up that floating balance, and he did, and as it went out he could replenish it, I should say it never happened that there were no cash payments in the course of the week—since the prisoner has been arrested my brother and I have carried on the business alternately—we have not engaged another manager—I have cashed cheques that I have received in the way of business if I wanted the money—I am a partner; I do as I please—I account at Norwich for all business done—I should make my drawings as I require them—I do not cash the cheques for the business, bat for my own private requirements—I have sent out to. cash cheques paid to the firm, and I have signed them with the name of the firm, as I have a right to do—I had perfect confidence in the prisoner up to June—the communication that was made to me by one of our servants was about a week or 10 days previous to the arrest—I do not think it was as long as three weeks before—I then first knew of these two items of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the commission included those two sums among others—I think the total amount I was then informed of was about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I first saw the two memoranda relating to these two sums after I had consulted my solicitor—my solicitor had them before I saw them; that was before the prisoner was arrested—I believe I had seen them before, as far as I remember—some of the memoranda were found in a drawer in the prisoner's desk—I was present when they were found—when Detective Hancock came we opened—the drawer and took them out; that was after the prisoner was in custody—several other pieces of paper were found in his desk, and the cash-books and several items that he had received the previous day—that paper is in the hands of my solicitor—the cash-books are here—Hancock opened the drawer—he did not pick the lock; he had the keys from the prisoner—everything that was found in the drawer is here—the prisoner has been five years in our employ ment, and has been sending to us week by week about 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—a servant under him gave us information—I did not on that go to the prisoner, because I took the other course, I went to our solicitor—we thought it better to employ a solicitor and take his advice before we took any other course—it was on that advice that I got a warrant for his arrest without asking him about the matter, or I should not have done it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The balance of the prisoner's indebtedness to us now is about 398<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—with the exception of the few deductions made after the new arrangement, he received his salary regularly—about two or three days' salary was due to him when he was arrested—the arrangement as to commission was in abeyance for a time, and ultimately the arrange ment was arrived at that he was to receive 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, he having previously had 540<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for a short time—the drawer in which the memoranda orders were was locked—we found these four other orders—I found no trace of those in the official order book.</p>

               <p>in June, 1881, because there was nothing more to be made out of it—it was not a success—I knew the prisoner was in the habit of getting orders on his own account for the Jeye Company, and receiving money from the customers, and afterwards handing the money to me, and I presume he solicited orders and got letters in return addressed to him personally—immediately I had opened the correspondence in the morning I would make out the order sheets, and if other orders came in I would add them to the sheet, and would sometimes make out a second or third sheet—I was always there in the morning—I would sometimes go out—if orders came in while I was out they would wait till I came in—if the customers were in a hurry one of the clerks might, as an exceptional thing, add them to the sheet—one of these orders of Lee and Co's, is on a supple mental sheet—it was their duty at Plaistow to keep an. account of the orders—although orders were not in the copying book, they would be in the Plaistow books—the November account of Lee and Co. was made out by Skillman—the signatures to the two orders are not alike; neither of them is a good imitation of mine—I myself gave notice to Skillman to leave, and told him the reason, for opening letters—that was the only reason—he did it to obtain orders, and get a commission upon them—I thought that exceedingly dishonest-—I gave him a character when he left, but dated two or three months before he left, as I did not think I could consistently give it him up to the time he left—I did it from softness of heart—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the character I gave him (<hi rend="italic">This was a character for industry, zeal, and intelligence; and stated that in his few cash transactions he had always been found correct</hi>)—the prisoner was given into custody on 3rd July—he came to the "office a fortnight or three weeks before—I did not know he was going to be arrested till the day he was arrested—when he did come I told him there would be a warrant out for his apprehension—the directors said there would be—I told him that from softness of heart, simply to give him a chance of escape—it was no doubt a great indiscretion on my part—he said, "I have done nothing, I cannot understand why I should be arrested," and afterwards he asked if it could be cleared up, if something could not be done—I did not suggest that he should leave, and that I would write to him to a post office in the name of Joseph Wilkins—he asked if I would communicate with him, and I said I would—I might have said before the Magistrate I suggested it; if I did, it was a mistake—he said at first he did not want to be written to-in the name of Joseph Wilkins, but he afterwards consented to it—he asked how I could communicate with him, and I said I would do so in another name—he said, "What name?"—I hesitated a little, and said "Joseph Wilkins," and he consented to it—he said he was quite innooent, and asked if it could be cleared up.</p>

I am the prisoner's brother—I lodged for a few days at 3, Queen's Place, Whitechapel, with the prisoner, his wife, and child Mary Ann, who was about 2 years 2 months old—they had another child in the hospital—I had a bed on a chest to lie down on at night; we all slept in the same room; the prisoner, his wife, and child slept on a bedstead—on Tuesday evening, 5th Sept., I went into the room; I was sober; I had taken a drop, a share of a couple of pots, but I had my senses; I was not out of the way in the least—there was a small lamp alight on the mantelpiece—the prisoner's wife was lying on the bed dressed; the prisoner was lying on the floor; the child Mary Ann was on the floor with her head towards the fender; the prisoner had his head towards the window and his legs towards the fire; he was fully dressed all but his coat; he had his boats on—a mug on the floor close by his side; there were marks of liquid spilt on the floor; I can't say whether of beer or water—I went to the bedside and topped the wife on the arm, and said" Margaret, it is a nice thing to see the child lying on the floor at this time of night in the wet"—she said "Give it to me, Johnny"—I picked up the child and handed it to her; it seemed quite warm; I saw a little blood across her mouth; I did not notice whether she was dead or not; when I gave her to her mother she said "My God, the child is dead!"—I said "Nonsense, it is impossible"—I looked</p>

I am a surgeon, of 68, Leman Street, White<lb/>chapel—about 11 on Tuesday night, 5th September, I went to 3, Queen's Place, and in a room on the ground floor I saw a child lying on the bed quite dead; the arms were cold, but the body was rather warm—I should think it had been dead about two hours—on the 7th I made a post-mortem examination—there was a large contused wound just above the right eye, it was bleeding slightly, and a contusion above the left temple; another contusion above the left eye, over the linear, extending towards the nose—neither of those were bleeding—there was a small quantity of blood about the nostrils and mouth, the frontal bone was fractured and driven into the brain substance, and all the other bones round were fractured and quite loose—there were superficial abrasions on the right side of the body extending from about the seventh rib down towards the knee; those would be caused</p>

               <p>by dragging the body about—the upper third of the right arm was fractured—there were no wounds on the left side—there was a small contusion on each elbow and knee—the cause of death was the fracture of the frontal bone; that must have caused almost immediate death—the injuries could not have arisen from the child merely falling on the floor—considerable force must have been used, such as by a blunt instrument, possibly the heel of a boot—the wounds over the right eye and the temple were quite separate and distinct from each other—the internal organs were all healthy—I saw the prisoner that night; he was drunk, and the wife also seemed to be drunk.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It would require a considerable amount of violence to cause such fractures as I found—a heavy body, such as a drunken person, falling on the child might possibly account for the injuries; I do not think so; it would require some hard substance—I don't think a drunken woman stumbling over the child from the bed would account for it, nor if the child had fallen with its head on the fender, and then a person had stumbled on it—I should not like to swear it, but from the description I had of the fender I think there would have been more cutting about it—I do not think a blow from the jug would cause the injuries—I saw the prisoner's boots; there was no trace of blood upon them—I did not examine the poker or fender to see if there was any mark of blood upon them.</p>

I recollect nothing more till my brother woke me up at half-past nine, and said the child was dead"—I asked if he recollected what time the child was brought to him—he said "No, I can't recollect"—I asked the wife whether she could account for the child being on the floor—she said "No"—the brother then came in with the doctor—I examined the room; I saw this jug on the floor about six inches from the fender—there was a very small portion of water in it. and a lot of water spilt round it—I saw one spot of wet blood about the size of a sixpence in front of the fireplace, about six or seven inches from the fender—there was a poker between the bars of the fireplace, and the fire was out—I did not notice any other fireirons—the fender was in front of the lire in its proper place—it was an ordinary old-fashioned kitchen fender, with a flat top—nothing in the room was disturbed—the bedstead stood about two feet from the ground—I knew the prisoner by sight—he u a dock labourer—he was not taken into custody at that time.</p>

               <p>September I went to the prisoner's room—he was then sober—I told him I was a police officer, and I wanted to speak to him with reference to his deceased child—he was very excited—I have a note of what he said—he said "It is a crime and a mystery, whatever shall we do? I was very fond of the child; she would meet me in the court at night when I came home from work. On Tuesday me and my wife went to the hospital to see our child. We had some drink on the way home, but I was not exactly drunk. My wife laid down on the bed. About 7.30 I went out to get some more beer. At 8.30 I gave the child a drink of water in the passage of the house; there was nothing the matter with her then. I then laid down on the floor; my wife was still lying on the bed, and I knew nothing more about it until my brother came in about 9.30 and found the child lying by my side dead"—I told him that the child's death had occurred under very suspicious circumstances, and I should have to take him into custody on suspicion of causing its death—on the way to the station he said nothing—after the charge was entered it was read to him, and he then made this further statement: "I was not exactly drunk; I went home about 6.30 with my wife"—he then said "We were both drunk; my wife laid down on the bed and I laid on the floor till about 7.30, when I went out and got some more beer. I returned home again between 8 and 9 o'clock, when I gave the child some water. I then laid on the floor and went to sleep, and do not remember any more till I was called by my brother at 9.30. My wife did not get off the bed from the time when she first laid down until the child was put by her side, when it was discovered she was dead."

                  </hi>. I am 16 years old and live at 6, Parker Street, Drury Lane—I work and mind carts in Covent Garden Market—on Saturday night, 30th September, I was at the corner of Shelton Street, just as the public-houses were closing, 12 o'clock—I saw the prisoner inside the public-house—he ran outside and used bad language to a policeman who was there, and the policeman told some of the people there to take him down the street—some persons took him three or four yards from the public-house, and he struggled and came back—Green came over and went up to the prisoner and asked him to come home—he said "No, leave go of me, because I have got a spite in for you"—Green did not let him go, he took him on the other side to try to get him away—the prisoner said "Are you going to let me go?"—Green said "No"—the prisoner then lifted up his hand and struck Green right in the breast—he had a knife in his hand, you could only see the blade of it—I saw</p>

               <p>it in his hand when he came outside the music hall; it was open then—Green went about three steps and then fell in the gutter—I said he was stabbed; I did not know whether he was stabbed—I went up to him—somebody came and struck a match, and they all said he was stabbed in the chest—he was bleeding from the heart—there was a lot of blood running out of his side—they dragged the prisoner away; he dropped his crutch and I picked it up—he was very drunk—I did not notice what state Green was in—I knew them both.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi> 898). I was on duty in Charles Place, Shadwell, on 16th September last—about 1.40 a. m. I saw the prisoner some little distance from the granary in Charles Place—I heard footsteps and waited in the shade of a lamp for a few minutes—the prisoner came near me, waited, and looked about and appeared to be listening—he then went towards the granary, which lies back from where I was standing, some five or six feet from the carriage way—there are two windows in the granary, facing into Charles Place—they are between four and five feet from the ground—the prisoner went to or near this window—I stopped there for some two minutes and then walked away very quietly on my toes—I did not see or hear anything take place while he was waiting there—following on I came to the window and saw some straw inside the grating, alight, on the window ledge—there was some other straw lying in the roadway, as if an old straw bed had been there, and this on the ledge was similar to that outside—I cannot say whether the straw was burning at that window before the prisoner went up there—fifteen minutes before I had seen the window and there was no straw there, only what was lying in the roadway—it was impossible for me to put out the fire, as the grating was only two inches wide—I followed the prisoner into Broad Street and then turned into Glasshouse Fields, at the top of which, in Bath Street, I overtook him—I asked him what he was doing out at that hour in the morning—he said he was going home—I said "Where do you live?"—he said at "331, Cable Street"—he was going towards Cable Street when he left the corner, but he had only that instant turned the corner when I took him into custody; he had been going in the opposite direction—Charles Street is half a mile from Butcher Row—when he started in the opposite direction he was going away from home—I told him I should him into custody on suspicion of having set fire to the place in Love Lane—he said "I have seen no fire"—I then took him back to the granary—he said "It would be no advantage to me to set it on fire"—the straw was still burning when we got there—it had fallen from the window ledge, which inclined into the building, and the place was full of smoke—I then sent a constable for the fire engine and took the prisoner on to the station, where he was formally charged—he said in reply "I We been down to Butcher Row with my brother to see him home, as we have been to Lusby's to night together"—Lusby's is a music hall in the Mile End Road—and "I was coming up along Broad Street and Love Lane when a constable stopped me and brought me here"—the prisoner was searched and a lucifer match was found on him at the station—on going back to the premises I found this lucifer match</p>

I was at Shadwell Police-station when the prisoner was brought in at 2 o'clock on the morning of the 16th—I formally charged him with setting fire to this granary—the last witness related what he has given in evidence, and the prisoner replied "I have just been to Butcher Row to see my brother home; we have been to Lusby's, and I came along Broad Street and up Love Lane. I saw no fire whatever, and when at the top of Love Lane this constable came up and said I shall take you into custody. I said 'What for?' He replied 'I will show you,' and took hold of me and brought me to the station"—I searched the prisoner and found a lucifer match—it had not been struck, and was similar to the one found by the last witness—it is an ordinary sulphur wooden match—the one that was found by the granary had not been struck, but the brimstone appeared to have been all worn off—I afterwards went to the premises, and found this loose straw in the road—apparently it is part of the contents of an old mattress or palliass—it was about five feet from the window—I saw a quantity of burnt straw on the ledge inside, and under that some sacks, all more or less burnt.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant L</hi>). On the night of 15th September I was in the New Kent Road, near Rodney Street, with Detectives Tewkes, Warlock, and Gills, and saw Small and Jones in a pony cart coming in a direction from the Elephant and Castle—they got out and went into a public-house, came out in two or three minutes, and we took them into custody—Gills and I took Small—I said to Small "We are two police officers, and are going to take you in custody"—he said "What for?"—I said "For what you have in this cart"—he said P I am not b——well going," and began to struggle very violently, and we were obliged to put him in the bar of the public-house and send to the station for assistance—he was searched at the station, and among other things I found this button in his trousers pocket—a clock and some coats were</p>

               <p>brought in from the cart, and we asked him how he accounted for it—he said "I don't know anything about any clock; I am only employed to take the cart home"—I said "You took it out this morning"—he said "Yes; two men employed me to take it out in the morning and bring it home in the evening. I don't know where they go"—I said "Who are they?"—he said "Hampson and Ince"—I said "You were out with them yesterday with some females?"—he said "No, I was not"—I said "I saw you"—he said "What sort of a trap was it?"—I said "A four-wheeled trap"—he said "Yes, that is quite right"—I went from there with the same officers to 94, Tabard Street, Borough, where I saw Hampson in bed—I told him that Small and Jones were in custody charged with the unlawful possession of a clock—he said "I was hired by you and Ince to take the cart out in the morning, bring it back in the evening, and if the cart was left it was left there by you "—he said "You have made a mistake; I don't know anything about it"—I said "Who does the furniture of this room belong to?"—he said "To the landlord"—I said "Who does that clock belong to?" which was on the mantelpiece—he said "The landlord"—I sent for the landlord and asked him if it belonged to him—he said "No; there was no clock there when I let him the room; the other furniture is mine, but that does not belong to me"—I said "Have you any further explanation to rive?"—Hampson said "Yes, I bought it off Charles Ince"—I said "I shall take possession of it"—he was taken to the station—Ince was brought in—they were all four placed in the dock again, and I said to Hampson and Ince "These two men, Jones and Small, are charged with the unlawful possession of this clock, and Small says that he was employed by you to take the cart out in the morning and bring it back in the evening, and if there was a clock there it was left there by you"—Small said "Yes, that is right"—Ince said "I have not seen you to-day before"—Small said "What are you talking about?"—Ince said "Well, only at the public-house to have a glass of ale"—they were then charged—I can speak to Small positively as being in the cart.</p>

How I came to know him was by reading about the war in Egypt, as I told him I had a brother in the 94th Regiment. On 15th September I was going down New Kent Road; somebody called me; I looked round and saw Small in a trap. He came up and asked me to have something to drink. I did so. I was not in his company four minutes altogether. He did not tell me what he had in the trap, or where he had been. He said he was going to take the trap home. I did not see him drive anywhere else." <hi rend="italic">Hampson says:</hi> "On 15th September I was in a public-house. Small came in and I recognised him by having had a glass of ale with him. I went to bed, and the police came and took me, and asked me who the clock on the mantelpiece belonged to. I told them it was mine; I bought it of a man named Ince.

Blumberg's fancy warehouse—I stopped him—he made a statement to me—I took him to Thames Street Police-station—then I went with Egan to Mr. Swinnerton, Messrs. Blumberg's manager, No. 6, Am well Street, Pentonville—I saw Phipps—I said "I am a police officer I have a man named Brewster in custody for robbing his employers, Messrs. Blumberg's, and he has made a statement with regard to you"—he said "I do not know Brewster, I do not know Blumberg's "—I said "He says that about 10 days ago he sold you two ladies' companions and a flask for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and other goods, and you have induced him to get some more; I want all the goods that you have bought from him"—he said "lama dealer in job lots; he told me they were job lots"—he took me into a back room adjoining the shop and took from a chest of drawers these two silver-mounted drinking horns, and said "I bought these from him to-day for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. "—from a drawer in a chest in the same room he produced three flasks, a ladies' companion, a pocket-book, a purse, six tortoiseshell combs, and two picnic sets incomplete—I said "You will be charged with receiving these goods knowing them to be stolen"—be made no reply—I conveyed him to Thames Street Station—in Brewster's presence I said "Brewster states that you have induced him to get goods for the past 12 months"—I said to Brewster "Phipps said you sold him these two horns for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to-day;" he said "Yes"—the charge was read over to both of them and neither replied.</p>

Spiers and Pond's premises—I have heard Downe's evidence and corroborate it—I saw Phipps speaking to a gentleman I do not know between two vans, and he showed a flask similar to this one to a man as if he was offering it for sale; I hastened to see what it was, but Phipps put it away hurriedly.</p>

Blumberg's once, and have been back nearly two years—about a year and a half ago I took him some property from Blumberg's, and he paid me in the same way—he lived over the water in London Street and in another street which I forget; he had a shop there—I took the things produced to a place at Pentonville; I cannot remember the name, but it is near the baths, at the corner of the reservoir—I cannot remember what he gave me for the other things besides the horns.</p>

               <p>cartridge-cases in them—the other is a five-chambered revolver; that had cartridge-cases in three chambers, which appeared; have been recently discharged, and there was a cartridge in another chamber and one chamber empty—I. extracted and examined the cartridges; they are ball cartridges—the prisoner refused to give his address at first, but gave it to me the next day, as 20, John Street, Tysoe Street, Clerkenwell—I searched the lodgings and found three boxes of fifty cartridges each to fit the revolver—I also found a case of gunpowder and other articles, and a pawn-ticket relating to another revolver—I examined the prosecutrix's premises—a window had been opened by the forcing back of a catch—I found several bullet marks in the house—one was in the wall about three feet from the floor, and six or seven feet from the head of the stairs—on the top landing there was a bullet mark with the bullet in it—there was another bullet mark in the edge of the front door, about ten inches from the bottom—the door must have been standing open—the next one was in the wall of the hall; and there was another mark which I did not think was a bullet hole at the time, but I afterwards found it was; that was about four or six feet from the ground—in the ceiling above the stairs, where the groom was shot, was a bullet hole—I took up the floor of the landing over it and got the bullet—this. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician and surgeon—on the night of 5th September I went to Highfield House about 9.30—I found Robert Howe sitting in a chair in the kitchen—I had him placed on the floor, and I then found he had a bullet wound about two and a half inches below and three-quarters of an inch on the outer side of his left nipple; that was within three-quarters. of an inch of the apex of his heart—the bullet had gone through and come out at his back, between the eleventh and twelfth ribs, and two and three-quarter inches from the spine—I saw a mark in his clothes where it had gone through, and it had also passed through a newspaper and letter—the left lung was wounded—-the bullet in passing through had split the sixth rib, opposite the wound of entrance—he was in a very serious condition—his life was in the greatest peril for some three weeks—the peril was due to a complication which arose from the injury—his heart was pushed over from one side of the body to the other by the pressure of atmospheric air admitted by the wound—he was not able to attend at the police-court till the 4th October—ho is still under my care, but is now out of all danger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in hit defence, stated that he was very terry fir the event and that he should have been so foolish as to carry a revolver, that hit object teas not to murder any one or to do any one any injury; if he had intended to shoot any one he could have done so, but his only object was to escape, and he purposely fired wide, and that in the struggle at the bottom of the stairs the revolver accidentally went off and caused the wound on Howe.</hi>

I am an oil and colourman, of 5, Richmond Terrace, College Park, Harrow Road—about 11.30 p. m. on 22nd August I and my wife fastened up the doors and shutters, and left all quite safe—about 7.30 a. m, I came down into the kitchen and found the place in great disorder—an entrance had been effected by the kitchen window; the fastening had been worked back by a knife—the window was raised a little—the back door was open—I missed the cruet-stand, teapot, knives, forks, spoons, and the rest of this property produced.</p>

I am a platelayer, of 7, Ridgley Road, Harrow Road—on 23rd August I was on the railway bridge by Kensal Green Railiway Station about 7 a. m.—I saw the prisoner come from the direction of Kensal Green across a plot of land belonging to the railway company and across a field to a hut—he laid down at the side of the hut as though he was shoving something underneath—he was about there an hour—he went on the North-Western main line and went to the pond and had a wash—he went to the North London Railway three or four times and came back to the hut—ho kept looking back—I saw something under his arm which shone in the sun—he got over the rails into the ditch on the main line and remained there a quarter of an hour—he ran after some boys as though he was frightening them, and drove them away—I went to meet him and he ran away—III</p>

I saw the two Joyces at the back of Marl<lb/>borough Street Police-court, and identified them as the men I had seen with the cart—I afterwards went with Sergeant Brown to a stable and identified the pony and the cart, which was cleaner, and had the name of Beck on it in large letters, which was covered up the morning of the robbery, or put on since.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">A list was handed. in, and the property was produced.</hi>) In a vase on the mantelshelf in the room I found these two pawntickets of 31st July, 1882; one for a brooch and earrings in case, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in the name of Ann Green, 28, Lisson Street, at Thomas Richardson's, and the other for a pair of opera glasses in case, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., Ann Green, 9, North Street, at Amhurst's, 74, East Street, Manchester Square—on reading that to the female prisoner she said "Those things are mine, and have nothing whatever to do with the case "—when this jewel case was produced out of the middle drawer she said "<hi rend="italic">Bobby, Bobby,</hi> however could you do this? you know I have given you money to buy these things, and you have had the invoices"—the boy replied "Mother, I have only had three invoices, and they were for the brackets"—these are some of the brackets found in the room—I took the prisoners into custody—I went again the next day, and searched the room with Sergeant Alcock, when I found these jewels (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had taken charge of the key during the night—this</p>

               <p>I was in my office about 5.30 when Holton came running to me and said, "There is a man coming along with two bales of indiarubber in his cart"—I asked if he could recognise who put them in—he said, "Two men," but it was done so quick he could not see—being principal of the department I was anxious to find out who it was, and ran out of my shed.</p>

I am a butcher, of 7, Tunbridge Street, Euston Road—on a Friday in August I was at the Metropolitan Meat Market, and Setchell spoke to me at a quater to 6 a. m.—Surman was with him—he said "You are just the man I am looking for"—I said "Oh, what do you want?"—he said "I want you to come and help me do 10 beasts to-day "—I said "I can't come now "—he said "When can you come?"—I said "As soon as I am done with the man I am working for I will come to you"—I said" How are you going to work?"—he said" Me and you can do them "—I said "No, I shall not, it is too much; you must get another man "—he said "Very well, I will"—I saw him again about 7 o'clock, and asked if he had another man, and he said "No;" be told me to get a man, and I had one there waiting for him—Setchell told me to go to the little butcher's shop in the Battersea Road belonging to Surman—I went there about 9.30 on the Friday morning—I saw Surman there, and said "Are they here?"he said "No, they are just gone "—I said "Where am I to go to?" he said "Collier's slaughterhouse, in the Usk Road "—I asked him where the Usk Road was; he said "Catch that tram," which was passing the end of his street," and go as far as you can by that, and then inquire "—I found the slaughter-house was at Mr. Brittle's. in the Usk Road—I could not find it under the name of Collier; I found Brittle's—I found Setchell and Jelly there waiting for me, and we set to work and slaughtered these 10 milch cows—there were three greys, and some were brown and white, or red and white; one was a short-horned poor cow, and one a very poor cow, not worth more than 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound when dead, but it was healthy—one was a very broad-backed red roan, and another a big blue cow, very wild, and we had trouble to kill her—the hock of one of them was as big again as it ought to be—while we were slaughtering them I asked Setehell once or twice where they came from—once he said they came from Romford, and another time he gave me some evasive answer—he never told me they came from Tick's—we had slaughtered them all about 6 o'clock at night—Setchell and Surman talked together behind the beef—Setchell paid me in Barman's presence; Surman took away a cart-load of something—I threw six heads into the cart, and there were six hides and six fat offals, excepting the hearts and tongues—Surman took both loads—we had a candle to finish the last lot by—I received 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for my work, but I paid him back It. in the public-house, and gave Jelly 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., so I had 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., ex my fare, which was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

I am a meat salesman in the "C" avenue of the Metropolitan Meat Market—on Saturday, 26th August, 91/4 beasts were brought to me in Cornell's van—before that I had seen Setchell, whom I had always known as Price, and he told me he had 10 carcases coming, which I was to sell for him—he did not say where from—93/4 came, and I sold them for 115<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a few shillings—I asked him where he got them; he said he bought them at Egham for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I said that was a good price, and I did not believe him—about 4.30 the same day he came, and I said "You have got yourself into a nice mess about</p>

               <p>these carcases," and I sent my clerk out for a policeman—a man whom I did not know was with him, who said "Iam the owner of the meat"—the policeman came, and Setchell was taken in custody—I kept the money by order of the Court—I went to the House of. Detention, but did not recognise him—Surman was not there on the Saturday, but they are always together.</p>

H. Price—it was in an envelope, stuck down, but not addressed—I said "What is this?"—he said "I do not know; open it and see"—I opened it and read it to him:" Sir,—I have engaged a carman to convey my beef to market. If you have not got room to hang it all up I will send a van this evening, so that you can send what you think proper. Send all offal back with the cart. Dress them as well as you can. I am going</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, of 18, Maze Court, Borough—on Sunday morning, 10th December, shortly after midnight, I was crossing London Bridge—I had only had two glasses of ale all the evening—I saw the two prisoners walking in the same direction towards the Borough—I overtook them, and as I passed them Allen pushed me, and said, "Be careful who you are pushing on," and struck me with his fiat on the left side of my face, which knocked me down-—I got up again, and held him—I went a little farther over the bridge, and he hit me with the knob of this stick (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on my shoulder, and knocked me down again—while I was holding him Desmond hit me on my head with his hand; first saying, "If you do not leave go of him I will make you leave go "—I fell, and do not remember anything more till I came to in Guy's hospital while my wounds were being dressed—I went to the station the same night, and saw the prisoners—I had to attend the hospital some time—I did not challenge the prisoners, or take my coat off.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I left Mr. Goldsmith, a master carman, in Whitechapel</p>

               <p>at 10 o'clock, and went down Tooley Street and had one glass of ale with one of our clerks at the Grapes—I then went to see him part of the way home—I was not staggering on the bridge—I did not reel against Desmond, or roll up against him and jerk him against Allen, nor was Allen's hat thrown off—I did not use beastly language to them; I never do, nor did I then strike Allen, nor did we struggle, and fall together, nor did ho get up and rejoin Desmond, nor did I follow, and get in front of Allen and tell him I would fight him—he did not say that he did not want to have anything to do with me, nor did I again strike him, or he strike me again, nor did I fall from the blow, and strike my head against the kerb—I din net strike Allen on the side of his head, causing a bump—I followed them, and asked Allen what it was for—I believe they were perfectly sober—I was alone—I gave them no provocation—it lasted 5 or 10 minutes—I suffered much pain.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 10, Waterloo Place, St. George's-in-the-East—on 10th September about 12.30 a. m. I was crossing London Bridge to the station, and saw Allen push Attwood into the road, seize him by his coat collar, and strike him with his right fist—he fell, and Allen fell on him, because Attwood kept hold of him—Attwood got up, and Allen struck him again with his fist—up to that time Desmond had done nothing, but he struck Attwood with a stick on his shoulder when he was getting up the last time—they walked thirty or forty yards, and then Allen seized him again, and struck him, and Desmond ran at him to strike him, but Allen said, "Let him alone, I can manage him," and struck Attwood on the side of his head, and he fell a third time insensible—I never saw Attwood strike either of the prisoners, and I was right against them till a crowd gathered and pushed me back—after he was knocked down the last time, and was insensible, the prisoners ran away down the steps of London Bridge—Dutch and I followed them, and they were brought back.</p>

I live at 2, College Gardens, Dulwich—on 14th September I went to bed at 11 o'clock—I was the last person up, and saw all fastened up—I was called at 6 a. m., and found the library broken into, and missed two coats, a waistcoat, pair of shoes, a concertina, and a gold watch—this is the concertina and the shoes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they were safe when I went to bed—I did not lock the window, but I believe it was closed—the watch was on the mantelpiece—I know the concertina by one note, being out of tune—it is worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I live at 59, Kennington Road, and am a labourer—I was at the Lambeth Baths at the time in question, and saw the prisoners there—I saw the prosecutor come out into the bath first, and they followed him about three minutes afterwards—they were talking together when they came in—I saw them walk by the prosecutor's box and look in, and then come back three boxes away from where the gentleman was—they looked in through a wicket-door—there is no curtain, and it is all open—Reed was wearing these drawers, the other prisoner had no drawers on—they went into a box, and then came on the diving-board; they got talking on the diving-board, and Williams got hold of Reed and threw him into the water; they swam half the length of the bath, then Williams got out, and Reed stopped in the water a little while, and then I did not see anything more of them until I saw Williams dressed, for he went down to the urinal first, and Reed followed him in—Reed had his drawers on—Williams came out of the urinal first, and Reed walked round the bath three boxes away from where I was; then he took off his drawers and put them in the box, and then he came out of the box and dived into the water and swam about, and then the prosecutor came out of the water and spoke to the bath attendant.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Shere—on Monday evening, 18th September, about 20 minutes to 6 I was near my house, and saw the prisoner coming down the corner from the direction of the heath—I had a friend with me—the moment the prisoner saw me he turned round in a most suspicious manner, so much so, that we stood still and looked at him—he turned round, and went away again towards the heath, which is about half a mile from my house, not in the direction of the station, but quite the contrary direction—the next thing I saw was Mr. Coe's rick on fire—that was between me and the station, and directly after, within two or three minutes, I saw my own rick on fire—Mr. Coes rick was in a field to the right of the path going towards the station—my rick was farther on, also on the right of the path towards Gomshall Station—the distance between my rick and Mr. Coe's was about 300 or 400 yards—that was the last I saw of the prisoner.</p>

I am a bricklayer, living at Gomshall—about 10 minutes to 6 on the evening of 18th September I was going through the fields on my way home from work—I was between Mr. Farhall's house and Mr. Coe's rick—I saw the prisoner coming up from the path leading from the church—that is a cross path leading into the path that runs across the fields to Gomshall Station—he stepped across the other path leading to Gomshall, and went straight up to Mr. Coe's stack, and went round the left-hand side of it—I was coming the same way as he was—I had a good opportunity of seeing him—I have no doubt he is the man—I did not notice the rick on fire till after I got home—I could see the rick plainly from my kitchen window—I live in Queen Street, Gomshall—I saw the fire from my window—I should think that was about eight minutes after I had seen the prisoner go round the rick—on seeing it, I went back, and saw that portion of the rick was on fire where I had seen the prisoner—shortly afterwards I saw another fire at Mr. Farhall's—at half past 6 I went with Police-constable Finch to the railway station at</p>

I am a carpenter, at Riddlesdown Road, near Croydon—on 24th September I saw the prisoner walking to and fro in a field with a baby in her arms—after a while she came out of the field into the high road, walked up the road a little way, and then went back into the field and sat down on a short post, changed the infant's cloth, threw it behind her, and placed another one on it—she then got up and looked at the baby's face—I saw that it looked very pale; I was within six yards of it—she walked across the field, and still kept wandering up and down the field by the side of the railroad, first looking at the railroad and then at the high road—I made a communication to the police, and went with him—I did not see him uncover the child's face—I saw it in her arms—she said she had choked it—she looked very strange.</p>

The last witness made a communication to me, and I went into a field and saw the prisoner carrying something in her arms—I asked her what she had in her arms—she said "My baby"—I asked her to let me see it—she took a pocket-handkerchief from across its face, and I saw that it was dead—she said "I have choked it with a pocket-handkerchief. I tied it round the poor little thing's neck. I did not want it to suffer as I have. I slept at a coffeehouse at the junction last night, and I carried the baby about with me all day. If you had not come I was going to do away with myself to-night when it got dark. "She took this pocket-handkerchief from her pocket, and said "That is the pocket-handkerchief I done it with"—I took her into custody, and took her to the police-station, where she was seen by Inspector Harris and Dr. Rosser.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She carried the child to the station in her arms in the same way—when I first saw her she was standing in the field—she said "Don't take me; let me stop till dark, and I will do away with myself"—I saw her husband at the inquest; he is a bricklayer—I went to the address she gave, 2, Silverdale Cottages, Saunderstead Road, on Sunday evening, about 7.30, but there was no one in, and when I got back to the station the husband was there—I did not go back to the house—the husband was in work—the prisoner was decently dressed; there was no appearance of destitution about her or about the house—they seemed in a very comfortable position for their class of life.</p>

It was in bed with me all night. At 8 o'clock this morning I dressed it and wrapped it in a shawl. I carried it about all day. Feeling tired, I laid it down in a field, when two men must have seen me, or they would not have come there. I picked it up again, and intended to wait till evening and give myself up. I don't want to be hung. It is happy, that is more than I have been. ") That was read over to her, and she said "That is quite true"—when I took the child from her she became excited, and clung to it—her husband stepped forward to assist me—I told her I should have to take it—she was crying, and said "You won't hurt the poor little dear"—I said "No," and she gave it up.</p>

On the afternoon of the 24th I was called to the police-station at Croydon, and found the prisoner there and a female child—I examined it; it was dead—I subsequently made a post-mortem examination—I found marks of compression by a ligature on each side of the neck, low down, extending from the front to the back of the neck, such as would be produced by a pocket-handkerchief—the brain was congested—the other organs were all healthy—the stomach contained a small quantity of partially digested milk—the cause of death was the congestion produced by the compression—it was a well nourished child—I examined the prisoner; she was exceedingly strange, apparently unconscious of what she had done, or the magnitude of the crime she had committed—she told me that she had been very unhappy, that she had had sleepless nights for some weeks, with great pain in her head, that her husband had struck her when the child was six weeks old, and she had not been able for shame to hold her head up since, and her only object in strangling the child was that it should not live to be as unhappy as she had been.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Inspector L</hi>). I was with the last witness at Vauxhall Station, about 2 o'clock, and saw Adlum leave the station—shortly afterwards I saw Grace in the Fentiman Road, and I saw him meet Adlum at the station—Boswell handed me this piece of paper con<lb/>taining</p>

               <p>these two tickets (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said in Grace's presence" I saw this piece of paper containing these tickets handed by Adlum to Grace; I saw him put it into his left-hand trousers pocket. Coming down Clapham Road he took it out as if going to throw it away. I seized his hand and took it out"—I then said "Grace, we have been keeping observation upon you, and you will be charged now with being concerned with Adlum in stealing these tickets, and also receiving them"—he said "I picked these tickets up in the street"—I said "When and what street did you pick them up in?"—he made no reply—among the papers found on Grace I saw this one with the address on it of 32, Meadow Road—I went there and saw Adlum; he was living there—I said to him "You know me"—he said "Yes, I do"—I said "A man named Grace has just been taken into custody for receiving some tickets from you belonging to your employers. I shall take you into custody for stealing these tickets"—he said "You don't mean that?"—I said "Yes, we have been keeping observation upon you for some time"—he asked me to allow him to take off his uniform coat and waistcoat and put on plain clothes—I said "Certainly"—he did so—I felt in the pockets of his uniform waistcoat, which he threw on the bed, and found 14 return tickets from various parts of the country on the South Western Line—an other uniform waistcoat was hanging behind the door, and I found in that 11 return half tickets to various parts on the line, and in other pockets I found others, altogether 39, all return halves—I think as to 12 or 13 of them the date had not expired—I said "How do you account for having all these tickets in your pocket?"—he made no answer at the time, but afterwards he said "I did not think there were so many as that; I intended to take them back"—I took him to the station—he there saw Grace and I said "You know him, Adlum?"—he said "Oh yes, I know him very well.

I am chief ticket collector at Vauxhall Station—Adlum has been employed there about 12 years as ticket collector—the ticket collectors have no authority whatever to take away from the station tickets which they have collected—they should take them into the office and put them on the desk to be entered and sent to the office—tourist tickets would be taken to the same office—ordinary tickets are sorted on a bench; tourist tickets are put on a desk—they should all be taken into the office and sorted by the man in charge—I know Grace—I have seen him travelling on the line on several occasions, and frequently at other times round by the station—I have seen him in company with Adlum there, I should say more than a dozen times, extending over a month.</p>

At that time Spincer was not in custody—I said to Adlum "I have come in reference to this letter, Adlum; I hold out no inducement to you, and make no promise "—he then made a statement, which I took down in writing, read over to him, and he signed. (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner in this stated that he began to deal with the tickets four or five years ago</hi>; <hi rend="italic">that he was introduced by a man named Clements to Spincer, and by him tovarious other persons, amongst others to Grace; that the tickets in question he received from Spincer, who paid him a few shillings at a time for them</hi>).</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Inspector L</hi>). I apprehended Adlum at his house on 4th September—I found in his pockets a number of tickets—I also opened a drawer in a chest of drawers in his room, which he unlocked with a key from his pocket at my request—he look out a paper—I said, "Let me look at that," and I saw the letters A and B—I read them—he said, "I did send some <hi rend="italic">gambols</hi> down"—he has since told me "gambols" means railway tickets—I saw him at the House of Detention—I mentioned those in the letter—he also told me he received them from Spincer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Bircham and Co., solicitors to the South-Western Railway Company—on 13th June an accident happened at Staines Junction—this letter signed Spincer was received at Water-loo Station; it was handed to me—shortly afterwards Spincer called on me—I had the letter, and referred to it (<hi rend="italic">Dated 19th June; expressing surprise at not receiving a reply to a letter referring to injuries received in the accident</hi>)—I subsequently paid him some compensation for his injuries—I saw him three times altogether—he signed the receipt produced "Francis Spincer "—I have compared the letters A and B with his writing—I believe them to be the same writing.</p>

                  </hi>, I am superintendent of police on the South-Western Railway—on 14th September I received Spincer into custody at Doncaster—that was after the other prisoners had been remanded—I said, "I shall charge you with being concerned with William Adlum and. John Grace, who are in custody, with stealing and receiving railway tickets, knowing them to have been stolen, also conspiring with those two men to defraud the railway company by using and selling them"—he said, "That is a very serious charge "—I said, "Yes "—I afterwards showed him the letters A and B—I said, "Those letters were found on Adlum, and were written by you "—he read them carefully through—he made no reply—when he was searched a pocket book was found, which contained the same address as the letters: "Broad Street, Ottery St. Mary," and underneath "No. 3, Gladstone Street, Vauxhall, London "—I knew Adlum lived there until last March—I said, "Adlum has made a statement, and says you have had tickets of him, and that last Sunday week you called at his house, and paid 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for some you</p>
