Sometimes boys get into the cupboard and sleep; I thought would take them up stairs and see if any body enquired after them. When I came from market, I mentioned them to the woman in the next room; nobody enquired after them till Mr. M'Donald came.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that woman here? - No, I said I would throw this stuff away, it was of no use to me, and I will try and clear the bottles: I said, perhaps, it was some painters stuff or other.</p>

               <p>When was you robbed? - The 28th of September last, I met with a man in Ratcliff-highway, In a cook's-shop, that was the prisoner, I went in to get my dinner, and he came in just after me and sat down and got his dinner, and I came out again, and just at the cook's shop door, I saw two of my countrymen, and we went into a public-house to drink, the prisoner followed us to the public-house, and he called for either one or two pints of beer, my company<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190005"/> and me were sitting together, and he was like to breed a quarrel with us, and he wanted to fight, and I said I would sooner drink with you than fight with you any time, so would I too, says he, we sat there till near the evening dusk, then he would see us home, he was very good company, and he saw us home to our own apartment, there were two and himself were three, and I and my wife were five; and we drank, and were pretty merry, and he was very good company till I got a little groggy; then knowing the man, and he being in the house, and it drawing late, I laid down to get a sleep, then the prisoner begged to stay under the roof of the house, because he was locked out of his lodgings; I let him stay as he was a poor sailor like myself, to harbour him for fear any harm should come to him; when I awaked it was between three and four in the morning, and the man was gone, and the money, and my property, and my wearing apparel.</p>
               <p>Where was the man when you went to sleep? - I will tell you, I had not a bed to put him in, but he said, never mind a bed, I can plank it, I have planked it many a time; I left him laying upon the floor.</p>
               <p>Was any body else left in the room besides him? - Yes, one of the men that was along with him, that man slept in the bed with me, my wife awaked me, the strange man was laying on the backside of the bed, I was laying in the middle, my wife was laying with her clothes on upon the bed, she put her hand under the pillow where she put her pockets, and they were gone, and the man was gone, and the money was gone; through the alarm I waked the man, and run up stairs to get a light, this other man that was in the bed put his hand in his pocket, and he said to me, Dick, all my money is gone; says I, it is fallen out in the bed, and I put my hand into my pocket; why, says I, all my money is gone too, so she came down, says I, what is the matter; Oh dear! says she, matter enough, the man is gone, and the money is gone; I missed thirteen shillings and sixpence out of my right-hand breeches pocket, and I had only three shillings and six-pence in this breeches pocket that I was laying on, he could not get at that.</p>
               <p>After you missed the money, did you look for the man? - I never had any thoughts to look for the man, what should I look for a man for that I never saw with my eyes before; my wife locked the door, bolted the door, and latched it; that is, it was latched first.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the door, when you first waked, to see whether it was open or shut? - My wife did.</p>
               <p>Did you lose any thing else besides your money? - Yes, a waistcoat, a washing jacket that I had under my coat, and I have not another in the world, and a shirt; and when I took him he had my shirt on, the shirt and jacket were laid for him to lay on to keep him as warm as I could.</p>
               <p>Where did you take the man? - In the Half-way-house at Stepney, I had intelligence on Thursday night about ten; I directly got up, and took him, and I took my garters off my legs and tied him, and I found my own shirt upon his back, with a name my wife clapped in with her own hands, the waistcoat was not to be found, nor the money.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the man before? - Never with my eyes till I saw him in the cook's-shop.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the man that you found at the Half-way-house was the same man that you saw at the cook's-shop? - Oh, I am sensible, would I go to say or swear a false thing, my Lord. no, I would sooner die first.</p>
               <p>You are quite sure? - I am sensible of it.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Yesterday was three weeks I went to the cook's shop in Ratcliff-high way to get my dinner, and there was a man in liquor, I went in, I never minded the man, and the prosecutor and the woman was sitting at dinner; in three or four minutes the man that was abusing the man at the cook's shop, was hauled in, having broke the windows, the man that was in liquor that broke the windows, asked the prosecutor to pay for the windows; I said this man and woman have said nothing amiss, they sat at table at dinner, they were charged with a constable, at last the prosecutor agreed to pay the man for the windows, but before that, says the woman, you have seen we have done nothing, and we will go before the Justice, and we will pay you for your trouble; says I, good woman I have nothing to do with your affairs, the man that broke the windows proved to be the prosecutor's landlord, tho' he said he did not know him. I often dine at this cook's shop, and the young man the son said to me, will you go over the way and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190007"/> have a pint of beer? and we went, and there was the prosecutor and his wife and three more men, seamen, they had, I suppose, five or six pots of beer; I paid for a pint of beer, and we had another, they would insist on my drinking, I refused, however, they got pretty still, and one of the men that went home along with us began singing a song, then they insisted upon my joining their company, we continued there all the afternoon drinking and singing, and I put down a shilling and said let us see what that will do, one of these seamen put down another, the other men said they would not pay any thing, they were asked in; so one being a stout man, says to the prosecutor, you was my total ruin you know by false swearing before, and you have an undoubted right to pay my reckoning, and the woman said, do not have any words, I will pay the next of the reckoning, and she paid it, and we all went to their house together; I was for leaving them, no, no, says the prosecutor and his wife, let us go home and have a bit of supper, and a song or two at home, we went there and she put some victuals upon the table, and fetched half a gallon of beer, that was soon out, and I paid for another half gallon; there were two others, a man and woman came up, we had three half gallons of beer, and at ten I said I should be locked out; never mind that says the woman, and one of the men said we shall all pigg here to-night; I insisted upon going home, they insisted I should not; about eleven we had three half gallons more, and being in liquor, I said I cannot sit up, let me lay down to sleep; I laid down and one of the men pulled his jacket off and put it over me; the woman came up stairs and said says she there is a woman lays there, you may lay down with her, they saw before I had money, and I said I want no woman; the other two men were up and down stairs several and several times; I fell asleep, and the woman waked me, says she you must get up because my husband will be very angry, he does not remember your being here in the room, and these other three are his country people, he will not be vexed with them, but he will with you, for he will not remember you, as he was in liquor, and she went down with me and let me out; I went and set with the watchman till day-light, and gave him threepence; on the Thursday evening I went to the Half-way House at Stepney, and we had some beer there, and in came this man and his wife, and another man, and took and tied my hands; says he, he has pistols about him, I was searched, I had neither knife nor pistol; well, they took me down to Shadwell, there they stripped me of every thing, the shirt was taken off my back, and she made oath before the Justice that it was her shirt; she then said it was marked with I. L. I bought the shirt of Mrs. Winnes who sells clothes near the New Road, and a pair of stockings and a black handkerchief; I received this money at Chatham.</p>

               <p>Court. Is Mrs. Winnes here? - No, I had no money to subpoena her, all my money and things were taken from me.</p>

               <p>Court to Elby. When did you first see any thing of this matter? - The prisoner was brought up to the public-house where I was drinking, with his hands tied, and charged with robbing them of some money, and this shirt, seven guineas I think it was, the shirt was then on his back.</p>

            ; I met the prisoner in Broad St. Giles's on the 20th of September, and I asked her how she did, she said, indeed Mrs. Groves I am very bad, I am just come out of gaol, I am in great distress; I asked her to drink something, she said, if you please; I had known her three months before, I took her into a publick house and bid her chuse her own liquor, and she chose a quartern of rum, I paid a great for it, I I gave her six-pence to get her some meat, and I called for a pot of porter, and when she came back, I said, Mary here is sixpence, I am sorry for your distress; she said, indeed I am, for this old bed-gown is my shift; then I gave her a shilling and took the six-pence, then I got up to come away and it began to rain, I said Mary if you have a mind to come home with me and have a good dish of tea it may refresh you after your trouble; she came home with me and sat on the foot of the bed, and I took and tied the nine and six-pence in the corner of my apron in a hard kno, she saw me do it; I went and unlocked my box where my clothes were, and I put my apron and my money in the box, and I shewed her the trimming; I said I had bought it for that gown, and pointed to the box; she said it would look very neat; after a little while I said I was very poorly with a pain in my side, I would lay down if she would make the tea, she said do my dear, she covered me up, and I believe I fell asleep, and I missed her and there was no fire, and I went to light a candle, and I was locked in.</p>
               <p>What time was this? - About one in the day-time, I thought she was gone to buy an old gown, I was not surprised, I made my bed and swept my room out afterwards; I found my box stripped of every thing, I missed my bonnet, I opened my window and called out, and a neighbour made answer, if any body has robbed you it is that woman in the white wrapper, for I saw her come down in your bonnet and a great bulk under her petticoats, she stood under<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190010"/> the gateway and pressed it down then I begged that somebody would go to my landlady, and see if they could open the door, and they got the door open, and I pursued where she said the prisoner was gone, I looked every where for her, and about seven or eight I met her; says I, Mary what an ungenerous creature you are, to treat me in the manner you have done, she was a minute before she spoke, she took the pipe out of her mouth, and said, I was just going to send to you; says I, Oh! you ungenerous creature, was you a going to send me my clothes again, and my money, and where is the key of my room, she put her hand in her pocket and said d - n you here is your key; says I, I will not leave you till I know where my things are; she flung her pipe down in the street and said,</p>
               <p>"by the Holy Ghost I will score you like pork, if you do not loose me," and she clinched her hands as if she had been going to strike me, but she did not: says I, I will forgive you the money if you will tell me where my things are, but if you do not I will fetch a constable; so then she downed on her knees in all the muck, and said,</p>
               <p>"bad luck and a sudden death attend you Mother Groves, if you do not fetch a constable"; so then I did fetch a constable, or else I would not have troubled my head about her; nobody was in the room but her when I laid down.</p>
               <p>When you found her had she any of your clothes on? - No, she had a very handsome gown on, which she had taken out of pawn that very afternoon.</p>
               <p>How long did you sleep? - I cannot recollect, but it was more than an hour, it was about twelve when we came in together, and it was almost two when I awaked.</p>
               <p>- DOUGLAS sworn.</p>
               <p>I have a lower apartment; I was having some breakfast with the woman of the house with my children, and the prisoner came to the window and asked for the prosecutrrix, I told her I did not know such a person by name, with that she went away, this was about ten in the morning; she was gone about an hour and a half, when she and the prosecutrix returned together, and they went up stairs together, and she might be up stairs for an hour and half or an hour and three quarters, I cannot say which, along with this said Mrs. Groves; when she went up stairs she had neither hat, cloak, nor gown on, and when she came down she had the contents under her petticoats, a kind of bundle, and she stood under the gateway and was stroking down her hips, and the prosecutrix's bonnet was on her head, which I had seen on the prosecutrix before, I thought the prisoner was gone out of an erand, she seemed as if hesitating, and then she turned to the right hand towards St. Giles's; I afterwards told Mrs. Groves which way she went as soon as she made the alarm; I am sure to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I come down again in two or three minutes and leave the house intirely? - Upon my oath she went up along with this said Mrs. Groves, and never came down with the contents till an hour and half, or an hour and three quarters; she came down also with the bonnet on her head.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see a bundle with me? - Yes, I saw a bundle under your petticoats, and a bonnet on your head.</p>

               <p>Had you delivered your key to any body while you was absent? - No, I came back before my wife, I was at work just by, and I heard a noise, and I came to the back door, and there was the prisoner in the back room, I found him in the bed-room below stairs, I found nobody else.</p>

               <p>How far from your house had he got before you took him? - Nearly half a mile.</p>
               <p>How came you to let him go so far? - I did not care to go too near him for fear he should shoot me, but more people came up then I mustered up courage, he ran and before I took him he threw something away, I followed him as close as I could within fifteen or twenty yards, he was not out of my sight in the course of my running.</p>
               <p>Did you observe him throw something away? - Yes I did observe him throw something away, but what it was I could not tell; after I took him I went to the place where he threw something away, and there we found a pistol; when I took him he had one of my silver spoons in his pocket.</p>

               <p>Mr. Keys, prisoner's Council. Did the man that robbed you go away immediately from the chaise, after he had robbed you? - Yes, he bid me turn my head about, which I very readily did; after he took the basket of fowls, I did not see him offer to strike any person; this transaction was a minute about, or two, three or five, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>To Daniel. The prisoner was a perfect stranger to you before this transaction? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long do you imagine it was about? - I thing it was about five minutes; he was longer in robbing my friend, than the others were in robbing me; at the time we were about the bustle of the mare, I had as much view of him as I have of you now, and for a considerable way, he was coming down the hill, I had a particular view of him every way, I particularly observed him before he came.</p>
               <p>Had you no terror on your mind at this time? - No, I had not, only when one of the prisoners threatened to shoot my dog, my attention was taken up with one more than the other; I knew all the three, and my friend knows them too, if he chuses to speak; the other two men were convicted on my evidence last sessions.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I am a tea-dealer.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In Southampton-street, Covent Garden; I was taken into a room, where the other men were, with twelve or thirteen, and I picked them out directly.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you saw these prisoners again? - I suppose it was a month.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys prisoner's Council. If the prisoner struck at you, it must be across your friend? - Yes it was.</p>
               <p>Yet your friend could not see that? - I do not wonder at that, he was a good deal terrified.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did you see this man after the robbery? - At Litchfield-street, at the Rotation-office, he was taken up at Litchfield-street, and I was sent for.</p>
               <p>Was he with other people at that time? - No, he was not.</p>
               <p>When you gave evidence of the person of the prisoner, had you described the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How? - In black clothes.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed when you saw him? - As he is now.</p>
               <p>And was you sure he is the man? - Yes, I was clear he was the man.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived in Southampton-street? - About sixteen years.</p>
               <p>You have not a doubt about? - No, I have not indeed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys. My Lord, the prisoner wished to have postponed his trial, on account of the absence of his witnesses, and I can only say, that if they had been here, they would have proved, that this young man's uncle is a man of reputation, and lives at Ealing; that the prisoner has been an officer, and since the peace he has been supported by his uncle, and bears a good character.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>When I was brought to Litchfield-street, I was pointed out by Dixon and Blacketer, two men that belong to the office, to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190014"/> gentleman who was robbed; I heard one man in particular, make answer, and say, that is the man; any body might have been sworn to equally with me, I am innocent.</p>
               <p>Court to Daniel. Was the prisoner pointed out to you as the man that robbed you, or did you yourself know him? - No, he was not pointed out, the prisoner was taken up on my information, and he told a long story before the Justice, that he was down at Folkston, from the first of August to the second of September; I had been there for some time.</p>

               <p>I am an officer belonging to Litchfield-street; I know the prisoner: I took him in custody on the twenty-third of August in Tottenham-court-road in the street; Johnson came to the office to me, and in consequence of his information to me, I took up the prisoner; I searched him, and in his waistcoat pocket I found this bottle and this bit of black mittin, with these seven shillings, and fourteen sixpences, all bad; they have been in my custody ever since, and three shillings and sixpence in good money, I found in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the money mixed or separate? - No, the bad money was all in that bit of black mittin, the bottle was broke before the Grand Jury, but that is the liquor that was in it; I was obliged to find another bottle, and I took him before the Justice; I have some shillings to shew the Court that this stuff will turn them of that colour.</p>
               <p>Have you made the experiment yourself? - I have, but I have none of them here; I believe Mr. Vines has.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, prisoner's Council. These kind of blanks are used for other purposes I believe. - Very few in that state, they have heads.</p>
               <p>Is there any impression on any of them? - Yes, on several, a faint impression.</p>
               <p>Jury. Some has no impression, and some a faint impression.</p>
               <p>Are not pieces of metal of that size, applied to various purposes? - Not in that state; a round blank with neither head or woman on it, you may make a button of it.</p>
               <p>Would you have taken any one of them as a shilling? - In the state I saw them in, they were finished fit to pass; I should not have taken any of them, but any other person would.</p>

            , about the 18th or 19th of August the prisoner asked me to go home with him, I went home with him.</p>
               <p>Court. What, was he an acquaintance of your? - Not in the least, but I found by being in company with Ford, that he dealt in base money, I went home with him, and called for a pint of beer, he took a bason of the shelf, and there was some pieces about the size of half crowns or crowns, I looked upon them to be copper; after that he told me that he could cast any of them, I immediately went to Litchfield-street, and acquainted Blacketer of what had passed, and he desired me to watch the prisoner; the next day my business led me to go over London Bridge, and I met the prisoner and asked him how he did, he pulled out a bottle out of his pocket, I thought it had been a sample of rum, I smelt of it and I found it was aquafortis, besides that he pulled out of his waistcoat pocket, something similar to paste, similar to that which is in Court, which he said was for cleaning of metal, then I left them, and called at Litchfield-street and acquainted them; two or three days past, and I called again on the prisoner on a Tuesday morning about seven the 23d of August, I was going to see Ford, he asked me for a bottle that stood on the shelf, which he took, he was in his own house, he was in bed, No. 7, White Lion-street, I took it to be something of bark, then he desired me to reach him another bottle, which I did, and when he got up he took off the shelf a black purse which is in Court (looks at it) this is the very purse, it had something in it that jingled I could not tell what it was, I went with him to Ford's, and Ford was not up, I knocked at the window and Ford got up and let him in, I kept on the outside, he asked Ford to give him a little salt, I leaned and lolloped on the outside of the window, there was no glaze to the window, only shutters; the prisoner asked Ford to give him some salt, after that he pulled the bottle out of his pocket, and began to rub some off it with the salt, with some of the metal which he had, which were of the size of sixpences and shillings, he rubbed seven pieces resembling a shilling, and thirteen sixpences, one sixpence I did not see him do (which is the sixpence which lays at the corner) after he had done them, he put him into cold water in a bason, I went immediately to find Blacketer, I could not find him.</p>
               <p>Did you observe what effect the rubbing of them had? - It appeared to make them look like shillings and sixpences.</p>
               <p>Before or after they went into the water? - Before they went into the water.</p>
               <p>What colour were they before they were rubbed? - Something similar to copper, when he washed them he put them into the very same purse, I then went to Dixon and told him what happened, and where he might find the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. How soon was it that you saw what you took to be the pieces that you say he rubbed in that manner, or something similar to them, again? - He rubbed them about a quarter after seven, I saw them directly after, the next day when the prisoner was examined, I went to Mr. Vernon.</p>
               <p>Then you do not know that they were the same pieces that you saw him do? - I really believe them to be the same, there is one shilling that has got a little bit of a hole or dent, that is it to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Pray, Mr. Johnson, has it ever fell within your observation that people stand in the street with paste resembling the colour of this, and rub buckles or buttons? - Such things might be in the street, but I never took notice of it, I have read in the paper of these things for cleaning of silver.</p>
               <p>Court. What way of life are you in? - I am at home with my friends, my mother is in the fan way, lives in Somerset-street, Portland-square.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190016"/>Are you bred to any business? - I never was.</p>
               <p>What age? - Twenty-nine, my father once lived at No. 61. Friday-street, he is reduced.</p>
               <p>This man was not your acquaintance? - No, he was not, Ford was my acquaintance, I was under a predicament for an assault in New Prison, which was the way I got acquainted with Ford, I was a prisoner there for an assault.</p>
               <p>You met this man first at the Hampshire Hog, with Ford? - Yes, it is opposite St. Giles's church.</p>
               <p>What was your business there? - I called to see Ford being a prisoner.</p>
               <p>What business had this prisoner with Ford, could you discover by the conversation between them? - I found that they had been to Peckham-fair the day before, putting off bad money, and they were eating some salmon, and I eat some with them.</p>
               <p>Can you explain to the Jury what led to that? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>What is Ford? - He is a duffer.</p>
               <p>Because it seems a little extraordinary, that the prisoner should choose to put his life into the hands of an absolute stranger, you know Mr. Johnson? - I never saw the man before that time in my life.</p>
               <p>Did you give him any encouragement to help him with respect to this money to pass it off? - No, my Lord, far be it from me.</p>
               <p>Then, what was it that introduced you so far in the confidence of this man? - I thought it was my duty, or any other person's else, to have such a man apprehended.</p>
               <p>I am not blaming you for discovering what past, but what I want to know is, what it could be that induced this man to put so much confidence in you? - I cannot tell, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Do explain to the Jury how it happened that this man trusted you with such a secret as this? - I look upon it, knowing I had been in prison with Ford.</p>
               <p>But he had no reason, I imagine, to suppose you dealt in that way? - I never did in my life.</p>
               <p>But did he suppose so? - Being in prison nobody can tell what situation of life I had been in when I came out; I cannot tell rightly what made him repose so much confidence.</p>
               <p>Rightly, can you at all? - No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Dixon. When Johnson applied to me I desired him to get some of it if he could.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. By your Lordship's permission, I beg leave to observe, this evidence does not sustain the indictment; as to the first count, it appears to me, that in the whole code of laws respecting the coinage of this kingdom, wherever counterfeiting of coin is mentioned, it must be so, that in the common course of receipts and payments of money, it might deceive a common observer; it is not merely the circumstance of money resembling in size, in diameter, and colour, that is such a resemblance as will reach the indictment, under the acts of parliament on this subject: there are various pieces of metal that are coloured for various purposes, that do, in some sort, resemble the current coin of the kingdom, both in size and colour, and yet have not that kind of resemblance to induce any reasonable person to take them. I conceive they must have some traces on the edges, or some traces of the inscription, or something of that kind of resemblance, that would induce people of common experience and of common observation to take them by themselves: with respect to the second count, I think there arises an objection to it from the very nature of the crime, as described in the act of parliament; it says, in a more general way, pieces of metal that only resembled in figure, pieces of base metal that are coloured for that purpose, so far as to resemble the colour of shillings; the evidence does not state that this money was the money that Johnson saw the prisoner colour, but if it did, it is within the eye of the Court and Jury, that they do not so far resemble the colour of shillings, so as to be taken by any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190017"/> person of common prudence or observation; I thought it my duty to submit these observations to your Lordship's consideration.</p>
               <p>Court. They are observations that go to the matter of fact.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. In the very last Sessions there was a trial of the very same nature, where the pieces did not more resemble the current coin of the kingdom than these, and the prisoner was acquitted.</p>

               <p>What do you say of that bottle? - I was acquainted with this Ford; I saw him in Clerkenwell; I went to see him, and this Johnson was drawing beer at the same time, and Ford was shewing a bad shilling, I said, Sir, I have a great many of them at home, and it is a great loss to me; says he, I will give you a bottle of stuff to rub them over; and in about a couple of months I met Ford and Johnson at the Hampshire Hog; then I believe I shewed them two or three of the shillings, and some pocket pieces in another cup; I have the pocket pieces to produce, which he says are half crowns; then we were talking about notes; I said I was no scholar, and Ford had a bad note about him when he took me that Johnson had given him: Ford was to take these fourteen shillings from me, and to allow me something for them, and to make the best of them; I have a very good character in the town.</p>

               <p>Who was there besides the constable and you? - There was a gentlewoman and two sailors.</p>
               <p>Are the two sailors here? - I cannot say, the gentlewoman of the shop was there also.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you did not hear any thing of her being angry about the sailor telling she took the things? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you insist upon it then, and tell the constable and the prosecutor? - I gave charge of the sailor to Mr. Taylor.</p>
               <p>Wa s the sailor in the shop before you came? - Yes; he just came in.</p>

               <p>You did not go into the shop, nor you did not follow her? - I cannot tell, I cannot swear I saw something on the floor red and white, but I did not see any body take any thing up; this woman went into the shop, I saw her going into the shop.</p>
               <p>Did not you stand at the door? - I would have gone into the shop only the young man did not like to buy the cotton.</p>
               <p>How could you see what was there, you do not know what it was you saw laying? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Do you remember this woman being there? - No, I never saw the woman before in the shop.</p>
               <p>Court to Halfwright. Did the woman give you a hint to drink part of a pint of beer, after you had given a hint about the the linen? - Yes; I saw the woman come in and the two men; I am sure the linen lay on the compter at that time; it lay to the right hand.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did that man buy any stockings? - No, he did not.</p>

               <p>I have been out of place about a fortnight; I went into a public house in Russell-street to have a pint of beer, and I saw the prisoner Shergold; I never saw him before in my life, and he said, Jack, how do you do, and he asked me to lend him a shilling, but I told him I had only eighteen-pence, and he put his hand on the outside of my pocket, and said, here is money, and I told him I would tell him the truth, I had three shillings, and in half-pence I had about three shillings and six-pence then; I lent him a shilling, as he asked me; and in a little time he came to me, and said, I wish you would lend me another shilling, and I lent him another shilling, and in about ten minutes after that he came up to me, and told me he was going to take a room at three shillings a week; and that I should not want for a lodging, or any thing else, and that he was going to receive five thousand pounds in a little time, and I should not want, if I would lend him another shilling; when he had the three shillings, and had drank the beer that he had, he asked me if I would come to Mr. Lewis's with a boy's father and mother that were there, and he said, we could have a pot of beer; I went with him, and we had a pot of beer; when that was drank the prisoner went away, and came again, and his acquaintance that was with him; soon after they came in again, and I staid a little while then; I went away, and on Saturday I saw them again, and staid a little while with them; then I went away, and saw no more of them till Sunday; then I met the prisoner Shergold, and he asked me to go to Mr. Lewis's, and we went into the Long Fields; I saw him again about seven, and the other prisoner was with him then, and I told them I lived with Mr. Combes, Bishop's Court, Lincoln's Inn, and we went that way, and he took me to the back of Lincoln's Inn Gardens, and he bid me go to my master's public house, and order a pot of beer, and change for half a crown, and meet the boy, and send him for another pot; then he asked me if I could take up any money or bacon, or beef, in my master's name; then, says he, could not you steal any thing of a gold watch, or any thing of that kind, I said I would not; then the prisoner Preston said, you bloody b - r, if you will not, you shall strip, or I will cut your bloody melt out; then Shergold laid hold on me, and he could not well manage me, then Preston pulled me, but I was so frightened, I let them pull it off without any more; while I was pulling my jacket off, another that was with the prisoners snatched my hat off; I snatched it back, and they all three made off; I then went to Bow-street to give information.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I was errand boy to Mr. Combes; I lived there about half a year; I left my place because I could not wait at table well enough; I am about fiftteen; I never saw Shergold before that time at the public house.</p>
               <p>How came you to lend him money? - Because he told me he would pay me again, and he had five thousand coming to him, though he was in distress.</p>
               <p>Did you think there was any likelihood that such a fellow as him should have five thousand pounds? - I did not know what there was; I did not know he was a thief.</p>
               <p>Where is this Lewis's house that they took you to? - In Red-lion-court, in Russel-court.</p>
               <p>What is this Mr. Lewis? - I believe he is a very honest man; he blacks shoes; I only knew the name of one of the prisoners at that time, that was Shergold, I never saw the other before that Sunday night, but I am sure he is the same person; I knew him by sight as well as I know Shergold; I am quite sure of both of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Is not the shirt he has on mine? - This is not it, for I took off the shirt that he lent me, and it is now washing; he had one of my shirts, which cost<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190027"/> me six shillings, and he pawned it for three shillings, but I never had a farthing of the money; he lent me his shirt to put on as I had no other.</p>

               <p>I am one of the patrol belonging to Saint Giles's and Bedford-square, I took the prisoner Preston at two o'clock in the morning; the prosecutor was standing in his shirt at the door of a lodging house in Dvot-street, and he said, that the man that had robbed him of his jacket was gone up stairs, I went up, and took him out of bed; as we were taking Preston to the Justices he said, going along, if the prosecutor would but forgive him he would give him the coat off his back; I said to Preston, you had better tell us what you have done with the lad's clothes; with that persuading him, he told us where the things were; I found the jacket in the house of a man named Palmer, who bought the jacket; he is here.</p>

               <p>I had this jacket of the prisoner Preston; on Sunday about nine o'clock, he asked me to lend him a little money upon it, as he was distressed, and could not pay his lodgings, I said to him, I do not lend any such thing, nor buy on Sunday nights, I said you have stole it, he said, no, it is my own property, but I would not lend him anything upon it, and away he went, and in two or three minutes after he came back and I told him I would give him eighteen-pence for it, and he took the eighteen-pence, and went away.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he is the person? - I really believe, to the best of my knowledge, he was the person that brought it; I never saw him before, but he is the same man that came the next day.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt that it is him? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Was anybody with him when he produced the jacket? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I keep a chandler's shop, and a pawnbroker's, I did do, but I have laid that by; I buy and sell old clothes in Bambridge-street, Saint Giles's.</p>
               <p>What would you sell that jacket for? - I offered to sell it the next day for two shillings, and I was bid one shilling; it is worth to the wearer two shillings or half a crown.</p>

               <p>We went to Bishop's Court, the prosecutor took us there to rob his master, and he stripped off his jacket and his hat, and gave the jacket to this lad, who went and pawned it for eighteen-pence; Preston did not pawn it.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What became of your shirt that Shergold had? - I never saw it since.</p>
               <p>Which was the best shirt? - Mine cost six shillings, and his would not pawn for anything.</p>

               <p>I went out and locked the door, and carried away the key, I left nobody in my room, the prisoner Cadwell was not at home above stairs.</p>

               <p>I suppose your street door in the day time is open? - It goes with a spring lock, I pulled it to, and it was fast.</p>
               <p>What time did you come home? - About half past eight, I found my husband at home, he brought the key with him; when I came home I found my room stripped of every thing; here is a list of what I lost, they are the things mentioned in the indictment, they were in my drawers in the parlour; nothing has been found but one handkerchief.</p>
               <p>What is your reason for charging the three prisoners? - Because they confessed.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Court. Relate what you know of the robbing Rose's house? - Between the hour of seven and eight last Wednesday was three weeks, I was going to my mother's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190030"/> house in Holborn, I met Nicholson, he asked me where I was going.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I take the liberty of submitting to your Lordship, that there is no evidence against Nicholson.</p>
               <p>Court. I hold, that it is regular to hear an accomplice in any stage of the prosecution, whether afterwards it deserves credit, will turn out upon the whole evidence, in which, to be sure, care will be taken to separate, but I cannot at present, cut the evidence to pieces in the course of the narration.</p>

               <p>Kendrick. We went up Brook-street, and went to the Barley-mow in Gray's-Inn Lane; coming up Holborn, we met Francis Hill at the corner of Gray's-Inn Lane, and he says, where are you going; says I, nowhere in particular; says he, if you will go with me down to the house where I lodge, the landlord is out of the way, and we can break open the place and get all the property out; I asked this Nicholson whether he was agreeable to go, and he said yes, and all three of us went as hard as we could down to the house; when we came there, there is a kind of a yard about three yards from the street-door that goes in with a little gate-way, and this Hill told us to stop there while he went to enquire whether the landlord was at home; he went upstairs and came down again, and said, no, there is nobody at home, let us go in, and immediately all three of us went up to the parlour door, the lower part, and we all three of us shoved the door open by the force of our hands.</p>
               <p>Was the door only put too, or locked? - It was fast.</p>
               <p>How did you get the door open? - By the force of our hands, but I could not see then whether the lock was broke; afterwards, says I, we want a candle; Hill went up immediately to Cadwell and says, have you got any candle, no, says she, have you got the parlour door open; says he, come down stairs and he (meaning me) will give you a halfpenny to buy a candle; she came down stairs and I gave her one, and she felt in the dark; it was a new halfpenny by the roughness; she said it was a bad one, and I gave her another, then she returned with a candle and she came into the yard and said, here is the candle, do you want it lighted, and Hill said, what do we want with a candle if it is not lighted, and she went over the way and lighted it, and came and gave it to Hill; she went up stairs; then we all three went into the room and shut the street door, and the parlour doors, then we opened the drawers and took out all the property that is mentioned in the indictment; I packed them up in three bundles; after we packed them up in three bundles, we packed one up in this, Nicholson's apron, and another in a black petticoat; I cannot tell what the third was packed in; we each took a bundle and called Cadwell to take the candle, and I said to her, put one of these bundles in your apron and come along with us; she declined doing that, but took the candle, and told us to wait a few minutes at the bottom of the stairs; the other two men went out, and I waited a few minutes for her coming down, and she did not come down, and I went away and pulled the street door after me, then we carried the property into Leather-lane and into Holborn, and we went to a coach that was in the rank, and put the property in, and carried it to the Windmill-inn, in St. John's-street, Smithfield, and sold the property for thirty-six shillings to one Mrs. Carter that lives up in the gallery; after we had sold it, I happened to put a silk handkerchief that belonged to some part of the property, in my coat pocket; coming down Snow-hill, I felt in my pocket, and said, here is a silk handkerchief that belongs to part of the property; Nicholson said, go in and pawn it; I declined it, and he went in and pawned it at one Mr. Cordey's on Snow-hill, for eighteen pence; and he came out and brought out three six-pences, and he gave us six-pence apiece and kept six-pence himself, and we went to Holborne and we met Cadwell, and we asked her to have something to drink; we told her where we were going, to the Barley-mow, and she came in half an hour, and the landlord would not let her in, he gave her a glass of gin, and she went out, and we never saw nothing of her till she was apprehended; after that we sat there and had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190031"/> some stakes and beer, and we thought it time to come away; I still had the money in my pocket the things were sold for, and going towards Drury-lane, there was a tallow-chandler's shop open; there was a candle in the window, and they desired me to give each of them their share, and I took out the money by the light of the candle, and gave each his share; then we went down Drury Lane and had a pot of beer and smoked a pipe; then we all agreed to go to Nicholson's lodgings, in Baldwin's Gardens; we all went there, and went to bed; the next morning we got up and went to a public-house, and had some purl, and so it passed for three or four days, till Sunday came, then I was apprehended in bed.</p>
               <p>Where was your home? - No. 12, Ely-Court, Holborn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Kendrick, you tell this story as easily as a man can read a chapter in the bible, as if it was to your honour; how long have you been engaged in this business? - About a twelvemonth, as far as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Is it not more than a twelvemonth since you was taken up with Berwick Mayton? - He was capitally convicted for privately stealing, I was neither a witness or anything else.</p>
               <p>How often have you been in custody since? - I cannot tell, that is an odd question to ask.</p>
               <p>You are as often in custody as out? - No, not quite, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Give a random guess, we will not quarrel for a dozen times? - I cannot give no random guess, I may have been once taken up or so by a warrant.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that you have been much oftener at Bow-street than once? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you never been a witness against your accomplices? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you keep that handkerchief on purpose for them to pawn it? - It was all a random affair, I did not like to go into that shop.</p>
               <p>Why did not you like to go into Mr. Cordey's? - I declined doing it, I had no reason.</p>
               <p>Was not your reason for not going in, that they might not be evidence against you.</p>
               <p>Who proposed going to Mrs. Carters? - We all know the place because Nicholson, I believe, had never been employed in any such thing before dealt had been about six months.</p>
               <p>A ready receiver for anything you carried to her? - I believe so, I believe she does in case we have anything of that kind to give her, I never sold her none.</p>
               <p>You only deal in this sort of way? - I do not know what sort.</p>
               <p>I suppose if there had been any plate in the house it would have been all the same? We should not have left it behind, Mrs. Carter lives there now, if she was not left behind, I did not squeak after I was taken, I stood out a week, and then I should not have squeaked if it had not been for other people, I thought this woman would have done it,

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Cordy, I have the handkerchief which was taken the 28th of September in the name of Jackson, I do not know the person that brought it.</p>
               <p>Did you take it? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Where is your master? - He is at home.</p>
               <p>Is that your practice to take in things without making any memorandum who takes them; how many people are there in your shop? - Three, two of us take in the things; there are so many persons we see in a day it is impossible to know one single person.</p>
               <p>That I grant you, but you might put in a memorandum upon it? - Sometimes I take them in, and sometimes the other man, and if we are busy, we tell the boy to write the bill.</p>
               <p>Court. The trade must be suppressed if it is carried on in that manner, it is making the pawnbrokers shops, a nursery for thieves? - Mr. Cordey sent me voluntarily to come.</p>
               <p>Jackson. My Lord, I went to tell them to come voluntarily, or if not, I should take out a summons.</p>
               <p>Court. It is very easy to make the initial letter of the person's name that takes in the things, then you would always know? - We lent eighteen pence upon the handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Describe the situation of your warehouse, and how it is connected with your house? - The warehouse is in a yard, of which the wall joins the Excise-office, it is the partition wall over the warehouse and my bed-room; there is a gateway from the street, separate from the door of the house, where the carriage part of my warehouse business is transacted, my parlour is part of the old South-sea House, and the rooms that are over that parlour are not mine, they are lodgings belonging to the South Sea-house, my two compting-houses run from that parlour likewise, making part of the South-sea House a door to the South-sea yard, and to that door people come through a gate in the South Sea-house; this, gate is common to me with Mr. Grindall; he has for a long series of years had recourse to that yard, and his coachman had a key; there is an access<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190034"/> to my warehouse door through my kitchen, but that is only relative to my family, there is no communication between any part of my house and the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Court. How is this warehouse held? - It goes with the lease; there is a gate way as I have told you, and over that gateway there is a dressing-room which joins to this bedroom where I sleep, and all the rest of the house is drawing-rooms, and so on, which run into one another; I was out of town when this robbery was committed, I came to town on Monday morning, I had lost a bale of Piedmont silk, B.B.C.No.7, consigned to me from Messrs. Bruisset and Co. of Turin; it was sent to me to be disposed of with eleven other bales; it came to me for 200 weight of Turin, that is always delivered in here for 160 lb.</p>
               <p>What might be the value of it? - From 260 l. to 270 l. this is my own-ware-house, nobody has any concern in it, and nobody has a right to go into it unless the people of my own house.</p>

               <p>What gate do you mean? - The gate that goes into the yard where the warehouse is; the gate at that time was open; I saw the little door open, and I went and knocked at the door, and my fellow servant let me in with a light, I told her there were three men at the gate, and we looked and saw the warehouse-door open; I went to the Rose and Crown and got two porters; they looked all about and they saw nobody; we could not tell what was missing that night till Mr. Close come; the next morning he came and looked over the warehouse, and said there was a bale of silk gone; when I went out for the porters, I did not perceive any man, I ran out in a hurry, I did not take notice; it was not so dark when I came home first but I saw the men.</p>
               <p>Should you know their persons again? - No, the two men at the gate appeared to me to be dressed in dark coloured cloth, and one a shortish man.</p>

               <p>Is that a usual communication to the house, or do they go by Broad-street? - They come by the front door, because the little gate is always locked at dusk, that surprised me and made me ask who was there.</p>

               <p>Mr. Morgan. He is an accomplice</p>
               <p>Court. Have you the record of any conviction against him?</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. My objection is, that in a capital case like this, this man is an accomplice, and is so acknowledged, and has been stated to the Jury as an accomplice by Mr. Silvester in the opening, thefore, I apprehend your lordship will not examine him.</p>

               <p>Court. An accomplice is by law a competent witness, the credit of his testimony is to go to the Jury, that is a rule of discretion that always prevails with Juries upon the ground of common sense, that that accomplice should not have credit unless his testimony is supported; I hold it the most satisfactory way to receive the testimony of the accomplice in the first instance, in order to introduce the circumstances that gave him credit; I can conceive thousands of circumstances that would not be evidence till the evidence of the accomplice is heard.</p>

             and Dan. East came into the yard and asked me for the key of the gate, which I gave them, that might be four, five, or six days after, I will not be certain which; I gave them to Storer, he asked me if I could give him a piece of clay or wax, I told him I could not, he then picked up a turnip and cut it and laid a piece of writing paper on it, and took off the impression of the key upon the paper, and then said Dan. let us go away.</p>
               <p>What did he do with the key? - He gave it to me again.</p>

               <p>When did you see any of the prisoners again? - Some time after, about a fortnight, I saw Beaman and Storer; they came to me into the stable, and frequently took me to the cellar, under the excise office, to drink, but we never sat down there; they brought a key that opened the wicket gate; they desired me to unlock that lock, which I did; it went very hard; they came again, and brought a key, and asked me to draw Mr. Grindall's chariot before Mr. Teissier's warehouse door, and Beaman told me to draw the chariot before the warehouse door, that he might have an opportunity of taking the marks of the lock, that he might not be seen putting in the key to prevent suspicion as there was so many windows, I told him I could not think of doing any thing of the kind, as I never used to put it there; they went away again, and they came again; Beaman came again, and brought a key with wax upon it, and put it into the warehouse of Mr. Teissier's; he then tried it, and said, it was a very good lock, the wax took the impression of the wards of the lock; then he said it was a very good lock, and took the key, and all away with him; a little while afterwards they came to me, and desired to know when it would be best for the warehouse to be done, I told them on Saturday, by reason I should be out of town with my master, the day of the month I do not know; the warehouse was done<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190036"/> on the Saturday evening, I came home about nine; when I came home the alarm was given to me that Mr. Teissier's warehouse was broke open, I heard that at the Rose and Crown, where the key of my stable was left.</p>
               <p>How soon after the Saturday evening did you see any of the prisoners at the bar? - The Sunday following, between nine and ten; then I saw

               <p>Were any of the others present at that time? - No.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - Beaman said, when I went in, that he, with some others, had got into the warehouse of Mr. Teissiers, and had taken away one bale of silk.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you where they went to? - - No.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you how they went? - He said they took one bale of silk away in a coach, which they had provided for the same, and there were such and such men with them, it is not right for me to mention their names; and he said there was fourteen pounds five shillings and six-pence coming to me, which he paid me all in light money, which I objected to; he then said, if they did not go he would change them for me, I owed some of the money, and I paid some of it, and he changed me one of the guineas; he said they had done no more than one bale; they were prevented by a woman coming in at that wicket gate, and calling the coachman, and finding no coachman, she went to the back gate, and that disturbed them; and that woman saw three of them, and one of them in a white apron; I saw Beaman afterwards, he told me I was indebted to him two shillings and six pence for my share of lumbering the silk, nobody was present but him and his wife.</p>

            , I will swear that.</p>
               <p>I understand you say you have lived as coachman with Mr. Grindall? - Yes, about four months.</p>
               <p>Where did you live before? - I drove the Shrewsbury coach before.</p>
               <p>How long ago was it when you drove the Oxford coach? - I never drove the Oxford coach.</p>
               <p>Do you remember driving any coach in which there was a little accident of a parcel being lost? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you remember being in custody on charge of stealing a parcel? - No, never in my life; I defy all the world to say I ever was before a justice or a court; I never was in custody for stealing a parcel from any coach of which I was the driver, or of any other coach; I came from prison here, I cannot tell the day I went to prison, it was on a Thursday after the 3d of September, about a fortnight.</p>

               <p>Do you mean to swear that upon oath? - I do.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - I will.</p>
               <p>What! you never perhaps heard of such thing? - I never was in a court in my life, if I suffer along with the prisoners I will say nothing but what is truth.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say likewise that you do not know the reward that was advertised by Teissier? - Yes, I know that reward, but that is not to me, it is for apprehending and taking.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190037"/>How did you know that such a reward was offered? - By seeing it in the Public Advertiser.</p>

               <p>The reward is one hundred and fifty pounds on conviction, and two hundred pounds more if full information should be given to the satisfaction of the Jury; is that so? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do not you know at this moment that a greater reward is to be given if a full plump round story is told than merely if you come to give evidence? - I will say no to that; I do not swear out of fee or reward; I do not swear to take the men's lives away for the reward.</p>
               <p>Why did not you discover the robbery the next morning? - Because I was in danger of my life; I was afraid of being shot; I put it off six weeks, and told them I would have nothing to do with it till they forced me to do it; I was apprehended before I made any discovery.</p>
               <p>What were you taken up for? - Upon suspicion of having been concerned in this robbery.</p>
               <p>Then it was you gave the information you are reciting now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you mention the commission of this robbery as a thing easy to be done by other persons besides the prisoners at the bar; mind the answer, and mind the question, if you do not answer that question, as I think you ought, I will give you a name to put you in recollection? - No, Sir, I never did.</p>
               <p>You swear that you never have had any conversation about the commission of this robbery previous to the time of its being committed, except with the prisoners at the bar? - I never had.</p>
               <p>Had you no conversation of that kind with a man of the name of Bray? - I had not.</p>
               <p>You fixed on Saturday, as most convenient for effecting this robbery? - I did.</p>
               <p>You say in your evidence, that one of the prisoners picked up a piece of turnip, and cut it, and put some writing paper upon it, and took the impression off the key, and then said, Dan let us go, did you see the impression? - I gave the key, and saw the impression taken of, I never looked at the paper.</p>
               <p>How can you tell that any impression was made? - Because he looked, and said this will do.</p>
               <p>Then you saw a piece of paper put on the turnip; you say that one of the prisoners demanded something for lumbering the goods? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do not you understand that term? - I do not.</p>
               <p>You could not conceive what it meant? - I could not.</p>
               <p>You did not give him the half-crown? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>What, you gave him the half crown for lumbering without knowing what it was? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did you make your information? - Before Justice Blackborough five days after I was committed, about seventeen days after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You was not the apprehender of any of these persons? - No.</p>

               <p>I am a Hackney coachman, on the 3d of September, I was at the stand at Corn-hill, about a quarter after eight, I was hired by a man, I should know him I dare say.</p>
               <p>Look about? - I cannot say I see the man here.</p>
               <p>Look about you? - No, I do not see the man here as I know of.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen the man since? - No, Sir, never.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see him before? - I cannot say, I may have seen many people before.</p>
               <p>Did you never see the man that called you that night? - Never before or since, I was hired by a man, he took me to Broad-street, he went on the coach box, nobody was in the coach at that time.</p>
               <p>What part of Broad-street? - The corner of a court, I cannot say I know the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190038"/> name of the court, there is a fruiterer's shop at the corner.</p>
               <p>How near is that to the Excise-office? - Close to it, almost opposite to it; when I had been there about two minutes, the man came to me, and ordered me down Winchester-street, I went down about four doors on the left hand, the man on the box went over the way to speak to two men that were standing by the Excise-office rails.</p>
               <p>Is that near the gate-way? - The Excise-office gate is very nigh it, I stopped there on the left hand, and waited there about a quarter of an hour, I was feeding my horses and somebody came and put something into my off door, and shut up the door again, and the man that was on the box before got up again, and told me to drive down London-wall, down Coleman-street, up the Old Jury, down Queen-street, down Thames-street, then to Puddle-dock, to the White Bear.</p>
               <p>Who keeps that house? - One Mr. Nodes.</p>
               <p>When you came to the White Bear, what did you do? - The man got off the box and he opened the door, and I got off the box to let the man out with something that they had in the coach it seemed to be a bale of something, but I did not know what it was, I helped to carry it in, and the other two men, we had a glass of brandy in the bar, it was put in, and they ordered me to turn about, then two men came out and ordered me to drive into Widegate-alley, Bishopsgate-street, we stopped at the corner of Catherine Wheel-alley, and staid there about half an hour, then they came back to me in company with a third, they all got into the coach, then we went back to Nodes's, and I stopped at the door about a quarter of an hour, I went into the house, and I asked them if they were going to discharge me, they said no, they should want me again.</p>
               <p>What were they doing in the house? - I cannot say, they were busy among themselves; these three men were by themselves, and another man in the back room with them.</p>
               <p>What had they with them? - They had the bale withinside Mr. Nodes's bar, when they went in they asked me to lend them a knife, I told them yes; they cut the ropes and things, and threw them, as I think, into Mr. Nodes's bar.</p>
               <p>What was in the bale? - I do not know, it was somewhat, they shewed it about, I cannot tell what it was, it appeared to me to be yellow, but I could not distinguish the colour, it being dark.</p>
               <p>Was it this colour? - I cannot say, they had plenty of candles, but it is hard to discern such a colour at night-time, then they took a brown bag out of the coach, and put the contents of the bale into the bag, and put the bag into the coach again, and I carried them to Wentworth-street, Petticoat-lane.</p>
               <p>Who went there? - Two people.</p>
               <p>Only two? - Only two, then they took it out and went away, and told me to wait till they returned, they were gone, I suppose a quarter of an hour, when they came back they ordered me to drive to Mr. Nodes's, which I did, then they said, come in and take your fare, and I had a glass with them, I was there the value of ten minutes, and they gave me six shillings, and discharged me; the second time I was in the house ten minutes, and the first time when I gave them the knife to cut the package, I was seven or eight minutes; there were seven or eight people in the back room; I do not know any one of them.</p>
               <p>Look about and see if you know them? - As I am upon my oath I do not know any body there.</p>

            , the coachman, and East, came in at the side door; they brought in a large bundle, they put it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190039"/> down on the outside of the bar, in about a quarter of an hour Beaman came in and joined company with them.</p>
               <p>Did they take their bundle into the parlour with them? - No Sir, they left it at the outside of the bar, it was a large bundle as big as a sack, the package was a kind of package such as they pack cloth in, of coarse cloth, it was tied with a rope, they staid after Beaman came in some time, but Vandeput and Storer went away in the same coach; they were gone about half an hour; they came back and brought a person with them whose name is Farmer, and they went into the parlour; Beaman and the other continued there after the others came back, here was a skain of silk produced in that parlour which I heard them say was taken out of that bundle.</p>
               <p>Court. Who said it came out of that bundle? - The four prisoners; it was of a yellowish colour to the best of my knowledge; it was candle-light, but something of that colour; I heard some conversation that Mr. Farmer had agreed to give half a guinea a pound for it.</p>
               <p>What did they do after that? - Then they returned and cut the cords on the outside of the package, and put it in a large bag which they had in the coach, some of the cord they took away and some they left behind, and that they desired me to burn; there were three of them went away in the coach, Mr. Farmer followed the coach, and East went home a little in liquor; he did not go in the coach.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt in point of certainty that these are the men? - These are the men that were in my parlour, all four of them.</p>
               <p>You, I believe, did not observe the marks on the package? - I did not, I afterwards saw some of the prisoners at Bridewell, that was Storer and East; they asked me if any thing had transpired, I said nothing that I knew of; they asked me who told me they were there, I said Mrs. Beaman, then came in a person that whispered them, and they told me the subject of that whisper was, that nothing could affect them.</p>
               <p>Had you at any subsequent time any conversation with Beaman after this robbery was committed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was that? - He shewed me two picklock keys that he said did the business; they were large keys, as big as street-door keys.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. Where did you come from just now? - Out of the room just by.</p>
               <p>That will not answer my question; where have you resided now, for a few days before you came here to-day? - In New Prison; I have been there almost a month.</p>
               <p>Perhaps on this account? - Yes, I fancy so.</p>
               <p>Where is your home that you have now? - At Puddle Dock; I lived there about two months; I kept the Gentleman and Porter in Ball-lane, Spital-fields.</p>
               <p>There are no thieves thereabouts? - That was the reason I left it.</p>
               <p>What! because it was an honest neighbourhood? - Because it was not; I lived there about a year and three months.</p>
               <p>You had not the good luck to be prosecuted during the time you lived there for harbouring thieves? - I never had a word said to me; I always kept the house quite clear before that; I kept the Little Lion in the Borough; I never was inside this place before in my lifetime.</p>
               <p>I am very sorry you was not here a long time ago; when they brought this bale and put it down, did you know them before that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was either of them in the silk way? - I knew but very few in the silk way.</p>
               <p>Did any of the prisoners deal in silk? - - Not that I know of; I have seen them all before, but not often.</p>
               <p>Did not you know that not one of them had anything to do with silk? - Not before it was brought to my house; I did not know anything of any of their businesses.</p>
               <p>Now, you have been telling us about the ropes, and the outward case being cut, who cut them? - I did not cut them.</p>
               <p>Who did? - The prisoners.</p>

            , they brought in a bundle, and put it on the outside of the bar, it was marked B. B. C. in a round ring, two B's at the top, and a C. at bottom.</p>
               <p>Was it in that form? - Yes, they called for some brandy and water, and went into the parlour, and Mr. Beaman came after and joined company with them, then they unpacked it, and put the contents of it into a brown bag, I was in the bar and saw them do it, and they took it away in a coach.</p>
               <p>Are you sure these are the men? - I am sure as to their persons.</p>
               <p>Mr. James. I suppose you have a perfect recollection of all that passed? - No, Sir, I did not hear all that passed, I was in the bar, they did cut the ropes the outside of the bar, and put it into a brown bag.</p>
               <p>Did you see anything likewise of the burning of the bands? - They left them behind, I burnt them, they were of no use, I could not cut off the knots.</p>
               <p>Was that the only reason why you burnt them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now, pause a little, recollect, if you mean to say so seriously upon your oath? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You mean to swear that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you do it of your own accord, or had you any directions for doing it? - They said they were good for nothing.</p>
               <p>Did they say any thing else? - They did not desire they should be burnt, as I recollect.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with your husband on the subject? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Did he happen to see the burning of the bands? - Yes, after they were flung on the fire; he did not say any thing to it, he did not think they were of any consequence.</p>
               <p>Therefore you burnt them as you would do any other cords? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What part of the house were they in? - The parlour; my master and mistress served them, I did not; I saw a kind of stain of silk like orange colour, that came out of that package.</p>
               <p>Was it like this? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did they do with this package as you call it? - They cut off the outside package and the ropes.</p>
               <p>What became of them? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What became of the inside? - They took a brown bag out of the coach and put the bundle into it, then they put it into the coach, and the coachman went away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. Did you go to the coach with them? - No.</p>
               <p>You staid in the tap-room? - Yes, to wait on the customers, I did not go out with the men when they took the bag, nor when they fetched the bag.</p>
               <p>Then how came you to say that they took it out of a coach? - Because the tap-room door stood open and I saw them take it out.</p>
               <p>What covering was it in? - Straw colour.</p>
               <p>A piece of cloth? - Yes, pretty large.</p>

               <p>Did you hear any thing said about burning? - No, my mistress told me she burnt the large outward wrapper as well as the bands; I do not know the names of all the prisoners, I know the name that one is called by, but I do not know that it is his name, his name is

               <p>What oars were missing? - Oars marked one and two; on Monday morning I missed the oars, and I enquired at several pair of stairs for them; they were fastened to the boat by a chain, and I pulled at the lock to see if it was fast.</p>
               <p>Whose boat was this? - Mr. Roberts's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. And if you lose any, you are answerable to Mr. Roberts for his oars? - Not that I know of.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; about three weeks ago I went to the prisoner's, there I found a pair of oars.</p>
               <p>Did you go to search for these oars? - Not particularly for them.</p>
               <p>How came you to take them? - I had them described; I found them in the prisoner's yard; there is a sort of pent-house goes over them; the house is in a place called Brewer's Yard, Shadwell, about forty yards off the river; these are the oars that I found there; they were at the top of the pent-house; they were put over the necessary, the broad arrow is plain upon them; they laid as all watermen lay their oars; not covered at all; I found them on the 4th of October; but I had information from Mr. Wall three or four days before.</p>
               <p>You went there and he was sent for? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was he sent for or not? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Who came back with him? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did not you see the little girl that assists in the family come back with him? - I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Roberts's name I see now is upon these cars, burnt in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He is one of the greatest boat builders in town? - I believe he is.</p>
               <p>To Selby. Are these the oars that you left in the house that night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Were they in the same state when they were lost as they now are? - There was none of this plaining then.</p>
               <p>Is the plaining over the name? - Yes.</p>
               <p>(The oars deposed to by Mr. Roberts.)</p>
               <p>Mr Garrow. Now as to that mark at the further end of the oars may it not have been worked out? - No Sir, it is plained out.</p>
               <p>Cole. He said he found these oars in the river, and brought them home.</p>
               <p>Did he not say he expected them to be advertised? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not the prisoner say at the Justice's that he had a witness that saw him pick them up? - I did not hear that, I heard the Justice say, if he had any witnesses for his defence they were to come for that to another court, but I did not see any witness there.</p>

               <p>What is the man's name that saw you pick them up? - He is a foreigner and belongs to Norway, I do not know his name, it was a very odd name, he is gone to the West Indies in a ship named the Hope;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190045"/> when the girl came and fetched me, she said that four runners wanted me, I came home directly, they asked me whose these oars were, I told them they were mine till I got an owner, says he, I have got an owner, and I will send you away for this.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Was it locked? - I cannot be particular, I wore the sattin waistcoat, which I have since found, on the Sunday before; the prisoner had been breeding a disturbance, and I went to look at my clothes, and three waistcoats were missing; I did not see them put there; in the evening, when the two young men came from work, that is, the prisoner and another that lodged with him, my wife enquired about the waistcoats, he said he knew nothing of them, my wife then told him that we could suspect no other person but one of them two, and we begged them to get another lodging; the other young man went away, and sometime in the week following the prisoner took another lodging; I forbid him the house, and he did not come there for some months, about six weeks after that a gentleman that is present wore one of my waistcoats in my house; my wife first saw it, and said it was very much like my waistcoat, and the gentleman was very angry, and soon after left the house; it had some gold edging put round it after it went from me; about six weeks ago I saw the waistcoat again on this gentleman's back at my house that I now live in, in Dean-street, Fetter-lane; upon this we suspected the prisoner; this gentleman's name is Egan; I met him again in Sydney's Alley; I saw him have the waistcoat on; I asked him to drink a pint of beer; says I, George, you have used me very ill; you have worn that waistcoat out; that is mine, he said I do not know it was yours,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190052"/> but it was some time after I had it he said that the prisoner gave him the duplicate; he went and took it out of pawn, then I thought it was not safe for me to mention it in the street with him, for fear he should go out, and I went to Mr. Hyde's, which is just by, and brought an officer to take Egan up, then he swore Maxwell gave him the duplicate; the waistcoat had been scoured, there was a mark in it, but the mark is gone, here has been a mark put in it since, that is, K. J.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Why did not you detect this waistcoat when you first saw it? - Because there was some gold lace upon it, and I was not sure of it; since I have seen it a second time I have been informed of it, there was one Conner who lodges in the garret, and Egan swore before the Justice that he asked the prisoner how he came to let him have a waistcoat that he did not come honestly by, and the prisoner told him he had the duplicate from Conner.</p>
               <p>How do you know that is your waistcoat? - There was a mark in it, but it is now out.</p>
               <p>Jury. There is no mark in it, it is a common pattern.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was marked with an R. with common ink, with a pen.</p>

            , I am now out of place, I have left him about three months about December, 1783, I was one day at dinner at the gate in Stafford-street, where the prisoner was, and the prisoner came out of doors; it was a very wet day; his foot slipped, he fell down, and dirtied himself very much, I took him home with me, and I sent him some clean clothes to put on, he was so very dirty.</p>
               <p>Did you live with any body then? - I did not, he slept at my lodgings that night, the next morning, when he was going to put on his clothes, he told me, if I would accept a duplicate of a silk waistcoat he had in pawn he would make me a present of it, he gave me the duplicate; it was three months after before the waistcoat was taken out of pawn, then I took it out, as near as I can recollect, it came to seven shillings; it was not a new waistcoat; it was a very good one; there was a taylor with me when I took it out of pawn, and I happened to have some gold binding by me, and I had it put round to make it look smarter; about six weeks after I went to the prosecutor's house in Saint James's-street; Mrs. Rodden came into the parlour where I was, and said, that waistcoat looks very much like one my husband had stolen from him; I found myself somewhat confounded, and I told her she behaved very rude; and the first time I met the prisoner afterwards I asked where he got that waistcoat that he had given me the duplicate of.</p>
               <p>What name was it pawned in? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>How came you to keep the duplicate so long? - I was out of place, and it was not convenient to me to take it out of pawn before.</p>
               <p>Jury. When the waistcoat was challenged, did they say there was a mark? - No, nor I never observed any mark upon it; the prisoner said he had the duplicate of a young man that is here, whose name is Conner, and I will venture to say there never was a mark on this waistcoat in this world with ink; I had the waistcoat, and wore it, and went into the prosecutor's house, I dare say forty times, with the waistcoat on, and they never claimed it; after that, I may say with truth, I have been there an hundred times.</p>
               <p>Was your coat open? - Yes, twenty times, an hundred times; after his wife said it was like his, she came afterwards and asked my pardon, she said the ground of it was a lighter green than that which her husband had lost.</p>
               <p>Was the husband by at the time? - Yes, I heard nothing transpire concerning the waistcoat for a year and an half; but about five weeks ago I went into the prosecutor's house again, the waistcoat had got greasy, and the lace was tarnished; I took it off and had had it scowered, when I went in this time the prosecutor's wife said it was very<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190053"/> much like her husband's: I said I had the duplicate, I took it out of pawn: I met the prosecutor in Sydney's alley, and I had the waistcoat on, and he asked me to have a pint of porter; he said George you use me extremely ill concerning the waistcoat; says I, I had the duplicate of the waistcoat of Maxwell; he wanted somebody to fetch a peace officer; I said I would go to any Justice he thought proper; he left me in the house, and went down to Justice Hyde's; Justice Hyde gave an order for apprehending the prisoner, I went with a peace officer, and the prisoner was taking a glass of punch with some friends, where they had a dinner; I asked the prisoner if he recollected giving me a duplicate of a waistcoat; he said yes, he got the duplicate from Conner, and in consequence of that he was committed.</p>

               <p>How long have you known Eagan? - Between three and four years.</p>
               <p>Long, before this time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Eagan. Had you seen Conner from the first time your waistcoat was claimed till it was taken from you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him about the duplicate? - I did, and he said he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Conner. I wanted to go with Eagan to search for the prisoner, at the same time, Eagan desired I would mention nothing of it, as he thought there would be no more about it.</p>
               <p>Eagan. I said it would only bring us into trouble, and I beg you will say no more about it, I do not want to have any piece of work about it; there was one particular I forgot to mention concerning the pawnbroker, when the prisoner was brought before Justice Hyde the pawnbroker was sent for that the waistcoat was pawned with, the prosecutor was present, he was asked by Justice Hyde did he know any thing of the waistcoat, he said no he did not, for he had fifty of those waistcoats in the course of a month, and it is impossible to tell one waistcoat from another.</p>
               <p>Court to Eagan. What became of the prisoner, has he been always to be seen, and always in the way? - Yes, I never knew he was out of the way ever since I first knew him in London, which is between two and three years.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have met him accidentally, he has been once or twice in the house afterwards, I never said anything to him after he left the house.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Does the prisoner owe you anything? - Yes, he does, four or five shillings.</p>
               <p>Eagan. You told me nine shillings, the other day.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It may be so; I told him if he would go out of the house I would never ask him for a shilling.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever ask him for this money since? - No.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I lodged in this house, there was a great resort of vagabonds, I and another young man that worked with me remained there about a fortnight or three weeks, they continually had speaking clubs of chairmen and all sorts; we did not approve of the lodging, and so we left it; the prosecutor said, what fault have you to find with your lodgings; I said, we are disturbed, we cannot get up in time to our work; his wife said, she was sorry we were going: you will find my character good, I know nothing of the waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Court. Did they voluntarily leave your house, or did you make them leave it? - I made them go.</p>
               <p>Conner. I never knew the man more than seeing him at a public house, we had a pint of beer, I was in the hospital at the same time, and there was very little hopes of my recovery; he was told that I never should come out; I afterwards went to Dover, to the Royal Hotel, and lived there about two months; I went from thence to Ireland for seven months, with a gentleman, and on my return to this kingdom<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190054"/> the waistcoat was talked of again, and I said it was a very hard case, Eagan came to me five days after I left the hospital.</p>
               <p>Did you ever give the prisoner a duplicate? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ever pawn a silk waistcoat? - No; I desired Eagan to come directly with me, to go to the prisoner to know whether he would say so before my face; no, says he, I will not, drop it; I went to the hospital about a fortnight or three weeks after this affair happened, I was very bad.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>On Sunday morning I was coming from the vestry clerks, near Charing-cross, on my return I met this gentleman, he asked me his way to Lime-street; I said, I would shew him, I walked with him to the end of Lime-street, then he asked me if I knew where he could get something to drink, I said, there was a public house at the corner, he wished some brandy and water, I condescended to go along with him, I told him I should rather not drink, he pressed me several times to drink; I said, if I did drink any thing, it must be white wine and bitters, he called for a gill of wine for me, and he drank the brandy and water, he went to his agent's, and I had a second gill of wine, then he produced a letter, where there was a woman's address, that lived at a hair-dresser's, in Glanville-street, going along it rained, he went into a public house, and called for pen, ink and paper, wrote a letter or two, then he drank some white wine and water, then he went to No. 13. in George-street, where there were two or three women, I waited sometime in the passage, I sent him several messages, at last a woman opened the door to me, and the Captain was laid on the bed with his clothes on, and a woman by the side of him, I waited ten minutes longer, he then seemed to be at a loss, where to go, I told him that I had some roast veal at home that day, and he was extremely welcome to dine with me; he called for a coach, and drove to that gentleman's house, in Goudge-street, then he introduced me up stairs, and introduced a decanter of brandy, I was quite intoxicated, prior to this I gave him my address, and there he found me; the woman of the house I presume is here, who can support every thing I say respecting of this; I came home, and as soon as I came home, I was immediately put to bed: I found when they left me in the room at the prosecutor's house, there was a female child left in the room with me, how I came by this property, I do not know, the Captain went and deserted me, and laid on his own bed, and how I got home I cannot tell; here are several respectable characters who have known me twenty years, and never knew me guilty of the smallest thing, till this unfortunate affair; when they came to charge me with this matter, these gentlemen had both been in the room a considerble<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190063"/> time before I came to my senses, they drew out all my clothes, in consequence of that I searched my pockets, I immediately resigned them to that gentleman; from nine in the morning, or thereabouts, I had been drinking brandy and wine and bitters, till he was so drunk, he was obliged to go to bed in his boots, and it was not extraordinary that I should be drunk.</p>

               <p>Court. Do you desire Mr. Stoughton should be asked in what manner the spoons were produced? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have related it already; immediately as the Captain had told him about the spoons, he began to laugh, the Captain said he would not be laughed at, he said I have none, he immediately jumped out of bed, opened a chest of drawers, put in his hand, whether in a pocket or not I do not know, and produced the spoons; then he downed on his knees, and begged pardon, and hoped I would not prosecute him.</p>

               <p>The prisoner lodged with me, he was strongly recommended to me by a person that had known him a many years; he came home at night intoxicated in liquor, which I never saw him before, between ten and eleven the prosecutor and another gentleman came and knocked at the door, and asked if Ford did not live there, I said, yes, I said, I believed they were both in bed; they desired me to go up with Captain somebody's compliments, but I cannot tell his name, I went up first and knocked at the door, and the prisoner's wife is very hard of hearing, and I could not make either of them answer, I came down again and said they were both of them fast asleep; the Captain then desired me to go up with a light which I did, the prosecutor said I will wake them, after sometime his wife came to the door, and asked what the gentlemen wanted, the Captain said, Captain such an one wanted to speak with him, she said it must be a mistake; the prisoner lay on his left shoulder, the Captain to the best of my knowledge, went and shook him in this manner, and said Mr. Ford awake! he opened his eyes, and could not for sometime make out what it was, Mrs. Ford desired me to withdraw, which I did; they came down stairs soon after, when the Captain came down stairs, I said to him, Sir, I am affraid here is some eruption, what may it be; the Captain asked me how Ford behaved, I told him he was exceedingly well recommended, he came to me on the 17th day of September, that was the 9th day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. When he came to your house in the evening, do you think he had any sense of what he did? - I do not think he had, I do not from my heart, he could not get up stairs or scarce go along the passage.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. My Lord, I beg leave to trouble the Court with a few observations on the indictment; I have forbore to ask a single question of any of the witnesses, because it seems to me to be the shortest way to take your Lordship's opinion at this stage of the business: this offence, or rather the offence intending to be described in the indictment, arises on an act of parliament made in the 17th and 18th years of the late King: and from the preamble of that act coupled with the enacting clause of it, it seems to me to be clearly decisive that this indictment cannot be sustained; it recites, that many of the King's subjects have been put in great fear and danger, and that the punishment of such offenders, (that is, of offenders who assaulted the King's subjects with intent to rob, and put them in fear and danger of their lives) was not sufficient. My Lord, I am perfectly conscious that I am addressing myself to a Court that know perfectly well what is meant by assaulting and putting in fear, and that it constitutes a highway robbery; now this preamble says, this is with intention to rob; those acts of parliament therefore were not intended to protect persons from bare larcenies from the person, but were intended to meet a new species of offence, where persons with arms, or by violent menaces, or by force, which might on persons of a firm and found mind produce such terror as to cause them to part with their property, did assault the King's subjects with intent to rob; and the legislature thought that this was an offence fit to be punished in some severer sort; therefore they inflicted the sentence of transportation: then the entering clause goes on to say, that this penalty should apply to persons who should either with offensive weapons, or by menaces demand any money or goods, with felonious intent to rob, or commit robbery upon such person or persons to whom such menaces should be applied. My Lord, my objection is first, that there is no menace of the sort described by this act of parliament in this indictment.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190066"/>Court. You have dropped one part of the act of parliament, which adds</p>
               <p>"or shall by any forcible or violent manner demand" these are the words upon which the present indictment is framed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then, my Lord, in the first place I take the liberty of saving, upon this evidence it is entirely impossible for the Jury to find that there has been an assault in a forcible or violent manner; the evidence of the prosecutor was this, that he was either met or overtaken, or found himself in the way of the prisoners, and one of them made use of this expression,</p>
               <p>"money</p>
               <p>"we want, money we must have." Now I need not state to the Jury that that expression is perfectly equivocal, it is the language of threat, of menace, or the language of supplication, of indigence in the mouth of a beggar; there is no sort of pretence that this was accompanied by any force, or by any indication on the part of the person asking, that he intended to distinguish his application from that of a beggar; a man earnest for a bit of bread, might address the person of whom he fought relief by laying his hand on any part of the body, and most naturally on the shoulder of such person; But still, my Lord, I have a clear and palpable objection, because the indictment states this, and this only, because it states that it was with a felonious intent his monies from his person and against his will feloniously to steal, take and carry away; that is the description of a simple larceny. I take the liberty of observing that it was not to protect persons from simple larceny, but from that higher offence, and in order to the constitution of which, there must be a threat applied to the person from whom the money is demanded: this indictment does not state in the words of the act of parliament, that this was with intent to rob or to commit robbery; and it seems not to have been enough for the legislature to have contented itself with one expression; but left any man of less sense than all those who constitute this Court are blessed with, should mistake; the legislature seems to have been anxious to have pinned down the sense, and to have marked its meaning so, that no man could possibly mistake it, for it goes on to say,</p>
               <p>"with intent to rob, or with intent to commit robbery," marking it as contra-distinguished from an attempt to commit simple larceny. My Lord, I contend on the part of the prisoners, that it is incumbent on the prosecutor to pursue this act of parliament in its very letter; he has not done so, he has not charged that they did it with a felonious intent to commit a robbery, or that he meant to take his goods forcibly or violently: I do not mean that the indictment should necessarily have found in it, the words with a felonious intent to rob him, or to commit robbery; but this I contend, it is clearly and indispensably necessary, that upon the indictment there should be a clear and unequivocal description of an intent to commit an highway robbery: now here is a clear description of an intent to commit larceny, but I defy any man with legal notions about him to say, here is the description of a highway robbery: your Lordship knows there must be fear, or at least there should be such a personal attack upon a man that a firm man might be put in fear, and part with his property, or have it taken from him; and this indictment describes it to be with a felonious intent, feloniously to steal, take and carry away his goods; that is a clear description of larceny. My Lord, I am ashamed to have taken up the time of the Court so long, I conclude with submitting to the Court, there must be a clear designation of an intent to commit a robbery.</p>
               <p>Court. I will first leave it to the Jury, and if any doubt is entertained, I will mention it to the learned Judges, and if they entertain any doubt, the case shall be reserved. I think it would be more correct if the words by force or violence were added: as to the other point, if the Jury are of opinion the prisoners meant to beg and not to rob, I shall direct an acquittal.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I have no objection to your Lordship's purpose, and I am sure, that after what I have experienced so often of indulgence, I shall be forgiven if<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190067"/> I make this observation: I observe that the mode in which it might be attempted to reconcile the indictment to the statute is this, by taking in the whole description that might be collected out of the indictment; but I shall take the liberty of submitting to this Court, that you cannot look further back than beyond the word intent, I take it that the other is a distinct part of the offence, that is, the assault, in a forcible and violent manner, of demanding money: the other part the Jury are bound to find, namely, that it was with a felonious intent t o rob, that feloniously, and against his will, and by force, they took the goods: therefore, it seems to me as if it was impossible to couple the two parts of the indictment, so as to make up one perfect whole to satisfy the act of parliament.</p>

               <p>Court to Sharpe.

               <p>A great many of these things were given me by a porter that lived at Mr. Sharpe's, not all of them, he persuaded me to it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Raley: My Lord, I am the father of the witness Raley, a lad whom I have brought up with the greatest tenderness, I have done all I can for him, I am very sorry to see him in that situation; I wish him now to receive that reproof that may penetrate his mind, I am father of a large family, eight in number; I cannot admit him into my house, but I will put him into a place of safety up at Hoxton; I have advised him to go to sea, I will get him a birth.</p>
               <p>Court to young Raley. I am very sorry, young man, to hear this account of you from your father, you must have behaved very ill indeed; you have had great good fortune in not being yourself prosecuted, you ought to have been prosecuted, and if<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190070"/> you had, the evidence that came out to day, would have involved you in the same guilt, and the same disgrace with this unhappy young man; and I hope if you have any feelings, that his fate, and my public exhortation to you, will have some effect upon you, and that you will not go on in practices, which in all probability must bring your unhappy father with sorrow to the grave, as well as draw down certain destruction upon yourself; you will be delivered into his care, submit to that restraint that he imposes upon you, and to that course of life which he thinks fit to mark out to you, and endeavour by your future conduct to deserve that he may forget what is past, and that you may become an useful member of society.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raley the elder. I return your Lordship many thanks.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys, foreman of the Jury. My Lord, it is the wish of the Jury to recommend the prisoner to mercy, as supposing he may have been drawn in by the porter, and as that witness, young Raley, appears to have been a partaker in the guilt.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen, the thing that alarms me, is the example; because put it to your own breasts, you all carry on trades in the city of London, and you are all obliged to entrust your property to your servants: I have therefore always held a very strict hand over this particular crime, because it seems to me, as if men's property depended intirely upon never relaxing the punishment due to servants that rob their masters; now having said this to you publickly, if you still wish this boy should find favour, I for one will not oppose it, though I cannot heartily approve of it.</p>

               <p>How came you to think of your watch? - Why I suspected from this, from her hands being at my neck, to my knowledge the man never put a hand to me.</p>
               <p>Did you feel her hand at your watch, or any thing of that sort? - No, I cannot say I did, when she was dragging me down I certainly felt something move.</p>
               <p>You say the man did nothing? - Not to my knowledge, but I was so busy with the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190071"/> woman that I do not know, but however the woman had hold of me while I was robbed of my watch.</p>
               <p>Then you cannot tell whether she took it or who took it? - No, I cannot, but I am sure it was taken while she held me, and was dragging me down to the ground.</p>
               <p>What became of your friend the Jew that you had released from her? - He was standing by.</p>
               <p>Did not he help you as well as you helped him? - He was minding his goods I believe, the woman endeavoured to make her escape, and by the assistance of the man prisoner and some others, was out of the hands of the watchman, I believe twice, if not more, I caught hold of her twice, she wanted to get away, she got my thumb in her mouth, (Ah you need not laugh, the marks are here yet,) I secured her till two or three watchmen came up, I never got my watch again, it was a silver watch.</p>
               <p>Do you deal in watches? - No.</p>
               <p>What business are you? - I am a taylor in business; I do not know the maker's name of my watch, nor the number, it was to be brought to me by a person that knew it, but they have not, then the woman was searched for the watch at the watch-house, nothing was found, I am sure this

             held me while I was robbed of the watch.</p>
               <p>What was she doing to your friend when you came up? - He was shoving her off desiring her to go from his goods; they have a stall against the side of the house, with buckles, watch-chains, and keys, and different things.</p>
               <p>Court. Why did not you get out of her way? - I did not suspect I should be catched hold of and robbed, I was not afraid of my watch at first, till she almost dragged me down on the ground, she pulled me down with such despair, that caused me to suspect a robbery.</p>
               <p>Was you there by yourself without any assistance? - Not one that I knew was there; the prisoner England obstructed the watchman taking her to the watch-house, he told the people not to meddle with the woman, but to let her take her own-part, while she had hold of me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's counsel. They did not know you was a taylor? - No.</p>
               <p>The people had a mind to see a battle between you? - I do not know, but it was no battle, at least it was a disadvantageous one to me when I lost my watch; I am flee before God and my own conscience to declare that I was held by her when I lost my watch.</p>
               <p>The fact is, that you like a fool entered into a squabble with this woman, in defence of poor Mordecai, and got a good beating, and your thumb bit, and lost your watch? - His name was not Mordecai, you are mistaken there, his name is Solomon.</p>
               <p>So you came up in the Godspeed, let the Jew loose, and engaged with this Christian female; did not the people think it was good fun to see the taylor and the woman engaged together? - I am not to be brow beat, though you may suppose yourself a very wise man.</p>
               <p>- KENDRICK sworn.</p>
               <p>Saturday sevennight I was coming down the Haymarket, I was standing with Mr. Solomons the Jew, asking the price of a pair of buckles, nobody was nigh us, she came up to me and behaved very indecent, and went to the Jew and behaved so to him, and the Jew puined her away, and told her to go away about her business; then she came the second time to him, and she ran to break his glass, and he caught her hand before it came down on the glass, it was a shew glass which stands with things in at the side of the public-house; then she broke his lamp, then he asked her what she meant, and she said what are you going to kill me, rob me or murder me, she made very bad oaths, and raised a mob, and called me very bad names, then Solomon sent for the watch and charged her, then the prisoner England came up and said, gentlemen consider it is a woman, do not ill use her, that was all the words I heard him say, and the prosecutor came across over the way, then she caught hold of him, and said, you bl - y thief, you have knocked me down twice, she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190072"/> caught hold of him by the frill of the shirt, and shook him till the watchman was ringing his rattle, and I went down to seek for assistance, and I heard the prosecutor call out, I have lost my watch, I never saw the prosecutor before, when I heard the prosecutor call out I have lost my watch, I directly turned round and saw the man-prisoner stand pretty close to the woman, but I did not see him do any thing to the prosecutor, nor did I hear the prosecutor charge him with doing any thing to him.</p>

               <p>How long ago? - A good bit ago.</p>
               <p>Was it three weeks or a month, or how long? - I believe it was, my mother is a washerwoman, I was going to carry some things to Mr. Cart, No. 33, Norfolk-street in the Strand, and some things belonging to his footman; I was sent about half after six, I had knocked at the door, and somebody came and snatched the basket out of my hand; my mother gave me a particular caution before I went out, and I held them very fast all the way, but when they snatched it I was obliged to let it go; I do not know rightly the person, he was dressed in blue, I took hold of him, and held him, he had the basket, so he fell down off the curb-stone, and I fell down too, so he got up again, and took hold of the basket, and ran round the corner, and gave it to a man that stood there; they ran different ways, and I followed him that had the clothes, I cried stop thief, and a footman stopped him, so he threw down the basket and ran away; I picked up the basket and the clothes; he was not taken at that time, I took the clothes home to Norfolk-street, and by that time they had taken the man.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether the men they took were the same men? - No, Sir, I did not see his face.</p>

               <p>Who do you come to give evidence about? - Nobody; I was greatly terrified, the man that took me told me to make a confession, and they told me if I did not I should be hanged, and if I did I should go to gaol for a few days, and be admitted as an evidence, and have good victuals and drink, and a bed, and a shilling each day, and part of a great reward; after I made this confession they desired me to sign it, which I did.</p>
               <p>Who was it told you this? - The man that took me, Sears I believe his name is.</p>
               <p>Was Atkins present? - Not at the time this man told me this.</p>
               <p>How came you to confess you had been a party in the robbery? - I did not confess any further than they told me to say, they told me that if I did not I should be hanged, if I did I should receive victuals and drink, a bed, and a shilling a day, and part of a great reward; Atkins told me that this Adamson was taken, and if I did not swear to him I should be hanged; the next time they asked me if I had any money, and Atkins gave me eighteen-pence, and told me to stick to what I had said; my friends told me to tell truth, and said what a sad thing it was to tell lies, this is the truth I tell now upon oath.</p>
               <p>Court. You know you have taken an oath, you know the consequence if you speak falsly? - This is the truth, I positively swear it.</p>
               <p>Court. Let Williams be remanded to Newgate, till this matter is further enquired into.</p>
               <p>Atkins. My Lord, the other man that attended is here on purpose to explain this matter, we were not bound over.</p>
               <p>Court. I shall desire Mr. Hodgson, the short-hand writer, to make out a copy of this evidence, and give it to Mr. Shelton, that it may be sent to Sir Sampson Wright.</p>
               <p>Court to M. Dalley. I think you say that Tranter was not the man that took the basket from you? - No, it was another man.</p>
               <p>And that the man that received the basket was round the corner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. In strictness of law in this case, I think both the prisoners ought to be acquitted on this indictment, without putting them on their defence, there is no evidence whatever against Adamson, and Tranter appears to be the receiver; a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190075"/> man must be actually present, aiding and abetting to constitute him a principal.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I went to Widegate-alley, on an information which was given to Bow-street, that there was coining in a house adjoining to the prisoner Scott's, and that the way of going into that house, was through the shop, through the kitchen, and to throw up the window, and go into the adjoining cellar at the yard door, and we should find the people at work; being lame I was not so nimble as I formerly have been, and the other officers went in first, I left the prisoner in custody, and went and searched, I saw the three prisoners, the two men were without clothes, the woman without a cloak or bonnet; there were dies fixed in the press, and a quantity of blanks: I was then curious to look at the woman, and I said then, and I say now, I was sorry to see any woman in that situation, I examined the woman, and I have not a doubt -</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I must stop you, you are the last man I should stop; but I should object the same if my Lord Mayor was a witness? - I have not a doubt, Sir, but you would object to my Lord Mayor: I am sure the woman had been handling of copper.</p>
               <p>Did you examine her hands? - I did indeed, and I repeated the words to her, good woman, I am sorry for you!</p>
               <p>Were her hands dirty? - They were.</p>
               <p>Court. Were her hands black as if she had been handling copper? - There is no doubt, it is certainly a fact, there was a mark where the blanks and things had been handled.</p>
               <p>Describe in what manner this business is done? - There were three people in the cellar, they were locked up, when those springs are in, and the press runs up to the screw, it comes to its purchase, and these springs raise it up again, therefore it must require more strength than if they were in the press; here are the two dies that were fixed in the press at the time, and a quantity of blanks: there is a hole sunk in the earth, in order that the press might not come over their head, therefore they are covered in the earth, that the fly of the press might have more effect.</p>
               <p>How many people are employed at this business of coining? - The only practice that has been proved in this Court, is three, one each end of the fly, and another to feed the press.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner Johnson's Council. Do you know anything of the practice of coiners in making farthings, but by hearsay? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Then you do not mean to swear that farthings are not sometimes made by coiners without the assistance of a third person? - It is impossible for me to swear that.</p>
               <p>How were the woman's hands, dirty? - Her left hand was dirty in the palm, and all the way up.</p>
               <p>Do you remember her shewing her hands to the Magistrate, and saying they were clean? - I do.</p>
               <p>And she said that, therefore, she could not be employed in coining? - She did.</p>
               <p>Then did you say to her, your hands were dirty, but you have wiped them on your apron? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Had she any opportunity of washing her hands? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Pickering and Scott. My Lord, we are both guilty, we would not wish to give the Court any trouble, but the woman is innocent.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow My Lord, the plea varies from the record, but that is not all, it does not state by force and arms, there is a difference in the essential part of the record; the conviction set out in this plea, may be a conviction had at York.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. This is a novel prosecution, the general law of the kingdom most undoubtedly is that what is called the benefit of clergy, shall not be allowed to any man twice: in all cases of felony, excepting where it is expressly taken away by act of parliament, by the common law of the kingdom the benefit of clergy was allowed; the reason and origin of which began in times very different from the present, and when the church enjoyed very peculiar privileges as distinguished from the laity; the privilege in question, was in fact the benefit of clergy, for it was a privilege peculiar to those in holy orders; distinguished from others, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190080"/> though the punishment of the law was death to men in general, yet they had the privilege of not suffering death, in those cases where another man would: in process of time the humanity of the government, and the liberal principles of the law, extended that privilege, by fiction and implication, to all those who could read, for that was considered as a sort of test, and the question whether the culprit was a clerk or not was extended to the enquiry, whether he could read or no; so much of the original of it was retained down to the very modern period; but women were not entitled to this very valuable privilege, for it could not be presumed that they could be clerks in holy orders, and therefore women were allowed to be executed: but by acts of parliament in more modern times, the benefit of clergy, which is and ought to be, if allowed at all, allowed without distinction, and without any reference to the cause of it, was allowed to all persons who committed simple felonies, and taken away from particular offences; and the law holds it shall not be taken away by any act of parliament, even where the law says he shall suffer death, unless the words are added without benefit of clergy; so that, as the law now stands, every man found guilty of any crime from which the benefit of clergy is not taken away, shall, upon praying it have it: but the law says, that though this indulgence shall be once allowed to a man that commits a lesser felony, he shall not be repeatedly intitled to it, and that he shall not be entitled to it a second time: the prisoner Scott has been convicted by your former verdict of an offence for which he is intitled of right to demand the benefit of his clergy, and he has so demanded it by praying the benefit of the statute, to which, say they, on the part of the crown, he is in a situation that does not entitle him so that privilege, for he has received that benefit once, therefore we object to its being allowed to him another time; and they have put into court a plea, which states, that he was tried for felony, and convicted, and prayed the benefit of the statute, which was allowed him, and they say that the said

               <p>Court to Haris. What time did you buy it? - About seven.</p>
               <p>Recollect the time as well as you can? - It was some where about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Stokes. I missed my buckle between seven and eight, I missed it instantly.</p>

The prisoner Conolly came to me to know if I could make a fellow to that buckle by Saturday night, I told her it was impossible; I live a quarter of a mile off; I told her it would come to thirteen shillings; the prisoners were both in company, I would not buy it the first time they came, and they came again, and a young man with them, and said, I had no occasion to fear, for he gave them the buckle.</p>

               <p>I lost a sow pig on the 20th of September last, I saw it the same day about eleven before my door, on the outside with another, I did not miss it till night, I found the pig in Wingfield-street at the prisoner's, in the house on the further end, on the side of the bed, it was alive; I described it as a white sow, I asked him if he had such a one, he said he lost one but it was a black and white one, and had found it again, I asked him to let me look at that pig which he had, he said he would give me his word that was not the pig, I asked him to let me look at it, it was penned up in a little close place, he opened the door about half way, he said, you see the pig is not yours, immediately my white sow rushed out from behind the black and white one; it was a place parted off with some kind of laths, I did not take particular notice, it was closed off from the rest of the room, I called him a d - nd rascal, he then said it was a woman's sow, and soon after that, he said it was his own, he said he bought it of a man in a green coat, I said it was mine, and to convince him she would run home to my house, he said that was no proof, for a strange sow would run into any body's house, there was a mark in the side as if it was intended for Smithfield, he lived from me above half a mile, or three quarters; he desired me to let it rest a few days while he got the dealer he bought it of, I immediately went to the Rotation-office in Whitechapel, and brought back an officer to his house, I then offered to let it loose, and he said I should have it without that, on Monday he brought several people out of Petticoat-lane to swear to the sow, that they sold it him, strangers that I never saw in my life, I let them all look at it, and none of them would have any thing at all to do with it, but left him; I am perfectly convinced it is my sow, I have no mark, but I know it by the ring, I knew it immediately as I saw it, the sow is now at my house.</p>
               <p>By what marks do you know it? - It is all over white, except a little black over the eye, I cut the string loose, it was home five<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190088"/> minutes before me, I am sure the prisoner said he had but one pig at home, and that was black and white.</p>

               <p>Last Tuesday evening, I saw the two prisoners, I saw Rankin with a cask of butter on his shoulder, in Newgate-street, going from Cheapside; Rankin had the butter, I turned round and followed them; Rankin pitched it down by the Horse-shoe passage, Roberts helped him down with it, Rankin sat upon it, and wrapped his coat round it, the other went away towards Cheapside; I went over to Mr. Clement's, and Mr. Holmes came with me, I asked Rankin to get up that I might look at the marks, Rankin said he did not know what it was, he was left in charge; and as I was standing, Rankin struck me over the the head, and ran off, I called out stop thief! Mr. Holmes ran after him, and he was stopped and brought back, I am sure he is the same man, the other was gone; a coach came to the Horse-shoe passage to take up the butter, and the coachman asked what he was to take up, Roberts afterwards d - d his eyes, and said if ever he got clear of this, he would do for me.</p>

               <p>I found the prisoner Rankin at the end of the Horse-shoe-passage, waiting while Roberts was gone for a coach; and I followed him and saw him stopped in St. Paul's Church-yard, I am positive to the man.</p>
               <p>What became of the butter? - It was left in Newgate-street till the next day, he never was quite out out of my sight, he was then taken to Guildhall; I observed the marks.</p>

               <p>Court. In the first place let these two witnesses West and Marsh be committed to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoners. You have both of you been convicted upon very satisfactory evidence which has perfectly convinced my mind, as well as that of the Jury, of your guilt; and from the circumstances of this case, you appear to be extremely improper and dangerous men to be suffered to go at large in this country, to have an opportunity of plundering your innocent fellow citizens; it is therefore necessary for justice, and the public safety, that I should send both of you out of the country; but I think it necessary to make a distinction in your cases now, though there was none before, for I consider the guilt of Roberts as greatly aggravated by the perjured defence he has set up in a Court of justice; I have always kept a very strict watch over perjured defences set up by witnesses, and I have thought it my duty to put these witnesses into a mode of receiving the punishment they have deserved; but I have also thought it right in all cases to increase as much as the law will permit me, the punishment of those offenders who have dared to set up such a perjured defence; for the mischief of the perjury does not merely stop in the perversion of justice in that single trial in which it is produced, but it has a tendency to deprive innocent men of the benefit of that sort of testimony, and to render it suspected even if true; these sort of defences have been so frequent, that the moment they are mentioned they are looked upon with a jealous eye, both by the Court and Jury, and the consequence of which may sometimes be to pervert the truth on the other side, and to render it not worthy of that attention it might deserve.

               <p>How came you to suspect him? - Knowing his indifferent principle; he was about my house frequently, not employed by me, but he had free access to my house to eat and drink; I took him up with one Hillman, and in Hillman's pocket was a piece of flannel found, that was locked in the box that was stolen from my premises: I got a search warrant to search Scott's house; when we went there, the property was first denied by Mrs. Scott, but Mrs. Scott said that Mr. Caseley and Mr. Hillman were in the cellar with her husband, and we found in the house all the things mentioned in the indictment, the stays and cap were thrown out of the window into a gutter, and a child's bedgown and other things were thrown out of the window into the gutter.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Casley. My Lord, my wife lives with the prosecutor, she and him went out.</p>
               <p>Court. What, is she his servant? - No; he took her from me, she is my lawful wife, I have six or seven children by her, I have three children living now, it was unknown to me some time where they were, and yesterday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190093"/> was fortnight she contrived to go out with him that I should take this property, and she would follow me with the rest as soon as she conveniently could; this is a fact, this man took my wife, and her properly was in this box, which was the stays and cap and other materials; as to the spoons, that this man says were his, before ever I knew that she cohabited with this man, she brought them to the house, six months before, and said they were her property; I disposed of them to Mr. Scott as such.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What do you say to this? - What he says concerning his wife, is doing his wife a deal of injustice, he is ruining his children, I took two of them out of Shoreditch work-house, and teach them the fear of man and the fear of God.</p>
               <p>Court. But what do you keep the wife too? - Yes; do not think that I want to distress the man of a wife; no! I took that woman as a prostituted being from the street.</p>
               <p>So you took her to keep her from prostitution? - I do my Lord.</p>
               <p>Have you any children? - No; but I keep three of this man's, as they say; supposing I do live with his wife, they ought not to rob me, if I have done wrong there is a court of justice for me; these things were always in my possession, the box was mine, the punch-ladle was given me by my uncle, the linen was for the children of my first wife.</p>
               <p>What age is this woman that lives with you? - I suppose she is about thirty.</p>
               <p>She may have more children and it may be useful to keep the linen? - It will be so.</p>
               <p>How long has this woman been with you? - About two years; this man has had free access of my house, they were always as intimate as could be, as far as the cupboard, but nothing further.</p>
               <p>And so you kept these things to supply the children this woman may bring you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I suppose you know, if you convict this poor fellow of this offence he will be hanged, and you will have no more trouble? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. Let us hear no more of such a story as this; your time is too precious Gentlemen to be wasted upon such a tale as this.</p>

               <p>You are a stranger in town? - I came from Spain but I have been in England going on these two years, I was born in Spain<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190094"/> my father is English, my mother is Spanish, I was brought up among English people, I live at present in Great Saint Andrew's-street.</p>
               <p>Where had you been? - I went to see an acquaintance of mine that lived in Bird-street, I went home with the prisoner and I could not sleep all night, the prisoner spoke to me by my name, I saw her once before, she asked me to go home with her and lodge with her till morning, I was glad of it to go out of the rain, for I was all wet, and I went home with her and staid all night, in the morning I got up and I was not very well, and she said strip off all your clothes and lay down and get a sleep, you are in an honest house, I stripped some of my clothes off and kept some on, I was afraid to strip them all off, though I was not afraid of robbing me, but I thought it was not proper that I should strip.</p>
               <p>Was any body there but her and her child? - No, but I do not like a woman to strip; in the morning I did strip off my clothes, and when I fell in sleep, she left me naked all but my shift, I waked, I looked all about, I was locked in, I made myself easy, I could not keep my eyes open, I was quite heavy, and somehow I was not very well, and so at night she came home and she told me to go about my business, and turned me out in my shift, and I cried out murder, and they got blankets to cover me.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you was sober that night when you went to sleep? - I was sober enough; the constable found the clothes where they were pawned, they were found on the Tuesday, the prisoner was taken up the same night.</p>

               <p>I took the prisoner to the watch-house, and found the things at different pawnbrokers; the prisoner said she pawned them to get a breakfast; no promise was made her.</p>
               <p>The different pawnbrokers produced the things which they took in, some of the prisoner, and some of her daughter.</p>

               <p>And Mr. Wawill was very angry with the Justice for discharging them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. What complaint did you make at first to the Justice? - About this burning my handkerchief on the Monday night before, and on the Friday night following, that was the complaint I made to the Justice.</p>
               <p>You went there by the advice of Mr. Wawill? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you then not to tell the Justice of what they had done in Catherine-wheel-alley, this had happened in Catherine-wheel-alley before you went to the Justice's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And did you tell the Justice of this that had been done in the Alley when you went? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself; was not the gown that you have produced burnt in the manner it is by what they did in the house? - No, there were these small holes burnt in the house, but not those large ones; I am clear in that; I had the gown on when I went to the Justice, I told him that some part was burnt in the house, and the remainder in the street at nine in the evening.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Who was the Justice? - Justice Staples in Whitechapel.</p>

             with some beer in her hand, and the two prisoners at the bar behind her, I then passed them, and went to the public house where this girl lives, the Black Swan in Rose-lane, which is three doors from my house, and my house is opposite Catherine-wheel-alley, across the road, I went into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190096"/> bar, and set down with the landlord, and had a pint of beer, and before I drank any of the beer I saw these two girls go out of the tap-room, and in five or six minutes the prosecutrix came in and said the two prisoners had burnt her again, upon which I said, then they burnt you when I passed you, for one of them had a small cup in her hand, the girl came into the bar where I was, and the master took up the gown, and it burnt his fingers, and turned them quite yellow, and I took it up, and it burnt my fingers; I says to the master, sure there is some law for this, or else we shall all be burnt; so I went to Mr. Quarril's, and he says, go and take them, and keep them as felons; there is no occasion for a warrant, for I have no warrants, or else I would make out one, so an officer came back, and the prisoners were sitting in the Swan tap-room, and they were taken to the watch-house; and the next day at twelve, I went to the Excise-office to pay my duty, and when I returned I saw them at large in the streets, which rather surprised me, and I went up to Mr. Staples and enquired into it, and they were taken up again, and they were committed; when the girl came in and said she was burnt, it shot into my head directly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You did not see them do anything with the cup? - No.</p>
               <p>I have your examination here, in which you positively swore that you saw them throw it? - Upon a second recollection, I said I saw a movement of the hand, which you will see in the second examination.</p>

               <p>They were unfortunate prostitutes, that were great nuisances to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You wished to get rid of them? - Yes, they have a right to be got rid of.</p>
               <p>Certainly, by legal means, but not by bringing prosecutions, which they do not deserve.</p>

               <p>Did she say that upon your oath? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Was his hand out of the shew-glass, or in the shew-glass, when you caught him? - Out of the shew-glass; a bullock was drove through the court, and he was one of the followers; my wife only took them up, I saw her take them up.</p>
               <p>Did he break the glass, or did he open it any way? - I cannot say whether he opened it or no, there were three shew-glasses broke at that time, they were whole before.</p>

            , it was about half after eleven on the night of the 19th of November, we have a half door before the street door, a hatch that was shut, I am positive it was shut, and the door on this side the hatch was shut, and locked; and suddenly as we were sitting<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190099"/> by the fire, I observed both the doors, with a great rush come against the wall of the passage, the street door is about eight yards from the place where I was sitting, I had an opportunity of seeing the door burst open, I jumped up immediately, and the prisoner was at the kitchen door in the house, and I seized him by the collar, I discovered the prisoner immediately after the door was broke open, I said to him, you villain, are you come to rob me, what brought you into my house, and my gown being long my lodger could not get out behind me to take them, because the place is but narrow, the other men were outside of the door coming to rush in upon me, my lodger went out into the street, as I thought to take some more of them, but he returned, and the prisoner was trying to get from me, and he forced the prisoner into the kitchen, and called watch, and he was taken into custody, I keep lodgers, seafaring men, I had two at that time, but they were both in bed.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - All the knowledge I had of him, was by his passing the door, we have two bad houses near.</p>
               <p>Jury. Please to put that question very close to the prosecutrix, whether she does not know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles, prisoner's counsel. I was going to ask that question? - I have seen him pass before in bad company, but I never said a word to him.</p>
               <p>I believe at this time you was in high conversation with several of your lodgers? - We were in conversation.</p>
               <p>Were not you speaking rather loud? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Could not any body going by hear you? No, Sir, they could not.</p>
               <p>The lights were not out? - No, Sir, thank God.</p>
               <p>You have seen this man before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do not you know what he is? - I do not look upon him to be good.</p>
               <p>That is no answer, do you know what he is? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Has not he frequently played a tune to you? - Never in his life.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do not you know this man is frequently playing opposite to you on the clarinet? - Yes, but that is not to me.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know that this man plays upon a musical instrument, near your house? - He never played to me, I have seen him playing in the open street.</p>
               <p>As you knew him as playing about, are not you convinced by his being in your neighbourhood, that he knew you too? - Yes, he knew me to be a woman of property.</p>
               <p>Was not he very well acquainted with your person? - No, Sir, he was not, why should I make him acquainted with my person.</p>
               <p>I did not ask you as to any improper acquaintance; did not he know you in the street, when he met you? - I am a person that have lived near twenty years in that parish, and have always lived in credit.</p>
               <p>Do you think that he has had an opportunity of seeing you often in the street, as well as you saw him? - Yes, Sir, I say so.</p>
               <p>At the time this matter happened, did not a great many of your neighbours tell you who he was, that he was there upon a frolick? - No, Sir, never.</p>
               <p>Has not this gentleman told you so? - Upon my oath no such thing, not Mr. Dick, never opened his mouth upon the subject.</p>
               <p>He did not make any demand of your money at that time? - No.</p>

               <p>Did you see your watch snatched? - Yes, but it was done so suddenly that I could not tell who it was, it was one single snatch; I think the person must follow me, and come abroad side of me, and then turn back and run, there was only one person, I turned and ran, and two men were taken, and somebody went and fetched the prisoner, he was fetched in three quarters of an hour, or an hour, I cannot say, they were all searched, and the watch was found on the prisoner; I was present when it was found, I am not sure whether it was in his breeches or in his pocket, I could not swear to the watch; I have had it seventeen or eighteen years, and it had a very remarkable string, and the person that cleaned it last there is his direction where he lives, I would not swear to the watch, nor did not, I have not the least doubt in the world but it is my watch, because of the man's name that cleaned it last; the string is very remarkable, it was a bit of waste stuff which I had, and I plaited it; the person that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190103"/> cleaned it his name is Richardson, watch and clock maker, Fore-street.</p>

               <p>Had your ever noticed the maker's name or number? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you often opened the watch so as to take notice of anything? - Not very often, it was a watch that I put into my pocket when I go into the country a fishing, and sometimes I have it not in my pocket for six months together, the glass and hour-hand have been broke since I lost it.</p>
               <p>Do you think you can be sure of the string? - It is made of a bit of scarlet brand, such as is used for stays, I suppose there never was such another string, from the glimpse I had of the prisoner I do not think it was him that took it, I think it was a taller man, and one of the men that were taken first was a taller man.</p>
               <p>I think you said also you did not observe more than one person in sight at the time? - No, only one person, I turned immediately.</p>
               <p>In following that person did you get any glimpse of him again? - Not at all, it is a long alley, I believe he was stopped in the alley, but there was not light enough to see at any distance.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, prisoner's council. Is the man that cleaned your watch a journeyman? - A master.</p>
               <p>I suppose he does a good deal of business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I suppose it is usual to put the name and directions in the cases of all watches? - I believe it is.</p>
               <p>With respect to that string, you know strings are various, like people's fancies, and such a string might, for what you know to the contrary, be put to fifty watches? - I did not say there never was such a string.</p>
               <p>No, clearly not, though it is not usual, yet it is possible that fifty other persons have put such a string to their watch? - I will not say they would not.</p>
               <p>You have already said that whosoever it was that snatched your watch you had just a glimpse of him, and thought him rather taller than the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>- SPENCER sworn.</p>
               <p>I was sitting at my own door about half past nine on Monday night the third of October, and there was an alarm of stop thief, I ran directly, two men ran by and I stopped them, I took one, and one Brown took the other; Mr. King came upon two minutes, or less, and said he was robbed, I took the two men to Bishopsgate-street watch-house, and searched them; they said they knew nothing of the watch, and Mr. King said he thought one of them was the person, but he could not swear to one of them; he gave charge of them; I took them to the Poultry Compter, and being informed of the prisoner, I found him at the Ship Ale-house, Shoreditch; I asked him if he had the property, he said nothing; I brought him to Mr. King; Mr. King said he did not know whether it was him or no; said Mr. King, have you got any watch, and when he came into the public-house he said, d - n my eyes, Mr. King, if I had known it was you I would have robbed one hundred before I would have done you; says Mr. King, have you got the watch, says he, I do not know; come with me and I will take you where it is; says I, you must not go out of my custody, he desired to go into a private room, for he wanted to speak to Mr. King; we went up into a room, and he said, shut the door, I was going to order somewhat, and I saw him clap his hand to his breeches, as if he was going to draw something, he would not be searched, I took him up in my arms and laid him on the table, and took the watch out of his fob on the right hand side, Mr. King said he thought he should know his watch again; he described it as a small sized silver watch; says I, is that your watch, yes, says he, it is the string I made myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. I suppose there was a good many people in the alley when you took these two people? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You only suspected them from their running, I suppose? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Do you know the prosecutor, Mr. King? - Yes, so far as this, I had carried silk to his house; he lives in Horse-shoe-alley, at the sign of the Crown, he is a silk weaver, I have carried many bales of silk to him.</p>

               <p>Had you an opportunity of seeing these men? - Yes, I looked through the window, and to be more particular, I opened the door of the leads of our house, and then I could see them more perfectly, they are the two prisoners, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>How wide is the street across that you saw them? - It is Fish-street hill, it is not a broad street.</p>
               <p>Court to Davis. What quantity of lead was taken? - Thirty-seven pounds, I saw it weighed, I saw the lead in the house down stairs, I did not compare it.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was ordered by my master to repair this first old house, to make that tyling good, and so I was going along the gutter and I saw this bit of lead lay so I took it up, and put it into the garret window for safety till my master came.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Warren called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Callen called one witnesses to his character.</p>

               <p>Did the others assist him? - Yes, they put a handkerchief upon my mouth; but I was so frightened I could not call out, I expected to be murdered, they were not half a minute, they riffled my pockets and then ran away; I got up and went to my lodgings, I rung at the wrong door of my lodgings, and a man came and set me right.</p>
               <p>How did you know the prisoner? - I was drinking with him the day before, I had been walking about and called in at this house, and dropped into conversation with this man.</p>
               <p>Did you know him when he first laid hold of you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he was one of the men that did absolutely rob you? - He is the man that caught hold of me.</p>
               <p>How long had you been in company with him on the Sunday? - I suppose two or three hours.</p>
               <p>Had you seen him at all on the Monday? - He shewed me to my lodgings on Sunday night, and I treated him with some beer at my lodgings, and he said, if you will come down to the same place to-morrow evening, I will spend a shilling with you, you seem to be a jovial companion, and such like as that.</p>
               <p>Did you go out the next evening? - Yes, and I found him at the public house, with his head asleep on the table; I did not see him at first, and I says to the people of the house where is my old friend, and they said that is him laid asleep on the table; so I roused him up.</p>
               <p>What time of the evening was that? - I suppose it was ten, I cannot say to half an hour; I said to him, you promised to treat me with a shilling to-night, come where is your treat; oh! says he, if you are that sort of a man, I will have no concern with you, so he got off into another seat; I do not recollect anything else passing that night at the public house, I was not in company with anybody particularly, those that were in company were strangers to me; and he got up from the table we sat at, and went to another.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he is the man? - I never saw two faces but what there was some difference in them, but I am sure he is the man, it was moonlight.</p>
               <p>Any other light than the moon-light? - There were lamps in the street, there was not much lamp-light, there were a few lamps.</p>
               <p>Was it by the moon-light, or by the lamp-light that you saw him? - I suppose it was by both, there was a lamp nigh.</p>
               <p>When you saw it was the man that you had been so well acquainted with, did not you say something to him? - No.</p>
               <p>How came that? - I was down so quick.</p>
               <p>Why did not you ask your old friend what he wanted with you? - The street is not further across than from me to you.</p>
               <p>What did you loose? - Seven golden guineas and two silver cased watches.</p>
               <p>How came you to have two watches? - One was my own, and the other was one I had of a person that lives in Montgomeryshire, and I lent him a little money upon it, he is a Welch drover; I keep a public-house, a malt-house, and am clerk of the parish; I live at Alvly, in Shropshire, about six miles below Bridgenorth, on the river Severn side.</p>
               <p>By the account you have given of yourself, you was very much in liquor? - Yes, I went by accident into this house in Chick-lane.</p>
               <p>Were your watches ever found again? - No, not that I ever heard of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him what dress or hat I wore when I made this attempt, as he says, on his person? - He was dressed shabbily as he is now, but particularly as to his clothes I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>What hat had he on? - A little slouched hat on.</p>
               <p>A round hat? - A slouched hat we call it.</p>

               <p>Was not he drunk? - He was not to say drunk, he was rather intoxicated in liquor.</p>
               <p>What are your ideas of being drunk? - He was not so drunk but he was capable of giving a proper answer, he was sensible drunk; if he had informed Mr. Roberts and me where he had been robbed at first, we might have gone and taken the people, and found the property perhaps, but he was near a quarter of an hour at the door.</p>

               <p>What time did the man come in, do you recollect? - I believe it to be about ten, or near upon ten, I cannot rightly say.</p>
               <p>Where was Byrne when the prosecutor came in? - I think, to the best of my remembrance, he was asleep, with his head on the table, when the prosecutor came in.</p>
               <p>Where were Hall and White then? - I think Hall sat at a table by himself asleep at the time; I think he was asleep too.</p>
               <p>Where was White? - Mr. White, I think, was gone, and Byrne and Hall were both a sleep; I think so, to the best of my knowledge they sat at different tables; there was a woman came in with some oysters at the same time, and this gentleman bought some oysters, but how many I cannot say, and he eat some, and gave some to my fellow-servant to take into the kitchen, and in a few minutes he called for the oysters, and he went to the door after the oyster-woman, and called Peggy, and he went out after her, but whether he knew her I cannot say; I cannot say whether I saw him and the prisoner speak together, but to the best of my knowledge he did not.</p>
               <p>How soon did Byrne awake again after the prosecutor went away? - I believe he slept very near upon the time, he went home, and Mr. Hall too, and Mr. Hall went home with Mr. Byrne, and I saw him to the end of the court where he lives, I cannot say how far he saw him; I did not go with him, he said he would go to see him home.</p>
               <p>Then you do not remember White, Hall, and Byrne drinking together, after the prosecutor came in? - No.</p>
               <p>What they had was before? - Yes, to the best of my remembrance, I think so.</p>
               <p>Who desired you to come here as a witness, my girl? - Come here as a witness! I only came here to speak what is the truth.</p>
               <p>But who desired you to come to speak the truth? - My mistress got me to come.</p>
               <p>When was you first told it would be necessary for you to come here, and speak about this? - I come to speak no otherway than the truth.</p>
               <p>No, no, I am not questioning that, but when was you first told? - On Saturday last.</p>
               <p>Who told it you then? - My mistress told it me.</p>
               <p>Who was in company then? - My mistress, master, and me.</p>
               <p>Were not the other witnesses Hall and White there? - No.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath were not they at your master's house on Saturday night last? - Last Saturday.</p>
               <p>Upon the oath you have taken were they or were they not? - Mr. Hall, I think was.</p>
               <p>And Mr. White both? - I cannot rightly tell you, I am sure Mr. Hall was.</p>
               <p>Now upon your oath was not Hall and White, and your mistress, and your fellow servant, and you all together at your master's house on Saturday last, enquiring what each of you was to say, and telling what each of you knew of this business? - No, Sir, upon my oath there was no such thing.</p>
               <p>You swear that? - I will swear that, I can swear it.</p>
               <p>Who told you that you must fix the time from five till half past twelve? - I spoke as near as I could.</p>
               <p>Who have you talked with on this business? - Nobody, but my mistress and master thought it would be proper for me to come on this business.</p>
               <p>Who is the prisoner's attorney? - I cannot tell, I have never seen him, I will be upon my oath to it.</p>
               <p>How came it then that you so particularly recollect the time that the prisoner came and went away that particular day and no other? - May be I might be minding my business more one day than another.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the prosecutor before Monday night? - I never saw him before the Sunday night, then the prisoner and prosecutor were drinking together.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190119"/>How long were they together as you recollect that evening? - I cannot say particularly.</p>
               <p>Do you know which of them went away first? - I cannot take upon myself to say not positively, nor whether they went out together I cannot tell, not positively.</p>
               <p>Do you remember how much beer the prosecutor had on Monday night? - One pint, and a slice of bread, to the best of my remembrance that was all.</p>
               <p>Then he did not stay long? - He was not above an hour, he might or might not be more, I cannot tell you.</p>
               <p>Did he pay for that pint of beer when he had it? - No, he did not, for there was a dispute about his paying for it, he would nor pay for it before he drank it; my fellow servant drew it, and he went to the bar and paid for it himself.</p>

               <p>What is your fellow servant's name? - Her name is Amey Garlick.</p>
               <p>AMEY GARLICK sworn.</p>

               <p>Did you see them go away? - No, I do not remember.</p>
               <p>Now we will see if you remember any better on the Monday? - Why, I take it, he was at our house about five o'clock on the Monday evening.</p>

               <p>How long do you think they had been there? - It might be half an hour, or an hour before the prosecutor came in.</p>

               <p>Did you ever serve them with any beer before the prosecutor came in? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Can you tell me upon recollection, whether you saw them there before the prosecutor came in or not? - I cannot take upon me to say.</p>

               <p>Did Byrne remain in the same box, when the prosecutor went away? - I cannot take upon me to say.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Then you cannot venture to say whether the prisoner was with them or not? - I cannot take upon me to say, I will not take upon me to say, when Mr. White went away, Mr. Hall went out at the same time that Mr. Byrne did, I saw them both go together, and Mr. Byrne had a candle at the bar, I can take upon me so far as that.</p>
               <p>How long before that had you seen them together? - I cannot say how long.</p>
               <p>Then the sum of your evidence is this that you can swear positively, that the prisoner came there at five o'clock, and went away at half past twelve, and that Hall and he went away together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But nothing else you will venture to say? - No, I will not.</p>
               <p>Now, who told you to say that? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>Can you swear that? - I can be clear in that as day-light, that nobody at all told me to say so, indeed.</p>
               <p>Do you know when the prosecutor went away? - I think he went away a little before we put our shutters up.</p>
               <p>What time is that? - We put our shuters up at eleven, or a little after.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner there after the prosecutor went away? - Yes, Sir, I did.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that too? - Quite positive of that.</p>
               <p>Did you see Mr. White there after the prosecutor went away? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Then you cannot say, whether White or the prosecutor went away first? - I cannot take upon me to say that.</p>
               <p>Did you see Hall there after the prosecutor went away? - Yes, I did not see Mr. White after the prosecutor went away, to best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>What beer had the prosecutor while he was there? - I think to the best of my knowledge, he had a pint of beer, and a slice of bread.</p>
               <p>Had he any more do you think than that? - Not to the best of my knowledge, and he had a penny-worth of beer that he pour-into his pint, but that he had with the oyster-woman; I served him with his penny-worth of beer, and his slice of bread.</p>
               <p>Did he pay for it directly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How, with half-pence? - I think, Sir, to the best of my knowledge, it was a shilling he gave me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190123"/>Did he pay for it before he had it or after? - No, after he had it.</p>
               <p>Do not you usually ask for the payment before? - Yes, but he scrupled paying for it when I asked him for it.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Have you any more witnesses except to your character? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Have you any knowledge at all of the two people that were with the prisoner when they stopped you in Chick-lane? - No, I have not.</p>
               <p>None at all? - No, Sir, I should not know them if I were to see them ever so, because they came like behind me.</p>
               <p>Should you know the young man that went home with you and the prisoner on Sunday night? - Yes, that was Hall I think.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation or dispute with the prisoner on the Monday night, except about the shilling that you wanted him to treat you with? - No, Sir, he got up directly, and went to another box, I do not know who he went to.</p>
               <p>Do you remember Hall and White being there? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>You cannot speak yourself, with any certainty to the time that you left the house? - No, Sir, I cannot, it was between eleven and one; it was between twelve and one, as they tell me, when I got home to my lodgings.</p>

               <p>Did you enquire whether she had any house or shop in Paradise-street? - I did, but I could find no house or shop in that name, nor there was no such person lived there.</p>
               <p>Did you enquire of anybody that was likely to know, such as the parish officers? - No, I enquired of two poor inhabitants, then I asked this linen-draper, supposing him to be most acquainted; here is one of the inhabitants here.</p>
               <p>When was this woman taken up? - I accidentally met her myself the Saturday before the sessions before last, in Rosemary-lane, I knew her again perfectly well, it was about six weeks before that she had been at my shop.</p>
               <p>Did you stop her then? - I did, in the street; she begged I would not expose her; a few people began to collect in consequence of what I said; I took her into a house, and I began to ask her how she could, a woman of her appearance, deceive me in that manner; she said she was drawn to it by a bad husband, she had lived extremely well, but was plunged into distress by very unhappily placing her affections on a very bad man, who had left her with two children; she appeared very sorry and had never done the like before but to me, in consequence of what I had heard, I enquired about it, and had it been distress, I would have acted otherwise; I afterwards went for an officer, and had her committed.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner, and I am very sorry it has fallen to my lot to appear against him, but if he had not, in all probability I must have taken a trial in his stead; I have seen the prisoner eight or nine times, I do not know what he is, I am a ticket porter; on Monday, the 30th of last September, about twelve at noon, the prisoner came to the Temple-gate, and he says, porter, will you go and do a job for me this afternoon about four o'clock? I said if I was in the way I would; he said, he would call at that time as he was going away, but he turned round, and says, porter, I have recollected myself, it will suit better for you to go at three; I did not see him that day, at all, on the next day, on the first of October, he came about half after twelve, I was looking down the Inner Temple lane, and about half way down I saw the prisoner, he put his fingers up and I came to him, says he, now can you do the job you was to do yesterday? I said, if you please; he took me down through the Temple in Temple-street, Whitefriars, then he pulled out this note, and gave it to me; I am sure this is the note, I had it from the prisoner; now says he, go according to the directions of this note, and you will receive a parcel, and bring it to me, at the Pied Horse, in Chiswell-street, and if you should be there before me, wait, but if I am there before you, I will wait till you come; I looked at the note, and I saw it was directed to Mess. Harris, Prescott, and Howard, linen drapers, in Bow Church-yard; the note was wafered; I told him I would go immediately, I was going, and he said, porter, I want to speak to you, if they should ask you where you come from, say you came from No. 5, Moor-place, Moorfields, I went with the note, and gave it, as I found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190131"/> afterwards, to Mr. Prescott, I believe he went into the compting-house to read it; in about five minutes he came out, and said, porter, did the gentleman mention what price he would give? I said, I do not know, he told me to come for a parcel, and bring it to him at the Pied Horse in Chiswell-street; he said very well, he would go and look them out immediately, and I must give that justice to Mr. Prescott to say, that there is not a tradesman in the city of London could look out a parcel quicker than Mr. Prescott did, but it was not the same sort that the prisoner sent for, Mr. Prescott went to look out the parcel, he did produce some linen to be sure, but it was a great deal smaller than the prisoner sent for, and of a different quality, for instead of looking out the four pieces of linen, he looked out a white night cap, which was on the head of a constable, who took me into custody; now says he, my friend, I shall take care of you, till you find out the person that sent you, I was defrauded out of several dozens of handkerchiefs by a note similar to this hand-writing; I cannot say, my Lord, but what I was a little ashamed, but when I recollected myself I said, I know nothing of it, I am innocent, I came in my profession as a ticket porter; says he, I do not know that; says I, I belong to a society, which the present worthy Lord Mayor is president of, it is called the Guardians; and if I had ever been concerned with any swindler, I must never look them in the face any more; he asked me who I knew belonging to the society, I mentioned many respectable characters about Cheapside; Alderman Plomer is our governor; we give two securities of fifty pounds each; says I, if you detain me here, it will not be the way to find out the person, you had better let the constable go with me to the Pied Horse in Chiswell-street; then Mr. Prescott had a consultation whether he should send any linen, but it was agreed, that it should be a parcel of waste paper, tied up in the form of a roll, for me to carry under my arm, that if the prisoner saw me he should not think any thing was amiss; then it was agreed for me to go, and the constable and his assistants, I was to walk first, and they were to walk behind me, Mr. Prescott was to come behind at some distance, and the constable and his assistants were to go into the tap-room, and take no notice of me, and I was to go in, and go to the bar, and enquire for the gentleman; accordingly we went, and I went in first into the tap-room, I called for a pint of beer, and asked the gentlewoman at the bar, if there was a gentleman there waiting for a porter that had been into the city about some Irish linens; she desired me to sit down; says I, I had rather not, I will go to the door, and may be I may see the gentleman one way or the other, I went to the door, and I had no sooner come there, than on casting my eyes across the road, I saw the prisoner standing in Moorfields, he saw me and held up his hands, I held up my hand, and held up the parcel, he seemed to be very well pleased, then he came forwards out of Moorfields into the middle of the road, and I advanced and met him at the right hand corner of Chiswell-street, where there was a penthouse, and we went down there; says he, well! (and smiled) you have got it; yes, says I, you villain! and I have got you; and I took him by the collar, and I turned round, and saw the constable about ten or twelve yards off, I held him fast, and gave them a beckon, they came up, he trembled, and said, what is the matter? then I delivered him to their charge.</p>

               <p>What did he say for himself? - He said very little, he said what was the matter; we went into the Pied Horse, and Mr. Prescott came in, then it was agreed to take him to Mess. Rogers and Co. at No. 5, Moor-place, whose names he had presented; we all went in together, Mr. Rogers came first, he said he knew nothing of the handwriting; the prisoner was present; Mr. Rogers said he knew the defendant, that he was formerly a clerk in their compting-house: I am sure this is the note.</p>

               <p>Did not the person explain the nature of the business? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You was under some apprehension for yourself if you had not found out some person to fix this upon? - I was detained.</p>
               <p>When you came to Chiswell-street, I believe your fears would have been realised if you had not found some person to fix this upon? - I fixed on the right.</p>
               <p>The party was not at the Pied-horse? - No, I know the man again.</p>
               <p>Pray, Sir, as you have been extremely tenacious concerning your character, has it ever been your misfortune to be suspected of any little depredations yourself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was the result of that suspicion? - Not felony, I never was tried in my life, I was in custody for an assault, and it was ordered up by a general release.</p>

               <p>Upon your detaining him, what story did he tell you? - He said, he knew nothing of the contents of the note, he totally denied it; he said, he knew the man that gave it him, and could bring several reputable people to appear for him, and convinced me thoroughly that he was not concerned, and he told me where the man was to be found.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. You know nothing of the hand-writing, but that it bears a resemblance to one you formerly received? - That is all.</p>

You have been convicted by the verdict, by a very attentive Jury of this fraud; and I am now at liberty to say that I entertain no doubt in my own mind, that the Jury have selected the truth of this case from the evidence; the offence is of a very dangerous nature, a person who has lived in a situation of credit as a clerk to a house of character, making use of the name of that house to obtain credit, and defraud them of their property, is an offence the most difficult of all others to guard against, and which therefore ought to be watched more particularly, and punished with more severity; for few kinds of fraud are more dangerous, and more prejudicial to trade, and it seems to me that there is very little distinction as to your guilt, between the attempt you made by the note you wrote and sent by the porter, and the completion of that guilt, which depended upon the credit that note might obtain with Mr. Prescott, for the delivery of the goods; the Court therefore think they should not discharge their duty to the public, and afford the protection which they owe to the trade of this great City, without sentencing you, which they now do, to be <rs id="t17851019-80-punish388" type="punishmentDescription">
