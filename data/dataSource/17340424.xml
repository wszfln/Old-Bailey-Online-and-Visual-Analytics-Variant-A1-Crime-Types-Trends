            . The Prisoner came to my Shop, with a Pattern of printed Linnen, and said, If I could match it, he should buy a Parcel of me, I happened to have none of the same Sort in my Shop, and so he left it with me, and came again in 2 or 3 days. I told him, I had been at several Places to match it, but could not do it exactly. Well,, says he, It don't signifie much, and as I have given you some trouble, I intend to take a Parcel of you, for I have got a Sister at Twickenham, who keeps a Worsted Shop next to the Kings Arms there; and as she has a large Acquaintance, she is willing to sell Linnen. I desired him to look out what he thought proper. But, he said, he would come another time, and do that, because his Sister's Waterman, who had brought up Money to pay for a Parcel of Linnen, was gone back to Twickenham, but would be here again in a Day or two. The Prisoner came accordingly, and said the Waterman had brought the Money. So he look'd out a Parcel of Goods, and made me cut a Piece of Muslin, because, he said, the whole would come to more Money than his Sister had sent. When he had chosen the Goods, and we had agreed upon the Price, I made out a Bill of Parcels for Goods <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173404240003"/> sold Mrs Wilson, (for that he said was his Sister's Name) and sent them by my Servant, with Orders not to deliver them without the Money. My Servant returned, and told me that the Prisoner had run away with the Goods. This was on the 21st of March; and on Saturday the 30th of the same Month, as I was going along White-chappel with Mr. Dun, I accidentally saw the Prisoner. Says I to Mr. Dun, I believe that's the Man that took me in. Mr. Dun mending his Pace, the Prisoner took to his Heels, and happen'd to run down a Stable-yard that was no Thorow-Fare. We follow'd, and at last found him hid under a Manger. We carried him before a Justice; but he was so sullen, that he wou'd not tell his Name, where he lived, or who he was acquainted with. I had seen a Description of such a Chap, (in the Daily Advertiser of the 4 or 5 of March) who had cheated other Persons of a large Quantity of Linnen; and thereupon I sent to those Persons, who came and found the Prisoner to be the Man. We found a pocket-Book upon him, in which there was an Account of many dark Things he had been concern'd in.</p>
               <p>Mansel Alcock, the Prosecutor's Servant. By my Master's Order I took the Goods, and went with the Prisoner to the <placeName id="t17340424-5-crimeloc18">Blue-Anchor Alehouse in Swan-Lane</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Did not you deliver the Goods to me?</p>
               <p>Alcock. No; I left them in the open Room, and then we went to an Alehouse. And the Prisoner pretending to speak for some Beer, stept out at the back Door. As soon as I found he was gone, I ran back to the Blue-Anchor to see for the Goods. But Mrs Spinks, the Woman of the House, told me, that the Prisoner had fetch'd them away.</p>

I said, No. Then he asked the Lad if he'd drink a Dram or a pint of Beer - They had a pint of Beer; and then the Lad left the Bundle, and they went away together.

            . On Saturday the 21 of March, as the Prosecutor and I were going along White-chappel, we saw the Prisoner crossing the way. Says the Prosecutor, I believe that's the Man as took me in. Why don't you follow him then? Says I; and upon that the Fellow began to run, and we ran after him.

            . On the 30 of March, in the Afternoon, I met Captain Mitchell in <placeName id="t17340424-10-crimeloc46">Long-Acre</placeName>

And how does Mr. such-a-one do? says he; Very well, Sir, says I again, and then I look'd upon my Watch, and it was just upon the Stroke of two, and so the Captain and I parted. The Minute he left me, I met the Prisoner; he got betwixt me and the Wall, put his Arms round my Waist, asked me a rude Question and thrust me up against the Post. I was very much frighted; but as soon as I recovered myself, I said, O my Watch is gone - Then, Madam, says he, you can't tell what's a Clock. So he walked along towards Drury-lane, and stopt to speak with an Ordinary Creachure that stood at the End of Princes Court.</p>
               <p>Court. Were you acquainted with him?</p>
               <p>Hunter. No, I never saw the Fellow before.</p>
               <p>Court. It's very strange, that a Man should be guilty of such an Action in a publick Street, and in the middle of the Day, and yet not endeavour to escape.</p>
               <p>Hunter. But it's very true; and last Friday Morning, a Watch-maker came to wind up a Clock in the House where I live, and he told me that he had seen such a Watch as mine, and had it in his Hand, and that one Lowther (not the Prisoner, but another of the same Name) brought it to him - it was a Gold chaced Watch. I value it at 14 l.</p>

             I saw Mrs Hunter in Long-Acre, and a Man had his Arms round Waist She flung from him, and call'd him Fellow and said, she had lost her Watch. Then she went to Princes Court, and he to Red-Lion-Court End, on the other side of the Way. She turned back in a great flurry and went in at a Door. I thought it a very odd Matter, and so I look'd after him and he crost the Way, and stood talking, with a fat Woman in a striped Gown, at the End of Princes-Court</p>

            . There was a Mob about my Door, and this Gentlewoman and that Man were among them She held her Watch-chain in her Hand, and said, she had lost her Watch; and he said in a Bantering-way, Why don't you search me? You see I don't run away.</p>
               <p>Captain Mitchell. I know nothing of the Prisoner or the Fact, but I met this Gentlewoman <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173404240006"/> in Long Acre, and as I had a small Acquaintance with her, in good manners I asked her how she did, and how a certain Gentlewoman of her Acquaintance did. I remember she look'd upon her Watch, and I saw the Pointer was toward two. Whether it was a Gold Watch or no, I can't swear; but it was like one, in Shape and Colour.</p>

            . Last Thursday Morning, a Gold Watch was brought to me to be set faster. Mrs. Hunter had describ'd her Watch to me, and this answer'd the Description; but as it was not advertised, I would not venture to stop it. So going to her Lodgings to wind up a Clock, I told her of it. It was brought to me by one Lowther a <rs id="t17340424-10-deflabel47" type="occupation">Seal Graver</rs>

He said, sometime I asked what he would have for it? He said 14 Guineas, and he would spend half a Guinea of the Money. I bid him leave it, and may be I might help him to a Chap, tho' I intended to shew it to Madam; but he would not I went with her to his House, but he was not at home.</p>

               <p>Hunter. There was not a Creachure near me, when he stopt me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The People said, they did not believe her, for she was a Town-Madam of a very indifferent Character. And so when she came down again, I had the misfortune to ask her if she had pawn'd her Watch? Damn you, says she, I don't know but you have got it - she went after some Captain, as she call'd him, unto Long-Acre; but when she had gone a little way, she came back once more, and I offer'd to be searched; but she got a Constable who carried me before the Justice.</p>

               <p>Clerk reads.</p>
               <p>`To Mr. Dutems at the Golden Cup, in `Leicester-Square. Send the Boy or Girl, of `the Person from whom the Things were took, `with the Money this Night'. [the Letter is torn in this place, and here's something wanting] `Shoulder of Mutton fields, let them `be there by Eleven. Send nobody with them. `Let them be in a Red Coat or Gown.</p>
               <p>`P. S. None but them will have it, and `they must bring this Letter, I shall drop it `first and so let them the Money.</p>
               <p>At 11 a Clock I and the Prisoner, with some of my Friends, went to the Shoulder of Mutton-fields: but not caring to venture the 10 Guineas, before I saw some probability of getting the Goods, we waited at some distance, and sent the Prisoner without the Money, to see if the Man was there, and brought the Goods. He went, and return'd in a little time, and said to us; I have met the Man, and he ask'd me if I had brought the Money. I told him no, for my Master was afraid he had not got the Things. He told me that he had, and put the Top of the Tweezer Case in my Hand, and jingled the other things in his Pocket; and then he bid me come to morrow Night at the same Hour, and bring the Money, but let nobody come with me. So we returned home, and went again the next Night: but having some suspicion of the Prisoner, I sent two of my Friends, a little before, (without the Prisoner's knowledge) to watch if any body came to him. But neither of them are here. For one of them can't speak English, and the other (Mr. Costeau ) is now a Prisoner in the Fleet. We took Arms with us; but when we came to the Field, the Prisoner pretended to be afraid, and desir'd to have a Brace of Pistols. I let him have one, and bid him fire it off if the Man went to take the Money from him without delivering the Goods. So giving him the 10 Guineas, he went towards the appointed part of the Field, and we lay perdue. In a quarter of an Hour we heard the Pistol fir'd; upon which we ran towards the Place, and saw the Prisoner struggling with a Man. I took that Man to be the Thief, and was going to shoot him, but was afraid of killing the Prisoner. But when I came quite up to them, I found that Man was my Friend Costeau. We searched the Prisoner, and found a Guinea in his Pocket, he said the Man gave it him in goodwill. I ask'd him why he fir'd then? and he answer'd, because he saw 2 Men coming along. I ask'd him what he had done with the other 9? He said he had given them to the Man for the Goods. Mr. Costeau said, that no Man came to the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. You should have brought Mr Costeau hither by a Habea Crpus.</p>
               <p>E. M. I have been at a considerable Charge already about this Affair - we went to the Salmon and Ball, and I told the Prisoner I suspected he had hid the Money in the Bank. He said, Do you think I would serve you so? But three of the Company took Links, and went back to see if they could find it. While they were gone the Prisoner call'd me aside, and said it was Necessity that drove him to do what he had done, and beg'd that I would not prosecute him; for if I did, he was ruined. I told him, his best way would be, to make a plain Confession; and then he own'd he had hid 9 Guineas in the Bank. Upon this we went out, and met the three Men coming back with their Links. The Prisoner desir'd the Links might be put out, or keep at a distance, and so he went to the Place in the Dark, and went into the Ditch, and brought out the Money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I describe the Man to be in a Lac'd hat and a Great-coat.</p>
               <p>E. M. Yes; the first Night.</p>
               <p>P. And the second Night, I told you which way he went, and that he was not gone 20 Yards off when you came up to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dutems. I am a Jeweller, and Goldsmith. My Lord Harvey gave me a Family-Box to fit up. Mr. Manisire had it from me, and after sometime, he told me, it was lost. We advertised it; and the same Evening I received the Letter that was produced in Court. I sent my Servant with it to Mr. Manisire: But his Servant (the Prisoner) came, and told me his Master was not at home. I sent them both back to look for him, and at last they found him. We thought it was not <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173404240008"/> safe to send the Prisoner alone with 10 Guineas, for fear Somebody, who might have seen the Advertisement, might wait at the Place, and Rob him - I never mistrusted the Prisoner, because he always behaved well.</p>

            . I went with the Rest to the Field. When we came near the Place, we sent the Boy (the Prisoner) before, and then we laid down on the Grass - It was about the middle of the Field. He went about half a Field's length, and returned in 6 or 7 Minutes. When he came to where we lay, he started, and said, O is it you? I have met my Chap; he was very civil, and said, young Man be civil to me, and I'll be civil to you It was not a foggy Night; for as we lay down, we could see the Hedges at a reasonable Distance: But we saw Nobody but the Prisoner. - The next Night, Mr Costeau and another Frenchman went beforehand to hide themselves in a Ditch, and we follow'd - We came to an Alehouse, and mark'd some of the Guineas unknown to the Prisoner, and then wrapt them in a Paper, and put them into his Stock, and so set forward. He told us we might go 2 or 3 Fields farther, till we came to the Bridge. I had one pair of Pistols, and his Master had another. I lent the Prisoner one of mine, and he went towards the Place, which was about 60 Yards off. He fired his Pistol, and we ran up. At first we scarce knew Friends from Foes. Mr. Costeau had got hold of the Prisoner, and said, Aye, you are the Thief. Says the Prisoner, I have got the Things, and the Man is gone over the Bar-gate that way. I follow'd, but it was Knee deep, and I could go no farther; and so we return'd to the Salmon and Ball. I was one of the 3 who first went back from thence, to look for the Money. And as we returned, the second Time towards the Alehouse, we met the Prisoner and the rest of our Company. Somebody said, the Prisoner had confest, and was going to fetch the Money; but he would have the Links put out, and so they were. Then he would do nothing before me and Mr. Costeau; upon which we staid at a little Distance, and the Prisoner went into the Ditch, where he hid himself. His Master call'd to us, Hist! Hist, we came forward, and he said, he believ'd he was gone. We call'd the Prisoner, but he would not answer; but at last his Master tumbled over him. Then the Prisoner said, he must have a Link, and I went back to the Ale-house and brought one. At my Return, Mr. Manisire shew'd me the Money, and I knew it to be the same by the Marks.</p>

            . At 9 at Night, my Master told me he had received a Letter, and sent me with it to the Prisoner's Master; but he was not at home. I told the Prisoner, the Thief was found, and he must meet him in the Shoulder of Mutton-Fields. He said, he would not venture his Life for his Master, nor never a Man in the World - At last he found his Master - I went with them that Night to the Salmon and Ball, and thence over 3 or 4 Fields; the Prisoner went before, and we lay down in the middle of the Field. He soon returned, and said it was no Bite, for he had met his Chap, who had shewn him the Top of the Tweezer-case, and chinked the rest of the Things in his Pocket. When I first came to the Place, says he, I walk'd about, and the Man came out of the Ditch, and walked about too; and then he said, young Man do me no Harm, and I'll do you none. Next Night we went again, and the Prisoner went a Field or 2 before us; and then he returned, and said, He was afraid, and desired us to come nearer, which we did; and he went forward again. In a little time he whistled, and fired a Pistol; upon which we all ran up, and a Man met me, and clapt a Pistol to my Breast. He did not know me in the dark, nor I him, till he spoke, and then I found he was one of the Frenchmen who went before hand to watch the Prisoner. Coming all into the Shoulder of Mutton-Path, Mr. Manisire searched the Prisoner, and found a Guinea in his Pocket; and when we came to the Salmon and Ball, we agreed to be searched all round, that no Exceptions might be taken, by searching some, and not others. After the Search, 3 of the Company would go back with Links, to see if the Prisoner had hid no Money in the Bank; and while they were gone, the Prisoner call'd his <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173404240009"/> Master aside into another Room. I don't know what Discourse they had together; but when they came out, we 3 likewise went to the Shoulder-of-Mutton-Fields to look for the Money. We met the other 3 with Links, and the Prisoner desired they might be put out, which was done; and coming near the Place, there was a Farmer with a Lanthorn looking for the Money too; for I suppose he had heard something of the Matter. Mr. Manisire beckon'd for the Farmer to go away; and then beckon'd me to go away too, which I did, and left them in the dark.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Things were lost on Friday Morning. I advis'd my Master to get some Bills printed for the stopping them. He did not approve of this, but advertised them on the Monday following, and the same Evening Mr. Dutems receiv'd a Letter, to send me or the Girl to meet the Man in the Field. I went with my Master and several others; but they stopt on this side the Place appointed, and sent me forward. When I had walk'd about for 2 or 3 Minutes, a tall thin Man in a laced Hat call'd to me, and said, I believe you are the young Man - have you brought the Money? No, says I. Why so? says he. Because, says I, my Master is afraid you have not got the Goods. Yes, but I have, says he, for here they be; and with that he put a Part of them in my Hand, and bid me come next Night and bring the Money, and be sure to come alone. So I went back to my Master, and we all went home, and came again next Night. My Master proposed, that I should give the Thief 10 Counters instead of Guineas; but I was afraid the Thief would discover the Cheat, and so my Life would be in Danger, and therefore I would not undertake it. Then my Master gave me ten Guineas: But as I went along, I began to consider, that my Master would be very glad to save his ten Guineas, and so I hid 9 Guineas in the Bank, and gave the Thief 10 Counters, and he return'd me one for my Civility.</p>
               <p>Court. Was any Counters found upon the Prisoner when he was search'd.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dubois. I found no Counters about him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Manisire. Nor I, and yet we searched him every where; all his Pockets, his Coat, Shoes and Stockings, after we had found one Guinea, in hopes of finding the Rest.</p>
               <p>Court. The Prisoner gives a good Reason for refusing to impose the Counters upon the Thief, for he says, he was afraid of a Discovery; and this appears natural; but it's by no means natural to suppose, that this Terror should vanish, and his Mind should change so suddenly. And it's very unaccountable, that he should hide only 9 Guineas in the Bank: If he did it for Security, why did he not hide all the 10? And if he intended to return the Money to his Master, why did he so long conceal where it was, and pretend he had given it to the Thief?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I had concluded to impose upon the Thief, by giving him Counters instead of Guineas for the Goods, I confess, that, having such an Opportunity, I did design afterwards to defraud my Master of the Money, and therefore I put one Guinea in my Pocket, to make believe, that I had really given the Thief the Money, (tho' I gave him only the Counters) and that he had return'd me that Guinea for my Trouble.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bowen. The Prisoner was my Scholar, I have known him 4 Years. I taught him Writing and Arithmetick, and he always behaved very well and deservingly.</p>
               <p>Juryman. Pray my Lord let the School-master see the Letter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bowen. I don't take this to be his Writing. 'T is nothing like what he wrote when he was with me.</p>
               <p>Court. No doubt but a Person would disguise his Hand on such an Occasion; but sure you can distinguish betwixt a natural and a feign'd Hand - Do you think this is natural?</p>
               <p>Mr. Bowen. I can't say as to that.</p>
               <p>A great many Witnesses appear'd to the Prisoner's Reputation, and gave him a very good Character.</p>
               <p>Court. To Mr. Manisire. Did you ever propose to deliver the Counters to the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Manisire. No; I did not, but some such Thing was mentioned.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173404240010"/>
               <p>Mr. Dubois. It was I who propos'd it, upon which the Prisoner said, he would not go for the World. Then said his Master; well, give him 10 Guineas. Pray don't go to deceive me now, says the Prisoner, for it may be of very ill Consequence.</p>

            . Last Tuesday Night, I made fast the Window-shutters of Mr. Bothomly's House - 'tis a Corner House in <placeName id="t17340424-14-crimeloc65">King-street in St. Ann's Westminster</placeName>

But Nobody answer'd - At 3 o' Clock the Watchman came by. I call'd to him, and bid him see if the Window-shutters next King-street were shut - He said, Yes, but the Bar was down, and the Pin was in the Window. Then lighting a Candle, I found the Shutters close, but the Sash within was thrown up. We searched in the Wash-house below Stairs, and looking up the Chimney, there stood the Prisoner upon a Wooden-perch. Here's the Thief, says I, stay Watchman and I'll call more help. So I got 2 more Watchmen, and carried the Prisoner to the Watch-house, where this Window-Curtain was found upon him - He had liv'd a <rs id="t17340424-14-deflabel66" type="occupation">Servant</rs>

He said he got in, to get some Victuals, and took the Curtain to wrap it in. I told him, he knew my Master kept no Victuals in the House, but order'd all to be given away - I had key'd the Pin of the Window my self, when I went to Bed; but the Spring of the Key was broke, so that in turning the Pin round, the Key dropt out.</p>
               <p>- Denton, Watchman. Mr. Westridge call'd me, to see if the Window was fast; I told him the Bar was down. He let me in. I saw the Sash was quite up. In the Wash-house Chimney, we found the Prisoner with his Shoes down at the Heels. He said, he was a Fool for coming there.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I own I was in the House, but the Sash was lifted up before.</p>
               <p>Juryman. Does the Pin go thro' the Shutter?</p>
               <p>Westridge. No; the Shutters are fastned with a Bar, and the Pin goes thro' the Bar and Jamb of the Window. So that he could put the Pin in the hole, and then go in, and pull the Shutters close after him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I am very sorry for what I have done. When I first began, I had no Intent of wronging my Master - It was done foolishly, and for want of Thought. I had been extravagant, and could not settle my Accounts; but I was in hopes of making it up before I was discover'd - But I cannot excuse my self - I might have done well if I would - My Master and Lady were like a Father and Mother to me, and the more is my Guilt, in making such ungrateful Returns for their Goodness - I hope my Misfortunes may be a Warning to all others - I know not what to say - I beg for Mercy - And if I live, I hope God will assist me to live better, and to make some Amends for my past Offences.</p>

            . Friday Morning was 5 Weeks, about 9 o' Clock, I met Mrs Pain, who said she was going to see the Prisoner at Stoke-Newington. An Hour afterwards, I saw Mrs Pain again, and she said the Prisoner was very bad; so I went to see the Prisoner. She was sitting up in her Bed, and I asked her how she did? She said, very bad at her Head and Stomach. When I came down, I asked Mrs Pain if she had seen nothing? For the Kitchen was in Disorder, and had been wash'd and sanded, and there was a Bloody-apron. She said she had seen something, and that the Prisoner had thrown something down the Vault. I stept over the Way, (for I live opposite to where the Prisoner lives) and told my Mistress. She bid me light a Candle, and look in the Vault. I did, and saw a Child there; but I was so frighted, that I could not take much notice. I sent for help to take it out, and then I saw only a little Blood on the Head of it. It was a Female, and seem'd to be new born.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you observe the Navel, or any thing about it, belonging to a new born Child?</p>
               <p>E. H. No. It was filthy with the Soil of the Privy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was it a Stone Kitchen?</p>
               <p>E. H. No. A boarded Floor?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was I alone, or was any of the Family in the House?</p>
               <p>E. H. I don't know - I saw none but you when I first came.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was the Child cover'd in the Vault?</p>
               <p>E. H. No. It lay clear.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How deep was the Vault?</p>
               <p>E. H. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was it a slight Bruise on the side of the Head, or a large one?</p>
               <p>E. H. I did not search - A Midwife was sent for after the Child was found; but she did not come till next Day.</p>

            . The Prisoner sent for me by a Neighbour's Girl between 9 and 10 in the Morning. She let me into the Kitchen her self. I ask'd what ail'd her? She said, she was not very well, nor had not been well since Whitsuntide : That she had been very bad that Morning, and had been at the Vault; but was now something better, and could eat a little Water gruel. I made her some, and then she went to Bed, and bid me lock the outer Door, and take the Key. There was Nobody else in the House - The Kitchen was a little out of Order; I saw it had been mopp'd up, but I saw no foul Clothes. We did not let her know that the Child was found, till her Master and Mistress came down, and that was between 3 and 4 in the Afternoon. And then I asked her how she came to do so? And she said, the Devil prompted her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What did you understand I meant by saying so? - That I carried it to the Place, or that I murder'd it?</p>

            , Midwife. On Saturday <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173404240013"/> the 16th of March, I was sent for by the Prisoner, to free her of the After-birth, and I made her a free Woman and left her safe. I was sent for on the Friday, but could not go, - I saw the Child, it was as fine a Female as ever I set my Eyes on, and I don't question but it was full grown; for I believe it was 3 quarters (of a Yard long) and I believe it was born alive, for I can't think so large a dead Child could make it's own way. There was a great Bruise on this side of the Head?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Might not that come by a Fall at it's Birth?</p>
               <p>M. F. I can't say that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you take some Child-Bed-Linnen out of my Trunk.</p>
               <p>M. F. Yes; a Shirt, a Blanket, and a Night-Cap, a Biggin, and a long Stay; but these I did not see till Monday, and it's much to be fear'd, that you did not put them there; for indeed I was inform'd they were borrow'd of a Neighbour.</p>
               <p>Court. That's no Evidence - You must not swear what you heard, but only what you know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Coulson, Surgeon. I found a large Contusion on the side of the Child's-head, which I believe was the Cause of it's Death. The Bruise might happen by the Child's falling from her, for a Child falls with a prodigious force.</p>

I got a Ladder, and went down 4 or 5 Rounds, and try'd to take it with a Rake; but when I had raised it 2 or 3 foot, it fell down again, and that daub'd it pretty much. There was a Bruise and some Blood about it's Head, but the Skin was not broke.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was taken very bad in Bed, between 5 and 6 in the Morning. I came down Stairs, and call'd for help as well as I could, but there was Nobody else in the House. The next Door was an Ale-house, and a Noise being there, I believe they could not hear me. And being violent ill, and in great Extremity of Pain, I was deliver'd in the Kitchen. I never saw the Child move, nor never laid Hands on it; but it got that Bruise on the Head by falling from me, and then in a fright I took it up and carried it to the Vault.</p>

In every such case, the said Mother so offending shall suffer Death as in Cases of Murder, except such Mother can make proof, by one Witness at least, that the Child (whose Death was by her so intended to be conceal'd) was born dead ?</p>

               <p>Mr. Kendrick. On the 28th of February, I lost a Pair of silver Candlesticks out of my House in <placeName id="t17340424-38-crimeloc164">George-Yard Lombard-street</placeName>

But Sir Edward said he suspected her, and advised us to search her Lodgings, and my Servant went, and found the Candlesticks there; but the Crest was taken out as nicely as if it had been done by a Silversmith.

               <p>Court. Were you acquainted with the Prisoner?</p>


               <p>Murphey. Yes; we were well acquainted for 2 or 3 Years. I knew him, and he knew me in a very particular manner - He took up a Knife at my Lodgings, and swore he would be my Death, if I would not maintain him - And another time, he cut this Gown a-cross, intending to cut my Flesh. I can't disown but I have been an unfortunate Woman. And when I had got Money to give him, he'd be pleasant enough; but if I had none, then he would call me all the Bitches in Life, and bid me, turn out, and knock down Men in the Streets, and whatever I could get from other Persons, bring to him, and then I should be welcome; for he did not care what he drove me to - But I design to reform before it's long - Here's the Cloak - You may see how he has hammock'd it - I am sure I was forced to pay for it, for I had borrow'd it to disguise my self, for fear he should know me, and do me some Mischief if he met me.</p>

When I first fell into her Company, she robb'd me of a Moidore that my Wife work'd hard for. But I was drunk, and she put me to Bed in Magpye-Alley, and I did not know where I was when I waked.

I went to 3 Places, and could not get it changed; and so I came back again. But my Master bid me go to another Place, and there I changed it for half a Guinea and 10 s. 6 d. in Silver; and as I was going home with it, the Prisoner took me in his Arms just by my Master's Door, and swore, Damn his Blood, he'd cut my Throat, if I did not deliver all my Money. He rumbled in his Pocket to find a Knife. The Money was in my Hand, and he put my Hand into his Mouth and bit it, and some of the Money fell into his Mouth. I cry'd Murder, and Stop Thief, and he was taken by 2 or 3 Men about 100 Yards from my Master's Door. I went up to them, and he said he was innocent. But the Men said, they heard the Money fall, and I pick'd up 6 Pence, and others found more in the Kennel just by him. It was about 11 at Night, and he stopt me; I saw him plainly by the Light of a Lamp.</p>

            . I went to Mr. Pilkington's to change a Guinea. He sent his Lad out, but the Lad return'd without Change, and so he was sent again. In a short space, we heard a Cry of Murder - Says Mr. Pilkington, that's my Boy's Voice; and so in half a Minute we ran out. We soon came up to the Prisoner, but he said he was innocent. The Boy shew'd me his Hand. I saw the Print of Teeth in it, and it was a little bloody, but not so much as for the Blood to run down. There was some Money found just where the Prisoner stood. One Man found about 7 s. 6 d. and another about 2 s. 6 d. - It was my Guinea that the Boy had to change.</p>

We heard a Man run, and we saw him when he came within 3 or 4 yards of us, by the light of a Chandler's Shop. So we stopp'd him; he struggled to get loose, and he said he was innocent.

I look'd into this Box one day, and found a Gross of Gold Thread Buttons which I never put there. This made me suspect, that he had a design to carry them off. I ask'd him how they came there. He seem'd confus'd and made me no satisfactory Answer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you ever enquire after what you mist?</p>
               <p>Mr. Cornthwaite. Yes; I have often enquir'd of you, but not of my Workmen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. But did you ever tax me with wronging you?</p>
               <p>Mr. Cornthwait. No; for tho' I had long been jealous of you, I had no business to let you know it, because I wanted to make a Discovery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you miss that Gross before you found them in the Lace-box ?</p>
               <p>Mr. Cornthwaite. I can't say that I did, but when I found them, I knew they were taken <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173404240020"/> out of my Drawers.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Is not that a Publick Drawer your Shop, where 30 Men are at Work.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cornthwaite. Yes; I keep a Quantity there in readiness, if my Men should want any when I am out of the way.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you order me to clear that open Drawer, and put the Buttons in the Lace-box to keep them from Tarnishing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cornthwaite. I have order'd you to that Drawer, but not to put the Buttons the Box</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you take a Parcel of French Buttons out, and bid me put them by, and give me some odd Buttons to put into the Drawer?</p>
               <p>Mr. Cornthwite. I don't remember any such Circumstance, Mr. D -</p>

               <p>Court. Record his Default - It seems to cast a Reflection on the Prisoner, that his Father-in-Law chuses to forfeit 40 l. rather than appear.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have put my Master in a Method of marking each Piece, and deducting what was cut off, to prevent his Servants from wronging him - He never pretended he had lost any Thing, till I was taken up - I submitted to the low Drudgery of cleaning out his Drawers, with no other Design, than to get an Insight into his Business, which I intended to set up for my Self; and when he heard of it, he shew'd his ill Will in aspersing and bespattering my Character.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Did you intend to turn Taylor? - My Lord he is not capable of it. He was brought up a Mercer; and I never heard a Word of his having such a Design before he was sent to Newgate-He has endeavour'd to throw an Imputation of Malice upon me; but -</p>
               <p>Court. You need not give your self any trouble about that, for he has made no such thing appear.</p>
               <p>The Reverend Mr. Morgan. I am desired to appear, and do that Justice to the Prisoner's Character as I believe he deserves. I have known him several Years. All his Acquaintance have represented his Character in a favourable Light. So far as my Station and Function can be supposed to have an Insight into a Man's Character, whom I have had a long Intimacy with, I believe him to be an honest Man, and I believe all his Acquaintance have the same Opinion of him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Truby. I served him with Wine when he kept a Coffee-house, and he paid me very honestly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Newel. I lived with him at Mr. Langley's on Ludgate-Hill, and he behav'd well there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Herbert. He was my Apprentice, and served me 7 Years faithfully. He has been gone from me 7 or 8 Years, and I have heard nothing amiss of him since.</p>

I ask'd him if he came about the Letter that was sent the Day before; he said, Yes? I came from the Person who sent it. Do you know him? says I. Yes, says he, very well. Then pray sit down, says I, and I'll send for Reby and his Master. The Prisoner upon that appear'd uneasy, and wanted to withdraw. No, says I, you must stay now. Sure you won't seize me, says he. Indeed but I will, says I. Then he began to turn his Tale, and said, that he did not come directly from the Person who sent the Letter. That he knew him to be a very wicked Fellow, and knew several others of the Gang who had threatned to swear Sodomy against Reby, and therefore he came purely to save the Young Man's Reputation. I told him, if that was the Case, he would do a very commendable thing to discover them. Then Mr. Waldo and Reby came in with my Lord-Mayor's Warrant, and I quitted the Room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had receiv'd an Injury from the Person who sent the Letter, and therefore was resolv'd to render Reby all the Service I could. And Mr. Tidmarsh told me, that I should be well rewarded.</p>
               <p>Mr. Tidmarsh Yes if you discover'd the Person who sent the Letter; and you said you were well acquainted with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. But some of you prevented me, by putting it in the News; and then the Fellow ran away - when you ask'd me to sit down, I only said I was going to Leaden hall Market.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any Body can prove, that the Prisoner wrote or sent this Letter?</p>
               <p>Mr. Tidmarsh. No, we were a little too hasty in seizing him, before we had made a full Discovery.</p>

               <p>The following WATER, having for a Series of Years perform'd numberless Cures, on Persons, who have despair'd of any, is now sold at the Request of the said Persons, who have been cur'd of the following Distempers, viz. the Itch, tho' never so bad; the Leprosy, and all scorbutick Humours or Breakings-out. It would be too tedious to enumerate the many Cures it has effected in all Sorts of Ulcers, Fistula's, Green-Wounds, Burns and Scalds, when all other Remedies have fail'd. It is of so pleasant a Smell, and so innocent, that taken inwardly it is a certain Cure for Agues in any Kind.</p>
               <p>N.B. Two Persons who belong'd to the several Hospitals upwards of five Years, for the Cure of the Evil, viz. at St. Bartholomew's, under the Care of Mr. Dobyns, &amp;c. at St. Thomas's and in Guy's Hospitals, under the Care of the several Surgeons, and at last turn'd out as Incurable, one having great Holes in the Throat, and the other eat thro' the Nose, Check, &amp;c. and a Boy with a Scald-Head, who was likewise turn'd out of St. Thomas's Hospital, deem'd Incurable, were Cured by the above mentioned Water, in a short Time; and several have lately been cur'd of the Rheumatism, by bathing the Part infected, and taking about 20 Drops inwardly, three times a Week; and for the Satisfaction of any labouring under the same dreadful Distempers, they are ready to attest the same. To be enquir'd after at Mr. Bunn's, Pastry-cook in Cheap side, near St. Paul's; where only the above-mentioned WATER is to be had. Price 1 s. 6 d. the Bottle.</p>
               <p>Dr. Newman's famous Anti venereal Pill.</p>
               <p>Which to the Surprize of all that takes it, Cures all degrees and Symptoms of the Venereal Disease, whether of long Continuance, or fresh Contracted; it speedily removes all Pains in the Head, Ams, or Legs; takes off the Heat of Urine, Soreness, Running, Cordee, and Inflammation of the Parts; without an Hour's Confinement; Nay, if you are broke out in Scabs, Blotches, Carbuncles, having Nodes, Tumours, Buboes, Shankers, Pockywarts, Phymoses, Paraphymoses, Ulcers in the Mouth, Nose, Throat or Palate, in a few days you will be well; there or four are sufficient in any gentle fresh Infection; But in worse Cases, or when the Distemper is in the Blood, a few more is requir'd for a Cure. There is but one in a Dose, the Bignss of a Pea, and pleasant to take; sold at so easy a Price as only two Shillings Each. I have likewise an Electuary which may be taken by the weakest Constitution or Nicest Palate, with delight. It instantly cures all Diseases of the Brest and Lungs; as Coughs, Colds, Wheezings, Asthma's, Shortness of Breath, Consumptions; restores lost Appetite, purifies the Blood, and procures a good Complexion; and a strong vigorous Habit of Body, enlivening the Faculties and strengthening the Brain; and by that means helps the Memory; sold at only two Shillings and Six-pence the Gallypot: with Directions, and, Infallible Medicine for the Ague. Attendance is given every Day by the Author at his House, at the Blue Ball in Hand-Court, almost over against Great-Turnstile Holborn.</p>
               <p>Note, I have a sweet scented Ointment which perfectly Cures the Itch, or Itchy Breakings out. Advice Gratis.</p>
