               <p>Court. Describe the gelding.</p>
               <p>Stock. It was a black gelding with a star upon his forehead and one white heel: he has been rowelled behind; but he is a remarkable horse, about fourteen hands and an half high, rather better. The stable was broke into through a brick wall, and then he had shot the bolt of the look back and left the door open: I heard of it between eight and nine o'clock: the stable was about a mile from my house: I went to Smithfield about three o'clock: I had had no intelligence of my horse: I suspected he would bring him there: I had not been in Smithfield above ten minutes when I saw the prisoner come riding upon one horse and leading mine: a man asked him the price of my horse; he asked nine guineas: the man asked where he brought the horse from; he said, from Waltham Abbey: the prisoner tied my horse up to the rails: the man asked him how long he had had the horse; he said, ever since the Monday se'nnight before: I told the man that asked the price that the horse was stolen, I told several people to take care the prisoner did not get away, whilst I went for a constable: I charged a constable with him: he said, at first, that he bought the horse at a sale at the White-horse at Chigwell the Monday was se'nnight before: this was on Friday: I told him it was my horse, and that I saw him on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that was your horse?</p>

               <p>Stock. No, I lost a sack with the horse, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200004"/> no bridle nor saddle: I found the sack with my mark upon it at the prisoner's lodgings.</p>

Yes; it was a remarkable moonlight<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200005"/> light night: I passed him about ten yards: he followed me and forced a conversation with me: he asked me if there were many hares and partridges about: I was not fond of talking with him; I said yes or no to him, and so on: when I came to the style at the end of the third field, I thought I heard something like the snick of a gun: I was quite surprized: I turned round and said, God, I thought I heard something snick like a gun; why, yes, says he, I thought so too: I repeated it several times, and so did he; at last, says he, I believe it was only an owl in the tree; the style was nailed to a tree: I walked up the fourth field and he followed me: I was going to open a gate at the end of the field that went into another grove; the prisoner fired at me: I reeled a little: I looked up and saw the pistol in his hand: he had turned and was going to strike me with the but end of it: I was stunned with the firing of the pistol, so that I don't know whether he hit me or not; if he did, I did not feel it.

            ; the prisoner followed me to within about ten or fifteen yards of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any particular expressions that he made use of as he followed you?</p>
               <p>Parkinson. He said, as soon as I turned round, being wounded, There, d - n you, take that, and swore many more oaths. There was a light in Cawdell's house, and I believe a man was up; Cawdell and another man went home with me to my father's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you wounded?</p>
               <p>Parkinson. Yes; I have the coat in court that I wore at the time; the pistol was loaded with shot; some of the shot were extracted: he was quite close to me when he shot me: my father sent for Mr. Baker the surgeon, and then they went to take the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the surgeon here?</p>
               <p>Parkinson. No; he is a quaker, and won't take an oath.</p>
               <p>Q. from the jury. How long had you been at the public house?</p>
               <p>Parkinson. About two hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you quite sober?</p>
               <p>Parkinson. Yes; we had but three pints of beer among us; I had drank nothing before all day, (produces a light coat) this is the coat I wore at the time, (the coat has a great hole upon the shoulder near the top and is very much discoloured with the powder.) I have several of the shot now in my neck (he shows his wound to the jury.)</p>

            . On Saturday the 15th of December last, I locked up the house and took up the key: in the morning the maid came up to me and told me somebody had been in my house; I went down into the shop, there I saw the goods in the back compting-house; the holland and table linen were brought forward and laid at the end of the compter. There is nothing to be seen of a night; the shutters all shut up, and the compter locks, so that nothing is to be seen. There was one bundle of Irish in a wrapper, tied up like an handkerchief, laid close by the street door; the street door was pulled to; the goods that lay on the compter were brought out of the back compting-house, which had been broke open; a pannel was taken out, and the box of the lock was unscrewed and taken off. The holland, the muslin, the damask table linen, and the cambrick, were taken out of the compting-house. In the shop there were two locks off, and the side shutters broke; one on the right side, the other on the left: some printed furniture cottons were taken out of one side, and some callico wrappers on the other side, and two compters were broke open: the compter slaps stood up edge-ways: there were printed lawns, figured and corded dimities, silks, and silk burdets; silk and cotton handkerchiefs, silk handkerchiefs, and I think some checks; there were several sprigged muslins and figured lawns and nankeen cloth: the street door was pulled to, the chain taken off, and the lock unscrewed. Some bundles of Irish lay at the street door, and some muslin neckcloths: the irish was removed out of the compting-house, that was all that was left of about fifty pieces; there were about eight or nine pieces; the neckcloths came out of the compters in the first shop. There was a piece of wax candle burning upon a pile of sheeting in the compting-house; it was in a flat candlestick, and a candle in it alight that had been taken out of the kitchen, up two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the candle?</p>
               <p>Greenfield. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. What size was it?</p>
               <p>Greenfield. Rather bigger than a long six; there was about one part out of three left. I found the matches lay in a window of the bed-room up one pair of stairs in the back room. The window they got in at was nailed up quite round; that window looks into Mitre-Court. A pain of glass was taken out of a closet window, but there were iron bars and they could not get in; there were inside shutters to that window, which were pinned with iron pins over night; they were bursted open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock the street door yourself?</p>
               <p>Greenfield. No;

               <p>Q. Did she continue washing these things after the men were at her house?</p>

               <p>Greenfield. Yes; I understood so.

            ; we went into the one pair of stairs room with the son: Siday got out of bed and got under it in order to secret himself; we found Siday's wife there: the street door was upon the latch: we went up and they opened the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in bed?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Yes, I believe they were all together; Siday had his breeches and stockings on but nothing else: these goods were locked up: Siday gave me the key to open the drawers they were in (the goods produced) fourteen yards of holland, nine yards of irish, a remnant of sprig muslin, two yards; and eight neck-cloths; they were washed but had never been worn.</p>
               <p>Q. from Siday. Can you swear to them?</p>
               <p>Greenfield. They have been washed, but I lost of them</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. What are marked?</p>
               <p>Greenfield. The spring muslin is marked O | U. the holland I | U. the irish are cut into shifts; there are no marks to them; seven handkerchiefs are cut separate without any marks.</p>
               <p>Q. to Taylor. How long did you stay in this room?</p>
               <p>Taylor. About half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Mrs. Siday said, it was linen she bought; in opening another drawer, where there were some pistols, &amp;c. we found this ticket (producing it.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Greenfield. This was a ticket upon a piece of scotch holland sheeting, takes out of the compting-house.</p>
               <p>Taylor. I found a bullet mould, a brace of balls, and two powder horns; the pistols were found in a drawer of a chest of drawers; the ticket was found in the same place; Siday opened most of them himself, except the bottom drawer, where the pistols were: Burch was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200009"/> not taken till the Saturday se'nnight following; we had information where he lodged, in Plough Court, Gray's-Inn Lane: we went up stairs and enquired of Mrs. Burch for her husband; she said he was gone out of town; in about half an hour, or three quarters of an hour he came in; we found a vast quantity of goods there (producing them.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Here are two diaper table cloths marked, three damask cloths with my mark, a fine diaper piece of cloth with my mark, one piece of gulix holland with my mark. It will be almost impossible to find the marks of them all, they are in different places: I have looked them all over, most are marked; here is a whole piece of muslin with the mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. You mentioned there was a piece of fine diaper cloth, part of which were found at Dunster's?</p>
               <p>Greenfield. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any part of them, that are parts of a set found in any other people's custody?</p>
               <p>Greenfield. I don't know that there is; there were but two sets of diaper, the other set was in Siday's possession.</p>
               <p>Q. to Taylor. Where did you find these goods?</p>
               <p>Taylor. All in Burch's room; these two boxes were full, the rest were laying about.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That Siday was married the morning they were took.</p>
               <p>Taylor. We went to old Mrs. Siday's house on the seventeenth of January, about nine in the morning; her house is in Shoe Lane; Mr. Bond and I went together, she was washing; we asked for Mr. Siday; she said he was out; we told her we were informed there were some of Mr. Greenfield's goods in her house; she said, she knew nothing about it. We found these three bags of goods there (producing them). Mr. Greenfield looked at the things; she was washing, and said they were his.</p>
               <p>Q. to Taylor. Can you tell what quantity of things were found at Mr. Siday's?</p>
               <p>Taylor. A large quantity, more dry than wet; some were found in the two pair, some in the three pair of stairs; there were some in chests, some tied up in other things. One Jennings and his wife lodged there at that time, but not in the room in which we found these things: we told her they were Mr. Greenfield's things; she said, they were left there by a person. We staid there about two hours, then we took Siday and the things to Sir

               <p>Dunster. They said I was the woman they wanted; they asked me where I had them from; I said I did not know: Noakes asked me where Burch lived; I told them where Burch lived, but did not say I had the linen from Burch; I cannot swear to it I was so frightened.</p>

            . I live with my father in Brook-street, Ratcliff; he is a labouring man in a rope ground; my mother is dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been at service?</p>
               <p>Currell. Yes; about two years.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Currell. About a fortnight or three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any acquaintance with him?</p>
               <p>Currell. No further than taking milk of him: he <rs id="t17710220-14-deflabel82" type="occupation">served the neighbours with milk</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"
                        targets="t17710220-14-defend178 t17710220-14-deflabel82"/>. I know him no otherwise.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it he offered you the injury?</p>
               <p>Currell. I forget the day of the month; my father can tell, I cannot: it was on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it ago?</p>
               <p>Currell. It is going on a month. I had known him a fortnight before this happened. I live in Brook-street. About twelve at noon I was going from Brook-street to Norton-Falgate work-house. I met the prisoner upon the road a going from Brook-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that an open road?</p>
               <p>Currell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there no houses?</p>
               <p>Currell. No, not up the road; none along the road. I met him in the road talking to another man. He turn'd round and saw me, and said, How do you do young woman, how do you do, my dear? he asked me, where I was going; I said, to Norton Falgate: he made his obeisance to the man, and the man to him, and they parted; and he made up to me directly. He asked me again where I was going to; I said, to Norton Falgate work-house: he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200014"/> said he was going past there, and he would shew me the way: I had said I did not know the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him so?</p>
               <p>Currell. Yes; I never was there before in my life. I said I was obliged to him: When I came to Whitechapel, there was a turning on the right hand, that was the turning my father bid me turn down. He said that was not the right way, he knew a nearer way, and he would shew me. I told him I was obliged to him; I went with him; he took me from house to house afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it he carried you to first? Had you been into any house before this?</p>
               <p>Currell. He asked me coming up the road to drink, and said he was cold; I said I would rather not: he at last persuaded me to go to a house, and have a pint of two-penny.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that?</p>
               <p>Currell. At the King of Prussia, up the road, from Brook-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink?</p>
               <p>Currell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into any other house before you came into this turning?</p>
               <p>Currell. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the next house?</p>
               <p>Currell. I walked a good way; I did not know the houses we went into afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it when you went into the second house?</p>
               <p>Currell. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it pretty late in the afternoon?</p>
               <p>Currell. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the sign?</p>
               <p>Currell. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you there?</p>
               <p>Currell. A pint of two-penny; and then we went out and walked on a good way.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it on the road, or how?</p>
               <p>Currell. Through roads, streets and turnings; then we went into another house, he went to the bar, and called for some gin, and he drank a glass of it; then while the woman was pouring out another, he said, How do you do, madam? She looked at him. and said, How do you do again? He then asked me to have some, I would not, I went out; he also asked the woman to drink, she said no, she had rather not, and poured it back again; then he took up his money; we went in at one door, and out at another.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where that house was?</p>
               <p>Currell. No; he crossed a street, and went down another turning.</p>
               <p>Q. What o'clock was it by this time?</p>
               <p>Currell. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been walking with him?</p>
               <p>Currell. From the other house to this I believe about an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you have been in walking from Brook-street to the first house?</p>
               <p>Currell. About half an hour; not quite so much.</p>
               <p>Q. About an hour and a half in all?</p>
               <p>Currell. Yes; I believe so.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of you then?</p>
               <p>Currell. Then we kept walking along; he went into another house, and had a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that?</p>
               <p>Currell. I cannot tell; then we walked a good way further. I was taken very sick as I walked, all at once: he asked what was the matter with me. I said I was taken very sick: I said I had sat up on Monday night all night, to give my father a sweat, and being without victuals all night and all day made me sick. He said, he should come to a house where he was known, and would get something warm: then we came to a publick-house. I did not know the publick-house; there he had something to drink. I did not touch it: I was very sick: I puked in a corner of the house: the maid of the house brought me a little piece of beef-stake upon a piece of bread, and prayed me to eat it. I pulled off my hat and laid it on the table; the maid took it backwards. I said, Where is my hat, when I came to. She said, she had carried it into the kitchen: she fetched it to me, and asked me to go backwards into the kitchen. I said, I could not stay. Clark said, We must go. We stayed sometime in that house. I cannot tell rightly how long we staid; I fancy full two hours and a half: then we went out again and walked a good way, till we came to an old broken house where we went in; he went first, as he did all along; I followed him and thought it a thoroughfare.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where this house was?</p>
               <p>Currell. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know now where it is?</p>
               <p>Currell. No: I thought it was a thoroughfare; when he went in he said, Come along; then he turned himself round, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200015"/> put one hand round my waist, with the other hand he flung off my hat, and flung me down with main force among the bricks and stones and nastiness, and flung himself on me directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Currell. It was almost dusk; I was crying out Lord have mercy on me! Christ have mercy on me! I am ruined! He said, in the mean time. Humph! G - d d - n me, is there no entering into your body. Still I kept crying out, Lord have mercy on me, Christ have mercy on me! I am ruined! nobody came to my assistance. He put up; then I got up and stood at a broken place like a window, till I came to.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by, till you came to?</p>
               <p>Currell. I was in such pain and agony I did not know how to come to. I went with him down a road and up a street to a house in a court: there was a woman there said, how do you do Mr. Clark? he said, Mrs. Clark how do you do and your husband? she said, he was indifferent but was not come home. He said, will you take care of this young woman for all night? she said yes she would.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it quite dark by this time?</p>
               <p>Currell. It was between seven and eight; it wa s quite dark: afterwards he said good night; I made answer in my fright, pray are not you a coming in again? he said, no; you will know where to find me in the morning. I said, how shall I know where to find you? he said, very well: he bid me and Mrs. Clark good night; and went out; and they had some potatoes and butter and milk; they asked me to eat. I said I was obliged to her I could not touch any thing; she put two potatoes in the fire, and asked me to eat them. I said I could not. She said she would make me some toast and butter if I could eat it; I told her I could touch nothing: she asked me afterwards if I would go to bed? I told her no: then she asked me again, I said in a minute or two; in the mean time I sat see-sawing in the chair in great agony, wringing my hands, and stamping my feet, and crying. I told her in the morning how I had been used; she said she durst say nothing on account of her husband: then I went to bed, I fancy between nine and ten o'clock. About three in the morning I mentioned it to her; I was ashamed to mention it before her father and her husband.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not mention her father and husband before.</p>
               <p>Currell. Yes, I did. About three o'clock her husband, her children and father were fast asleep.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the husband and wife lie in the same bed?</p>
               <p>Currell. No; I lay with the wife. I told her how I had been used in every shape. I cried; the woman said he had been a great blackguard, for if it had been her own husband she would not have took his part. Between seven and eight in the morning I got up and came to my cousin's at Norton Falgate workhouse, where I had been going on Wednesday morning. My cousin came with me to this woman's house where I was left.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that?</p>
               <p>Currell. In Duke's Court.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your cousin's name?</p>
               <p>Currell. Currell. She and I went to Mrs. Beslington's brouse. She lives in Webb's Court. She desired us to go to this woman's to enquire after this man.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is Webb's Court to where this Mrs. Clark lives?</p>
               <p>Currell. About a quarter of a mile. She did not go with us; she was dressing her husband's dinner. We were to go to Clark's to enquire the character of the prisoner; when we came there my cousin said, How do you do ma'm? she asked in what form I was brought in? whether I was in liquor? she said no; I was over-frightened; for I had been used very ill. My cousin asked her is he was a single or married man? she said a married man; and had a wife and three or four children. My cousin asked where he lived? she said somewhere about Whitechapel, she did not know where. This woman told my cousin how I see-sawed in the chair, wrung my hands, stamped my feet, and cried. She told my cousin when she went to bed to me the bed shook under me, and she never saw a poor creature tremble as I did. I told her in the mean time what I had lost in endeavouring to get from him. I lost a double flounced silk handkerchief, a silk and cotton handkerchief, and a pair of gloves; then my cousin went home and went to her sister's; this man had been to this Mrs. Clark's to enquire after me about ten o'clock that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200016"/> morning; this was Tuesday night; he came, as I was informed, on Wednesday morning; he said he would go to the publick house facing the workhouse, and see if he could see me, when he went to my father's; my cousin said she would go to him to know.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she mean by that?</p>
               <p>Currell. To know what he meant by taking me out of my road.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it not to know if he would make you any satisfaction?</p>
               <p>Currell. Yes; we did not see him; then we went back to my cousin's house; he went to my father's, and said he wanted to make me amends to marry me. My father asked him what terms he came upon, and what he meant? he said he wanted to marry me and make me amends. Then my father said I do not know what you mean by making amends; what have you done to my child? my father did not know but what he had killed me. My cousin sent him a letter on Wednesday night. He had it on Thursday in the evening. My father was so lame he could not come to me; he sent a neighbour that lives opposite us; she was coming to Whitechapel; she came to my cousin's and told me I could not tell her more than she had heard; he had told all over the place how he had been with me. My father said, if you have done my child any harm how can you make her amends when you have a wife and three or four children? He came to my father's several times with two or three friends. He could not rest till he saw me. I saw my father on Thursday when I came home.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you tell your father what had happened to you?</p>
               <p>Currell. No. The woman told my father. I was ashamed to tell him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he come to your father?</p>
               <p>Currell. This was on Tuesday. He came on Wednesday morning about ten o'clock; he kept coming all the day. He came on Wednesday and Thursday till he did see me. A neighbour went with my cousin and me the second time: when we came she told the very same how I had been ill used in every shape. The prisoner was in my father's house when I came home; which was on Thursday night; I came home with this neighbour, Mrs. Bevington. I found the prisoner at my father's. I was low spirited. I fell a crying. I went into a neighbour's house to endeavour to see my father: before I came in I was informed the prisoner was in my father's house. I did not like to see him for his ill usage to me. I staid a little in the neighbour's house. I went into my father's house; he was a coming in. I went and kissed my father and fell a crying immediately. The prisoner said, Don't cry my dear; I will marry you and make you amends; do not take on. I said, how can you marry me when you have a wife and three or four children? a man with him said, before God he has no wife or chick or child; he is no more married than I am married. This man and he went away; he came next morning; but before he came he sent a letter to me, appointing to meet at the Black boy at Stepney. I said, where is he? why don't he come himself? what does he mean by sending his letters to me? why don't he come to my father? the man made answer again and said, he is somewhere about the neighbourhood, he is not far off; one of my brothers came in in the mean time; the man that brought the letter said, we two will go and see for him; he is not far off: while they were gone to seek for him

             came in. My father was gone to Shadwell. He sat till the officer came and said to me he wanted to speak a word or two a-side. I was against it; but however Mrs. Wetherall said, you may hear what he has to say; just go into my house: she said it is a town talk already; you need not make it more public. I went into the house, and he went with me; her house joined to my father's: when he went in he said, Well; I hope you will not be hard hearted; I hope you will make it up; and said, I am very sorry that I have ill used you so bad as I have. I said, you have been very cruel to me; and used me in a very bad manner: he could not deny it. I said, every thing you have done, you have done by main force, and all against my will. He could not deny it; all his cry was, he would marry me and make me amends. The officer came and took him; he was not in the house above three minutes before the officer came. They went into a public house. While he was there, he ask'd my father to make it up. My father said, it was out of his power, as he had been before the justice. We went to the justice on Thursday night, and had a warrant granted to take him. The officer went after him that night, but could not find him. He took him on Friday morning: he put his hands together, and told the justice he never<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200017"/> had chick nor child: he was sent to prison, and this Clark, where I laid all night, was sent for by the justice; she told the justice the same thing as she told my cousin: the justice asked her twice whether I was not in liquor when I was brought in: she said, no. The justice asked why I did not come home. I told him I was in such a pickle that I was ashamed to come home.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is it this Mrs. Clark lives?</p>
               <p>Currell. In Duke's Court, Kingsland Road.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is that to Norton Falgate?</p>
               <p>Currell. It may be a mile from Norton Falgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you found out whether the man is married?</p>
               <p>Currell. His wife and four children came down to my father's.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had not been married, I suppose you would have accepted of that satisfaction?</p>
               <p>Currell. I should not, because of his ill usage.</p>
               <p>Q. You tell us you sat up all night with your father?</p>
               <p>Currell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not eat any thing?</p>
               <p>Currell. No, nothing but two or three dishes of tea in the morning: I had not had a bit of bread in my mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pints of beer did you drink part of?</p>
               <p>Currell. About three pints of two-penny, and one pint of beer: there were two publick-houses I did not taste any at.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you used to drink two-penny?</p>
               <p>Currell. I am not used to drink at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know what was the matter with you when you turned so sick?</p>
               <p>Currell. I thought being without victuals, and drinking a little two-penny.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew, when you sat out, did not you, how far it was from Stepney to Norton-Falgate work-house?</p>
               <p>Currell. I did not know.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew your cousin lived there?</p>
               <p>Currell. Yes, but did not know the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not they tell you how far it was?</p>
               <p>Currell. They told me which turning to turn down.</p>
               <p>Q. You walked for a long while before you got into the second public-house?</p>
               <p>Currell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you begin to doubt whether he was carrying you the right way?</p>
               <p>Currell. I had not the least suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. Not till you got to that ruinous house?</p>
               <p>Currell. I had not the least suspicion even then.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he behave to you upon the road; did he offer you no civilities?</p>
               <p>Currell. No, he did not even brush my cloaths: he only said. Come along, come along.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he never kiss you?</p>
               <p>Currell. No, he did not offer to touch me.</p>
               <p>Q. I wonder you should go with a man you knew so little of, to so many public-houses?</p>
               <p>Currell. I did not know that he had any wicked thoughts any more than I had. I did not think but he was going to carry me right.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you found out where this house was?</p>
               <p>Currell. No, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other houses near this house?</p>
               <p>Currell. It was a lone house. After I came out of it there were some white rails on the left-hand side, that is all I can tell of it: it was in a sort of a road.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you suppose that was a thorough-fare, an old ruinous house on a road.</p>
               <p>Currell. I could not tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the truth of the matter this, that this beer had got into your head?</p>
               <p>Currell. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I cannot think that a modest young girl would have gone about with this man if she was sober. I should think this beer had got into your head?</p>
               <p>Currell. I don't remember it did.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you have forgot. Have you found out any of these houses?</p>
               <p>Currell. Yes, I found out one; the Barking Dogs.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the people here?</p>
               <p>Currell. No, I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not subpoena'd Mrs. Clark?</p>
               <p>Currell. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mrs. Basington here?</p>
               <p>Currell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And Mrs. Wetheral, who is she?</p>
               <p>Currell. The woman that fetched me home.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury. I did not press her to give any particular account of her usage till I heard the general out-lines of her story. If you chuse it I will now ask her as to the particular part.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200018"/>Q. from Jury. You say he went first all the way, you followed him?</p>
               <p>Currell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is this old house from Mrs. Clark's?</p>
               <p>Currell. We were about half an hour going there.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get there?</p>
               <p>Currell. He turned round and asked me to lay hold of his arm. I said, I was greatly obliged to him: I did take hold of his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know this Mrs. Clark before?</p>
               <p>Currell. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you think it a little extraordinary to be left in the house of Mrs. Clark, a woman you never saw before, all night?</p>
               <p>Currell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you ask him if he was coming back again?</p>
               <p>Currell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing he had not had a wife and children, would not you have married him?</p>
               <p>Currell. I should not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see nobody pass nor repass, in the course of the time you went from this ruinous house, to Mrs. Clark's?</p>
               <p>Currell. I recollect there were two or three women walking along that called, and said, I should lose something: my white handkerchief was unpinned. I took and pinned it: they said, I should loose something that was hanging behind me, so I pinned my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he tell you he was going to after he brought you out of this ruinous house?</p>
               <p>Currell. He said nothing to me. I thought he was going to my cousin at Norton-Falgate.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to agree to stay at Mrs. Clark's that night; you did not know but you might be used ill by this man again, if he came back?</p>

               <p>Currell. I was not capable of walking any where, I was in such pain and agony, and my cloaths were so black and dirty.</p>
               <p>Court. This was night you know: had you any money in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Currell. I had but one six-pence in the last public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do you any injury?</p>
               <p>Currell. He took up my petticoats. When he was forcing me against my will he cried, humbh.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what is meant by carnally knowing a woman?</p>
               <p>Currell. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You must. let me know what he did to you; you say he forced you against your will: how and in what manner. Did he enter your body?</p>
               <p>Currell. Yes, a minute or two after he had spoke those words.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever been served in this manner by any other man?</p>
               <p>Currell. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever examined after this by any surgeon, or any woman?</p>
               <p>Currell. My cousin Besington saw me.</p>
               <p>Q. Consider what you are swearing: I very much doubt whether you was quite sober. Are you able to swear he entered your body?</p>
               <p>Currell. That I am very sensible of.</p>
               <p>Q. What resistance did you make?</p>
               <p>Currell. I cried, Lord have mercy on me, am ruined, and Christ have mercy on me; ruined. I did endeavour to get from him I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Your hands were at liberty, wy not?</p>
               <p>Currell. Yes, and I endeavoured with him off, but could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your cousin Currell?</p>
               <p>Currell. In the work-house.</p>

I sent a letter to her father, in which I desired him to come to me and I would let him know particulars: he could not come, so he sent a neighbour next day. He did not receive the letter till the next day. It was sent by the penny post. I went with them to Mrs. Clark's house: I asked her whether she was in liquor, and how she behaved. Mrs. Clark said, No, She was frightened; that she trembled and wrung her hards, and shook so, that she was sorry to see her, and that when she went to bed the bed shook under her. I asked her if she had told her how things were. She said, Not till she went to bed. Then she told her the prisoner had used her very ill: shsaid she was as cold as death.</p>

He said he was in liquor, and she was in liquor, and he could not tell whether he had done any thing to her or not; but he would shew her where her sister was, for he had left her in Duke's Court, at one Mrs. Clark's. He came to the father, and all his cry was, Father, where is your daughter? Her father said, he could nor tell, he ought to know best. I went to the house, and found her in a striped bed-gown, wringing her hands, and walking about the room. The woman was making the bed. This was on Thursday. On Friday he was taken up. He came to the father's house about nine o'clock: he was talking about marrying her, and sat down close by her; she said she could not consent, because he had used her so ill.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the only objection?</p>
               <p>Wetherall. Yes, the only one that I know of; and not only so, but she heard he had a wife and children. He wanted to speak with her: she went to the entry with him. I went into our house with her; he would say nothing while I was there. I went up stairs: she said to him, You know you have used me very cruelly, and I did not consent till the last minute, nor that minute neither.</p>

She said she would treat me with another pint of beer there; we had another pint of beer there. I said, that was Norton Falgate. She said she would follow me, and go along with me. She followed me; I could not get rid of her; she laid hold of me, and put her hand in my breeches; and she followed me at night again: there I left her. She would follow me at every place.

            . I live at Mr. Sodoway's, the Barking Dogs, in Tabernacle Walk, Moorfields. The prisoner and this girl came into our house together; they went into the back parlour. The woman was very fond of the man; she put her hand in his right bosom, and after that she asked for a lodgin g. We told her we had none. She fell asleep, and hit her head two or three times. The prisoner jostled her, to awake her. I said, he would make her sick. He said, No, he wanted her to get up, to go with her friends.</p>

I saw the woman sitting with one hand round his neck, and the other hand in his bosom; they were drinking together. I went into the kitchen; the maid came a second time to me, and desired me to go and see what they were at: I found her retching then: I saw nothing farther.

            . I am sister-in-law to the prisoner. He brought this woman to my house between six and seven o'clock in the evening; she was very much in liquor. She seem'd to be very fond of him. When he came in he held the door in his hand; she wanted him to sit down; he went away. She went to bed about seven o'clock; she fell asleep while she was eating. She slept all night, from seven o'clock till seven in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she awake you at three o'clock, and tell you how she had been used by this man?</p>

               <p>Clark. No, not a word. She said in the morning she had an aunt at Norton Falgate workhouse that she went to see. She told me that she had a great regard for Clark, and that her father had given her a holiday, and she chose to spend it in his company. She said she had a great liking to him, on account of his crying milk so prettily. About three o'clock in the afternoon a woman came with her that she called her aunt; her aunt told me more than she had done.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not you tell her aunt that she was very sober when she came to your house?</p>
               <p>Clark. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you say she was very much frightened?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you tell her aunt that as soon as your husband and father were asleep, she told you how she had been used?</p>
               <p>Clark. I did not. They came and brought some purl.</p>
               <p>Q. They did not make you in liquor, did they?</p>

I was a servant to Mr. Stratford in January last; I was housemaid; the night before the twelfth of January last the house was broke open; they got in at the fore-kitchen window; there is an area before it; it was fast when I went to bed about ten o'clock; the things were taken off from the window, it was an outside shutter; I saw it about eight o'clock.

Cannon came for his cloaths; and when he went I saw Siday stand at the corner of the street. The night before he went away he wanted me to let him go out to stay all night after the family were gone to bed; he came in about eleven o'clock.

            . I live with Mr. Stratford; when I got up on the twelfth of January, I was some time before I got into the room; I looked about and saw the press burst open; the mustard castor was split; and I thought the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200024"/> cats were got in. I remember I lock'd up all safe the night before. I took the key out and found the lock was broke open. I missed the plate. I was much surprised and went into the street hall. I saw Mr. Stratford's closet door; I believe he always keeps the key; I saw the hall door open; I shut the door; I saw the housekeeper's door open, and the plate chest was burst open; the window in the area had the sash burst open and the cords were hanging to it; the hinges on one side of the shutter were broke; when I came down I saw some specks of wax about the hall. and some dirt, which had not been there over night. I had been there but ten or eleven days when this affair happened. I had the care of the press in the hall; I had two pint silver cups, four salts, four shovels, two castors, a sugar and mustard castor, a bread basket, half a dozen table spoons, a large scallop bowl, a soup spoon, and a long spoon, two small hand waiters, and two candlesticks, French plate; what were taken out of the housekeeper's room I don't know.</p>

            . I went to bed between twelve and one o'clock. I understood and believed the house was locked. My servant came in the morning and alarmed me. I endeavoured to save my wife and the women servants; the maid servant went down stairs. I followed her soon after. I found my door was forced open and every thing of consequence was gone; I set forth a number of things in the indictment upon recollection, but I have lost many other articles that I cannot recollect (all the articles in the indictment severally read, which Mr. Stratford deposed to.) I took the prisoner Cannon into my service at Bath: he seemed very desirous to come to live with me for fear of being pressed. I discharged him at London on the second of January, I think; he came in very much flushed with liquor; I never keep a servant that does so; therefore I discharged him immediately. He hired himself to me by the name of John; I have heard his real name is Luke.</p>

               <p>Levi. A great deal was not sterling; it was uncertain silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Which?</p>
               <p>Levi. The buttons were not.</p>
               <p>Q. How much might all you call uncertain silver amount to?</p>
               <p>Levi. I can't tell.</p>

            ?</p>
               <p>Levi. Yes; a gold snuff box; two seals, broke to pieces; a head of a cane and a gold button I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. These you had of

             at the same time you had the silver?</p>
               <p>Levi. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that standard?</p>
               <p>Levi. I believe some of it was French gold. I gave three pounds and sold it for three pounds again. I lost thirty shillings by it; there were several suits of cloaths and two pair of pistols which I bought of Cannon and Siday.</p>
               <p>Court. Did they say how they came by them?</p>
               <p>Levi. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bars of the kitchen broke?</p>
               <p>Levi. Yes; and the cock was broke off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any coat of arms or crest engraved upon it?</p>
               <p>Levi. I believe there was; but I can't read or write.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to make this discovery?</p>
               <p>Levi. Saunders came and said, if I wanted two or three hundred pounds he would give it me; he would lay it out for me; I was a little in liquor; I went with this man to a public house; he was to shew me some diamond buckles, and all the while they were nothing but paste. I went to a public house; he told me to stop there for a moment; when I came back from the public house Cannon and Siday would not give me the buckles.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is this Saunders?</p>
               <p>Levi. I don't see him here.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they to take you up?</p>
               <p>Levi. I told Saunders, and he discovered me. I never saw the diamond buckles; I saw the rings; they shewed me one pair of paste, which they said were diamond buckles, and three diamond rings; I believe there were nine in all.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give for the plate?</p>
               <p>Levi. Four shillings an ounce.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. You are certain you bought it of these two men?</p>
               <p>Levi. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Both were acting together about it?</p>
               <p>Levi. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you seen them?</p>
               <p>Levi. Two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. You had seen Jacobs as often as them?</p>
               <p>Levi. Yes; I have known him twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must know him very well?</p>
               <p>Levi. Yes; I know him by sight very well.</p>
               <p>Q. As they were not diamonds, describe them?</p>
               <p>Levi. There was one large ring, and one diamond ring; then there was another they told me was a diamond one; and there were two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200026"/> mourning rings and a plain ring; I believe there were nine in all in a little case.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know them again if you saw them?</p>

               <p>Bond. I found five loaded pistols in the same drawer. The Jew then told us who he had sold the plate to, namely, Lazarus Jacob's son. I went and took them both. He said Lazarus was present one of the times he went there.</p>

            . On Friday the 18th of July, the day after Mr. Stratford was robbed, Mr. Stratford called, and desired Mr. Turner, who is partners with the prisoner Glannon, might be enquired of by Sir John, to see if he could find any of Mr. Stratford's property. From Mr. Turner's account, it appeared that his partner Glannon was the principal acquaintance of Cannon. Mr. Glannon was sent for; he said he had left a box there. Sir John sent me with Glannon to his house: he carried me through the shop into a kind of back warehouse close by the door: he scratched up the earth (the place had no flooring) to about five or six inches, and then took out this box (producing a box sealed up.) It is now sealed with my seal. He had told Sir John that there was a box; and he told me, I think, as we were going along, that there was a pair of buckles ( Opens the box, and produces a pair of diamond buckles and a drop.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Stratford. These are mine; the buckles contain just the same number of stones that I had given notice of.</p>
               <p>Leigh. Mr. Glannon took these knee-buckles (producing them;) they were tuck'd in at a cavity between the board and the wall; they are not diamonds.</p>

               <p>Leigh. They were so far concealed, that I told Sir John, when I came back, that if I had gone with a warrant to search the house, I should not have found either the one or the other. I asked Glannon whether that was all Cannon had left with him; he several times said, Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. from the jury. Did he say he received them himself from Cannon?</p>
               <p>Mr. Stratford. He said Cannon and himself had hid them there.</p>

               <p>Q. Glannon came voluntarily, without a warrant?</p>
               <p>Leigh. There was no warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. And mentioned these buckles at once?</p>
               <p>Leigh. I can't tell exactly: he told Sir John, Cannon had been there either on Sunday or Tuesday, or both: I don't recollect whether he said one or both; and he said he had left a box there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say anything of Cannon's having taken a lodging at his house?</p>
               <p>Leigh. No; he mentioned him with a kind of indignation. He said, that when they were partners before, Cannon went from him, and owed him money. He spoke at first of Cannon as being an unworthy man, that he did not chuse to have connection with.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you he was coming to give information to Sir John, if he had not been sent for?</p>

               <p>Q. I think you say he said he was present when the buckles were hid?</p>
               <p>Leigh. He said, Cannon and he hid them. He said, as to the knee-buckles, Cannon had made him a present of them for himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you how long they had been had?</p>
               <p>Leigh. Either on the Sunday or the Tuesday: it was on Friday that Mr. Stratford was robbed. Cannon came there on Sunday or Tuesday, and then they hid these buckles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell Sir John he was then coming to give information?</p>

            . I am a carpenter and undertaker. On the day that Mr. Stratford came to town, I was sent for to put some window-curtains up. On the 26th of December, I saw Cannon in the house then, for the first time. I was in the kitchen at Mr. Stratford's. His late coachman and another man were going down to Tothil Fields Bridewell. I was going that way, and said I would walk with them. We all three went in and enquired for Cannon. Cannon was in the kitchen. We sat down with him, and called for some beer. Cannon drank with us. One word brought up another. Mr. Stratford's coachman was talking with Cannon, and Cannon told him several things that he asked him. He asked him what time they came in that morning; Cannon said, about two o'clock. He asked him how long they were in the house; Cannon said, they did not come out till almost seven. The coachman asked how many there might be in the house; he said, six, and every man had a loaded pistol. He said, it was a happy affair that Mr. Stratford's people were not alarmed; for if they had, they must have been all murdered. He said, that if Mr. Stratford would admit him principal evidence, he could impeach sixteen or more that were in the gang, and tell where every thing was.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the coachman, or any body, persuade him to tell this?</p>
               <p>Grant. Tomlin said, You may as well tell the truth; and if you can be admitted an evidence, you shall.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you should not have made use of it, it is not right.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that Cannon had said nothing about this robbery before the coachman had advised him to be an evidence?</p>
               <p>Grant. He did not say he was in the house when the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Siday's Defence.</p>
               <p>One Sunday, I can't justly tell the day of the month, my brother, and two more young men, came up to me before I was out of bed. I got up, and let them in. They brought in some things: they told me they had been helping a young man to move that was afraid of having his goods seized. He asked me to let him leave them: being my brother, I let him put them into the closet. The next day he brought out the things, and asked me to buy them: he said it was plate: I said I would. I weighed it with the weights and scales that are in court. The Jew came up to me; I asked him if he would buy it of me; he said, Yes. I sold it to him; he paid me the money for the plate and the cloaths. He asked me if I woul d sell him the diamonds; I told him, Yes. I asked him four hundred pounds for them; he said he would give it me. He brought Sir John's men, and took me to goal. Mr. Glannon knew nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Cannon's Defence.</p>
               <p>About three days before Sir John's men took me up, I met this

             and his brother in Fleet-street. They asked where I was going to; I said into the country. Siday told me they were going to look for a room, and asked me if I knew any body that had a room to let; I said an acquaintance of mine had. I went with them to New-street, Covent-Garden; to Glannon's house: they gave him the box. At the same time he said he had four rooms to let backwards: I told him I had two friends with me that wanted a room or two. Glannon and they and I went backwards; nobody else was in the shop. They looked at the rooms, and agreed to give him 4 s. 6 d. a week for the two rooms. Somebody knock'd at the shop; Glannon came down, and we staid up behind. Upon our coming down, this Siday goes into the shed that is backwards; he was to have the use of it. Siday and his brother and I went in, I came out before them, and then they put the buckles, I suppose, in that place. That very night I came home to Siday's house; I was in liquor; he persuaded me to lie down upon his bed. I took off my coat and waistcoat, and laid down upon his bed. I had nothing upon my head, though Mr. Bond says I had a night cap. I slept two or three hours before Sir

We sent a note first, he did not come, I suppose he was not at home; we sent another messenger, and then Glannon came down.

I saw one of them with Cannon at the shed door: they were doing something there, what I did not know at that time. I was called into the shop to serve a customer.

I heard nothing more of it till Friday, then a person came to me with a note from Tothill Fields Bridewell.

I took the buckles up, and went to Sir John's; he committed me. I desired Mr. Turner to go home, and in a bag which contained hair powder he would find a sixty pound bank note: I sent for it that it might not be sold with a pound of powder. On the Friday following I had a boy came to me from Newgate with a letter to acquaint me that there was a shirt buckle wrapped up in a piece of paper on a shelf, and desired me to send for it. Accordingly the next time I saw Mr. Turner, I acquainted him that I had such intelligence, and bid him see if he could find it, to take it to Sir John's; and if he could not find an owner for it, to bring it to me.

I saw a lot of wearing apparel on the 11th of January in Marybone: I could not buy it myself; I had not money. I went to Lazarus Jacobs on Sunday, and told him of it; he said if I would call in the morning he would give me money, or go with me. Lazarus Jacobs was out, so Jacob Jacobs went with me: he said he must not trust me with the money, but must go with me, and lay the money out. He went with me to Castle street, and laid out twelve guineas for me. From there we went to an eating house in Chandois-street, St. Martin's lane, a cook's shop. We got there about two o'clock, or a little after two. We staid there till between five and six. First I eat my dinner, and then we ripped off the lace, and sorted the clothes. I saw

               <p>Callinger. They were eating.</p>
               <p>Court. Why do you remember it being the 14th of January?</p>
               <p>Callinger. Because I had some business to do there with Mr. Myers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know of the Jacobs being taken up?</p>
               <p>Callinger. Not till I was subpoena'd.</p>
               <p>Q. What had they with them?</p>
               <p>Callinger. Some bundles; I cannot say what was in the bundles; I did not see them opened. I staid there an hour and a half, or two hours: I left them there: I came away between four and five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. How long have you lived in Rosemary Lane?</p>

               <p>Callinger. I did not take notice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not?</p>
               <p>Callinger. Because I did not go there about any business in particular.</p>

               <p>Callinger. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Levi says he did not know the Christian there: did you speak to him?</p>
               <p>Callinger. I cannot tell whether I did or no.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be subpoena'd?</p>
               <p>Callinger. Because I was in company.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they know that?</p>
               <p>Callinger. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not somebody talk to you, and ask you whether you was in company there or no?</p>
               <p>Callinger. Myers asked me whether I remembered the day; and Myers told me the day I was there with him.</p>
               <p>Q. So you did not remember the day Myers bid you bring that receipt?</p>
               <p>Callinger. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is that receipt?</p>
               <p>Callinger. In a book at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other conversation with Myers about it?</p>
               <p>Callinger. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave you the subpoena?</p>
               <p>Callinger. A young man gave it me.</p>
               <p>Q. Somebody you did not know?</p>
               <p>Callinger. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the subpoena given you?</p>
               <p>Callinger. On Wednesday last.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you tell what you was to appear for?</p>
               <p>Callinger. I was subpoena'd to appear here.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you guess how they came to subpoena you?</p>
               <p>Callinger. It struck in my head directly: Myers told me before that I should be subpoena'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the last receipt you had?</p>
               <p>Callinger. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. It was an eating-house you say?</p>
               <p>Callinger. Yes.</p>

               <p>Callinger. A bag.</p>

            . I am a chapman in Rosemary-lane. I was at an eating-house in Chandois-street on the fourteenth of January. Mr. Callinger and I had a little bananas together; and; and we had a mouthful of something to eat. I went in about two o'clock. I said till ale o five. I saw Jacobs and Levi there. I was sitting at the table, and had a bit of soft beet and potatoes. They had two bags with them. I did not see what was in them. I left them there. Mr. Callinger and I went away, and left them there.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What had they for dinner?</p>
               <p>Myers. The same.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure they had the same?</p>
               <p>Myers. They had some stewed meat, with balls, and some roast beef too, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you sit?</p>
               <p>Myers. At the same table.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell us what they had to drink?</p>
               <p>Myers. We had some beer.</p>
               <p>Q. What had they?</p>
               <p>Myers. Some beer too.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did they go to dinner?</p>
               <p>Myers. We were there till five o'clock. The dinner was ready at half an hour after I came in.</p>
               <p>Q. But you don't know whether it was roast beef or no?</p>
               <p>Myers. I can't tell. I don't love to say a thing I don't know. We eat and drank together.</p>
               <p>Q. But the beef, or stewed meat, or whatever it was, did not stay upon the table from three till half an hour after five?</p>
               <p>Myers. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose it might stay half an hour?</p>
               <p>Myers. Three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Court. Where does Callinger live?</p>
               <p>Myers. In Rosemary-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he lived there?</p>
               <p>Myers. Four or five years.</p>
               <p>Court. Has he never been out of that shop?</p>
               <p>Myers. No.</p>
               <p>Court. How far does he live from you?</p>
               <p>Myers. About fourteen or fifteen houses higher than the White Swan.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the business between you?</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200034"/>Court. In buying or selling?</p>
               <p>Myers. We had bought a parcel together.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this meeting about something you two were buying together?</p>
               <p>Myers. Yes. We could not agree.</p>
               <p>Court. What was it?</p>
               <p>Myers. It was a pawnbroker's stock. We did not buy them, because they were too dear.</p>
               <p>Court. Then there was no money paid by you to him?</p>
               <p>Myers. There was a little bill, but it was not paid the same day.</p>
               <p>Court. So neither of you received any money at all?</p>
               <p>Myers. No.</p>
               <p>Court. So it was not business between you two, but about buying this pawnbroker's parcel?</p>
               <p>Myers. Yes.</p>

               <p>Roberts. It was on the latch on the outside. I went down stairs again for about half an hour. When I came up the second time I missed them. Then I thought of my notes. I went to stop them that night.</p>

               <p>Morris. I was going through Fenchurch-street between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, about a month ago, on a Wednesday night: I met two young men by this gentleman's house; they came to me and said they would give me some money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner's name?</p>
               <p>Morris. They call him Cut Nuckle, it is a nick name that is given him. One said, he would give me some money if I would not say any thing about them or what they were doing; for they said they were going into this gentleman's house. I saw one of them go in, not both, then I followed them: it was not the prisoner, it was Waters that went in.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say when he came out?</p>
               <p>Morris. He called him Waters. The hatch door was open when he went in, it had a brass knob. I staid at the door with the prisoner: they said they would give me money not to say any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the compting-house from the first door?</p>
               <p>Morris (describes it) When he came out he gave it to the prisoner, and they both ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the house?</p>
               <p>Morris. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it might be some other house?</p>
               <p>Morris. It was a corn-chandler's shop, so I know it by that; it was dark and all the other houses were shut up. The next day I went to play at Salt

He got him to his house and kept him several days, promising that if he would swear against me he would give him money to bind him out apprentice; he then took him to the Rotation at Whitechapel and got him swore in, so I was taken up. My lord, please to look into Paget's character, he has been cast for transportation; and as for Morris, he is a common thief.</p>

            . On the 13th of January, the day after Mr. Stratford's house was broke open in Grosvenor Square, I dispatched several persons different ways in order to look after the things stolen. I went into Gravel Lane, Houndsditch. I had been at several houses before I went there; to the house of one Valentine, who is a receiver of stolen goods. I saw the prisoner sitting by the fire; Heley and my brother was with me. I said, What Peak, are you here, I am sorry to find you here. He was then standing by the fire, he stood very much confused, and desired we would take him to his father's; he has often been desired to keep out of the way. I insisted upon their taking him to Whitechapel immediately.</p>

We took notice that they walked backward and forward several times. I saw him break the window, and put his hand in: the third time he put his hand in, I took him. I was just the breadth of the street from him. The two first times, he passed his hand to his companion, and, I suppose, gave him something I could not see whether he took any thing: I did not see any thing in his hand when I took him: I brought him into the shop.</p>

            . I am a coachman: I was that night in Oxford Road between seven and eight: there came a young man by me; he said he was looking at two young men, and said, he thought they were going to rob some shop. They looked into the shop as if they were waiting for somebody in the shop; I said, I thought they were. We stood some time watching them; at last we heard one of the glasses crack, and the prisoner was at it: he was at it several times: after that, I heard it crack again: I said, They have broke the window: we got the waterman to look at them: he took notice of them: the prisoner came, and put his hand into the window: they walked down, and came up again; and then he put his hand in again; then my coach went on: I did not see any more. Then Jonashan Horton the waterman took hold of him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I had turned my back, but had not been out to sit down. I was in the shop with two servants, with several persons, not less than a dozen, about three quarters of an hour before: I had examined whether the ribbands in the drawer were right. It is a rule with us to keep the ribbands, so that we can tell whether any thing is taken out by any customer: the row of ribbands next the pane of glass was gone.</p>

I was close to Mr. Foy's side: his foot slipped, and he jostled against one of the women. Mr. West instantly knocked him down with his fist. When he got up he was all over blood, and without his hat and wig. I cried out, For mercy and peace. I looked for his hat and wig. I slipped down. While I was down I received two or three blows. I saw Mr. Foy down upon his back, and the little man Paris striking him with a short stick, about an inch and a half or two inches round; it was no extraordinary large size. After I saw this, I heard Mr. Fynes call for the watch. West had hold of Mr. Fynes, and held him fast, saying, he should not go till he charged the watch with him. The watch came, and he charged him. I went with him to the watch-house. I did not see the deceased: he was brought into the watch-house, and he could not stand. A watchman set by his side, and supported him; he bled very much from his nose and mouth; and he had a cut on his nose: he said, That little man has broke my heart: he denoted him by having a small cockade in his hat. I did not see Randall strike at all: he had a stick in his hand then. I was not charged with the watch. I asked the officer to let me get bail for Mr. Foy and Mr. Fynes; he said, No, he would take no bail at that time. I had been about half an hour in the watch-house. Then I went and fetched Foy's wife, and came back again, and staid with the deceased till five o'clock. I asked him if he would be bled: he said, Yes. I went and fetched Mr. Gill: he bled him; and then he spoke a few words of the sad affair he had fell into. In the morning we procured bail for him. Then we carried him home in a chair. When he went to go to bed, he said to me, Joseph, now I am going to bed, I shall, I am afraid, never rise out of it more. I asked him then who did him the injury: he said, the tall man, West, knocked him down, and kicked him in the side, and the little midshipman, Paris, jumped upon him. I was called up next morning at three o'clock by Mr. Foy's apprentice. I went and took him by the hand, and said, John, how do you do? he said, Very bad. I asked him if he knew me: he said, Yes; your name is

I went to a surgeon, and told him there was a young man in a dangerous way wanted assistance; the servant said his master was ill. I went and told Mr. Foy of it: he said, For God's sake get me the gentleman that bled me. I went. It was five o'clock. I knocked at his door. He answered me out of the window. He came down and went with me and Mr. Grey to Mr. Foy; there he made the same declaration as before. Mr. Gill said he had prepared some little medicine for him. I went to his father-in-law's, and in the mean time he died; which was about five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been drinking?</p>
               <p>Roadey. Yes; half a gallon of beer before I came in, one half afterwards, and a p int of gin.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you leave the house?</p>
               <p>Roadey. Pretty near two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Roadey. Very well in his senses; he walked upright. I can't say he was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Q. He was in liquor?</p>
               <p>Roadey. Yes; a little.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he jostled a woman; describe in what manner: who was the woman?</p>
               <p>Roadey. I don't know: she was in company with him: there were six men, and four or five women.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the foremost of the company?</p>
               <p>Roadey. Mr. West.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner was the jostling?</p>
               <p>Roadey. He slipped from my side against the woman; but neither of them fell.</p>

               <p>Roadey. I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the woman off the pavement?</p>
               <p>Roadey. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know what happened after West and the other company went to the watch-house?</p>
               <p>Roadey. No. I went to the watch-house with Fynes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to help the deceased into the watch-house?</p>
               <p>Roadey. No; two watchmen brought him in.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did Mr. Fynes behave to Mr. West?</p>
               <p>Roadey. I don't know; I was diligent after taking care of Mr. Foy.</p>
               <p>Q. Who called for the watch?</p>
               <p>Roadey. Mr. Fynes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any women scream out?</p>
               <p>Roadey. Yes; then they were crying out, Murder, and so on.</p>
               <p>West. He declares he was on the side of the way we were of; we have witnesses to prove he declared himself to be on the other side of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. What sort of a night was it?</p>
               <p>Roadey. Rather a gloomy night; there was a lamp over our heads. I took particular notice of them in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure West was the man that knocked down Foy.</p>
               <p>Roadey. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough for you to see the other man that struck him was Paris?</p>
               <p>Roadey. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. You say he was merry; was the jostling by joke or accident?</p>
               <p>Roadey. By accident.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he leaning upon your arm or any thing? Did he want that help?</p>

            . I was in company with Mr. Foy and the company at Mr. Nash's; we had a pint of gin and beer; we were there from about a quarter after nine to near two o'clock. Roades and the deceased and I came away together; we came along very peaceably till between the Ship and Black Dog in Shoreditch. The first thing I saw was, West knock the deceased down.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in company with him?</p>
               <p>Fynes. Randall, Paris, and three or four women.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing pass between Foy and the women?</p>
               <p>Fynes. No. The first thing I saw was Foy knocked down by West; he got up immediately; his face was all over bloody; I had stopped at first; then I advanced nearer; then West turned upon me and gave me a blow on the side of my head; the prisoner Randal came and assisted him. When West and I was engaged, to the best of my knowledge, I saw Randal strike the deceased with a short stick; then Randal came upon me with the stick; they were both upon me; I was knocked down and struck several times; as soon as I got up I ran and called the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any violence offered to the deceased in your presence?</p>
               <p>Fynes. I saw him strike him twice. I did not know Randal at the time; it was a frosty night; no moon light; there was a lamp just over the place.</p>
               <p>Q. Such a light as to know him?</p>
               <p>Fynes. Yes, when he came upon me there was charge for charge. I was brought to the watch-house: the deceased was brought in soon between two watchmen and laid upon the bench; he slipt off the bench upon the ground: after he had been there about an hour he vomited blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any marks of violence?</p>
               <p>Fynes. He had a wound on his nose and his mouth was bloody: the officer of the night kept us in custody till next morning: we were sent to the cage next morning, because we would not give the watchmen money. The deceased was carried home about eight o'clock, supported by two men upon a chair. I had visited the deceased but once before he died. I did not suspect he would die. It was on the 15th of January in the afternoon that I called to see him: I asked him if he knew me, he said he did: I asked how he did, he said, I hope I am done for. I said no more to him: he and I were weavers, both of us mostly in the velvet way. The officer of the night took their words, but he would not take ours: West I believe gave him money.</p>

            . I am a watchman; on Monday, the 14th of January, about two o'clock on Tuesday morning, I was on my stand at the end of Magpye Alley: I heard some people on the other side of the way have many words. I heard them soon call watch: then I crossed the way and went to them: the deceased lay upon his back, and Paris was standing over him in a threatening manner with a stick, a kind of a short stick about as thick as my wrist.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Randal a stick?</p>
               <p>Clayton. Yes, much such another</p>
               <p>Q. Had West a stick?</p>
               <p>Clayton. Not that I saw. West was striking two men that run behind me for shelter. I went to the watch-house and got three men to my assistance: one got West by the collar, and then it ceased; we secured them and took them to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Foy struck?</p>
               <p>Clayton. Not to my knowledge: Foy was left in the care of the other watchmen upon his belly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear hurt?</p>
               <p>Clayton. Yes, his hat and wig was off and his head all over blood. The constable said there was another person wanting: I went to see, and they were bringing up the deceased in a disorderly bad manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you say in a bad manner?</p>
               <p>Clayton. The watchmen were pulling and hawling him: Mr. Pickersgill stood by him. I told him they did not use him well. I went out upon my beat; when I came back I saw Fynes, and I asked who the other was: he said, Foy: I went out and returned at six, and I asked Foy how it happened; he said the midshipman ( Paris went by that name he had a cockade in his hat) he said the midshipman has broke my head with a stick. I got his wife to fetch a gentleman to let him blood; he drew his breath very hard; after he was let blood he breathed easier: we got him discharged: he could not walk at all; the watchmen attended him.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the parties before?</p>
               <p>Clayton. I was well acquainted with Fynes and the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Foy appear in liquor?</p>
               <p>Clayton. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Fynes?</p>
               <p>Clayton. No.</p>

               <p>Clayton. He led him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what you said to them. What did you say the men had done?</p>
               <p>Clayton. I said there was a quarrel in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say that they had been making a fray?</p>
               <p>Clayton. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200044"/>Q. Did you say to Fynes, You have done a pretty piece of work?</p>
               <p>Clayton. Yes; by the accident that had happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Why charge him with having done a pretty piece of work?</p>
               <p>Clayton. Because it was a bad accident.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Fynes strike West?</p>
               <p>Clayton. I saw either Fynes or Roadey strike him; I don't know which.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had hold of Fynes?</p>
               <p>Clayton. They all went together: West charged Fynes and Fynes charged West:</p>
               <p>Q. You had been acquainted with Fynes?</p>
               <p>Clayton. I knew him in the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it so dark in the street you could not distinguish him then?</p>
               <p>Clayton. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Foy had any falls with the watchmen?</p>
               <p>Clayton. I believe he had; I saw them gathering him up like.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any battles with the watchmen?</p>
               <p>Clayton. That I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find him?</p>

               <p>Clayton. At the Unicorn brew-house, about forty yards from the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you stay with him?</p>
               <p>Clayton. No; the watchmen said they could not bring him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they give the reason why they could not bring him up?</p>
               <p>Clayton. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him aim any blow at the watchmen?</p>
               <p>Clayton. No.</p>

            . I am a weaver. I was at Mr. Foy's about eleven o'clock on Tuesday morning: he was lying upon his back; his eyes were shut; sometimes he opened his mouth: I said, Jack, do you know me? he said, Yes, Will, very well: I said, I am sorry to see you so ill used: he said, Will, I am barbarously used; my heart is broke within me. I asked him if he knew any of them: he said, Yes; Pickersgill I know. He said a big man knocked him down, and kicked him in his private parts when he was down; and a little man jumped upon his breast I asked where his wife was: he said she was gone to the justices. He said the little man that jumped upon his breast was a midshipman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Foy mention the names?</p>
               <p>Williams. Only the name of Pickersgill.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Shoreditch. About the seventeenth of last month, I received orders from the coroner to open the dead body of Mr. Foy. I first examined it in the presence of Mr. Milward, and Mr. Gill the apothecary, but could not observe any thing worthy of notice, except upon the scrotum or bag of the body. Upon opening the body, I found a rupture to consist of the intestines and cawl. When I examined the intestine part of it, it was mortified, which I imagined was owing to the confinement in the part, and part of it was ruptured: the remainder of the viscera seemed to be in a very good and found state. Upon opening the breast, the right lobe of the lungs was considerably injured, and adhered to the adjacent parts, so that it was incapable of performing the common function of breathing; the other parts of the breast seemed in a good state. From the symptoms which he complained of, and the appearances, I do imagine his death was owing to the rupture, which, if he had had proper care in time, there was more than a probability of his doing extremely well.</p>
               <p>Q. That of the lungs must have been a thing of some continuance?</p>
               <p>Gorssett. I suppose three years.</p>
               <p>Q. With relation to the rupture, would that happen by any kind of violence, and what sort of a violence?</p>
               <p>Gorssett. I look upon a violence on the belly to be the immediate existing cause; but there may be a pre-disposing cause, which may be some force exerted on the bag or scrotum.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think any hurt or blow on the scrotum could hurt it?</p>
               <p>Gorssett. It might be the pre-disposing cause, but not the immediate cause.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not they be both made at the same time?</p>
               <p>Gorssett. Almost instantaneously, one after the other.</p>
               <p>Q. At the same time?</p>
               <p>Gorssett. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not you distinguish whether it was an old rupture, or lately come down?</p>
               <p>Gorssett. In this case, it is not of much signification, because the same immediate acting cause must exist to impress an old one, so as to occasion a man's death, equally the same as to occasion an immediat e one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this appear the effect of violence?</p>
               <p>Gorssett. All ruptures are the effect of violence.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you apprehend he died naturally, or owed his death to violence?</p>
               <p>Gorssett. He owed his death to the rupture.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any mark or swelling upon it?</p>
               <p>Gorssett. There was a discolouration, from some force exerted on that part.</p>
               <p>Q. Could that come by falls only?</p>
               <p>Gorssett. It might come by any sudden or quick motion; it might come by falls, or motions, or leaping or jumping, or lifting heavy weights, or any thing that puts the muscles of the belly into perpetual motion: it might come from falls, or blows, or strains.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any marks on the belly outwardly, as if it had been bruised?</p>
               <p>Gorssett. I did not; the belly gives way on any violence, which does not discolour the part so much as on other parts.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing any body had stamped upon the belly in that manner, would there have been marks of violence?</p>
               <p>Gorssett. There is a possibility of being marks, but a greater probability of there not being any, on account of the belly giving way: the rupture in the scrotum might be occasioned by falls, leaping, blows, or any quick or sudden motion; even coughing and vomiting might occasion it, when the parts have been considerably relaxed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any appearance of his having had ruptures before?</p>
               <p>Gorssett. It did not appear to me that he had a rupture before Mr. Millward, the other surgeon, thought there was; but it is a matter of little consideration whether there was or was not.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it might be occasioned by leaping or jumping, &amp;c. Supposing the party to be full of liquor, would it not more probably happen then by a lesser motion?</p>
               <p>Gorssett. When the person is stimulated, the muscles are certainly more laxed then than in a better state.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mark on the breast?</p>
               <p>Gorssett. None at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200046"/>Q. If there had been a punch upon the breast with a stick, would not that have made a mark?</p>
               <p>Gorssett. I make no doubt of it, because there is the resistance of the ribs.</p>

            . I keep a house in Bishopsgate parish: Mr. Foy and I spent the evening together: that this happened at my house: there were seven men. He came in a few minutes after nine at night; and Mr. Roadey, and Mr. Robinson, an acquaintance of mine, came in about ten, and Mr. Rowe, and another; in the whole there were seven.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you drink?</p>
               <p>Nash. Beer chiefly; we had two gallons of beer, and a pint of gin.</p>
               <p>Q. How much do you think Foy drank?</p>
               <p>Nash. I cannot tell; there was above a quart of the liquor left: they went away about half an hour after one; they were sober and solid: Mr. Foy was a little merry and hearty; but, upon my oath, he was not drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he quarrelsome or noisy?</p>

               <p>Q. Not so sober as Fynes?</p>
               <p>Nash. He was a man of fewer words than Foy was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sober or no?</p>
               <p>Nash. He was a little merry, but capable to take care of himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drunk or sober;</p>
               <p>Nash. He was sober then.</p>
               <p>Q. Was all the gin drank?</p>
               <p>Nash. I gave it regularly among them.</p>
               <p>Q. From the Jury. You know Roadey, Foy, and Fynes?</p>

               <p>Nash. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you say upon your oath they are all peaceable men?</p>
               <p>Nash. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what sky-larking is?</p>
               <p>Nash. I don't know: I believe it is playing tricks with one another.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see sky-larking tricks played?</p>
               <p>Nash. I have seen others, I did not see them play any.</p>

               <p>On the fourteenth of last month, my wife, and family, and I, were invited to spend the evening at Kingsland Road: being engaged at Stepney, I could not accompany them there. I went at night to fetch them home; when I came there, I staid about an hour, or an hour and a quarter till it was rather late; my business detained me. I staid about an hour and a quarter, we all set off very peaceably. I, my wife, her mother, her sister, her two brothers, and her cousin. When near Holywell Lane, we were unfortunately met by these three men; they were all arm in arm, and running, and the deceased Foy run against my wife, and struck her on the breast. I then demanded the reason of it, a blow immediately followed; one took my wife by the arm and snatched her off the pavement. I ran towards her, and two of them took me by the collar. I had a handkerchief tied round my neck, they got hold of it, and one on one hand, and the other on the other, squeezed my handkerchief round so that I could hardly speak, I could not utter any words. My wife screamed and cried out for the watch, upon which some of my company that were behind came up to my assistance. I struck one of them, and then this Fynes blasted his eyes and swore the most bitter oaths, and then struck me. I was obliged to strike him, and do the best I could till the watch came up; then I gave charge of this Fynes, seeing him first: then they gave charge of me. The watchman took hold of me, and there was he with his fist over their shoulders and d - n - g and swearing at me, and wanted to get at me all the way to the watch-house, and abused us: he called my wife's mother old bawd, and said that my sister and all were a parcel of whores. The constable said, if he would not be easy he would put him in the cage. I told the constable to take charge of the other man. I did not know this Roadey, but I suspected him to be the other person. I taxed him with it in the watch-house; he said, No; he was not near us, nor in the company, and knew nothing about it. My wife had been ill almost five months. She was brought to bed about five months before this. The surgeon told her he did not know whether her arm would not be cut off. I had hold of her right arm, they came slap against us, and turned us out both against the houses.</p>
               <p>Q. To Nash. Where had Foy been the rest of the day?</p>
               <p>Nash. He said he had been with his father-in-law buying some pewter.</p>

            . We had been spending the evening at Mr. Buckley's, in Kingsland Road. Mr. West came between eleven and twelve o'clock. Mrs. West was there all the evening. Mr. West came to fetch his wife home. Randal came into our company about half an hour after twelve: Randal belonged to another company at the same house. We joined company to come home together: there was my brother, mother, sister, my cousin, Mr. Pickersgill, his wife, son, and daughter. Mr. West was to the wall, and Mrs. West outside. Near the Black Dog, Shoreditch, we met three men; two came first, one came after: the two men came and jostled Mr. West; his wife cried out; he asked the cause, and then one of them struck him, and said, D - n you, don't you like it? A third came up; Mr. West said, Here is another of the thieves: Mr. Randal went to his assistance. My brother was on the other side of the way, with my sister, and young Mr. Pickersgill. I took my cousin away, to be out of the way. The man took Mrs. West from her husband, and put his hand in her bosom; that was one of the three, I don't know which: two of them collared Mr. West. A third came to them, and then she was pushed off the pavement. Mrs. West shrieked out; Mr. West called, Watch; two watchmen came up, Brown, and Moy; they secured Mr. West. Fynes struck at Mr. West over the watchman's arm, as he was in custody. We were all very sober.</p>

I did not see the deceased till he was brought into the watch-house: my brother was the first man that entered the watch-house. The deceased was brought in about five minutes by two watchmen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the men say any thing when they first attacked Mrs. West?</p>
               <p>Paris. I did not hear any thing; I heard a hollowing and hooting before they came up, but I did not expect any harm, so did not take any particular notice of it.</p>

               <p>Paris. No, the lady was meddled with first: he asked the reason, then he was struck. I was a little behind; I walked up to them.</p>

            . I was in this company: I walked with my spouse: Mr. West and his wife went first: my wife and I were the third couple; we were arm in arm. A little beyond the Black Dog, I saw two men come and separate Mr. West and his wife; they took hold of me, and dragged me on the other side the way: I gave my wife my watch, because I thought they were disorderly people. She said, You'll get a blow; I said, I could not fight, but I could see who did. I went over the way with my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them do any thing to West and his wife?</p>
               <p>Pickersgill. No; my spouse went for the watchmen: I saw no blows struck: the people were gone a good way towards the watch-house. When the watchmen came up, I had a little heart to go back again; and I saw a man over another man that was down: I heard afterwards it was the deceased: it was the watchman that stood over him.</p>

In returning back, I saw a good many people together about Hog-lane; words arose, and blows ensued. The motion was very quick. I sat upon my box and saw it in the middle of the street. I can't tell one man from the other. One out of three men ran against a lady: the gentleman took the lady's part, and asked him what he meant: words ensued. I don't know which gave the first blow. A lady came to me, and paid me the homagement of Sir; and asked me to assist them. I never moved off my box.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was called about half an hour after two, by Clayton; he bid me make haste: three men were fighting. A man called us: we ran, and saw a parcel of people together. My partner took hold of Mr. West: he said, Don't use me ill; I am a house-keeper night hand. Mr. Fynes came up to him, and I could hardly keep him off from striking him. Mr. West gave charge of Fynes: my partner took hold of him, and carried him to the watch-house: we put them in the watch-house. We had as much as we could do to keep Fynes from striking him in the watch-house. When

               <p>Q. Had it more the appearance of pain, or drunkenness, that he fell off the seat?</p>

            . I am a watchman in Shoreditch. When Clayton came down to the watch house, I, Mr. Haywood, and Mr. Moys, went out; just as I got into the place, I took hold of Mr. West: he asked me if I was a watchman, and bid me take charge of them people. Fynes came and made a blow at Mr. West: he made several blows at him. I delivered Mr. West to Moys, and took charge of Fynes. West made no resistance, but said he would go with me with all the pleasure in the world. I had blows over my arms from Fynes several times: he behaved very rough for some time. As soon as he came into the watch-house, he attempted to strike Mr. West. Fynes tried to slip his coat over his shoulders to get away, as I had hold of his coat: he appeared to be drunk. I was in the watch-house when Foy was brought in by the two watchmen; he appeared to my thinking to be very drunk; he slipt upon the floor, and seemed to sleep.</p>
               <p>Q. How did West and his company appear?</p>
               <p>Jones. Sober, and behaved very civilly. Foy went to the door to make water, but could not; he complained his stomach was bad: he said his heart was burst. I think he sat down sometime. His wife brought him some water afterwards, and washed him.</p>
               <p>Thomos Brown. I am a watchman. Clayton told me three men had fell foul of some gentlemen, and some mischief would be done. I went: Foy was upon his legs, and fighting like to himself: West gave me charge of him. Foy struck me, and knocked me down; he fell down himself in the channel: as he was aiming a second blow at me he fell flat upon his belly: I heaved him up, but he could not stand.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Jones come before, or after you was knocked know?</p>

               <p>Brown. After; Jones did not see him till he came into the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell what he meant by fighting with himself?</p>
               <p>Brown. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body near him then?</p>
               <p>Brown. No; he was at a distance from the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear then to be staggering?</p>
               <p>Brown. He appeared to have a great deal of strength; he struck me down with one hand; he seemed to be very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. If he was pretty strong he was not much in liquor: Do you attribute his weakness to his fall with you?</p>
               <p>Brown. Yes; he said in the watch-house that the midshipman had broke his heart.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. Where was Moys?</p>
               <p>Brown. I did not see them till they came back to help me with him to the watch-house.</p>

I saw Fynes by the fireside; I understood he was one of these men; I told him, I knew the parties in trouble, and I should be glad if he would give an account of it; he said, the night the accident happened, he and the deceased were going to a club; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200051"/> said, they came along Bishopsgate-street; that the deceased was skylarking, or something of that kind: he said he was pt to kiss women when in liquor: I think he said it was severe weather; he said he got off the foot way, and fell among the ice; that he asked him if he hurt himself, and he said either No, or, Not much: I asked him again; he said he was sure he fell: he said he got into the foot-way again, and was twenty or thirty yards a-head of them. He said, he did not see the beginning of the quarrel; that when he came up, the man was upon the ground: he said he did not see who struck first: Fynes allowed they might be fuddled a little, or some such thing. I asked him if Pickersgill was present at the scuffle; he said he was not; that both he and his wife were at a distance.</p>

               <p>Mr. Lutwich. I am a silversmith. The prisoner came to me with this spoon (producing it,) and said, that his wife had found it as she was sifting cinders on a dunghill in Tottenham Court Road.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he produce the spoon?</p>
               <p>Lutwich. No, not at first; he said, that his wife had found a spoon on a dunghill: I told him, that he should make some enquiry about the owner; he said, that it was so long as three days, and that he could not find the owner. I said, Let me see the spoon; he then went away, and came in about two hours after. He first came about five o'clock; he said, Here, I have now brought the spoon, if you will buy it of me: he then shewed it me: the bowl was all over wet mud; he stroked the mud out of it first, the other part was clean; I saw the crest of a castle on it: I said, Friend, I hope you came honestly by it; he said, Yes. I said, Sit down, my neighbour Castle has just such a crest on his plate. I bid my people take care of him: I went to Mr. Castle's; he said, it was his crest; I described the man, and they said, such a man had been there; they bid me stop the man, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing about the spoon?</p>
               <p>Lutwich. I asked him how he could rob so good a friend; he said, he was sorry for what he had done; he cried, and said, he was in liquor, and hoped we would forgive him: he had offered it for sale at another silversmith's, but that person did not like any trouble, so he gave it him again; but I am determined to stop every thing that appears to be stolen.</p>
               <p>Court. Sir, we commend you; you are quite in the right.</p>
               <p>Q. To Aspinall. Look upon this spoon.</p>
               <p>Aspinall. It is my master's property; I know it by the crest.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>

               <p>My lord, I was cleaning the street. I went and asked for a little beer; the cook gave me some victuals; the spoon was among the victuals; I held up my apron; the cook put it in: I had had victuals at several houses that day, so did not know at which house I had the spoon at; if I had, I would have carried it back.</p>
               <p>Q. to Lutwich. Did he tell you such a story as this?</p>
               <p>Lutwich. No; I am informed he is light fingered: I asked his master to appear for his character, but he would not.</p>

               <p>Rutt. Because, just after, I was obliged to break the door open to get into my house. This was yesterday three weeks. I was at a public house; she came, and said, her mistress, Esther Green, wanted me. I asked her to drink; she sat down; this was between ten and eleven o'clock. I heard she had picked a sailor's pocket of twenty or thirty guineas; they said it was in a red purse. I then went home, and missed my money; I did not miss it till Friday; I was in company with no body else but her, and she knew the way of my house. I took her up, and found one pair of buckles in her shoes, and another pair in her pocket; two rings were on her fingers; one of the rings is a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200053"/> mourning ring, the stone is knocked out; it is an old family ring; here is my purse, here is a darn of my mother's in it, I can swear to it; she dropped this purse.</p>

            . I went in search of this woman: I found her at the Anchor and Crown, in New Rag Fair: she had two rings on her fingers: she was going to take them off, but the officer took them in his possession. We went from there to one Stewards, a public-house; there the officer searched her: I saw him take a pair of buckles out of her pocket, nine guineas, two half guineas, one thirty-six shilling piece, six shillings in silver, and eight-pence farthing. The officer took charge of her: she was standing pritty near the fire: I said, Mr. Rutt, do not you know these buckels? he said they were his: he took them out of her shoes: one of the rings is a mourning ring. Mrs. Green was committed with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does Mrs. Green live?</p>
               <p>Ragland. In Denmark-street, at that part of the town.</p>

               <p>Ragland. No; I heard him say before the justice, that he believed she was innocent of the robbery; for if he had but two shillings she was welcome to one of them: the prosecutor told me to go to her, and tell her, that if he could get the money again, within eight or ten guineas, he would not hurt her: she said she had given him all she had left of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They came to me at New Prison, and said, if I did not mention her name they would be very favourable to me; if I did, they would hang me.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Court. Did you, or Rutt, or any of you, say any such thing?</p>
               <p>Ragland. I went to New Prison to her: I asked her if she would give the man the money, or let him know what she had bought.</p>

On Friday evening I took a search warrant. On Saturday the twenty-sixth of January I was in the prisoner's lodgings; the prisoner opened the door; she behaved with great civility, and asked me to walk in; I then told her on what account I came. I searched the ground floor, and found nothing; then I went up one pair of stairs, and there found a chest of drawers, chest upon chest; they were lately brought in by a broker; she said the broker had the keys, made a sort of offer to open them, and, in appearance, they seemed as if locked. I then went into the two pair of stairs room, and opened some drawers; there was nothing there; but she presently afterwards talked to her boy in French. At the bottom of the stairs Mr. Coward stopped the boy, and took from him two pieces of linen, and several pieces of muslin. I saw one of the pieces of cloth the Saturday before it was missing; and am certain of it. Mr. Coward took an account of my goods; I saw him make a mark on one of the particular pieces that I pulled down on Saturday night, to shew to a customer.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. Why did you stay so long before you took out a warrant?</p>
               <p>Herman. My wife did not chuse to do it; for she did not mistrust the prisoner. She lodged at my house about eight weeks at that time; had lodged there for two years together before, at 5 s. a week. I believe she paid very honestly for the lodging; but the last of the eight weeks was not paid for; her husband had never been with her there; she said he was in France.</p>
               <p>Blanchard Coward. I am shopman to Mess. Hussey and Whitter. The prosecutor deals with them to the amount of two or three hundred a year. (Looks at a piece of linen) Here is my own mark in a pencil; the mark of Hussey and Whitter is the common shop mark. About December I took an account of the linens and muslins for the prosecutor, and marked them with a pencil: I believe this is the mark I then put upon it. The prosecutor came to me on the 4th of January, and said he had lost his goods, and asked my advice. I went to Sir

            's; but on Friday se'nnight following, he said he had a suspicion of the prisoner, and desired me to go and see if Mr. Hussey's mark appeared on any goods I should find. I went to the prisoner's house; the prosecutor went in, and then held up his finger to me to go in, as they waited at the door: the constable, the prosecutor, and myself went in. The constable and prosecutor made the prisoner acquainted with their business; the prisoner flew in a passion, and threw things about. Nothing was found below stairs, except several remnants of cloth, that we could not specify. The constable desired me to stay below, left any thing should be carried off; a Frenchman stayed with me, and put his back against the stair-foot door. I saw the prisoner's son come in and go up stairs; the prisoner spoke French to him. The moment I had opened the stair-foot door, I saw the son coming down with two pieces of Irish cloth, and nine pieces of muslin. I saw the goods put into the wrapper: they were sealed up in my lord mayor's presence, and have not been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200055"/> opened since. The boy dropped the cloth, and was confounded; I chid him; he was for some time impertinent. I asked him where he took them from; he took me up to the dining-room, unlocked a sort of book-case that had drawers at the bottom of it, and I took out of it a piece of Irish cloth; here it is (producing it;) I speak to the marks of it. The goods that were dropped by the boy I am sure were sold by my master to the prosecutor. Here is a mark of 15 and 1/2, which denotes the measure of the muslin; and here is a mark of 4 s. 6 d. that I am positive is my own putting, and that it was Mr. Herman's property.</p>

            . I am a broker's wife. We sold goods, to the amount of seventy pounds, to the prisoner: she always came with a little boy with her; he is about thirteen years old: he talked French, and passed with his mother as an interpreter. Upon my taking notice of the apron she had on, which was a fine plain muslin, the boy spoke to his mother in French, I suppose to let her know I praised the apron: she spoke again to him in French, and then the boy told me that his mother had a considerable quantity of that to sell from France; and she had likewise some fine cloth to make shirts and shifts of, at two shillings and sixpence per yard.</p>

            . I met the prisoner one day accidentally in Bishopsgate-street, with another man; they asked me the way to Bedlam, and they asked me where I was going: I said, as far as Stretham; I did not know the way, so I could not stop to shew them; but I went with them, and shewed them Bedlam. I was going home to clean myself; they asked me to go in and drink; I went in with them; then we proceeded on to Hackney-road, as I know the road since; I really did not know the road then: they went into the Ass and Foal, there we had some dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the road to Stretham?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. No; when they had had their dinner, they went further along the road, a good way.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. In Pans Alley, Aldersgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What business do you follow?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. I <rs id="t17710220-36-viclabel201" type="occupation">work at the upholsterers work</rs>

They proceeded farther along the road, and then turned down a lane till they got into some open fields; then they began to pull me about, and d - d and sunk me, and said, that they had not brought me there for the purpose of shewing me the way to Stretham, but for other purpose, and asked me if I had got any money: I told them I had not; they d - d me for a b - h, and threatened my life; they put their hands in my pocket, both of them, one on one side, and the other on the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Has there not been a trial here already about this same matter?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. The other man that was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the man in company with this man?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. The other man was Meeken by name, I believe; I never saw either of them before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same man that was tried here before, that was with him?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Yes; then they took the buckles out of my shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of buckles?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. A little sort of stone pattern; they were silver. After they took my buckles out of my shoes, I begged and prayed of them to spare my life: I begged of them not to murder me, for the sake of my children I had at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, had you any business that road that carried you that way?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. No; they took me that road, and said, it was my way to Stretham.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you never been at Stretham before?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. What business had you that day to go to Stretham?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. A young man that lived there owed me some money.</p>
               <p>Q. You told them you was going to Stretham?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you made some enquiry where it was?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. When I met them, I was going home with the intent to enquire.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been to when you met them?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. To Flying Horse Yard, Bishopsgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the man's name that owed you the money at Stretham?</p>
               <p>Mazemore.

               <p>Q. How far was it from the high road where they robbed you?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Five or six fields.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200057"/>Q. How came you to go with them?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. They appeared civil gentlemen. We went by some trees, down a dirty lane, with a gate to it, that took us out of that road into a field.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see the prisoner after this?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. I did not see him till Sunday last, when he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. By what means was he taken?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. A person took him by description.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you give a description to?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. I gave the description to a person of my acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you he was taken?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. The person that took him brought him to me, to know if he was the man or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the person that you gave the description to?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On seeing him, did you know him again?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Yes, immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. From the Prisoner. Did not we go to drink the wine before we went to Bedlam?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. No, afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. At what time of the day did you dine?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Between one and two.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know how far it was to Stretham?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Only as they told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know which way from the town it lay?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. No; I was going home to ask my landlady.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you was going home to clean yourself?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Nothing further than an apron.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this place you dined at the only place you called at after you had drank your wine, on coming out of Bedlam?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. No; they called at another house, with an excuse to call for some writings, as they were a-going to receive some money at Stretham: it was a public house; I do not know where it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink there?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Yes; they had a glass of brandy a piece; I had the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call any where else?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. No: I lost two shillings and sixpence in money; I cannot say which had it, nor how they had it, but I lost it.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. How long might you be at dinner?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. I believe an hour and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you to drink?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. A pot of beer, and a glass of brandy.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the men sober?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married woman?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. No.</p>

            . The second of last November, the Friday before Lord Mayor's day, I was coming from Mile-End, to go to Smithfield. I was coming down Bethnal-Green road; near Lord Camden's head, I met Mr. Meekins and this man, along with Mazemore. Mazemore stopped to speak with me about five minutes; in the mean time these two men stopped with her: I had not seen her before for six months.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know either of them?</p>
               <p>Cross. I had seen them before. Meekins used to be about the turnpikes, dressed like a countryman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Mazemore before?</p>
               <p>Cross. She used to wash for me; she had not washed for me six months, for I went to live down at Mile-End. She asked me when I would call to see her, and how I did. I called the Sunday fortnight afterwards: when I went, I asked her what she did along with them two men.

             was remarked for a gambler. She said, I wish I knew who they were; I said, they often resorted about the turnpike. She did not say any more then. A week after that, she told her sister, and she told me, and we went to seek after them. When we came back one day, she had taken Meekins into custody; her sister and I had been out all day long looking after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way were they going?</p>
               <p>Cross. They were going towards Bethnal Green. It was in Bethnal Green new road, that leads towards the Green, or it takes to Oldford, or Hackney, or Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. What time a day was this?</p>
               <p>Cross. Near one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. She stopped to speak to you?</p>
               <p>Cross. Yes, about five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. Did she ask you the way to Stretham?</p>
               <p>Cross. No; she was rather behind them.</p>

               <p>I was coming by Bedlam wall, before you come to Bedlam. Mrs. Mazemore said, Well, what, you are looking about you, young man; I said, Yes: says she, This is Bedlam: said I, I should like to see it, but should not like to go in by myself: she said, she would go with me, If I would give her a glass of wine. I went up a street, and had some mulled wine and toast. While it was mulling, Meekins came in: I never saw him, neither before nor since, till I saw him here, just before he went out. She called Meekins her cousin. Then it was agreed we should all three go to see Bedlam. We went there, and walked about a good while: we went two stories high: she wanted me to get a coach to take her to the play that night. From thence we went to Dobney's Bowling Green, and we went to the sign of the Sun; we went into the parlour, thinking to dine there, and had a glass of brandy a-piece. I said, You favour a young man that I know; she said, Don't think I am a young man, you may see I am not, for I have breasts, and took her handkerchief aside, and shewed one of her breasts. She said, she wanted a pair of shoes, and she should be a fine woman if she had a silk gown, and wanted me to buy one, and said, she could not have one without ten guineas. Then we went to the Ass and Foal, and dined; and then Meekins and she went out arm in arm together, and I came away, and never saw her after till that day I came to see her at her house. We parted good friends.</p>

In coming back, she confessed she took it, and had put it in a particular part of her lodgings; in consequence of which, I went to her lodgings, and found it in the place she had described (The watch produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

            . I am a constable. I attended at Bride's watch-house the night this happened. The prosecutor charged the prisoner with stealing his watch; he said he had searched her, but could not find it. I examined him very strictly; he said, when he went to do with her, he pulled it out of his breeches, and put it into his waistcoat pocket. She denied it: I was obliged at last to make use of force to search her. Two watchmen threw her on the table, and opened her legs, and I took it out of her inside, out of her private parts.

He fell on his knees, owned every thing, and said, he had left the cloaths and gown at Mr. White's in Wych-street (the goods produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.) The prisoner said, he had left a bundle of linen at Five Bell Court, in Houndsditch, at one Isaac's, a necklace-maker. We went there; there were no goods there.

I went for a constable: the prisoner was carried to Cathro's house; there he went down on his knees, and confessed he had every thing Mr. Cathro laid to his charge, and said, he should have all his things again; that they should have part in Houndsditch. We did go there; we had a hundred Jews about us there; in five minutes, two hundred: we thought it time to make our retreat.</p>

He continued there till the Friday after Christmas day. On the twenty-eighth I lay in the same room with him; there were two beds in that room, and two other persons that are lodgers lay in the same room likewise. The things mentioned in the indictment were locked up in a cloaths-chest in the room where I and the prisoner lay: I saw them the afternoon before I missed them, which was on the twenty-seventh. I had put some money in my box. I took out the key, and the next afternoon I went up again for a clean shirt and apron. I tried before I attempted to unlock the box. I saw that the nails that fastened the catch of the lid were all cut; these nails being out, there was nothing else to do but to lift up the lid of the box. I looked into the box, and missed all the things in the indictment. The prisoner's going away, and not returning again, induced me to suspect him. The other two men that lay in the same room continued in the house, but the prisoner was gone. Some time after, in January, the apron was found on him. I was not present when he was stopped. I brought him home; he had that blue apron on him, which is marked with the initial letters of my name. I am very certain that these buckles were mine; I know them by the discolour of them; being obliged to work in the wet in a cellar, the water had given them a yellow tinge.</p>

He said, he had broke open the box with a pair of scissars, and a small heater. He told me where he had pawned these buckles; that it was in Turnball-street, but did not say the name of the pawnbroker; but he went with me, and shewed me the house, and there the buckles were.

            . I am a constable. I went to the prisoner on the seventh of January: the landlady that let him his room came to me between seven and eight, and said there was a new bed carried out of the house, but could not tell by whom.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know his lodgings?</p>
               <p>Warren. Yes; No. 7, Carriers-street, St. Giles's; a single room up two pair of stairs. She said she insisted upon my going with her to see that none of her goods were carried out. It was sometime before I would go with her; at last I did: the landlady went up first; the door was open: I said to the landlady, Please to look round, and see that your property is here: she said they were all, except one blanket, a long bolster, and an old blanket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other thing there but what was the property of the landlady?</p>
               <p>Warren. This table-cloth and old blanket she said were not hers, and a bolster. Thornton came up, and swore, that if he catched an officer in the room, he would use him ill: he came up into the room; the landlady and I were in the room; he said nobody had any business to break his room open, or to enter his room: with that he took up a plate; I had my short staff in my hand; I bid him not be outrageous; he flung it down on the floor: I said I only came to see that this gentlewoman's were in the room. I asked him if the other things were his property; he said, what was that to me, he would not give me any account of it. Another man came up into the room: I charged him to aid and assist, and we took him to the justice: he said he would not be led: he said, Here is a watch that cost me a good deal of money; take it, and I will come down to you: I said I would not quit him till I had him before the justice: the justice examined him, and asked how he came by these things; he said he bought them of an old cloaths-man in Brown's-Gardens. Then the justice asked him were he worked last; he said with a man in Monmouth-street. The justice ordered me to go and enquire of another master where he said he worked in Monmouth-street. I went to search for this man; he never lived in Monmouth-street; he still stood to it that he bought them: he was discharged that night.</p>

I asked what he wanted with him, he would not tell me; I took him before Mr. Welch. The Justice desired him to go with me, and shew me where Thornton was gone to. I went to the place where Gibbons lodges; as soon as she saw me go past the window, she locked the door; I saw her as I passed the window, it was in Newtoner's lane. I demanded the key of the door; she refused it: at last, in four or five minutes she offered it to me. As soon as I went into the place there was that little china lamb and a jarr upon the chimney piece in the woman's lodgings; that was the ground floor.

             lodged in the one pair of stairs; my wife; as I called her, who then lived with me, had some words with Mr. M'Domach. She told her she saw a bed, and she said she thought we had robbed her lodgings of one of her beds; She brought them &gt;up to me, and said she did not care to let them stay. News was brought to me that they were searching my room. When I came up there was Mr. Warren and two people with him: I asked why the pillow was brought into my lodgings by M'Domach's wife.</p>

             came and sk       to let him leave them; he said he would not leave them longer than next day. When my husband came home at night I told him such a person had been there, and left the things. I never saw the things: I did not know what he had left there.</p>

               <p>Council for the prisoner. My Lord, I don't conceive that this evidence is now at liberty to go into evidence so late back as the year 1765; the day in the indictment is the 10th of June, I hope your lordship and the court will not allow Mr. Payne to go into such evidence. The indictment charges this on the 10th of June last; can you speak to any facts on that particular day?</p>

               <p>Council. Find him out.</p>
               <p>Saunders. I have seen a person I am told was he: I received a particular description of the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see this person? What have you got in your hand?</p>
               <p>Saunders. Only a memorandum of the particulars: I have the original in my pocket: I made the original at the time the affair happened on the seventh of January, 1770; here is the original: the day before that was Saturday. Mr. Payne asked me to go to that place; he said, Bishop Talbot was to preach: he gave me a particular description of his person, as a man well advanced in years, and a meagre thin countenance, and that he was to have a mitre on his head; it was in <placeName id="t17710220-81-crimeloc391">White's Alley, Moorfields</placeName>

               <p>Q. Who did you say preached?</p>
               <p>Saunders. This person preached; when I came out there were a great number of people there besides their own; they said, that was Bishop Talbot; they told me so next day.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the person dressed that preached?</p>
               <p>Saunders. In a white robe.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the particulars?</p>
               <p>Saunders. He had a cap on when he came in, but he took it off.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the cap?</p>
               <p>Saunders. A blackish cap.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he put any thing else on?</p>
               <p>Saunders. Nothing then, but preached.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at any other time?</p>
               <p>Saunders. Yes, at two other times, June the 10th; it was the same person, he preached and catechised three young children.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that at the same place?</p>
               <p>Saunders. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed then?</p>
               <p>Saunders. In the same manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing on his head then?</p>
               <p>Saunders. No, nothing as I remember then.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200068"/>Q. Was any thing else done?</p>
               <p>Saunders. I understand he confirmed three children; I am told since it was catechising; I do not know from my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any particular ceremony used with these children?</p>
               <p>Saunders. After catechising of them he laid his hands on their heads and repeated some benedictions.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mass that day?</p>
               <p>Saunders. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who said mass?</p>
               <p>Saunders. One Mr. Dilton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Talbot say mass?</p>
               <p>Saunders. No, this was in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing further?</p>
               <p>Saunders. On the 24th of June the same person as before preached.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mass then?</p>
               <p>Saunders. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who said mass then?</p>
               <p>Saunders. I do not know whether Dillon or some other person; I did not take a memorandum of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing else done?</p>
               <p>Saunders. No, nothing else whatever, only there was one thing last Thursday. I met a person, who is either a brewer's clerk or a cooper, who endeavoured to frighten me from coming here.</p>
               <p>Court. You must not tell us any thing of any conversation that passed elsewhere. Did any body else say mass besides Dillon?</p>
               <p>Saunders. Yes, one Fowler.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Talbot say mass on the 10th of June: did you at any of these days hear Mr. Talbot say mass?</p>
               <p>Saunders. The person, called Talbot, said mass one day.</p>
               <p>Q. One day he did say mass; was it June the seventh?</p>
               <p>Saunders. No, I believe the 24th of June was the day: I know I made a memorandum of it (looks at his papers) he did not say mass, he only preached.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he administer the Sacrament any time?</p>
               <p>Saunders. They administered the Sacrament to several people; the person called Talbot was one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. When w as that?</p>
               <p>Saunders. It does not mention the day; I believe it was on the tenth of June, I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he administer the Sacrament?</p>
               <p>Saunders. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After what form?</p>
               <p>Saunders. The form of the Jewish ritual.</p>
               <p>Q. Look about and see if you can see the person?</p>
               <p>Saunders. I do not see any such person here; the person was far advanced in years that I saw. I do not see any such person.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You have produced a paper you made at that time: I suppose you took a minute of all that passed at that time?</p>
               <p>Saunders. Not particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you omit any thing?</p>
               <p>Saunders. It was not in my power to remember every thing that was said.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said one, two and three Sundays?</p>
               <p>Saunders. June the seventh, one Wheeler said mass; the person called Bishop Talbot preached on these words, my sheep hear my voice. June 10, one Dillon said mass, and Bishop Talbot preached, and either catechised or confirmed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put down these memorandums on those particular days, or put them all down together?</p>
               <p>Saunders. I put them down on particular bits of paper, and put them on one afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. When were these three put together?</p>
               <p>Saunders. They were writ a long while ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this wrote last week, or the week before?</p>
               <p>Saunders. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it wrote this week or last; was it wrote this week?</p>
               <p>Saunders. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it last week?</p>
               <p>Saunders. Possibly it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Here is nothing here of any bodies administering the Sacrament at all; you thought it so immaterial you did not put it down?</p>

               <p>Saunders. I saw it administered there several times.</p>
               <p>Q. As you speak with great caution, for which you ought to be very much commended, was the person thus described to you; I will not ask by whom, on the seventh of January, tenth of June, and twenty-fourth of June, by the name of Bishop Talbot: was that the same person all these days?</p>
               <p>Saunders. Yes, that very same person that was described to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200069"/>Q. What time was it you saw him?</p>
               <p>Saunders. It was in the afternoon he preached; I believe all the times was afternoon: no, one was in the forenoon, from eleven to one, in the afternoon from three to five.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been there often?</p>
               <p>Saunders. I have been there many years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you ever knew mass, except on one particular day in the year, last longer than twelve o'clock?</p>
               <p>Saunders. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. You know this was Trinity Sunday?</p>
               <p>Saunders. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I am pretty sure mass is not quite finished about ten minutes before twelve; what time might it begin?</p>
               <p>Saunders. About eleven; it takes up generally between forty and fifty minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did preaching begin in the afternoon?</p>
               <p>Saunders. I believe it might be some little matter after three, and then vespers are said, which is done about a quarter, perhaps, before five.</p>
               <p>Q. By whose orders did you go?</p>
               <p>Saunders. It was by Mr. Payne's desire I went.</p>
               <p>Q. What had he to do in this matter?</p>
               <p>Saunders. I was, and am under pecuniary obligations to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What has that to do with your going to enquire after these catholicks?</p>

            . I attended this court in December sessions. I took down the trial of lieutenant Hay, who was prosecuted by the prisoner at the bar for robbing him of a bundle of wearing apparel, specified in the indictment. The prisoner, in his evidence, swore, that he called in by accident at the City of Bristol, a public house near Iron Gate; that he had a porter with him, who had the bundle containing the things mentioned in the indictment. That Mr. Hay came into the house; that then he (the prisoner) ordered the porter to take the bundle away; that Mr. Hay insisted upon it he would have them; that there was a scuffle between Mr. Hay and the porter: that a press gang belonging to Mr. Hay came up to the porter with their clubs, which obliged him to deliver it to Mr. Hay; that Mr. Hay gave it to one of his men, and ordered him to lock it up for his (Mr. Hay's) use. Upon his cross examination, he said, he bought the goods for one

            ; that Kennedy was in the house, and was pressed before he (Smith) came into the house, and that Kennedy did not own the cloaths: that Mr. Hay gave no reason for taking the cloaths, and that from his soul he believed Mr. Hay took them with an intent to steal them; and that there was nothing said of his having bought them for Kennedy.</p>

            's rendezvous, which was in the City of Bristol, a public house, at Iron Gate. At half an hour after six in the evening, I was in the public kitchen by myself, writing a letter: I might be there about ten minutes; one of our people came to me, and said there was a man in the tap-room wanted to speak with me. I asked him his business; he said he was come with an information to press a man. I asked where he was; he said he did not know, but begg'd I would go into the tap room. The prisoner at the bar and the landlord came into the kitchen to me with some gin; they asked me to drink I said to the prisoner, For what acquaintance? he said, he had come with an information. I said, if I must go, I must: I drank a glass of gin, and three of our people went along with me. Going along, I asked where it was to; he said, to the Queen's Head on Tower-hill. I asked who was there; he said, the second mate of a vessel was there now shipping hands. He said, there were two ways to go into the house: he said, you and I will go in at one door, your ship-mate and you at the other. The prisoner sat down; I did not take him to be the landlord of the house, I took him to be a stranger till afterwards; he said he would pay for the liquor. He sat down, and took a pipe, and kindled it. I called for some beer; the landlady was sitting. I said to her, Have you here a mate of a vessel shipping hands? she said, No, he was not there. Then a girl comes to me, and said it was treachery. I said to the other people, it is time for us to be going: what we drank we paid for, and came away. After we had been at the City of Bristol about ten minutes, a messenger came to us to go up again to Smith's; I said, they are only playing tricks with us, it is to no purpose to go: this was between seven and eight on Saturday. Afterwards the prisoner came in, and a porter with him with a bundle of clothes under his arm: they came into the kitchen, and a man, that I found afterwards to be Kennedy, stood just by the fire. The prisoner took the two-arm'd-chair, and sat down by the fire; he pointed to the man, and said aloud to me, that is your man. He was very well dress'd. Kennedy and I went up to him, and said, Pray, Sir, have you any protection? he said, None at all. I said, What are you? he said, Second mate of the Eagle, and bound to the Bay of Honduras. I was obliged to detain him till my officer came in. Kennedy look'd round to Smith, and said, Is this your friendship to me to betray me? Smith turn'd it off with a laugh; and then Kennedy, going to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200071"/> the table where the bundle of things were laid, took it off, and put it on the copper. Then Smith took them off, and said, These are mine, and delivered them to the porter again: the porter set them on the table. Then Kennedy said, They are not yours, they are mine. Kennedy took them from the porter again, and delivered them to me. Words then ensued; Kennedy said, I insist upon it you take care of these; they are my property. Just about that time Mr. Hay came in, he said, William, what is the matter here? I said, Here is a man I have detained that has no protection. Mr. Hay said, Friend, what ship do you belong to? he said, The Eagle, bound to the Bay of Honduras. Mr. Hay said, he must send him on board the tender. Kennedy spoke to Mr. Hay, and said, those were his things, and begged Mr. Hay would let him have them. Smith said to Mr. Hay, No, they are mine, and he swore they were. Mr. Hay said, My honest men, or my lads, if you will come on Monday morning on board the tender, or here to my rendezvous (I can't say which) the right owner shall have them; then I was ordered to carry them up to the rendezvous to take care of them till Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you ordered to carry the goods then?</p>
               <p>Williams. Up into the rendezvous room, where Mr. Hay and the rest of the gentlemen did their business. After that I came down; Smith and Kennedy still had words about the things: Smith said they were his, and Kennedy said they were his: Kennedy said, Do you or not owe me money? Smith said, No: Kennedy said, You owe me the sum of four guineas; he repeated it, and the second time Smith owned he owed Kennedy the sum of four guineas. Kennedy asked him the third time; then he denied that he owed him four guineas. Monday was the regulating day; I went on board the tender on Monday. As I was walking the deck, pretty near twelve o'clock, I saw Smith there. Kennedy was then in the hold; Mr. Hay was in the cabin. Smith asked me what was to be done with the clothes; I said he would hear presently. He said, Why they are mine. I said, You heard what our lieutenant told you on Saturday. He said, Here is the receipt; I bought the things. I said, Why did you presume to come down to our house to have this man press'd? I imagine you bought these things for the man to have if he went on board his ship quietly; he said yes' but he wanted a whore; he turn'd it off with a laugh, and swore he would play the devil with our lieutenant. The clothes were sent on board by order of the regulating captain: I imagine Kennedy had the clothes afterwards; no person touched them except myself and Kennedy, and the porter: he never had his hand on them; he only saw them under my arm.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You pressed Kennedy?</p>
               <p>Williams. I was one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought the cloaths into the house?</p>
               <p>Williams. The porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the porter with?</p>
               <p>Williams. Along with Smith and Kennedy.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose servant did the porter appear to you to be, upon your oath?</p>
               <p>Williams. I believe, on my oath, he must be Smith's servant, as having the cloaths with him.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time the porter and Smith remained there, the porter, to rest himself, I suppose, had put the bundle on the table?</p>
               <p>Williams. Yes; and put himself down by the cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. The porter had never quitted the possession of the bundle?</p>
               <p>Williams. Not till such time as Kennedy took them from the table.</p>
               <p>Q. The man never voluntarily parted with the possession of his bundle?</p>
               <p>William. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, did he sit upon them?</p>
               <p>Williams. No; he sat-down along-side of them, on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. What could be the intention of the porter sitting down by the bundle?</p>
               <p>Williams. It might be till he delivered them up to take care of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Kennedy went and took them away. Were they on the bench or table?</p>
               <p>Williams. On the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did the porter part with them willingly?</p>
               <p>Williams. The porter never mentioned a word, nor a single syllable; he sat still.</p>
               <p>Q. He did nothing, nor said nothing to stop them?</p>
               <p>Williams. I cannot say the very particulars of what the porter said.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon you to swear, that the porter did or said nothing to prevent Kennedy's taking them?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200072"/>Williams. He did not move, and, to the best of my remembrance, he did not speak.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he hold of them?</p>
               <p>Williams. He had not his hand on them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Smith speak immediately?</p>
               <p>Williams. Yes; he said, They are mine. When Kennedy put them down on the copper, Smith jumped up, and took them from the copper.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the copper from the table?</p>
               <p>Williams. About two yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Kennedy catch them up in a hurry?</p>
               <p>Williams. Yes, it might be so; he took them up.</p>
               <p>Q. So Smith went and fetched them?</p>
               <p>Williams. He was sitting by the fire, in a two armed chair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Smith by that shew he would not part with the cloaths?</p>
               <p>Williams. He told the porter to take care of them, for they were his goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he deliver them to the porter again?</p>
               <p>Williams. He put them down on the table a second time, and bid the porter take care of them; he put them down by the porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Kennedy say any thing to that, or give any reason why he should not do it?</p>
               <p>Williams. Kennedy went to the table again, and took them from the table, and gave them to me, and insisted upon my taking care of them for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that objected to by Smith?</p>
               <p>Williams. Smith said, they were his, but he did not offer to take them out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How many of the press gang were round him at this time?</p>
               <p>Williams. I and

            , and there might be one more; and Mrs. Gibson and her sister.</p>
               <p>Q. When Smith still persisted in having his cloaths, where did Mr. Hay order them to be carried?</p>
               <p>Williams. To the rendezvous.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that a public room?</p>
               <p>Williams. Yes; used by him and his officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the evidence you gave at the last trial?</p>
               <p>Williams. Yes; as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give evidence that Mr. Hay ordered them to be carried up to his own room?</p>
               <p>Williams. That was not mentioned; that is to the rendezvous or his room; he rented the room at so much a week, but did not lodge there: he had another room.</p>

            . I was present when Kennedy was press'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Kennedy and Smith come together?</p>
               <p>Barton. Yes; and a porter with them. The porter had a bundle of clothes under his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to press him?</p>
               <p>Barton. Smith pointed to him, and said that was the man: he had been down before with an information.</p>
               <p>Q. What was said about the bundle of clothes?</p>
               <p>Barton. After he was pressed he went up to the porter, and took the cloaths, and put them on the copper. I believe the clothes were lying on the table near the porter; whether under his arm, or lying on the table, I cannot tell. Kennedy laid them on the copper; Smith, I believe, went and took the clothes; either Smith or the porter took them from the copper, and the porter had them in possession again. Smith demanded the clothes, and said they were his property. Kennedy talked to him, said several words to Smith: Kennedy said the clothes were his: Smith said they were his.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this before or after Mr. Hay came in?</p>
               <p>Barton. Before: he was not in the house at that time; he came in about four or five minutes after it was over, and the clothes were in our possession: the last witness had the clothes under his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mr. Hay came into the room what passed then?</p>
               <p>Barton. He asked what was the matter; I told him about the man being press'd. Smith said the clothes were his. Mr. Hay said, Good man, I cannot tell who the clothes belong to; but whoever they belong to, they shall have them. Kennedy insisted upon his keeping them for him, for they were his property. Kennedy insisted that as he was pressed, we should take care of them for him. Mr. Hay bid us carry them up into his room till Monday, and whoever they belonged to, should have them: he said so before Mr. Smith, and before all. Smith said but very little; then Kennedy insisted upon it they were his, and delivered them to us. He said the clothes belonged to him, and insisted upon our taking care of them.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a talk of money owing between Kennedy and Smith?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200073"/>Barton. Kennedy charged Smith with owing him money; the man was carried on board the tender.</p>
               <p>Q. Now on Monday on the regulating day what passed?</p>
               <p>Barton. I was not on board the tender.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw all this scuffle about the clothes between Smith and Kennedy?</p>
               <p>Barton. I saw him take the clothes from the porter, and delivered them to this Williams.</p>
               <p>Q. Kennedy, you say, insisted upon your taking care of the clothes for him?</p>
               <p>Barton. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What, the people of the gang?</p>
               <p>Barton. Yes; he insisted we should take care of the clothes for him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Mr. Hay do; where did he order them to be carried?</p>
               <p>Barton. Up stairs, in the room: I cannot say whether he mentioned rendezvous room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Smith at that time say he had not parted with the clothes?</p>
               <p>Barton. Smith said at that time the clothes belonged to him; Kennedy insisted upon it they were his property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Smith say he had bought them that afternoon, and had not been paid for them; did not he offer to shew a bill and receipt?</p>
               <p>Barton. Not to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. Were they carried into Mr. Hay's room?</p>
               <p>Barton. In the rendezvous room; he does not lodge there.</p>

            . I was present on Saturday at the City of Bristol; Mr. Smith, Kennedy, and the porter came in together: the porter had a bundle with clothes in it: when they came in, the press-gang press'd this Kennedy.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they to press him?</p>
               <p>Gibson. Smith came before with an information for them to press him: he pointed to him, and said, That is the man. Kennedy said he gave Smith a note to receive 4 l. for him, and he bought the clothes for him to go on board that evening. Kennedy said they were his property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Hay take the clothes to himself?</p>
               <p>Gibson. He never touch'd them at all: he said the right owner should have them on Monday, when the man that was press'd was regulated.</p>
               <p>Q. Each claim'd the cloaths and took them away.</p>
               <p>Gibson. Yes; then Mr. Hay said he would order the clothes to be laid aside, and the right owner should have them on Monday.</p>

There was some clothes, in a bundle, a porter brought in under his arm, that was put down on the kitchen table. The porter sat down on a bench by the table. Then as soon as Kennedy found he was press'd, he said, You villain! is this the way you brought me here to be betray'd. He went to the table, and took the clothes from the table, and put them on the copper. Smith said they belonged to him; Kennedy said they did not. Kennedy said they belonged to me, and besides that you know you owe me four guineas, and I have got your note for it. Smith denied it; at last he own'd he did owe him four guineas. Mr. Hay came in at this time; he said, Lads, what is the matter? Williams said, a man is press'd. Kennedy went up to Captain

               <p>Q. Was you tried here for this felony?</p>
               <p>Hay. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Smith's evidence? I don't mean to trouble you with all that evidence; please to give an account of the transaction on Saturday night and on Monday night.</p>
               <p>Hay. It was about seven in the evening when I came in, or a little after. I found at my rendezvous three or four people in the kitchen. I desired to know the reason of the confusion; I found them a little confused. Smith and the men that were impressed were disputing about a bundle of clothes. When I came to be informed of the matter, that the man had no protection, I said, Very well my lad, I will put you on board the tender; and as for the clothes, whose property they are, that matter should be settled before the regulating captain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Kennedy insist upon their being his own clothes in your presence?</p>
               <p>Hay. Yes; each of them claimed a right to the clothes: I was not at liberty to know whose property they were. I ordered the clothes up into my rendezvous room (a large room I do business in) till Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Smith any objection to their being put aside in order to being kept till Monday?</p>
               <p>Hay. I don't remember in the least that he made any objection.</p>
               <p>Q. On Monday did you go on board the tender.</p>
               <p>Hay. Yes, I did; and the captains, as they usually do, asked the men if he had any chest and bedding, or clothes: he said he had a bundle of clothes, his property, at my rendezvous.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Smith there then?</p>
               <p>Hay. I did not see Smith at all.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom were the clothes delivered?</p>
               <p>Hay. To the master of the tender; for which a receipt was given.</p>

He said he wanted some tin goods; three dozen of lanthorns of a sort. I set them down on a slate. I said I must have time to get them ready. He said, well then I will call again to-morrow. I will go to one Dare at Charing Cross, and I shall get some things there. He came next day about noon, and said he had got ovens and several things, and I was to tell him what things I had got. I told him I had about a dozen lanthorns of a sort; he wanted three sizes I think, and he wanted seven ovens. As to the particulars I cannot say every thing; I believe there was a dozen candlesticks of a sort, and sauce-pans; and there were five bottles to hold four gallons each of oil; and there were thirty-two put into the five bottles. I advised him to have the oil in a cask, he said, the bottles would be of use to him when he came to Saint Kits, to hold aqua fortis. There were eighteen tin kettles; there were two dozen of candlesticks, I believe; and I think eighteen sauce-pans.</p>
               <p>Q. All part of the original order?</p>
               <p>Hinkes. Yes; he came in the evening, and said, he would come next day. I expected him at noon, he did not come till evening. That was the third time, I believe it might be about five or six o'clock. I invited him into the parlour, as I expected to be paid; he drank a dish of tea as he was a standing just at the fire. He stooped down and pulled out a little red pocketbook, and says, I have a note that is not due, and here is a check. He gave me this draught on Walpole, Clark, and Bourn, (producing it.) I took it into the closet. I had not cash enough. The first order was about 10 l. or odd. I went out to a neighbour and borrowed five guineas. When I returned again, he said, he would have three more stone bottles, which I believe made it forty shillings more. Upon that I gave him twelve guineas and three shillings, which was the balance. He was not to have had twelve guineas, but he said, people that I deal with allow discount; and as I expected his favours again, I allowed him discount; he should have had a shilling more. He said he would come on the morrow by twelve o'clock, which was the Saturday. I said the bottles of oil will not be ready by that time. He said he would come with a cart and take what I had, and come by four o'clock in the afternoon for the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason did he give for wanting them so soon?</p>
               <p>Hinkes. He said he was going away.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200075"/>Q. Did he mention the time?</p>
               <p>Hinkes. I cannot say, I went in the morning with the check to Messrs. Walpole, Clark, and Bourn; they said they had no such person kept cash with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever come for the goods?</p>
               <p>Hinkes. No.</p>
