               <p>Hewitt. At Mr. Kennedy's Shop [Coat produced, and sworn to].</p>
               <p>Morgan Bennet. I was at Mr. Kennedy's in Leaden-hall-street, and saw the prisoner at the bar take a coat off the coach-box, but I did not know then but that he was the owner of it, and belonged to the coach. It was likewise observed by one of the ladies who came in the coach, who immediately told Mr. Kennedy that a man had taken the coat off the coach-box; upon which Mr. Kennedy inquired something of the man, and which way he went, and then pursued and took him about St. Mary Axe, and brought him back to his house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Mr. Kennedy do then?</p>
               <p>Bennet. Sent for a constable, and carried him before my lord mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say before my lord mayor?</p>
               <p>Bennet. That he had never done any such thing before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kennedy. The 21st of January two ladies came in a chariot to my house; the first witness,

He said he took it off a coach box. I said he must go back with me to my house; which he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Morgan Bennet give you any account of the matter?</p>
               <p>Mr. Kennedy. Only that he saw the man take it; but did not know then but it might be his own. It was the lady that gave me the information, upon which I went after him; but she could not be persuaded to go with me before my lord mayor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>Said, That the coat lay a good part of it upon the ground, and that he picked it up from thence, and stood there for a good while without attempting to run away with it.</p>

I returned again in the evening; but I did not miss the shirt till the next morning, and then I looked for it, but could not find it. I suspected the prisoner at the bar of taking it, as she came often to the house, and I had no reason to suspect any body else. I got a warrant to search, and, upon inquiry, finding the prisoner, I charged her with having taken the shirt. She at first denied it, afterwards she owned she had taken the shirt, and pawned it at Mr. Brooks's for 4 s. Where I found it. This is the shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. What means did you use to induce her to confess it?</p>
               <p>E. Best. I promised to be as favourable as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know the shirt by particularly?</p>

I took it in my hand, and said, I think this very thing broke open my house; and, upon return home, we fitted it to several holes made in the drawers and cupboard doors.</p>
               <p>Q. What other reason have you to think it was done by that instrument?</p>
               <p>M. Combes. Any-body might see it was done by such an instrument, and this fitted the places.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Combes, in your presence, ask him any questions about that instrument?</p>
               <p>M. Combes. No; Mr. Combes asked him about it afterwards at Sir

            , carpenter. I was sent for to Mr. Combes's, to see what kind of instrument had opened the shutter, cupboard-door, and drawers, and I said it was forced by some other instrument than common pick-lock tools; that I imagined that it was by a screw like what is called a cooper's vice. This is what is called so [holding it up.] When this instrument had been found in his room, I tried it, and I found it went in very easy; and that this instrument, or some other like it, must have opened the desk, the drawers, and cupboard.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they were forced by a screw?</p>
               <p>Edwards. The desk was forced in the joint opposite to the lock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the leaf of the desk much torn or not, or the drawers?</p>
               <p>Edwards. The holes made in the flap of the desk were pretty much torn, but the drawers were not.</p>
               <p>Q. So all we know from your evidence is, that this was done by that or some other instrument like it.</p>
               <p>Constable. They brought me a warrant to search this man's house, and to take him up. Upon searching his house, we found this screw; and when I met with the man afterwards, I told him he must go along with me. He asked for my authority. I said, Here it is; upon that he struck me with his fist; and I said he had better be easy, and go with me. He then took his knife, and threatened to rip me up; and he got away from me then, but I afterwards took him.</p>

She at first refused it; then I insisted upon her setting down the box, and forced it open. On the top of the box were the seven bottles of wine mentioned in the indictment, viz, two bottles of Sherry, three of Malaga, and two of Madeira.</p>
               <p>Q. The indictment mentions them to be your property: how do you know that?</p>
               <p>Barnard. I went down in my cellar to see, and there I saw the vacancies where those bottles had stood.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you keep those different sorts of wine in different places?</p>
               <p>Barnard. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the wine before?</p>
               <p>Barnard. About two hours before, I went down with this servant, and I unfortunately left the key in the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, when you went in with the prisoner, take any notice whether the wine was all there?</p>
               <p>Barnard. I observed it in the same situation as I had placed it; the Madeira stood by the Sherry, and there were only two bottles of each in that place.</p>
               <p>Q. When you opened the box, you say you saw the bottles of wine at the top?</p>
               <p>Barnard. Yes, my Lord, and several other things, as soap, starch, &amp;c. not mentioned in the indictment. I then sent for a constable; and, upon his searching, he found the night-cap and handkerchief in her pocket?</p>
               <p>Q. Was you there when he searched her pockets?</p>
               <p>Barnard. No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. How then do you know that the cap and handkerchief taken from her were your property?</p>
               <p>Barnard. They were my wife's, as my maid will prove.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any particular mark upon the corks or the bottles?</p>
               <p>Barnard. No, my Lord, but she acknowledged before the justice her taking them out of my cellar.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you miss it?</p>
               <p>Hickman. The 24th of December I was down at my warehouse at <placeName id="t17620224-5-crimeloc27">Woolwich</placeName>

               <p>Q. Where was it you first missed your cheese?</p>
               <p>Hickman. At the same time and place?</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find this butter and cheese again?</p>
               <p>Hickman. In the hands of Mr. Trumbell, constable. [The case produced, the hoops were stripped off, and just begun to be cut.]</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know this firkin to be yours?</p>
               <p>Hickman. The dairyman cuts the letters I H, and the cooper likewise marks them with this mark. [ Showing it.]</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure, from these marks, that this is your firkin of butter?</p>
               <p>Hickman. Yes, I am sure of it; and by the like marks I know the cheese to be mine, taken out of 15 that I had of the same sort, and I went before the justice to swear to the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner before the justice with you?</p>
               <p>Hickman. Yes; and the justice told him he was very sorry to see a man so capable of getting his bread charged with a thing of that kind. He said he had found them, and that what he thought a fault, he thought none. However, he went away from me at that time, and soon after sent me a letter that he was innocent; that he should attend his business, and would surrender himself to the constable in time, or to the same effect.</p>

               <p>Berry. Mr. Hickman's, delivered by Mr. Hickman's waterman, and I was to take up 20 firkins more at the Three Cranes.</p>
               <p>Q. You staid all night, you say; when did you take in the other 20?</p>
               <p>Berry. The next morning, and carried it from thence to Woolwich.</p>

               <p>Berry. In the morning, before we took in the other 20, and likewise the cheese.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you give Mr. Hickman notice of it?</p>
               <p>Berry. I sent my servant down to Woolwich, and mean while I went and got a search warrant and the constable for to search, and I found them at the prisoner's house, in the manner before-mentioned, and did not go to acquaint Mr. Hickman of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does the prisoner live?</p>
               <p>Berry. At Red-maid Lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might that be from the wharf where the goods lay?</p>

               <p>Q. What was the latest time in the evening when you saw those goods?</p>
               <p>Berry. About 9 o'clock, when I left the boat.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that when you left the boat yourself, all the butter and cheese was in the boat?</p>
               <p>Berry. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the marks on the butter tub and the cheese when you took them into your boat?</p>
               <p>

               <p>Berry. The watchman at the Red Bull wharf said he had seen the prisoner at that wharf about twelve o'clock that night.</p>

I was obliged to go away again about my business; and before I returned home again, a person told me my house had been searched, and such things found. I said I was innocent as to any theft; but when such things were found, I had carried them home, that the owner, upon inquiry, might have them again. I went home, and out again, as my business called me, till such time as they began to find the bills at Hicks's Hall the last session, then I was less at home; and I sent my wife to Mr. Hickman, to let him know that it was not thro' any fear of coming to him, I knew myself innocent, and he might depend upon it I would appear at the proper time to answer for myself at the court; I was told, my Lord, that if I did, I need not go before the justice. I came and spoke to Mr. Akerman, and said, I came in order to surrender myself; but Mr. Akerman said, there was no bail found, and therefore he could take no surrender; upon that I went into my business again, and I think in two or three days afterwards I went to surrender myself to the constable, with bail for my appearance. At this time, my Lord, I went before the justice, who said, there cannot be any bail for you. I said, that was very hard, for I was very unwilling to injure my family; but that did not avail, I was committed.</p>

            . I am a lighterman; I live at the Hermitage, servant to one Mr. Staples, and the prisoner was fellow-servant with me a great many years, and was at this time; and it is our business to look after our craft, and to do what business offers, and look out for more; and in the night preceding the 24th of December I was in a lighter at Red Bull wharf, to make it fast, and there was another lighter by, which my partner went into, to get a piece of rope; and, going down into the stern sheet, he found the bag with the things mentioned, and he said, Here is a prize; and I said, Hand it up, which he did; and it was put into the skiff, and he carried it to his house, saying, Somebody may inquire after it, and, if they do, they may have it; and afterwards, on the same day, I heard his house had been searched.</p>
               <p>Q. So you heard him say he would take it home, that if any-body inquired after it they might have it?</p>
               <p>Woodward. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not look to see what prize this was?</p>
               <p>Woodward. No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not inspect it at all, but went down with your lighter, and, upon your return the same day, heard the prisoner's house had been searched. - Did you hear by whom, and on whose behalf?</p>
               <p>Woodward. I think not till the day after.</p>
               <p>Q. As you appear to be acquainted with this affair, did you ever go to acquaint Mr. Hickman with it, or of his character?</p>
               <p>Woodward. No, my lord, I never troubled myself about it; Mr. Hickman had his things, and the prisoner follow'd his business as usual, and continued so to do for two months, so I thought nothing more would come of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hickman was asked if the constable endeavoured to take him?</p>

               <p>Q. You mean there was not found that quantity of linen you expected?</p>
               <p>Black. It was merely according to the inventory they gave me, saying, here is the inventory we had; but, seeing no date to it, I was in some doubt whether it might be right; however, they pretended it was the inventory given to them; but when, they could not tell; the linen which they then delivered was in great confusion, and hardly sorted.</p>
               <p>Q. When they delivered up the linen, did you check the inventory according to the several articles?</p>
               <p>Black. Yes, and found it nearly agreed, but not exactly; this was late at night, at least ten o'clock. The next day, as I began to examine this inventory, great doubts arose, how such a family could be so extremely destitute of linen. About two or three days after they went away, a very considerable bill was presented by the linen-draper, and I was surprised that all those goods should be charged to my Lord, and so few or scarcely any of them to be found.</p>
               <p>Q. What might the amount of the bill be?</p>
               <p>Black. I believe, including a former bill, above a hundred pounds.</p>

I said I could not wait so long, he must be sent for. Upon this one of the prisoners went down, and soon after came up again, and said he would be at home between one and two o'clock. However, my suspicion rather increased, and I went down and asked the landlord's daughter whose room it was. Sir, said she, the room belongs to them, and they pay rent for it. Upon this I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176202240009"/> up stairs, and desired

The lock was on this side of their lodging - the constable therefore unscrewed the lock. I asked if there was any thing of theirs in that room. They said, yes, a box or two. Upon my entering the room, I found it to be a perfect ware-room, and contained such a quantity of things as one could scarce expect to be collected together. Pointing to a box, that appeared to have belonged to a coach. I asked if that was theirs; and they told me it was. Then I desired them to take the things out; and

               <p>Q. Am I to understand by your account, that you never was in the shop?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never was; I asked the constable and the gentleman, the next day, what business they had with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any witnesses to call?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No.</p>

            . On Wednesday the 10th of February, between six and seven in the evening, as I was sitting in the parlour behind the tap-room, a woman in the fore room picked up a black silk apron that lay on the floor; she called out to my wife to know if she had lost any thing, and my wife went and took it of her. On her returning to me, she said, the Lord bless me, how came this apron out of my drawers? I said, you must take more care of your things. The maid (the prisoner at the bar) went up stairs some little time before, and my wife going up stairs, I immediately heard her talk something about fire; then I went up stairs, and casting my eye to the bed I found the bed cloaths a fire, and my wife turned about, and said, O! Lord, Sall, what have you done! I turned about as she was going out of the room, and gave her two or three kicks as she went down; she ran out of the house, and I went back immediately to put the fire out, not seeking at all after her. Some people in the tap-room seeing a smoke, came up stairs, and one of them seeing smoke come out of the drawers in the same room, we opened the drawers and found some part of them on fire, with some things in them. After the fire was extinguished, we began to examine what things were missing out of the drawers. About this time a girl came in and picked up a muslin double ruffle at the door, which the maid had dropped.</p>
               <p>Q. Who saw her drop it?</p>

               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner lived with you?</p>
               <p>S. Dalton. Three months.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you put them in the indictment?</p>
               <p>S. Dalton. Because they were in the house that afternoon, and never found since.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a suspicion of her dishonesty when you kicked her down stairs?</p>

            . As I and my husband were sitting in the back room, some person said, Mrs. Dalton what have you lost? I said, I don't know that I have lost any thing; they said I had; and with that I went to them and found a black silk apron: I went into the next room, and said to my husband, Lord have mercy upon me, how came this apron here? And my husband said, It is carelessness in you not to keep your drawers fast; upon that I went up stairs, and pulled the latch of the door, but could not readily get it open. When I did, the candle was out, and I said; Who is there? what is the matter? And the maid answered, Nobody but me, Madam. Then said I, What have you done? what is the matter? there is fire in the room. And I said, For God's sake, go down and light the candle as quick as possible; but, she staying some time, I called out for somebody to come up stairs; which they did, and went to the bed side, and the bed was tucked in very close; and we pulled off the sheets and blankets, and found it all on fire; and one of the men looked at the drawers, and saw they were in a smoke, and took out one of the drawers, and turned out the things, and they were on fire; here are the remains of several things that were on fire; and there were in the drawers before, three pair of double ruffles, a gauze handkerchief, one black silk handkerchief, one flowered linen one, and three large silver table<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176202240012"/> spoons; so looking over the things that were left, I said, Lord have mercy upon me, what signifies what is left, so many things are lost! At this juncture, Mr. Bradfield, sitting in the house, said, here is something pick'd up since you went up stairs; that was one pair of ruffles and one yard of plain muslin.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do upon this?</p>
               <p>A. Dalton. I was quite unhappy about it, finding my sheets and linen burnt, and many things lost, and I could not hear where the girl was, till my husband, by much inquiry, found her, and took her before Justice Fielding for examination.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of that examination, did you find out any of the other things you lost?</p>
               <p>A. Dalton. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the person who told you a little girl had picked up some things at the door?</p>
               <p>A. Dalton. Mr. Bradfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know where the prisoner's father lived?</p>
               <p>A. Dalton. I did not at that time; I took her upon her uncle's account.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Mr. Kelley's to inquire for her that night?</p>
               <p>A. Dalton. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray now, good woman, when you heard where the father's house was, why did not you search his house next morning?</p>
               <p>A. Dalton. I really did not know; I believe her father's house was searched some time the next day.</p>

             asked for the mistress, and said a young woman that went out had dropt some things, did you see a young woman go out?</p>
               <p>Bradfield. I heard her go out.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was her?</p>
               <p>Bradfield. No, I am not.</p>
               <p>- Brenton. I was at Mr. Dalton's about six or seven o'clock, sitting in the tap-room, and I heard an uncommon noise of the girl's running down stairs, and she ran through the tap-room with something in her apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her.</p>
               <p>Brenton. I saw her running by me out of the door, my Lord, and just after she had ran by me a man pick'd up a black silk apron; soon after that I heard Mrs. Dalton cry out, that the house was on fire: then I ran up stairs in order to put it out. When I came there I found three upper drawers on fire, and Mr. Dalton putting it out in the bedcloaths. One of the witnesses ran and fetched some water, and we took the things out of the drawers, and dipt them in it, in order to put out the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the house?</p>
               <p>Brenton. No, she was gone about three minutes before, and never came back any more till she was brought back.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it the black silk apron was found? Was it before or after the girl came running down?</p>

               <p>Brenton. Upon her running down, she dropt it going out of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the black silk apron was not found before she came running down stairs?</p>
               <p>Brenton. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing being said to Mrs. Dalton about the apron?</p>
               <p>Brenton. Not till after the girl was out of the house?</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what occasion did Mrs. Dalton go up stairs?</p>
               <p>Brenton. Mrs. Dalton called to the girl, and she made no answer; then she went up stairs, and found the room on fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Just after the girl was gone, and the apron found, did any-body call in, saying, I saw a ruffle drop'd, and I pick'd it up.</p>
               <p>Brenton. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the room when it was delivered?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176202240013"/>Brenton. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober at that time?</p>

               <p>Brenton. As sober as a judge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you up in the room at all?</p>
               <p>Brenton. Yes, and assisted at putting the fire out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the discovery made by the girl after the fire was put out or before?</p>
               <p>Brenton. The apron was before; but I cannot say whether the ruffle was found before or not.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the first alarm?</p>
               <p>Brenton. The girl's coming down stairs in a great hurry, and dropping something which appeared to be this apron; and soon after a girl brought in the muslin ruffle and some muslin.</p>

               <p>Mr. Payne. I am a carpenter at Hammersmith, and was intrusted to take care of a house belonging to 'Squire Fawkener, and to do something to it; there were two chimney glasses, and several locks upon the doors, and some other things. Some time in November my servant informed me, that some of the locks had been taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go to the house yourself?</p>
               <p>Payne. The 26th of November; and I missed the six locks, two chimney glasses, and some galley tiles.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do then?</p>
               <p>Payne. I acquainted Mr. Fawkener with it, and consulted what to do.</p>

            . Some time in November last, the prisoner and I went to a House of Mr. Fawkener, and took away from thence six or seven brass locks and some galley tiles. When we had taken the locks off, we concluded to sell the tiles first; but not meeting with a purchaser, then we endeavoured to sell a lock. As we could not meet with any-body immediately to buy it, we carried it to Mr. Hilton, a pawnbroker, to pawn it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you pawn it for?</p>
               <p>Smith. Two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the rest of the things?</p>
               <p>Smith. We got leave for the tiles to remain at the pawnbroker's till we called for them, the locks we took home to Izack's house. and we took the insides of the locks out; for that, he said, would be the best way to sell them. A day or two after he told me, I should sell or pawn one, and he and I went into Swithin's-alley, Le cester fields, and I pawned it for 18 d. at Mr. Watson's. Then, my Lord, we parted; he had the rest, and in a day or two he sold one, but where I cannot say. Then I sold one.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the tiles?</p>
               <p>Smith. He told me he had sold them to a man in the street.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176202240014"/>Q. How did you divide the rest?</p>
               <p>Smith. The first lock that he sold he kept the money, and for that I sold I kept the money; but I know not what became of the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the chimney glasses?</p>
               <p>Smith. We saw none when we were there; we only took brass locks and the galley tiles.</p>
               <p>Q. How much had you of the first lot that was pawn'd?</p>
               <p>Smith. One shilling, my lord.</p>

            . I am the person who first missed the things. Some time after Michealmas there was one chimney glass in the parlour, and another in the housekeeper's room up stairs, besides a lookingglass in another chamber, and several brass locks, I believe 12 or 13. Afterwards a gentleman came to look at the house, and he asked me if there were locks to the doors; and I said, yes, brass locks. Then I went to shew him the house, and missed six or seven of the locks, and called my fellow-servant to shew him that the locks had been taken off; and observed, that the person, who had taken them off, had broke the boxes, not knowing that they were false ones; and, upon acquainting my master of it, he ordered me to take off the rest, which I did. Some time in January a person came to look at the house, and it appeared to us, that the doors must have been broke open to get at the things up stairs.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to suspect him?</p>
               <p>Scarrolt. Because he went on faster than I thought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176202240015"/> he could afford; and I went to an officer, and he told me he would mark me 2 s. in half-pence, and I carried them home to my wife, who put it in the till; and the shop door was locked in the morning, there was a quartern loaf missing, and 3 s. 5 d. gone out of the till; so I called the officer, and he and I went up into the lodger's room, and there we found a quartern loaf; and when I mentioned the loaf, the officer said he would swear to most of the half pence which lay in the chair under his window, and there lay the key also.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner at this time? was he awake?</p>
               <p>Scarrolt. Yes, and in bed, with his breeches and stockings on.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to him?</p>
               <p>Scarrolt. Asked him how he came to do so; and he made us no answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the shop door locked on the Sunday morning?</p>
               <p>Scarrolt. Yes, and I had the key; and this is the key that was found in the chair with the money, and opens the lock of my shop door as well as my own.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the key of his room?</p>
               <p>Scarrolt. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it at the time you let him the room?</p>
               <p>Scarrolt. For aught I know to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Scarrolt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put any marked money into your till?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Scarrolt. Yes, I put 15 d. in marked halfpence into my till, and 4 s. 9 d. of other, on the 6th of Feb.</p>
               <p>Q. Of whom did you receive the marked halfpence?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Scarrolt. From my husband, and the next day there was 3 s. 5 d, missing.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do upon finding you were robbed of the marked money?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Scarrolt. My husband had a search warrant ready, and he went for the officer, and they went up to his room together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up with them?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Scarrolt. No, nor sawer knew any thing that passed, till they went thro' my room below stairs to have him to prison.</p>

When I charged him with the fact, he said he had taken them for his wages. I said, that was his mistake.

When I came to serve her, a young man in the neighbourhood came into inform me I had a suspicious person to take care of. I took him to the lower end of the shop, to hear what he had to say, and returned again to the drawers, not supposing she had had time to take any thing: She objected to the price of the buckles, and I drew out another drawer to suit her better, and she pitched upon a pair of buckles, and asked for half a dozen of tea spoons, and I produced two sets; upon which I weighed them, and she wanted a larger abatement than is common in our trade; but the intimation I had, made me resolve to see whether she came to buy, or not, and agreed to her price. Then she desired them to be marked, while she went to Covent Garden, and she would call again. I said, If you leave earnest, I will. She said. No, if I did not chuse to mark them, I may let it alone. My neighbour informing me she was a suspicious person, I asked if she had any money to buy spoons; and said; If you have no money, you must be looked upon as having a bad design, and should be dealt with accordingly (In the time of her being in the shop she took this buckle). I then took her before justice Fielding, and we searched her, but found nothing upon her; however, upon my complaint, and an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176202240017"/> advertisement of a ring lost, she was committed on suspicion. Upon my return I found this buckle lying on the floor, and I inquired if any-body had been there to cheapen any buckles, or any-body had been at the drawers, and nobody had been in the shop; and I can take upon me to say no one but she could take it, for this buckle was in the drawer.</p>

In the morning of the 6th of February I had some mistrust of her, and I asked her leave to go into her apartment. She said, I might go when I pleased. When I came into her room, I missed the things specified in the indictment; and I asked her about the window-curtains, why she took them down; and she said they came down. I asked her where they were. She desired me not to be angry; she had pawned them, but she would take them out of pawn, and put them up again. I asked her how I could rely upon that, when she had so deceived me. I asked her where she had pawned them, that I might get them again. She said, she did not chuse to tell me, but promised to get them again. I told her she must tell me where my things were, otherwise farther trouble would ensue both to her and me. I asked her if she knew the consequence attending these things? She said, No. I then told her, my Lord, the consequence, as I had been informed, would be transportation. At length she told me where she had pledged them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it?</p>
               <p>H. Copley. At Mr. Payn's in Golden-lane; and then I sent for a person to go with me; but, being told I must get an officer, I sent for Mr. Cambrook.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go in company with him to Mr. Payn's?</p>
               <p>H. Copley. Mr. Cambrook and the prisoner went to Mr. Payn's; and Payn acknowleged that such things were there, and said she must go before a magistrate. Then, my Lord, I went to Justice Welch, and he ordered me and Payn the broker to come to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Payn produce the things before you went to Justice Welch?</p>
               <p>H. Copley. No, my Lord, not till the Wednesday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you there the Wednesday following, when the goods were produced?</p>
               <p>H. Copley. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they the same things mentioned in the indictment?</p>
               <p>H. Copley. Yes; one sheet and the other things were produced before Justice Welch, the other sheet was pawned elsewhere.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say before the justice?</p>
               <p>H. Copley. She acknowleged the fact; said necessity obliged her to do it; that she designed to get them again, and put them in their places.</p>
               <p>Q. You say one of the sheets was pawned elsewhere; where was that?</p>
               <p>H. Copley. At Mr. Batcock's in Golden Lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you discover that?</p>
               <p>H. Copley. By her own confession; and Mr. Smith, Mr. Payn's man, went with me, and Mr. Batcock delivered the sheet to me.</p>

               <p>S. Kennon. I had never known him but for the neighbours. Last Wednesday se'nnight I was turning <placeName id="t17620224-18-crimeloc100">down Dias-street , near St. Giles's</placeName>

               <p>Q. How long had you seen this cart before the accident happened?</p>
               <p>S. Kennon. But just before I expected it was going down St. Giles's, and it turned short, and I cried out to the young man, for Christ's sake, to stop.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was the cart from you when you cried out?</p>
               <p>S. Kennon. About two or three yards.</p>
               <p>Q. How many horses were there?</p>
               <p>S. Kennon. Three.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that the foremost of the three horses was two yards distant from your husband?</p>
               <p>S. Kennon. Yes, and if he had stopped then, my husband had been safe.</p>
               <p>Q. When you called out to this man to stop, did you observe at what rate he was coming?</p>
               <p>S. Kennon hesitated, and seemed not to understand.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray attend,

            , to my question: Was the man driving slow or fast, when you cried, For Christ's sake, stop?</p>
               <p>S. Kenning did not answer the question, but said he whipped his horses twice, and the fore horse beat him down, and the wheel ran over him in an instant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man see your husband fall?</p>

               <p>S. Kennon. I cannot say he did.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was between 6 and 7 o'clock, how was it as to light?</p>
               <p>S. Kennon. I could see from one end of the street to the other.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was it from the corner that your husband was thrown down?</p>
               <p>S. Kennon. About four yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you called out to the carman to stop, and, instead of that, he drove on?</p>
               <p>S. Kennon. Yes, he drove faster.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your husband speak after he was thrown down?</p>
               <p>S. Kennon. No, his brains were beat out in an instant.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner afterwards?</p>
               <p>S. Kennon. He went on; I had enough to do to take care of my husband.</p>

            . About six or seven o'clock in the evening I happened to be coming down Dias-street, about five or six yards from the bottom of it, and I saw a man, and a woman leading him by the hand. I was on one side of the way, and they on the other, where there was a lamp, and they seemed to be both in liquor, but afterwards I thought otherwise. for the man, I understood, was almost blind; and I observed an empty cart turning down the corner of the street, the corner where the man and woman were.</p>
               <p>Q. On which side of the way was the carman? was he on the side where the man and woman were. or on the other side?</p>
               <p>J. Stewart. He was on the other side.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the horses go between the carter and the man that was killed?</p>

               <p>J. Steward. Yes, my Lord, and the man gave the horse a lash, and I called to him, for God's sake, to stop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call out to him before or after he had given the lash?</p>
               <p>J. Stewart. After he had given the lash.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened then?</p>
               <p>J. Stewart. The horses drove on, and I called out again, for I thought myself in danger, and he gave the horse another lash after I called.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first called out, for God's sake, to stop, how long was it before he gave another lash?</p>
               <p>J. Stewart. Very soon after.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before the man was run over?</p>
               <p>J. Stewart. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. When he gave the second lash, can you say whether the deceased was then upon the ground?</p>
               <p>J. Stewart. I believe, to the best of my knowlege, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether the carter had hold of the thill-horse, or otherwise?</p>
               <p>J. Stewart. I cannot say; he stood near the side of one of them, and I ran to the other side; and when I was at some distance I looked about, and saw the deceased lie on the ground, and the wheel go over his head or neck, I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>Q. How far distant was that?</p>
               <p>J. Stewart. About five or six yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the cart drive on?</p>
               <p>J. Stewart. Yes, at a very quick rate.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there an outcry?</p>
               <p>J. Stewart. I think there was, but I was too confused to know from whom.</p>
               <p>Q. You speak very cautiously; how long afterwards? before the man was taken was taken up?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176202240019"/>J. Stewart. The next day, and I was at the coroner's inquest.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you seen the cart before it turned the corner.</p>
               <p>J. Steward. I never saw it till it turned the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. At what rate was it going before the accident?</p>
               <p>J. Steward. At a quick pace, before any lash was given.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took up the deceased from the ground?</p>
               <p>J. Steward. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner at the bar drive on the cart, and take no care of the man?</p>
               <p>J. Steward. He did not stop to take any care of him.</p>

            . I was going to fetch some candles and oatmeal in Broad St. Giles's, and this man's cart stood at a stationer's about three doors from Dias-street, and he came out of the shop, and said Gee-ho? to the horses, and they went on, and were going to turn into Dias-street to go home; and as he turn'd a quick pace, I said, Jack, stop your horses; and he said directly, D - n your eyes Gee-ho? and gave them either two cuts or three, and then they went a full gallop.</p>
               <p>Q. When you call'd out to him, whereabout was the cart?</p>
               <p>D. Jolly. The fore horse had just turn'd the corner post.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when you call'd out to him?</p>
               <p>D. Jolly. I had just cross'd the way, and was oblig'd to keep up very close to avoid danger: then Icried out to him, for god's sake, to stop; instead of which, he made use of that expression.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at the stationer's?</p>
               <p>D. Jolly. I saw the horses there. I saw him come out of the stationer's and heard him say, Gee-ho: and they went on.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner at the bar is the man?</p>
               <p>D. Jolly. My Lord, I am very sure of the man.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again after the accident?</p>
               <p>D. Jolly. The same evening; he came up stairs into my room, to ask me a question; I answer'd him, and he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there nothing said concerning the misfortune that had happen'd?</p>
               <p>D. Jolly. Yes, my Lord and he said he hoped I would not appear against him; and I said I would not say any thing about it, unless I was oblig'd.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he taken up?</p>
               <p>D. Jolly. Next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observed whether the man had hold of either of his horses?</p>
               <p>D. Jolly. No, my Lord, he had no hold but was pretty near the side of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he at all in liquor at the time?</p>
               <p>D. Jolly. I cannot say that he was.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You was in Dias-street, you say, and saw the old man and woman attempting to cross, and you saw the sore horse push him down; can you tell whether the first witness c alled out before the horse pushed him down or not?</p>
               <p>D. Jolly. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before or after you call'd out?</p>
               <p>D. Jolly. I call'd out before the man was run over.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make use of any endeavours to stop upon your calling out?</p>
               <p>D. Jolly. None that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he heard you call?</p>
               <p>D. Jolly. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he see the man that had fell down?</p>
               <p>D. Jolly. I believe he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the farthest wheel from the carter, or the nearest that run over the man?</p>
               <p>D. Jolly. The farthest, so that he could not see the accident happen.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he driving a good pace?</p>
               <p>D. Jolly. Yes, a great pace.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might it be to the stable door?</p>
               <p>D. Jolly. About twice the length of this hall.</p>

At length there was some suspicion of her dishonestly, and she was ordered to quite the room. She sent for a cart soon after, and had several things put up that did not belong to her; which was stopt just as they were going to drive away.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Gumbley. Since I discharged my servant, I gave her leave to reside at a house I had repairing in St. James's square, and to come to-and-fro for her victuals. I afterwards did not approve of her conduct; I had some suspicion of her dishonestly, and I ordered her to quit the room, and take away her things. Next day a person came to acquaint me, that there was a cart at the back door taking away a great many things. Accordingly I went, and found the cart just going off. I said to the carman, where are you going? He said, where he was ordered. I said you must unload the things; and the man said he would not. I went into the house, and met the maid with a bundle, and I said you are a base huffey. I then had the cart unloaded, and part of the things in the cart was a chest of drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the things removed out of the cart into the house again?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gumley. Yes, and had the drawers carried up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at that time charge the prisoner with theft?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gumley. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When the things were removed into the house, did you see the chest of drawers opened?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gumley. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find in them?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gumley. There were several things; the first was a Holland shirt, which I lost last summer - several pieces of lace, lost at different times - one piece about four yards of Holland - a piece of muslin - about seven yards of green silk damask were afterwards found by her confession where she had sold it. [ These things were produced in court, and swore to]</p>
               <p>Q. Was she searched in your presence?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gumley. No, I pushed her out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. When she was taken up, and had before the justice, what did she say?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gumley. She owned she had robbed me of them. The piece of damask, she said she had sold to a woman in Carnaby-market. The Justice sent for them; but the woman happened to be abroad at that time, and it was afterwards brought to me.</p>
               <p>Wilson.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when the prisoner at the bar was examined?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Yes, and she acknowledged the taking those, and several other things. She owned some things were at her lodgings in St. Giles's, and gave me a direction to look behind the bed for some, by the side of the bed for others, and under the bolster for the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find those things you have there tied up?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Yes; a piece of silk for lining of a petticoat, a piece of green silk damask, some red silk, some pink sattin, some towels and dusters, one apron, one handkerchief, one shirt, and some yards of linen and holland.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the things all found there?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Yes. or were found by her direction.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Gumley. Are these things all yours?</p>

               <p>The things that I went to move out of the house Mrs. Gumley had given me, and she told me several times, that, when I went away, I should get a cart and take them away at once.</p>

            . I lost a harrow and some iron tynes. I had set the harrow up against the stable wall, and I never saw the harrow any more till I saw it in a field near two miles from my house, and the tynes were found at Teddington.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to suspect the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Leyton. I had some reason for it; and upon that I got a search-warrant to search his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing there?</p>

               <p>Leyton. Nothing at all, my Lord. Soon after I had word brought me, that they were sold at Teddington to Mr. Fry, the blacksmith. I went over the next day, and asked him, if he had bought any harrow tynes, and would let me see them. He shewed me them, and there was one that I knew by a particular mark. [He produced it, and swore to it.] He said he bought them of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you then?</p>
               <p>Leyton. I got a warrant to take him up; but he was in custody before for some assault.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the prisoner's counsel.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at the first search of the prisoner's house, when there was a distress made for 9 s.</p>
               <p>Leyton. No, it was afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he was in custody for an assault?</p>
               <p>Leyton. The constable told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time of searching this man's house, was there not a great deal of money found there?</p>
               <p>Leyton. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the keys of the prisoner's doors when he was taken from home?</p>
               <p>Leyton. I think I have heard the constable had them.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, at whose expence is this prosecution?</p>
               <p>Leyton. At my own.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you declared, that the expence of this prosecution was to be defrayed out of the money found at the prisoner's? Pray recollect.</p>
               <p>Leyton. I believe I have been told so; but I never proceeded upon that footing.</p>

               <p>Q. to Fry. What is the value of that tyne?</p>
               <p>Fry. About a peny.</p>
               <p>Q. to Leyton. Had you any money of the prisoner's in your hands at any time?</p>
               <p>Leyton. I never had.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to think of getting a search-warrant for the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Leyton. Because I had always a mistrust of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner called upon to ask the witnesses any questions.</p>
               <p>He said one Clements owed him 16 s. and he let him have that old iron; which he told Mrs. Fry when he sold it.</p>
               <p>Saxton.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the prisoner ever used to lend money?</p>
               <p>Saxton. He has lent me 20 s. which I paid him honestly again; and he lent my wife 20 s. upon a gold ring.</p>

He said that the prisoner's goods were then distrained, and all in confusion, and advised me to go to his house. When I went, the goods were brought out to be view'd, and I found the saw and the rasp there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever charge the prisoner with having stole them?</p>
               <p>Hoole. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say you had lost them in the hearing of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Hoole. Not as I know of.</p>

               <p>Hoole. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after the prisoner was taken up that the goods were taken out of the house?</p>
               <p>Hoole. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Can't you tell me whether it was the same day, or whether it was a week after?</p>
               <p>Hoole. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what part of the house the things you owned were brought out of?</p>
               <p>Hoole. There was but one room in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought out the things?</p>
               <p>Hoole. Saxon helped to bring them out.</p>
               <p>Q. Who desired you to prosecute this man? did not the parish officers? Recollect.</p>
               <p>Hoole. Not as I know of.</p>

               <p>Noell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the man first taken into custody?</p>
               <p>Noell. I think Sunday the 24th.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take an inventory?</p>
               <p>Noell. The Tuesday after.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that saw; did you see that in his house?</p>
               <p>Noell. It lay up between the joists.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that saw taken out of the house with other things?</p>
               <p>Noell. Yes, my Lord.</p>

               <p>Noell. The prosecutor immediately owned both the saw and the rasp.</p>

            , chamberlain. Last Saturday was three weeks a quilt was stole off the bed, and a week ago a sheet was likewise stole out of it; and last night I went into the room, thinking I heard somebody, and I saw a bundle, and there was a quilt and a pillow case taken and tied up. I went to call somebody. In the mean time the prisoner went downstairs, and I called to somebody in the yard to stop her; she was had back to the room, and a woman happened to be in the yard, saw something hanging down like a sheet, a little below her clothes. So she took hold of it, and said, Here are the sheets wrapped round her, and they were my master's.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that they were your master's sheets?</p>
               <p>Turrell. By a mark of coloured thread, by which they are well known to me. Then we sent for a constable, who took her before my lord mayor, and she was committed.</p>

               <p>I have lodged there several times, and never wronged them of any thing in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any witnesses to call?</p>
