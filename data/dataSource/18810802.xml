               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The depositions were read as follows</hi>:—William Nash. "I live at 48, Golborne Boad, Kensington; I did live on the 15th May at 422, Portobello Board. I am a dairyman. I was out on Sunday evening, the night of the fire, my wife with me. We came in at a little after 11 o'clock, not as late as half-past; we were both in bed by half-past 11. I did not hear anybody go out after that. I went to sleep; my wife woke me; she pulled me, and said 'For God's sake, what's this?' The room was full of smoke and illuminated up. We got out of bed, and my wife ran up the stairs. I believe I got out of bed, and took what clothes were on the chair and my wife's dress off the bedstead. I pulled my trousers and drawers on in the passage, and I believe I gave my wife her dress somewhere, she says in the passage. I went for the escape after that. I do not know where the fire was; I did not go to see where the fire was; I saw no flames. I do not believe the fire was in the bedroom. I took my clothes and went out. I went out by the door in the Warrington Board. I do not know if the fire was in the shop; I did not go to see, I had no time. I took nothing but my clothes and my wife's dress. I went for the fire-escape, and some<lb/>body had been there, and it was pulling off the path in Ladbroke Grove Road. I went round by Sutton's, the pawnbroker's. I believe the Portobello Board door was that which I left at. I do not know if my wife had gone out there or not; I think I left her there, she had only a dress. Mr. Keen was standing on the stairs when I came out of the parlour. I did not hear my wife at the top of the house; I could not say if I heard her knocking at the doors at the top of the house, and I did not see Mrs. Keen until I came back with the escape. Mr. Keen broke open the door leading to the shop; he was on the stairs in his trousers. In that time I had got my clothes off the chair, that's all. There were no combustibles in the shop. The passage was boarded off from the shop up to about 8 feet high, and open above that. The illumination came from the Portobello side. The stock-in-trade and everything was insured for 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. There is no fireplace in the shop, it is all bricked up. The latest time I saw a fire in the parlour was between 3 and 4 in the after<lb/>noon—the latest time I was in the shop on Sunday was at about half-past four. I did not look into the shop when my wife awoke me. The glass was cracking in the door, and the smoke pouring through. My wife did not have her boots in her hand when she went up stairs. Keen was on the stairs. I did not say 'Save yourselves, or you will all be burnt'. He did not say 'You have on the same clothes that you wore</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188108020012"/>
               <p>yesterday.' I put on my boots in the passage. I left the house in a low-crowned hat. I had on the same shirt I have on now, not a night shirt. I had my waistcoat and a "brown Cardigan jacket under my arm as I went for the escape, and I put them on as I came back with it. I had not those things on when I left the house. I did not wear an overcoat on Sunday at all. I have no idea what caused the fire in the front shop. I did not take any furniture to Portobello Road from Golborne Road. The articles I had in Portobello Road were a table and an iron bedstead, a mattress or flock bed; I had them from Keen for a cow and calf and some cash. I have not had all the money yet, there is some 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. owing; he has paid me, I think, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I value the lot of bed and mattress and table at about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think I sold the lot I bought of Collins. I had five chairs, three cane-bottomed and a horse<lb/>hair arm-chair. I brought part from Golborne Road where all was not sold. I had one or two ornaments and some photographs and a fender worth some 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. then; I had my clothes and my wife's clothes. I do not know in what amount the furniture was insured. The policy we have not got; it was burnt, I suppose; it was in the house. I had not paid any rent for six weeks, and I had borrowed 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from a loan office about five weeks ago. The landlord asked me to sell some furniture for him, and I bought some myself for about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., of which I sold a music-stool for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I had in the shop also scales, show tubs, milk<lb/>perambulator, and other things, which I value at 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; there was one pair of scales also that was not mine. There was a door from the passage into the shop; no one could get into the shop except through the parlour door if that into the passage was fastened, unless they got over the partition. I have made a claim on the Yorkshire Fire Insurance Company for 79<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. My wife did not say anything when she came down stairs, except that the doors were locked; I do not know if they were in the upstairs rooms. My wife said Mrs. Bond spoke to her. I do not think I told the escape man that there were people in the house. (Signed) William Nash."</p>
               <p>"Ann Maria Nash. I live at 48, Golborne Road, Kensington; I did live on 15th May at 422, Portobello Road. I am wife of William Nash, he is a dairyman. We were both at home all day on the 15th, except when my husband went out with his milk. We went out in the evening at 6 or 7 o'clock for a walk round the houses about there. We came in at 11 or a few minutes after; we went straight to bed then; my husband went to bed at the same time, he did not go into the shop before he went to bed. I went to sleep; I was awoke by a suffocating feeling. My husband was not awake then, I awoke him; I did not hear the fire at that time, but the room seemed full of smoke and light. I got out of bed, as did my husband; I do not know what he did, for I went up stairs to wake them at the top of the house and the Keens. I did so; I awoke the Keens first, I did not see them come out of their room. I went up to the top of the house, and I knocked at the door until I was answered by Mrs. Bond; neither of the others spoke to me—not Clark nor Church. The suffocating feeling was not at the top of the house when I went up, it was when I turned to come down stairs. Neither of them on the top floor came out to me. Mrs. Bond said 'What is the matter, Mrs. Nash?' I said 'The house is on fire; 'I never heard her answer me. I believe the Keen' door was open as I was going down;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188108020013"/>
               <p>I did not hear or see anything of Mr. or Mrs. Keen as I was going downstairs. When I went down I found my husband in the passage near the door leading to Portobello Road. I did not see Mr. Keen then; the first time I saw him was at the fire-escape. There is a glass door between the shop and the parlour. The light seemed everywhere when I woke. I do not know where the fire was, in the front of the house I suppose; I could not say if it was inside or outside the house, it was all illuminated everywhere. When I found my husband by the door leading to Portobeilo Road he gave me my dress, and he seemed to be arranging his own dress. I went out, and I knocked at next door. I have no re<lb/>collection whether my husband came out with me or before me. By the time I came out the fire had got much ahead; I do not know if it was in the shop then, it seemed everywhere. I then turned and met the escape, and said there were people up stairs. The engine did not come for some time. There was a fireplace in the front kitchen in the base<lb/>ment, but it was never used. I went out at the hall door; that door was not shut. I had my nightdress on when I went up to call them, and when I came out of the house I had only my dress and nightdress on. The landlord retains the front kitchen as a lumber room, and that is kept locked. I cannot say if the front room was on fire in more places than one, it seemed all illuminated. I did not take my boots up in my hand, nor give them to Keen. My husband was undressed in bed, except his night-dress; if he said he had slept in his boots and clothes it would not be true. After the fire he went to his cousin, who lent him a coat; he did not take away an overcoat from the fire; I cannot say if he was wearing a hat when I saw him with the fire-escape. Before the fire he had a brown cardigan jacket, and he has that now. He always made a practice of putting all his clothes together on a chair, but not his great<lb/>coat. I cannot recollect whether he had on the cardigan jacket when I saw him with the fire-escape; he had nothing round his neck, no scarf or tie. He had insured the property directly he went there; I believe the furniture in the parlour was insured for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it was worth more than that. I cannot say what was the value of the property in the shop; some of it was furniture, some of it belonged to Darvill; there were two beds, two tables, a washstand, and a lamp, worth, perhaps, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

               <p>the ground-floor—there is a shop and a back parlour opening into the Portobello Road by a door in the middle of the shop, and over that door is a fanlight; it is a double-fronted shop—there is a private door at the side of the house, which opens into a passage—there is a thin partition, which does not reach to the ceiling, dividing the passage from the shop—there is a door, the upper part of which is glass, communicating between the shop and the parlour at the back, and another door at the back of the parlour, communicating with the passage, and there is glass also at the upper part of that; a person looking through that door can see into the parlour and shop—the prisoners occupied the front parlour and shop at a rent of 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week unfurnished—I retained the front kitchen myself as a store-room for furniture; I kept it locked; I did not live on the premises—the prisoners came into occupation on 15th Feb<lb/>ruary—they had no kitchen—there were fixtures in the shop, which belonged to me, counters, scales, &amp;c.; I left them there with the con<lb/>agreed sideration that if he succeeded he would purchase them; no value was upon; their value was about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he opened the shop as a greengrocer's—he did not pay his rent, there were seven weeks owing when the fire occurred; I had pressed him for that often, I had been in two or three times a day sometimes—I wanted the shop—he owed me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for gas up to March; 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been consumed altogether, and he was responsible for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; up to the date of the fire his portion would come to about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had asked him several times about the gas bill due to March—he failed as a greengrocer, and abandoned that trade, but the shop was not entirely unused, he kept a few things there—I asked him a few days before the fire to give up the shop and occupy the parlour, I had a quantity of furniture which I wanted to expose for sale, and he offered me half the shop for my purpose, and said his wife would superintend it for me—at the time I put my furniture there I don't think there was anything in the front shop belonging to the prisoner—he afterwards purchased some furniture and placed it in the shop with mine for the purpose of selling; it was placed there after I had arranged for half the shop—I saw some furniture there which did not belong to me, and he told me he had purchased a portion of some furniture that had been left in a room for 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—I recollect the fire; after it I went to the infirmary at Kensington Workhouse, where I saw two dead bodies amongst others, there were six altogether; one corresponded in size and sex with the appearance of Harry Church, and the other with that of Louisa Church.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Nash was first a greengrocer, and after trying that for some time he was unsuccessful, and became a furniture dealer, but he did not give it up altogether, so there was a little greengrocery there at the end of the time—there are not gas pipes in every room of the house; there were two burners in the shop and two in the parlour—the meter was kept in the back kitchen downstairs in the basement—there was no gas on the first floor; there was no gas on the second floor—there were two gas-burners in the back shop—the gas bills are sent to me as the landlord; I called upon Nash for his share—the whole house tumbled in, it was gutted by the fire—I have since had men there clearing away and rebuilding; among them there has been a German named Flamme about the premises 14 or 15 days; he has made no statement to me about the state of the chimney; last evening I heard something about</p>

               <p>the chimney from the next house being out of repair since the fire—there were 17 inches of bricks placed by me in the fireplace before the fire; they are there now, except a portion at the top which has been removed, and since then smoke has come down from one chimney to the other when the wind is in a certain quarter—smoke, or sparks could not get into the shop from the neighbouring house, the 17 inches of brick<lb/>work would prevent that—I heard yesterday afternoon from Flamme that there was a sort of aperture, by means of which smoke might come from one house to the other—there were 11 men there last week, yesterday there were only two—I did not make inquiries of the men some time ago—these were new houses, three years old—since the fire the gas pipes have been recovered and examined; I have seen nothing of a fracture myself; they are being relaid; they tumbled down when the woodwork was burnt away; the lead pipes were melted away, and the meter was destroyed—I have had no experience of gas igniting; I know if gas escapes it will ignite, and it will escape wherever there is the least opening for it—the Salvation Army burnt the gas there six months previously—I have no recollection of any case where gas has taken fire except by lighting; I do not think the slightest spark coming from the fire would ignite the gas—an explosion would accompany the ignition, and it would spread quickly if there was much gas about—I cannot account for this new house being so quickly burnt; I can attribute it to other causes than the escape of gas—I had not been down to the bottom of the house for a week or ten days before this; I know pretty well the state it was in; I found it after the fire in the same as it was before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Seven or eight day's before I had been in the kitchen under the shop, that was all safe, and it was undisturbed after the fire—I had glass doors in. there, and have got them out since, unbroken—there was no fire kindled there—the gas-meter was in the scullery of the base<lb/>ment in Warrington Road; it was left for use, turned full on—there was an understanding with the people in the house to use the gas—before the prisoner came to occupy the shop it had been let to a previous tenant up to three weeks or a month before—I was in the shop with the carpenter fitting it up before the prisoner came in; it had been a public room for two years—there was a fireplace in the wall adjoining the next house quite bricked up, full of bricks right up, 17 inches in thickness—it is not possible, in my judgment, that any spark could have come from the adjoining house during the time the prisoner was there, from 15th February to 5th May, the prisoner never complained that anything was wrong with the shop—since the rebuilding I did myself observe once a small smouldering smoke come down the chimney, after I had taken out two rows of those bricks placed in the fireplace; that was when a draught was made, before that no smoke could have come through—it came from the other house—when it was bricked up there was no aperture for the smoke to come through—my own house had then no fire in it, and it would be colder than the other house—there was no grate, but where the grate ought to have been was bricked up—there was not a space left at the top; there might be room enough to get a thin knife up—the house adjoining is a beerhouse with an "off" licence.</p>

I am a milkman—on 16th May I lived at 422, Porto<lb/>bello Road—I occupied the whole of the first floor, the shop at the back, and the back kitchen—on the Sunday evening preceding the fire I saw Nash, about 6.30, in his own shop; he appeared to be pulling and shifting the things about from one part of the shop to the other—I and my wife went to bed at half-past 9—I was aroused about a quarter to 10 by Mrs. Bond to serve a person with milk—I then slept till some<lb/>thing past 12—I was then aroused by Mrs. Nash (Wright) knocking loudly at the door, and saying, "Jim! Jim! get up, the place is in flames"—I and my wife and child got up and escaped on to the landing through the staircase door—we did not wait to dress—they were assisted down into the street—I went back and down the staircase into my shop—I made an attempt to go back into my room on the first floor, but could not succeed because of the smoke and flames coming through the door into my bedroom—after Wright had aroused me I heard her upstairs knocking at the door on the top floor, and calling to them to get up; that was before we got out on the leads—Wright passed me on the staircase as I went down—I said to her "Have you roused the people at the top of the house?" she said "Yes, and they will be down in a minute"—she had on her dress, no bonnet—her dress was not fastened in front, and I could see a white substance under it—she was barefooted, and she handed me a pair of boots as she passed—she made no remark—I saw her leave the house; she went through the passage and closed the door after her leading into Portobello Road—at that time I had looked at the front shop—as Wright passed me I glanced my eyes into the shop through the half glass door in the passage and saw two flames, one in the right hand corner, and one on the left—the right hand corner was at the farther end</p>

               <p>speaking to Nash; he was in the passage leading into Portobello Road—there was a good deal of smoke there, and flames too, and on the stairs—I saw how he was dressed from the reflection of the flames in the shop—there was no partition in the passage—I was able to see what dress he had on—to the best of my recollection he had on the same clothes that he had at 5 or 6 in the morning—I did not advise him to insure—I am sure of that—I did not go for the fire escape because I was told that someone else had gone for it—I don't know who told me; it was someone in the street—there was a crowd collected about the house—Nash had not got on the overcoat when I saw him in the passage—I don't know whether the officer from the insurance office came to solicit him; he asked me—Nash did not ask my opinion about it before he insured; I swear that—it was several weeks after he had insured that he said "Would not this place burn well?"—no one was present at the time—he said "I have got a largo fire and the gas on; would not this place burn well, it being all match board?"—he had a large fire in the room, in the grate, and the gas was burning in the room—I have not stated this conversation before; I have not been asked—the first thing he said when I went in was "Is not this room hot to-night? I have got a large fire and the gas well on; this place would burn well"—my statement before the Magistrate was read over to me—I believe I said then "He called me into his back parlour and said 'Would not this place burn well, being all wood?'"—I don't know whether I said anything about the gas being well on; I did not think of it—I never told anybody that I had recovered my money and my watch—I never said so to a person named Parsons—I never complained of the gas, or said that I could not sleep in consequence—he had the gas burning in the parlour when he called me in—I don't know whether it was lighted in the shop, I did not notice; it was past 8 in the evening, I believe—I don't know whether the shop was shut—the shop and parlour joined; I believe there was a glass door between them—I did not see whether the shop was lighted or not, I had my own shop to look after—I just opened the door and looked in as I passed—I don't know whether I mentioned to anybody about the gas being well on—I believe I men<lb/>tioned it before the Coroner, not before—I don't think I mentioned it before the Magistrate—I did not think then that he was going to set fire to the house; I regarded it as a light passing observation, a joke, that was all—it was not many minutes after Wright had aroused me that I saw the fire in the two corners—the police assisted in getting my wife down—the shop was full of flame at the time; the two fires formed an archway—I could see through the glass door in the passage—I was on the staircase—there was a door leading from the shop to the passage—I believe there is a door from the shop to the parlour—that was not the door I was looking through; it was the passage door—there are twelve or thirteen stairs—the staircase is halfway along the passage, and I had to turn sharp round to the right to my shop—the staircase runs as far as the door leading from the passage into the shop—I can't say on which stair I was standing, I might be two or three steps up, I don't know—the door was on my left hand, and it was through that door I saw the two fires—I did not mention this to any<lb/>body till I was before the Magistrate—I did not discuss it with anybody—I know a Mr. Harris—I don't know what he is—I did not hear him</p>

               <p>between 300 and 400 yards from the house—I went quickly towards the fire, and seeing some people moving about in front of the fire I ran to the fire-escape, arriving there just half a second after Mr. Harris—I and Mr. Harris and Meredith and the fireman assisted with the escape—on the way Mr. Harris, having no shoes or stockings on, complained of the stones hurting his feet, and he fell out, and a man in the uniform of a railway-guard or signalman assisted us with the escape up to the house—I found it all in flames—the flames were up to the second-floor windows—I have known Nash 13 years—I saw nothing of him at all before getting to the house; he was not in any way near the fire-escape—I remained there till the fire was put out—I can't exactly say the time it was got under—I remained there till past 6 o'clock in the morning—I did not see the bodies recovered, but I saw them going away in the shells between 2 and 3 o'clock—after they had been removed I saw Nash—he came round the corner in the direction of Mr. Sutton's, the pawnbroker's, and went to Mr. Barlow's back door—he was wearing a brown Chester<lb/>field overcoat, buttoned up to the top, a billycock hat, trousers, and boots; he was fully dressed.</p>

I am a fireman at the Ladbroke Grove Station—on Monday morning, 16th May, I received a call at 12.44 a.m.—I went with a manual engine to 422, Portobello Road—I arrived there about 12.50—the house was then burnt right out, the floor and roof had fallen, when the fire was extinguished we searched for the bodies, and found three on the ground floor and three in the front basement—they were afterwards taken to the Kensington mortuary—I examined the ruins—the basement under the ruins was not burnt at all—there had been no fire down there whatever; only the ruins fallen in from the floor above—there was a lot of second-hand furniture there; there was a cup<lb/>board there, but not even a panel was scorched—I afterwards examined the shop—I saw the place where the front shop joined the next house, where the fireplace had been; it was blocked up with bricks only, no mortar, to a thickness of about 16 inches—the bricks were as close together as you could stack them—no fire could come through there at all—the flue of the chimney joins the flue of the adjoining house—last night, in con<lb/>sequence of what I heard, I examined that fireplace again—I noticed</p>

               <p>that some of the bricks had been removed, and a piece of quartering run through into the flue adjoining—it was my impression that that hole had been recently made, by the appearance of it—I thoroughly examined it and found that the mortar was quite fresh—the hole appeared to have been quite freshly made—there was not the slightest sign of smoke or fire—I examined the chimney belonging to the shop—there was no sign of smoke or soot adhering to it; the mortar was quite new, fresh, and clean—soon after the fire was extinguished I noticed the gas meter in the basement; it was disconnected from the supply pipe, and the gas was turned full on—one of my men turned it off—no doubt the action of the fire had caused the pipe to be disconnected from the meter—I did not know Nash before this night—I saw him in the middle of the road near the fire between 2 and 3 o'clock—he seemed to be completely dressed then—he had on a brown coat, and some sort of a plaid sear round his neck; he had a hat on and boots, and appeared to be fully dressed.</p>

I manage the business of a bill discounter at 82, Le<lb/>man Street, Whitechapel—in February the prisoner applied to me for a loan of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon the security of house furniture and a sole-sewing machine for boots—I asked him if the property was paid for—he said "Yes"—as there was not much furniture in the place I asked him if the machine was paid for, as that seemed to be the principal security—he said "Yes," and he would produce the receipt for it; he afterwards produced this receipt at the office: "September 14, 1880. Received of Mr. E. Walters the sum of 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the Black and Goodear Boot and Shoe Machine Company, Limited. H. Pocock"—I advanced him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes</p>

On 10th July I went to 12, Upper Woburn Place, in consequence of an anonymous letter which had been received by the Commissioners of Police; it contained another letter—I saw the prisoner there and showed him the letters, he looked at them—I did not read the anonymous letter to him, but I did the other—I allowed him to read what he liked—these are the letters. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "7th July, 1881. Dear Sir,—I think it only just to bring under your notice the following. There is a young gentleman named Patrick T. Hickie, stopping at No. 12, Upper Woburn Place, W.C., just come from Ireland. I happened to be in a public-house at Brixton a day or two ago; he and two others of the same appearance, also I think, they are Irish too by their accent. They were in a private compartment. I heard Hickie say to one of his companions, 'You, John, must come with me on the night I am to Bhoot that bloody tyrant Buckshot Forster.' They were whispering. He also said, 'Make the cartridges yourself, John, and load your six-chamber; you know we may have to use all chambers to escape; mine is only a four-chamber; it will be good enough for Forster; when it was for Boyd he swore it was a gun I had; it was a revolver. Did not we escape well? Poor Phelans suffered.' At this they all shook hands, and said, '<hi rend="italic">God save Ireland.'</hi> They were half gone with liquor. I found the enclosed, which they dropped in the shop when leaving. Yesterday evening I saw Hickie in Euston Road, and I followed him the address I give you, and found out his name to be the same as is to the letter he dropped. I was not going to take any notice of it until I told my brother, who requested me to inform the police. I am sure he is a Land Leaguer from Dublin. You ought to watch him. He is tall, wears a soft American hat, long overcoat, with velvet cuffs and collar, and dark pants. You will see by the letter that he is to do</p>

"12, Upper Woburn Place, opposite St. Pancras, 3rd July, 1881. Dear Malachi,—I will be pre<lb/>pared on Sunday next. I will watch him when coming from his prayers; if I do not get a chance then I will watch him on Monday night. John is to accompany me. We must kill him out at any rate, there is no use in doing it and not killing him then and there. I wrote to Paris and Dublin to-day. Now is our time. Forster is to live or I to die. God save Ireland. Your affectionate brother, <hi rend="smallCaps">PATRICK T. HICKIE</hi>. P.S.—John is to make the cartridges. 'I have the R. that shot old Bloody Bones, you know who I mean.

Very important." <hi rend="italic">Post-mark</hi>, "July 8, 1881."—I was accompanied by another officer—I told the prisoner we were police officers, and asked him what he meant by writing such letters—he said, "Why would I write those letters?"—I took from a table close by a document on which was some writing, and said, "Who wrote that?"—he looked closely at it and said, "I did"—I said, "It is very evident whoever wrote that wrote these letters"—I pointed to some writing paper in a small pad, and said, "Here is some similar paper to that on which the letters are written"—he said, "Yes; it is"—he said that he had been in communication with the police, and showed me some printed forms to be filled up by candidates for the police—I said, "I see that you have been applying to join the police"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "In the name of O'Connor, a false name"—he said that he did not think there was any harm in that, and showed me this draft letter, which he said he was just about to forward to the Commissioners of Police. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he was fairly educated, and was the son of a solicitor in Dublin, and referring to his uncle, John Hickie, of</hi> 127, <hi rend="italic">Leadenhall Street, and return<lb/>ing the forms filled up.

O'Connor.</hi>) I asked him if that was his writing—he said, "Yes"—I compared it with the letter of 7th July, and pointed out to him the similarity of the writing; it was undoubtedly the same, but he still said that he did not write it—I said that it was perfectly clear that he had written the letters, and he had better not do so again, or he would get himself into serious trouble—I afterwards received from Superintendent Williamson the letter of 14th July, the subject of this indictment; I have compared it with the admitted writing of the prisoner of July 3rd and 7th, and in my opinion they are in the same writing, the characteristics are so marked—I received instructions on 18th July to arrest the prisoner, and did so on the 19th in the Old Kent Road—I was watching, and saw him come from Silvan Grove—I told him I was about to take him in custody for maliciously writing and forwarding a letter to Mr. Forster threatening to kill him—he said, "Do you mean the letter you showed me the other night?"—I said, "Not only that but another, which I will show you at the proper place"—I took him to King Street, Westminster, and showed him this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was headed</hi>"Death," <hi rend="italic">with a drawing of a pistol, a skull and bones, and a tombstone inscribed, "In memory of Buckshot Foster, M.P. R.I.P."</hi>"London, 14th July, 1881. Sir,—I deem it proper to give you a chance of saving your life. The only chance you have is to release the prisoners whom have been arrested under your infernal Coercion Act, and resign the office you hold as Chief Secretary for Ireland forthwith.</p>

               <p>You know well the base way you have acted towards Ireland and her people, for which you long ago earned the bullet which you will get if you do not take this opportunity. I will, if you are man enough, meet you in the field, and then let the case be decided "you or I." I request an answer on or before Saturday next, to be sent to the following address, to say whether you will meet me or resign the post of Chief Secretary for Ireland, or else die like a dog. I request that you will keep this letter private and confidential, and make it known to no one except your seconds. God save Ireland. P. and H. Address, Post-office, Old Kent Road, for William Patrick O'Connor. The Eight Hon. W. E. Forster, M.P., 80, Eccleston Square." He said, "Who said I wrote that letter?"—I said, "You will be charged with it"—he said, "I can prove I did not write it; it is not my writing"—I found these two scraps of paper on him, they appear to be in the same writing as the other documents.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first went to see the prisoner on Saturday night; I think it was the 10th—I did not go to arrest him, but to caution him against writing these threatening letters—I had no authority to arrest him—I have cautioned people before—I thought him intelligent and smart, just fit for the police, but I did not go on that account—I had not received letters in which he introduced the names of his friends, nor did I go to them and say "Send this flighty young <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> out of the country"—I was not acting on my own responsibility—since he has been in custody I have seen his father in Dublin, who told me that he had destroyed some briefs and legal documents which were entrusted to him, and had taken the safe out of the wall and sold it, and he thought none but a road man would do such a thing, and that he came home drunk and went down on his knees and prayed for his departed mother, and then jumped up and threatened to assassinate his father—what his father chiefly told me was that he was a disreputable scoundrel, who could not by any means speak the truth, that his mother was subject to fits, and he thought there was a little of his mother's blood in him—I told all that to the proper authorities—the prisoner answered all my questions fairly—I took no papers but what he gave me voluntarily, the draft letter to the Commissioners of Police, and a letter to his sister, I think, in which he begs her not to disclose his whereabouts or he will be ruined—I also brought away a photograph of Robert Emmett—I was present when he went to the Commissioners' office after my visit, and I thought whether he wanted to be arrested or not he very soon would be—he then asked me for a number of letters which I had taken away, and I referred him to the chief office—I searched the prisoner's room at his own request—I asked him if he had got a revolver; he said "No, you can search me, and search my place and my luggage," and I searched and there was no revolver.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the senior partner in the firm of William and Charles Volckman, who carry on business at High Street, Stratford, as wholesale provision manufacturers—the prisoner entered our employ<lb/>ment about the end of 1879—we have several town travellers—I had several interviews with him—I engaged him to travel for us in a par<lb/>ticular district to be assigned to him by the firm, in London—he was to give up his whole-time, and to be paid a commission, which started at two per cent, upon moneys received—he drew a weekly sum at first of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but latterly of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—his duty was to account daily for all sums received, and to pay in daily all large sums, and smaller sums as frequently as possible, but latterly there was a hard and fast rule made that all sums should be cleared on the Friday evening—I instructed him myself that he was to make an absolute clearance of all moneys on Friday evening, in addition to reporting daily such sums—those were my general instructions, in order to facilitate the cashier paying into the bank all moneys of the week on the Saturday morning—that rule was brought into operation in November or December last year—when he entered our service he had been engaged by some house in the country, with whom there were a few outstanding accounts, and I gave him permission to settle those as soon as he could—in consequence of certain information I received I examined our books—the 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from Mr. Assendon is not entered, nor the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mr. Eltham, of Dalston—I had had occasion to speak to the prisoner several times in reference to a very considerable overdraft on his com<lb/>mission—on the 11th June I brought to his notice Mr. Eltham's and Mr. Assendon's accounts as not having been advised or paid in by him—in consequence of what passed I declined that he should further represent the firm—the two Raines were present at a portion of that interview—I received this letter on the 14th June. (<hi rend="italic">From the prisoner, dated</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th June</hi>, 1880, <hi rend="italic">enclosing statement of sums received, and asking for cash account to be made up and receipt forwarded</hi>)—the total is 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not received a penny of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The interview on the 11th June took place in my private office—I showed him the account—he did not say he had not received those sums, but he offered to pay them—I had suspended his right to draw 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week by arrangement with him; that was suspended for about three weeks—he said something to the effect that if I would pay his commission ho would pay these accounts—I refused to pay him his commission on that occasion—I am not positive, but I believe one of the Raines was present at the interview—I believed the prisoner had a guarantee from the Guarantee Society—I said it would be a question for his guarantors—only Eltham and Assendon's accounts were mentioned at that interview—I did not then know of Mr. Fay's account—I there and then suspended him—his letter of the 11th was the first notice I had of Fay's account—seven sums are there mentioned—the last account rendered</p>

               <p>to the prisoner would be the April account, showing the large overdraft by him—it might be March—Mr. Coulson came to me about the over<lb/>draft—no guarantee was effected—I received the prisoner's letter of the 23rd June, asking for a statement of account and settlement—I gave no reply, under the advice of my solicitor—I had been in correspondence with the Guarantee Society through my solicitor and one of our employes—I took my solicitor's advice about the 13th June, and afterwards the matter passed over to the police by his advice—I had no direct correspondence with the Guarantee Society—I had about five other metropolitan travel<lb/>lers besides the prisoner and an assistant—there may have been a differ<lb/>ence in the rate of their commission—there have been modifications in the districts from time to time—the prisoner has been over the same ground the whole time—one of the modifications was Mr. Volckman had part of the prisoner's district—the prisoner succeeded our oldest traveller; the old traveller had a list of places—his district was north of the Thames, not the West End—the list would take a fortnight to go the round, or rather ten days, every day except Saturday and Sunday—he might do one day's work on another day, but it would be irregular and against instructions—sometimes a disorder of that sort occurs—this is the prisoner's book, with the names and addresses of the persons arranged in a particular order, according to the days of calling—the customers would write and complain if the traveller did not call on his right day—the practice of calling in that order was followed for the convenience of the customer, and specially for the convenience of the firm in its cartage and deliveries—two or three days elapsed between the order and delivery, not more—we had a traveller named Walters—we have one named Betteridge—I saw this little book of the prisoner's yesterday for the first time—it is not the firm's book, but his private book—I have not found in it any entry of Eltham's or the other account—I impressed upon the prisoner that he must give the whole of his time to the firm, or he could not do our work—he was at our beck and call whenever we chose to summon him—occasionally travellers paid in on the Saturday—that was a depar<lb/>ture from the rule of the house—I do not recollect whether I wrote to Mr. Eltham—I found out about his account some few days before the 11th June—I think Mr. Eltham sent me his receipt—that is my letter of the 18th May, acknowledging the receipt given by our traveller for the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I spoke to the prisoner about it—he did not deny it when I showed him the receipt, of course—I do not recollect his saying "If you pay up my commission I will pay up that sum," nor what he said, but he did not say that—he said something about an oversight—the com<lb/>mission included expenses—travellers would be allowed to draw more than their usual sum if their commission account showed they were entitled to it, but I should call for a report before I paid anybody in advance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The engagement was verbal—our travellers give the whole of their time to us—the prisoner ought to have the old traveller's book—his overdraft was about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I refused to pay his commission because we should be putting ourselves in a false position—this letter of the 9th June, which was found on the prisoner, was my dictation. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that Mr. Assendon had written that his account was paid, and asking the prisoner when he collected it</hi>)—the prisoner drew over 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, but not by my consent—I first knew of it the week before I taxed him with it.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188108020041"/>
               <p>I am cashier to Messrs. Volckman—it was the duty of travellers to account to me for all moneys received—the prisoner's duty was to account for all sums he could every day, and others on every Friday night—I was present on the 11th June at the interview with Mr. Volckman and the prisoner—previously on the same day he had given me an advice of an amount received from Mr. Assendon—he asked me to tell Mr. Volckman the amount had been advised—this letter of 8th June was written to the prisoner—this is a press copy—the account should have been advised on March 11th—I said I would not tell Mr. Volckman the amount had been advised—at a second interview with the prisoner Mr. Volckman said "Why did not you pay in these amounts?" referring to Eltham's and Assendon's—the prisoner said "I should have paid them, but really for the last two or three weeks I scarcely know whether I have been standing on my head or my heels."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was at my desk when the prisoner spoke to me—my brother George would be at his desk; he would not hear what was said—very likely I said "Tell him yourself," or something to that effect—I believe he replied "Very well," "All right," or something of that kind—the prisoner did not say to Mr. Volckman "I will pay them when you make up the commission accounts"—he said he would pay them if his commission account was paid—Mr. Volckman said he should not touch it—I do not remember his saying "It will be a question for the Guarantee Society"—the last commission account was made up to June 11th—that was the account I made up against him—there has been no monthly settlement with the prisoner since the overdraft—the previous account was to May 31st—he was not-allowed to draw anything for three weeks—his district was a fairly large one, and his expenses would be considerable. I am a bookkeeper to the prosecutor—I am brother to the last witness and live with him—on the 11th June the prisoner told me he must leave—he first spoke to me about the amounts ho had not paid in—I was present at his interview with Mr. Volckman—the prisoner said he had been worried, and did not know whether he was standing on his head or his feet, and that he had lost his book—he mentioned that as his justification for not clearing his accounts—I said I could give him no advice in the matter—his commission account is in my writing—it goes down to 11th June, 1880—he owes to the firm 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I cannot explain how he overdrew to that amount—it was not done to my knowledge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> He was entitled to a commission on all moneys received from his district—he accepted my account so far as I know.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I could not say when the last account was rendered to the prisoner—my account is an extract from the ledger—I never acted as cashier—the prisoner saw the January and February accounts—he said some items were omitted; he said "I must live"—I understood him to mean he must have the means of living—I told you at Stratford there was so much said I could not remember half—I meant not that the prisoner was constantly bringing up these matters, but that there was so much from the beginning to the end of this business that I could not say what took place at a particular interview—he did not deny the amounts being paid by the customer—he knew that I knew that the sums were not handed over.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I do not think he mentioned the matter before the 11th June—he had drawn his commission up to three weeks before the 11th of June—I saw him several times on the 11th June before I went into Mr. Volckman's private office; then the amounts were mentioned to him—he had not previously mentioned them to me—I wrote this letter to him on the 8th June. (<hi rend="italic">Asking the prisoner to hand over all moneys immediately on receiving them.</hi>) I am a customer of Mr. Volckman and live at Church Street, Stoke Newington—this is the prisoner's receipt for 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in his writing—I paid that to him on the 10th April—the receipt is on one of my bill-heads—the prisoner had not one. I paid 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to the prisoner on 15th March and received this receipt—I subsequently received a second account—I spoke to the prisoner about it—he said "It is a mistake in the books; it is all right; tear it up;" that was about the end of April; it was a monthly settlement.</p>

On Sunday, the 17th July, at 2.35 a.m., I was in Warrington Gardens, Notting Hill, when I heard a woman's voice calling "Murder" and "Police" at No. 40—I went towards the place and heard blows and thumps coming from that direction—I went into the house and up to the first floor, and opened the door, where I found the prisoner in the act of rising from the bed in his shirt, and trousers, but he had no boots on—blood was spattered over his arm and breast right down his trousers—I saw a woman in bed in her night<lb/>dress, ana the prisoner kissed her—he knelt down by the chair on the other side of the room, and mumbled something which I could not hear—when he got up I pointed to the woman, who was bleeding from the arm, and there was blood on the wall and on the floor—she was in<lb/>sensible—I laid to the prisoner "Who has done this?" he made no reply—I found this Russian club by the bedside, and on it I saw marks of blood and hair—the prisoner laid down several times on the floor—I said "I shall take you for violently assaulting your wife;" he said "All right"—he was perfectly sober as far as I could see.</p>

I live at No. 2, Warrington Mews, Notting Hill, and am a coachman—I am the son of the deceased—as far as I know she and the prisoner were married—I have frequently seen this Russian club—I last saw the deceased alive about 9.50 on Saturday—I know that the prisoner has been in a lunatic asylum, and on several occasions I persuaded my mother to leave him in consequence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Twice the prisoner tried to commit suicide within the last eighteen months—I frequently saw him at Davis's house—he was eccentric in his manner—I believe him to be a man of sound mind when the drink is out of him—the reason he was taken to a convalescent home, or lunatic asylum, was through drink—he has been ever since more or less of unsound mind—laziness and drink have been the cause of it—I know Mr. Dawe, the prisoner's father, who lived in Goldhawk Road, Shepherd's Bush—he was an eccentric man—I have heard Mr. Dawe speak of his uncle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The prisoner used to drink to excess sometimes—he has been living at the address where this occurred ever since he came from the Convalescent Home at Wands worth, a little over twelve months—during that period he has not been doing anything for his living that I know of; he might paint a few pictures to get a trifle—my mother sold them, and she used to bring them to me—about six months back I noticed that he was very strange in his manner when I went to see him; he seemed to sit in one place, and took no notice of me or my wife—he was sober.</p>

I am a surgeon, of 110, Goldhawk Road, Notting Hill—about 3.30 a.m. on 17th July I went to 40, Warrington Gardens—I went up to the first floor front room, where I found a woman lying on the bed covered with blood—there were two cuts on two fingers on the right hand; she had a compound fracture of the large bone of the arm, and there was a jagged contused wound about three inches long, through which the edge of the bone was peeping out—the head was very much injured—I made a post-mortem examination—she died about 7.15 on Monday morning—she had several contused lacerated wounds on the fore part of the head and face and behind the head—some of the bones of the face entering into the formation of the face also were smashed in—I should think there might have been at least six separate wounds—I saw no other instrument than this club which would inflict such injuries—it had hair and blood on it—the deceased was about 50—I saw the prisoner in the room, and made observation of him—he seemed to have a very restless eye, downcast I mean—he did not seem to be able to look you hard in the face—he is a man that I should not trust very far alone without keeping my eyes upon him—he appeared to be sober—he seemed very stolid—he was kneeling down over his wife when I first went in, and afterwards he put his head down on the table, and then he laid down on the floor—his shirt sleeves were turned up to the elbows at the time—the injuries to the arm were caused by its being raised, in self-defence in all probability.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I came to the conclusion that the woman had been attacked while she was asleep—I had never seen the prisoner before</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon of Newgate, in consequence of an intimation from the Solicitor of the Treasury I have paid particular attention to the behaviour of the prisoner and the state of his mind—I have seen him once every day, and lometimes oftener, since 25th July; he was then in a gloomy condition, and very taciturn—when spoken to he answered questions very slowly, with such a considerable pause that I asked him, in order to save time, to answer my questions quicker—it had no effect, however, upon him—I examined him from day to day, and found him in the same condition—I have had conversations with him about the deceased; he does not believe her dead, but that something is done to keep her away from here to give evidence against him—I am of opinion that he believes she is not dead—I think his non-belief arises from the state of his mind; that he has never realised that he inflicted the wounds that killed her—my conclusion is that he is of unsound mind, and has been so ever since I have had to do with him—it is quite impossible for me to say whether his weakness of mind has been of long standing or not—he has a mark on his neck from having attempted suicide—he told me he attempted suicide by cutting his throat—he also has scars on his chest from having burnt himself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a photographer, and am a brother of the prisoner—I have visited the prisoner since my return to the neighbourhood of London, a little over two years—he has during that time been twice in the Camberwell Lunatic Asylum, and once in Wandsworth—when I have seen him he has been sometimes silent, but sometimes cheerful—he seems very eccentric at times—there have been three of his relations similarly affected—I can speak of three attempts he has made to commit suicide—my sister was dreadfully frightened once when she found a letter in a box in the cupboard—she brought it to me, and said she was afraid he had gone and killed himself, but I traced him down the road, and found that at several shops he had bought laudanum—I found him in a bed, and I said "While mother is living don't do it"—I got him up, and walked him up and down the room for two hours—I think that was about 1856—he once attempted to stab himself with a small table knife under the breast, and they told me at home, another time, that he was in a fearful state upstairs, and they told me to go upstairs and attend to him—I found he had bought a bottle of rum, and had drunk it all, and had been taken in a fit, and some gentlemen brought him home—that was when we were living at Kensington—the paraffin oil I can only speak of from hearsay—I have never known him to raise his hand to a single member of his family, except on one occasion when he was under the influence of drink—he was very kind, and kind to animals—he has been so eccentric, that I should say it came to insanity.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and am one of the surgeons to the Surrey County Lunatic Asylum at Wandsworth—I remember the prisoner being admitted to the asylum on 24th December, 1879—he was under my professional attendance until 3rd April, 1880—he had some delusions; he believed he had been charged with two crimes—he had a mark on his throat and several scars on his chest from recent bums—he was quiet and reserved generally—he was most decidedly of unsound mind—he improved very rapidly under my treatment—he was discharged after having been out three weeks, to see how he did at home, and he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188108020053"/>
               <p>was considered quite well—I think it would be rather difficult for me to give an opinion as to whether he was responsible for his actions or not when he committed this crime—I have not seen him lately—the prominent symptoms soon passed off—in drinking oases, the drink being removed, the disease very soon passes into abeyance, but it would be very apt to return again under the same influence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I should say that drink was the exciting cause of the insanity, but from what I have heard to-day I should say there was a predisposing cause, that it was hereditary.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Canning Town, near Victoria Docks—on 7th July, about 4 p.m., I was in Fenchurch Street; I was surrounded by four men, one on one side, one on the other, one in front, and one behind—the prisoner took my watch; I had an umbrella and a parcel, and the prisoner got away—I saw him two yards off, and had a good look at him before he came up—I gave information to the police—I afterwards went to the Guildhall, and picked the prisoner out from about five others; I had not the least difficulty in doing so.</p>

I obtained the freight release from the shipbroker's and sent down to the docks and had the case ex<lb/>amined by the Customs officer, and the weight of the silver. As I did examine the case, I was justified in saying it was ready for delivery, as all it was necessary for me to do to complete the clearance was to go to the Docks again and pay the Customs duty, and the dock charges, and bring the case away. With respect to the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. such charges would not have been incurred had not the plaintiff prevented my removing the case from the docks; and with respect to the charge of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for entry, this charge is usually made by agents. I had no intention to defraud Miss Cave, as I wrote to her solicitors offering to complete the transaction.

I am a clerk in the Inland Revenue Office, 183, Great Portland Street—Bangham was employed there as a writer from 2nd January, 1879, to 8th February, 1879; during that time I frequently saw him write, and I know his writing very well—I have a letter of his dated 21st January, 1879, stating his inability to attend at the office that day as he was suffering from neuralgia; it is addressed to the head of the office, and in Bangham's handwriting I believe—I believe this order for the cheque-book and this 232<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque to be his writing; also the endorsement "Charles Edwards"—as far as I can judge the endorsement, "W.

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the Foreign Cattle Market, Deptford—I know Hanson; he works for Mr. Follett, a butcher in the market—his foreman is named Olsen—a pass is necessary to take goods out of the market—on Saturday, 2nd July, about 2 p.m., Hanson came and said "Will, you give me a pass to take out calves guts from Follett's slaughter-house?" I said "I cannot do so unless you get an order from the foreman, saying that you have a right to them"—two other lads were with him, Andrews and Spillerberg, I think, but I am not certain—Hanson said "Well, I think it is all right, I work there;" I said "But you are not the foreman, and I cannot give you a pass"—the three came again in half an hour, and brought this order, and I signed it and allowed them to taker the guts away; it is, "Sir,—Pass bearer with calves' guts from Follett. W. Olsen,</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutors' foreman—Muggeridge was in his employ, and Lee was in my employ—my employers contracted with Messrs. Knight for buying the fat—they carry on business outside the market, and the fat is taken out in casks—on Saturday morning, 2nd July, I left the slaughter-house in Lee's charge; there were four sacks of fat there, and I told Lee to take them to Mr. Knight's if I was not back within an hour or two—it was my custom to meet him outside the Bock of Gibraltar public-house; he was not there—I had to pass the police-station on my way home about 6 o'clock, and found him there in custody, and William Muggeridge also—I said to Lee "What do you mean by telling the policeman that I gave you the fat?" he said "Gurney, I did not say so, all I said was that the foreman of the mutton butcher's gave me some fat guts for washing out the slaughter-house"—it is not true that I gave any of the prisoners any fat on that Saturday—it was all mutton fat in those four bags, and no fat guts—there are several parts of the inside of a sheep from which fat may be taken, but the caul fat has no connection with the guts—I went to Marchant's that afternoon, and the police showed me some fat similar to what the bag contained—I saw some mutton caul fat, and also fat taken from the guts; that was with calves' fat and calves' fat guts—we had killed no calves, and lost no calves' fat—the mutton fat I saw at Mar<lb/>chant's was in a very dirty condition; it was not whole, as it was taken off the guts in small particles, and it was clean when it was in our place.</p>

There are more than 100 slaughter-houses, but they do not kill sheep at all of them—when the slaughterers are killing sheep or lambs they pitch the cauls into a sack against the wall, and sometimes the fat sticks to the wall or falls on the floor, but it he supposed to be picked up and put in the sack—the slaughter-houses are swept out a dozen times a day, sometimes out at the doors, and the fat is collected—the guts are the slaughterer's perquisites—the four sacks in question contained all mutton fat; they were taken to Knight's; it is impossible to identify the fat in them as coming from our place, though, of course, it would be similar—I never saw the sacks, only the fat, but it was all mutton fat in them—the bag I saw at Marchant's contained a mixture, including calves' guts and everything.</p>

I keep a grocer's and haberdashery shop at 66, Church Street, South Lambeth—on. 18th July Searle came in and had some dealings with my wife—20 minutes afterwards Watts came in—my wife called me into the shop—Watts showed me some drapery, and said he was in the habit of supplying my predecessor regularly every month, calling to know if he wanted any goods—I told him that I was full up, and he showed me similar boot-laces to these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I told him I did not want any—it ended in my buying halt' a dozen leather lacea at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a dozen mohair laces for 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he then went away—after<lb/>wards Searle came in—my wife attended to him, and I came into the shop as he was going out—I went down to the police—I said "I suspect this is a trick"—Watts came in a second time and said that he would leave us a price list, and my wife handed me this order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I</p>

               <p>Walworth, fruiterer—I have known Searle four or five years—I saw him at 11.30 a.m. on 18th July, and from that time he was minding my shop till 2.30; I then saw another man named Mitchell, a potman; I saw them leave the shop together, and go to the public-house—I saw Searle return between 5 and 6 o'clock, but not with Mitchell.</p>

I am the wife of Henry Bunn, of Great Suffolk Street—the prisoner and his wife lodged with us; she has lived there five years, and she married the prisoner last September—on the Saturday before Christmas Day I heard a scream, and afterwards saw bruises on her—I have not seen him ill-use her, but I have seen the effects—I have spoken to him about it, and he said he was very sorry—on Whit Monday she had been ill for ten days; the prisoner came home that night between twelve and a quarter-past, and I heard him using abusive language, and then heard a heavy fall; I only heard one voice, as the woman could not speak above a whisper—I went on to the stairs and listened, but it was all quiet afterwards—I had seen her a few minutes before he came in; there were no marks on her face then, but she was very ill—I saw the prisoner going out next morning, and ran after him, and asked him if he was going to leave her again without anybody to look after her, or anything to eat; as if he did I should have to go some where; he said, "I will be back in five minutes;" I then went up and peeped through a crack of the door; she was sitting up in bed, and seemed quite out of her mind, playing with some papers—I sent for the relieving officer, went into the room with him, and found a bump, and a cut on the centre of her forehead, which was not there the night before—the prisoner came back about 4 p.m., and I told him he was to go to Dr. Matcham's, the relieving officer's, that day, or before ten the next morning, or he would be takes up and charged with cruelty and neglect—he said that he knew all about it, he should sell up the home and put her in the workhouse that after<lb/>noon, and I should not be charged for what he did to his wife—I took her before a Magistrate in a conveyance on the 10th, and she was afterwards taken to the infirmary—I saw her dead at the inquest—I never saw her drunk; she was a sober, hard-working woman, but the prisoner was very seldom sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She had several attacks of illness, and was laid up for a time, and then got better; she had these attacks before she married him, and they continued afterwards—a medical man attended her, and I did a little nursing for her—the prisoner is a leather dresser; he used to work for a time, but did not do much; he drank very much indeed: he was very drunk on this night, when he came home over after twelve—I did not go into the room when I heard the fall—my husband was in the street at the time, but near enough for me to call to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical superintendent of Newington Infir<lb/>mary—the deceased was admitted there on the 10th June, quite out of her mind; I could not get anything out of her—there was a cut nearly healed over the right eye on her forehead, and several bruises on her legs and over her left buttock, and smaller bruises all over her body—she got better, and became a little more sensible the day before she died, which was on 24th June—I made a post-mortem, assisted by Dr. Matcham—the organs of the body were healthy, except the womb, where disease was commencing; the covering of the brain was adhering to the skull<lb/>cap, especially on the right side, and the brain on that side was much softened, and contained a great deal of fluid—softening of the brain was the cause of death; I can't say whether that was from natural causes or not—continual ill-treatment of a person in bad health will accelerate death—Dr. Matcham saw her earlier than I did, and knows more about it—I had not seen her before she was admitted.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was taking a walk around the field with the other workmen—there were seven of us—we did not all go through the gap, the field was open at the other end—the gap was not protected by a hurdle—the prisoner had, I should think, 30 cows in the field—I was about 35 yards from him when he was standing in his garden, or orchard, and fired—the hedge which runs round his garden has a gap in it which is protected by a hurdle—I was about 50 yards from the hurdle when I saw him with the gun—I walked nearer to him—he was about 20 yards from the hurdle when he fired—I did not speak to him or take any notice of him—nobody gave me permission to go into the field.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There are building operations going on all round, and the fences are in disorder, so that you can get through almost anywhere—the other men got into the field where it is not fenced in—I often go into the field at dinner time, and sit down—I have never been molested or told not to go there.</p>

I am a surgeon of Upper Tooting—I saw Turner and Savage at Wandsworth Common Police-station—Turner had twenty, shot marks on his body and legs; I extracted three shots, they were not dangerous wounds, but he might have been killed if he had been closer—the shot were sent well home, and imbedded in the muscles; some of them are past detection—they are No. 6 shot—Savage had six shots, two in his thighs, two in his heels, and two in his head—a rifle gives more force than a gun—Savage was able to go to work next day.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JESSE REEVES</hi>. I am head keeper of Wimbledon Common—on Sunday, 17th July, I was watching and saw a fire break out near the Windmill—I went towards it, and just as I got to it I saw another fire break out nearer Wimbledon; I ran on, and a third fire broke out about 75 yards nearer Wimbledon—I saw Mason standing there in plain clothes; we went farther down the furze; I sat down and watched, and Mason left me for a minute or two—I then saw the two prisoners working their way through some high furze direct from the previous fires and coming towards me—Mason rejoined me, and I called his attention to them—Grain worked his way through the furze to the other side of the clump, and stood there keeping watch; Deverell went into a large, high clump of furze, came out, and went into another, where he appeared to throw something into the bushes, and immediately rushed into the open, ran about twenty yards, and then stopped and looked back, but seeing no fire he again returned, slipped one foot into the furze, struck a light and threw it in, jumped back about two paces, and the fire blazed up—he then ran and rejoined Grain, who came out from the other side of the clump; they both walked rapidly away together, and I ran after them—Deverell looked round, saw me coming, and ran away into Mason's arms, who had gone round the bushes to intercept him—I ran back and caught Grain, and before I could speak to him he said "I know nothing about this man"—I said "That don't matter to me; you were coming with him through the furze, and you ran away with him"—he said "I admit I came from Waterloo with him this morning"—there were nine fires' that day, and about an acre and a half of furze was destroyed—it would have been much more but for the volunteers turning out and working hard to put it out—several trees were destroyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The camp had been there seven days; this was the second Sunday; that is the favourite day for visitors—it was very hot, and the furze was very dry—we have had fires so often that without looking at my book I cannot tell you how many, but we have caught most of the men and convicted them—the road is thirty or forty yards from where the first fire was, and about the same distance from the other two—I sat down and saw the prisoners working their way through furze four or five feet high, but some of which is seven feet high; they were three or four yards apart, one behind the other—they were not twenty yards apart—I could not see what Deverell threw into the furze; I was about forty yards from him; I said he apparently threw something—I pre<lb/>sumed he was trying to set fire to the furze—I ran towards him—I am sure there was nothing else in his hand—I saw no cigarettes—when the fire actually broke out they walked away together—Grain was ten or twelve yards off when the match was thrown on the Wandsworth side of the bush, but not out of Deverell's sight—I did not see either of them</p>

               <p>with cigarettes, and there were no other persona near, but I daresay people were wandering all over the common.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I saw the prisoners come from where the first fire was to where the other fire was, one behind the other—if they had been smoking I must have seen it—I saw Deverell strike a light deliberately and throw it into the furze.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MASON</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman V</hi> 235). On 17th July I was on duty in plain clothes at Wimbledon Camp—I met Reeves, who asked me to come with him—he sat down on the edge of a gravel pit and I went away for a few minutes, and then came back and went round a clump of furze—I then saw Deverell go into the furze, but could not see what he did—he came out and ran away a little distance, and then returned and looked—I saw him return a third time and stoop down, and then the bush went into flames and he ran into my arms—he had no pipe, cigar, or cigarette—I said "I shall take you in custody for setting fire to the furze"—he said "All right"—I saw Reeves run after Grain—I searched both prisoners and found a box of fusees on each, and some cigarette papers and tobacco on Deverell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was about 10 yards from Reeves, standing up in the furze, so that my head was visible above the top—there were bushes all round, but there was boarding on one side—it was a calm day—I did not see Grain till after the bush was in flames—they were walking side by side as the bush went into flames—I do not think they began to run till Beeves began to run.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi> 2). On 17th July I was on duty on Wimbledon Common—about 8,20 I laid down at the edge of a gravel pit, and saw Deverell about 40 yards from me behind a furze bush—he went about three paces and turned round, and immediately the bush sprang into flames—I saw Beeves run towards him—I ran the reverse way behind the bushes—Grain was standing 8 or 10 yards away, apparently watching while Deverell was in the bush—when I got round the bush I found Deverell in Mason's custody—I took hold of Grain and assisted in taking him to the station—he said "I know nothing of this man," but he afterwards said "I came from Waterloo with him this morning."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Grain was 10 or 12 yards from Deverell when he came from behind the bush—Deverell did not run till Reeves began to run—I saw no match struck.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 10, Winthorpe Road, Putney, and am a booking clerk—on 17th July I was at the camp, saw a fire, ran to it, and saw Superintendent Dig by—while I was speaking to him another fire broke out 50 yards away; that was put out, and, as I was walking away, I saw Grain come through the furze, and saw another fire break out about 70 yards behind him—I ran towards it, and about the time I got half way to it I saw a fire break out at the spot I had seen Grain—the fires were both put out, and in a quarter of an hour another fire broke out, and just as it began to blaze up I saw Grain in charge, and said "You have got one of the right ones"—I had previously described him to Digby.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Everybody seemed to keep away from the furze; I kept away because I would not be accused—any person in the furze would naturally be suspected—Grain was the only person I saw in the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>, No one could have thrown a match from the high road to where the fire broke out.</p>
