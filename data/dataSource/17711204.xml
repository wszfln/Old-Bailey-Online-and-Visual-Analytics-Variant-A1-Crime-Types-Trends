             said she thought she heard a noise over-head. I got up and opened the kitchen door. As soon as I had done that, I heard feet over-head. I was much frightened, and screamed out immediately. Upon that I heard them run along the entry; there were several feet. I heard them pull back the bolt of the street door, and let themselves out. Then I went up stairs, and into the street, and call'd out, Stop thief! I did not see them, for they were gone out at the door before I got up stairs. I found the parlour door open, and the closet door, in which the plate was kept, was open. There was taken out of that closet a silver pepper castor, a silver cream-pot, and four silver table spoons. A drawer in the bureau was open, out of which the scissars and the buckles were taken: they took them out of the cases, and left the cases. I had seen them before that day. This pepper castor (producing it) is mine.</p>

            . I was coming home with Mr. Life. Just as we came against King-square-court, I saw three people running very fast. We heard the cry, Stop thief! and immediately we pursued them. We just lost sight of them when we came to the corner of Queen-street. We asked a green-woman if she had seen three men run by. She said they were just gone down Queen-street. We went down Queen-street, and then we saw the same three man again; they were standing together in a cluster.</p>

            . Yes, they stood under a lamp. Mr. Life seiz'd two of them; they struggled, and one got away from him; and just at that time I heard something drop from Coleman. Life had hold of him. I ask'd, what has he dropt? Mr. Life stoop'd and pick'd up this cream-jug (producing it). It was Coleman dropt it. Mr. Life felt down him, and ask'd him if he had got any more of these things about him. Then I left him, and pursued Ogilby, the other prisoner, and Mr. Pearce stopt him. Ogilby, when he came to the watch-house, said he was very faint; he desired to sit down at the watch-house door, as the watch-house was shut; and this pepper-box was found next day, as I am informed, in the place where he sat. (The cream-jug deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>

            . As I was coming up Dean-street about half an hour after six o'clock, I heard St. Ann's bell ring before I came to it; when I got to the Highlander, which is three doors from Mrs. Jones's, I saw the two prisoners and another run by; I knew them as soon as I saw them; I had seen them at the justices before. I had often seen the three together. I am sure the prisoners. were two of them. As soon as I saw them I said to Crompton, they three have been doing no good; the words were not out of my mouth before I heard a woman crying, stop thief! I said to Crompton, you can't run so fast as me, but follow me that they may may do me no injury. When I came to the corner of Queen-street I lost fight of them. I asked a green woman if she had seen three men run by; she said they were just gone down the street; as soon as I had turned the corner I saw them before me. When I came just by Mr. Hammond's, the Glazier, in Greek-street, they were all three standing together. I said nothing but immediately caught hold of two of them; I had not fast hold of one; he got from me and run down the street,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177112040004"/> I kept the other fast, which is Coleman; they all three stood so close together that I can't say whether he that got from me was Ogilby, or the man that got clear off. I am sure Ogilby. was one of the three. Mr. Crompton called out, stop thief! and one Mr. Pearce stopt Ogilby. He was about seven or eight yards behind the other. I asked Coleman what he had stolen; I saw something in his hand; I took hold of his wrist and immediately he dropt something, I stoopt directly and picked up this cream pot. (Produced and deposed to by the prosecutrix.) They declared at the watch-house that they were strangers to each other. I told them that I knew them well; Ogilby sat down on the stop at the watch-house door, and said he was saint; the pepper-box was picked up near the place where he sat.</p>

            . I was coming from Covent-garden play-house, where I had been to keep a place for my master; when I got into Greek-street, I saw two men running as fast as they could; I secured Ogilby; he was behind the other. While he was sitting upon the step at the watch-house door, he tumbled his cloaths about; I bid him sit still; he said I had pulled and hawled his clothes about, and he wanted to set them right.

I met the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177112040007"/> prisoner afterwards in the street; I saw Aldin's waistcoat under his arm; I charged him with having robbed the prisoner; he desired I would make no noise about it, and let him go. I took him before justice Kynaston; there he was searched, and the prosecutor's shirt and gold-ring were found upon him. The prisoner desired I would go to a man that was in company with him when I took him, and desire him to come and assist him. I went after that man; as soon as he saw me he run away. The prisoner said at the justices that that man was not concerned in the business.</p>

            . I am a merchant's watchman on the keys. While I was on duty I saw the prisoner come on shore several nights with bags, which might hold a hundred weight. I asked them one night what was in the bags; they gave me a shilling to let them pass. Another night; I saw them come on shore with a jarr of raisins; I told them they had better not carry them any farther, for the officers were further up, and they would lose them; they put the jars down till the officer was gone by, then they took it up again, and went on with it.</p>

I was informed by my apprentice, on the 24th of November, about seven o'clock in the morning, that my house was broke open. I immediately got up; I found my shop was broke open; the door was fastened only with a hasp, which was so slight that it would fall down of itself sometimes by shaking; the shop opens into a back yard, and then there is a wall which a person might get over, by some pantiles that lie there. I found a tinder-box, that usually stood in the kitchen, had been removed from there to the shop, and a rush-light was removed from the shop into the kitchen: my bureau, which stood in the kitchen, was broke open and there were sixteen guineas taken out that were in an iron box in the top of the bureau, and eight shillings was taken out of a little drawer in the bureau; the flap was let down, and there was a tool that I worked with found on the top of the bureau; my great coat, which hung by the side of the bureau, was gone; and the silver spoons were taken out of the beauset, and a table spoon was taken from the cupboard in the kitchen. The window-frame appeared dirty, as if trod upon by some person that got in at the window. I am sure it was fast over night; I was last up in the house over night; I went to bed that night about eleven o'clock.</p>

               <p>- Mince. I have lodged in this house eleven years. When I got up at five in the morning. I saw the bar open, and I alarmed Mrs. Bellinger. The top shutter was put down against the door; the till appeared to be cut open with a knife.</p>
               <p>- Wetherby. I am a watch man. I came down by the prosecutor's door at ten o'clock, then all was safe; at half after twelve having called the hour I went to my box; there was a young fellow. in a white coat, whistled between his fingers; then a man opened a sash in the prosecutor's house, and put his head and shoulders out at the window, and said where are they: the man in the street said, they are all together, will not you come down and go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177112040010"/> along with them? He replied, no, he could not come down. Then the clock struck one; I took my lanthorn and went round to call the four. I cou'd see no person there then.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might it be before you came back?</p>
               <p>Wetherby. More than a quarter of an hour. The place where the back door is, don't belong to me. It is within sight of my stand. I look'd at the door when I came back; all was fast then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any noise in the house?</p>
               <p>Wetherby. No; I called the hour at two; I saw nothing then. When I came back from calling the half hour after two, Sam came up into the court.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know his sirname?</p>
               <p>Wetherby. No; he had been a servant to the prosecutor but a short time before; I thought he had been so then: He threw something up at the same path that the man had before looked out at, which was two stories high. I told him not to offer to throw any thing up at that time, for I would not suffer him to do any such thing. Then I saw the sash go up, and a man put out his hand, and wagged his fingers, by way of beckoning to him. Then Sam went away, and the man pulled the sash down again: Then the clock struck three. I took my lanthorn, and went round, and called the hour. When I came back, my candle was almost out; I had left a spare candle in my box, which was gone when I came back. I went and challenged some draymen with having taken it; they said they had not. I walked into the alley, and saw the door standing a little a jar; that was about half an hour after three. I thought I heard something stirring about the place: I struck the door three times with my staff, and two young fellows jumped out at the door. I asked them what they were doing there: They said they were going to their work. Then presently another came out. I saw the glimpse of a candle a going up stairs, but it was put out in a minute. I took care of the door till Mr. Mince came down: Then I told him they had got careless lodgers, for I did not think they were thieves; if I had, I would have had them all taken. Sam was the third that came out of the house: I did not know then that Sam had left the service.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know either of the men that came out first?</p>
               <p>Wetherby. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who it was that looked out at the window?</p>
               <p>Wetherby. It was

            , and I think four more, on the 20th of November, in the court near Mr. Bellenger's house, about twelve at night. I saw Sam the waiter, and one Bowman, and another man that was taken up and discharged at Sir John Fielding's. There were five or six standing in the court. Sam said Moxon, I wish you would lend me six-pence, for I have left my place, and have no money. I was going to lay at Mr. Bellenger's that night; it is a public-house. As I was going to lend Sam six-pence, while I had my hand in my pocket, Farrell put his hand into my pocket, and picked out a glove and comb. Sam said, if you take any thing out of his pocket, I'll knock your head off; so he gave me my comb and glove again. Shepherd was coming home along with me; Moody attempted to pick his pocket; I am certain Farrell was one of the men that was in the court. When we searched him, we took about 4 l. out of his pocket. Edridge lay with me that night.</p>

             and I were up in the room about twelve o'clock: Somebody came into the court, and gave a whistle. I said, I imagine that is Shepherd come home. There were four of us in the room a going to bed. Edridge jumped down and went to the window. I said, who is it? is it Shepherd? He said, no. I said, who is it? He said, it is nobody that you know. I went to look over his shoulder, and he pushed me away. I said, well, if I don't know them, I don't want to know them.</p>

On Saturday the 16th of November I was in the counting-house at Bennett's Hill; about one o'clock I heard the maid talk of a strange man coming down out of the men's room. I asked what was the matter? The maid said, a strange man came down out of the men's room. I said, why did not you stop him? She said she did not think of it, but told Sykes, and he was gone after him. In about ten minutes I saw Sykes bring him back. We brought him into the counting-house, and asked him what business he had there. He said he was not there. I said I wou'd prove that. I bid the men go into their rooms, and see what they had lost.

I asked the prisoner where they were? He took them out, and gave them to me. (The buckles produced.) I sent for a constable. He said he had no money; he said he had had nothing to eat for several days, and that, he said, was the reason of his coming there. When the constable came, he examined his breeches pocket; he found two-pence halfpenny only. I told him we must have some more money. In shaking of him, we found, in the lining of his waistcoat, two guineas, six shillings in silver, and nine-pence in halfpence; and we found the thimble, which is

            . I live in Bride lane. I was at Finchley on the 14th of July; there were two post-chaises, my husband and a gentleman were in one, and my daughter and I in the other. As we were coming over <placeName id="t17711204-21-crimeloc98">Finchley-common</placeName>

I said I had none; then they demanded my money, and I gave them what is mentioned in the indictment, a paper ear-ring case, with a pair of gold wires in it for the ears, a little pen-knife, a breast buckle set in silver, and eighteen-pence in money. I believe the prisoner is one of them, but I cannot swear to him; he was dressed in dark coloured clothes; I could not discern the colour. I have never found any of my things.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner taken up?</p>
               <p>Bulford. I was in the country then, and cannot say. I saw him about three weeks or a month after.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you swear to the prisoner then?</p>
               <p>Bulford. No; I thought he was one.</p>
               <p>- Bulford. I am daughter to Mrs. Bulford.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say what sort of men they were that robbed you?</p>
               <p>Bulford. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say the prisoner is one?</p>
               <p>Bulford. Yes, I can; because he was close to me all the while; he was on that side of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177112040013"/> chaise on which I fat; It was light enough, I could tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he about the chaise?</p>
               <p>Bulford. I believe about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you frightened?</p>
               <p>Bulford. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And could you make such particular observation of his person?</p>
               <p>Bulford. Yes, he was so close to me, and had hold of my hand, and I looked at him all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Bulford. Just light enough that I could distinguish his face.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. What did you know me b?</p>
               <p>Bulford. By his face.</p>
               <p>Court. What clothes had he?</p>
               <p>Bulford. A darkish great coat.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. What colour was the horse?</p>
               <p>Bulford. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you not to take notice of the colour of the horse?</p>
               <p>Bulford. Because I looked so much at him, I am sure he is the man.</p>

I asked what he wanted for them. He said 10 s. for both. Mills said nothing. I took them into custody. Then I said to the fellow that fetch'd me, go and bring handcuffs: he brought them. I said, now tell me how you came by the spoons. Loveday said his mother gave them to him to sell or pawn. I took a coach, and put them in, and searched the other. I found four small tea-spoons on him, wrapped up in this bit of flannel. I observed he searched to shuffle in the coach, made me search him. I asked how he came by them? He said, to tell you the truth, I had them of an uncle of mine, one Betmaker, a master cow-keeper. Next day we went to Mrs. Betmaker's, to ask if she had lost any spoons. She said she could not tell, but would go and look over her plate. She, after looking over them, said, no, she had lost none. She has spoons of the same letters as these last two, but the same make.</p>

He asked if any body lived there. I said, yes. He said he had been there twice before, but could find nobody at home, and said he had knock'd then twice, but could not make any body hear; and that a woman that lived there had had a shirt and stockings of his, which he came after, and he would come again.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177112040015"/> at night.

I am a watchman in Great Russ ell-street, Bloomsbury, Standing at that street I saw the prisoner and two more cross Russell-street; each had a bundle with them; the prisoner said he would give me a pint of beer: I asked for what; he said, because you are a good fellow; upon this I looked hard at the two men; I did not like their having bundles; on this I seized the other men; then the prisoner threw his bundle into the middle of the street; upon which I let go my rattle in order to call out for more assistance; upon that the other men made off: two watchmen came to my assistance and took the prisoner to the watch-house; the bundle now produced is the same the man threw into the street; when I took it up the prisoner denied knowing any thing of the bundle; going to the watch-house with him the prisoner said it was given him by his mother, with orders for him to give it to his brother, because his wife was with child, and then likely to lie in; he said, if I would let him go he would give me share of a gallon of porter; I asked him where his money was? upon that he pulled out two six-pences and gave me, which have been in my possession ever since.</p>

               <p>Lukeman. About a week or ten days after, a letter came from the general post-office, that they had not received the Isle of Wight hag; that brought it fresh into my memory.

               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Andrews. He left his name as a direction; he desired of me that if any letters were left in the name of Jarvis that I would take care of them till he called for them; he laid at my house that night; he wrote some letters in the morning, I don't know to whom; I put them in the post myself; he borrowed a seal of me after he had wrote the letters.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him seal the letters with your seal?</p>
               <p>Andrews. No, I did not; he went away from my house the next morning on foot, and when my coachman came down from London he told me, that Mr. Jarvis desired me to send by him any letters that might he left at my house for him; I gave him the letters directed for Mr. Jarvis.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send any other by your coachman?</p>

            . I am a coachman to Mr. Andrews at Maidenhead. I carried the prisoner down to Maidenhead on Saturday; I don't know the day of the month; he was booked in the name of Jarvis; I saw him again at the Whitehorse-cellar two or three days after; he bid me ask my master if there were any letters for him, and if there were to bring them to him at the Whitehorse, cellar. I received two letters from my master directed to Mr. Jarvis; I gave them to the prisoner at the Whitehorse-cellar. He told me he expected some more in two or three days; I had two more afterwards. Mr. Jarvis met me at the Whitehorse-cellar again, and took them from me. I always stay at the Old Whitehorse-cellar till the coach come back; the man that drives the coach from town to the Whitehorse-cellar, brought me two notes from Mr. Jarvis.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that man's name?</p>
               <p>Rymell. He is called John; I don't know his sirname; he is here. I saw the prisoner after that at the King's-head in the Old Change on my Lord Mayur's-day. I went there to take him; as soon as he saw me he asked me for letters.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he appointed to meet you there?</p>
               <p>Rymell. No; but to meet the man that brought the note. I said I had no letters, but I must have him for the present.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of that note being brought to your bankers for payment?</p>
               <p>Tracey. It was brought to me by the banker's clerk; it was not endorsed, and I think I saw the prisoner at Nicholas-lane coffee-house; the banker sent it to me on account of its being tendered for payment without an endorsement, and coming so quick for it, came immediately as the post could return.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you converse with the person that you saw at the coffee-house?</p>
               <p>Tracey. The banker's clerk had told him that the note could not be paid for want of an endorsement. I apologized to him for it; he said he had received it of Mr. Jarvis at Maidenhead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that person tell you what his name was?</p>
               <p>Tracey. I can't tell, I think he wrote on the back of the note

            . On the 23d of November last I was at the lottery office examining some tickets. About six o'clock in the evening I laid down my pocket book on the counter. I missed it in a little time. The prisoner was there examining some numbers. I believe, when I missed it, he went out. I told the people in the office that I suspected that person. He returned again. They said he would return again. I asked him about it; he said he had not seen it. I got a warrant for him on Wednesday the 27th of November, and searched his lodging. We found a bank note, that caused a little suspicion. I lost a 50 l. and a 20 l. note.</p>

               <p>Q. Whereabouts in the room did you stand was it next the street?</p>

            . The prisoner is my son-in-law. He told me he had found two bank notes in the street, and desired I would go and buy some things with them; it was on Monday. Accordingly I went to Mr. Jefferies, and bought half a dozen of spoons, and he changed the 50 l. note. I live in the Borough.</p>

               <p>Cooper. I was that way; I thought it looked like a good shop. I changed the 20 l. note at a silversmith's shop in New-street; there I bought two salts and two spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. What change did you receive of Mr. Jefferies, cash or bills?</p>
               <p>Cooper. I received cash of him.</p>

               <p>- Bird. I am a silversmith in New-street, Covent-garden. This Mrs. Cooper came in after candle-light, and looked at some salts; then she said, I cannot have them unless you can change a 20 l. note. I sent out and changed it. I put it among more, that I cannot tell what the number of it is.</p>

            . I am a broker. I live in Fleet-lane, a little below Mr. Frisby's. On the 26th of October the prisoner offered these two pots to sale; she said they were her own property; it was about five o'clock; I asked what she would have for them; she said six shillings. By the price I suspected they were stolen; I asked where she lived: she said in the Old Bailey with Mr. Metcalf; I told her I should be glad to see Mr. Metcalf, to know if they were her own property; I asked if she had a husband; she did not choose to give any account of her husband; I went with her; she took the pots in her hand and went up Fleet-lane, she turned at the top to the right hand; I said where are you going, this is not the way where you said you lived. I desired one of the constables to take charge of her; by that time Mr. Frisby had missed the pots; he came and owned them.</p>

               <p>I did not say any such thing to Jones. I met a young woman with these pots; I went along with her; Jones was not at home; in the mean time this young woman desired me to stop while the woman I met went to fetch herself some snuff.</p>

I saw the two prisoners come into the hall; I watched them, I saw what they were about; the great boy was pushing the little one on; they were both at this gentleman's pocket; they were so close I could not see whose hand was in the pocket; when they had got the handkerchief out they made off. I tapped the gentleman on the shoulder, and we went after them; the little boy had the handkerchief in his pocket, a corner of it hung out, and he said the great boy put his hand through his coat and picked the gentleman's pocket, and put the handkerchief in his pocket.</p>

I followed him over the way; I asked him what he had there? he said, cloaths. I asked him where he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177112040029"/> got them? he said, from Mr. Lester's room. I said, I did not think that Mr. Lester was at home: he said he would go along with me. We went into the passage of the room, and called out for Mr. Lester: there was no answer. Then the prisoner dropt the bundle, and rushed by me into the street. I pursued him, and called, Stop thief! The prisoner ran into one door of a public-house, and out at another. I took him as he came out at the door.</p>

The prisoner and the deceased stood at Mr. Monk's door; the prisoner called several times for a pot of beer. I can't tell how they came together. Mrs. Monk was then standing at the door; the prisoner seemed to be in liquor, and the deceased much more so, which was the reason, I believe, that Mrs. Monk would not let them have any liquor, for there was no beer brought. The deceased went away, the prisoner followed him, and just opposite my door said to him, What are you going away, won't you be your pint; and then he said, you have got no money in your pocket, or to that effect. The deceased turned round and took six-pence out of his right hand pocket, and held it out in his hand, and said, yes, I have money. The prisoner came towards him, and the deceased drew his hand back as he saw the prisoner coming, and the sixpence fell upon the ground; the prisoner attempted to pick it up; a little scuffle ensued, and the deceased was thrown down; the prisoner took up the six-pence from the ground, and went back to the public-house door, where they had been standing before, and he called for a pot of beer again. I did not see any beer brought; the deceased got up; he went to the prisoner, and asked him for the six-pence; the prisoner said, as no beer was brought, he would put the six-pence in his pocket; and he took his whip, and went into the road to the cart he was the driver of, which stood with bricks in the road; the deceased passed him to the near side of the horses; he went to the head board of the cart, to look at the number and name, as I imagined; the prisoner came round to him whilst he was looking at the head-board; some words passed between them (but what I can't tell) for about two or three minutes: then the prisoner hit one of the horses, and set them a going; the deceased turned round to the third horse, and caught hold of his bridle; I believe they call it got hold; the cart kept going on, and the deceased kept hold of the bridle, endeavouring to stop the horses, and he went on near thirty yards that way; at last I saw the deceased drop from the hold he had; he fell upon his back, and the wheel went over the lower part of his body; the prisoner went on with his cart, and somebody stopt it, I believe; I saw it standing in the road at some distance.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the prisoner behave upon that occasion?</p>
               <p>Fenton. He did not seem to take much notice; he was to much in liquor, I suppose he did not know the consequence.</p>
               <p>- Lockston. I saw him hang by the side of the horses, and I saw him drop; he lost his hold some how or other, and fell down upon his back, and the wheel went over his belly.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the prisoner, when he saw the man drop, stop the horses?</p>
               <p>Lockston. I can't say; the horses were stopt about twenty yards off; I can't say who stopt them.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the horses toss'd up their heads or not?</p>
               <p>Lockston. I can't say.</p>
               <p>- Monk. They came to my house; they called for beer, but they were both in liquor, and so I said I would not draw any. The prisoner went away; the deceased went after him, I thought it was to take the number of his cart. I saw the team go over him, but I did not see him till he dropt.</p>
               <p>- Clark. I live at Leightonstone; I was opposite the cart at the time; I was at one Mrs. Crouch's; and I saw the deceased take hold of the reins of the horse; I did not see him go five yards before he fell; I saw the wheel go over his body.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177112040032"/>- Landefall. I belong to the bank; I saw this accident. On the 2d of November I was coming by the Infirmary, I observed a cart standing at a public-house door, loaded with bricks; I walked on a little further about twenty yards perhaps; then I saw the cart come on, and a person hanging to the shaft horse on the near side by the bridle; he went on a few yards farther in that manner; he was pulling the horse very hard; the horse shook his head; he let go his hold, and fell under the wheel; he turned like, and the wheel went over him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the prisoner strike his horses?</p>
               <p>- Landefall. I did not. After this happened I walked on, and the deceased was taken up and carried to the hospital. When the people charged him with having killed the man, he put his hand in his pocket, and said, Why I will be two-pence to his three-halfpence; I told him so. He was very drunk, and stood very still.</p>
               <p>- Toller. I am surgeon-beadle at the hospital; the deceased was brought into the infirmary, and died soon after.</p>

               <p>Hutchins. Yes; I was sitting in the parlour; on the eleventh of June, about ten o'clock at night I heard the dog bark; my men were gone to bed.</p>


               <p>Q. How many maid servants had you up?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. Two maid servants. I called them to see what was the matter with the dog. In a short space of time I heard a noise; I ran to see what was the matter; I found my maid

            , was one.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you swear to his being one?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. I do, to the best of my remembrance; the other's name is Highham Lazarus;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177112040035"/> my fright was exceedingly great. I did my endeavour to assist her; but one pushed me into a chair, and pulled my upper petticoat over my head; I believe it was the Doctor that laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any of the others?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. No; I put my coat down again, then they put it up again, and said if I valued my life I must keep it there; then I heard the cook cry very much; one of them said cut her throat; another said, you Bish, if you don't hold your tongue I will cut your throat; if you hold your tongue I will cot murder you; they were all in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who it was made use of that expression?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. No, my coat was over my head; I could not see them: as they were pleased to speak so favourable, I begged them to make her hear, for she was deaf; then they came to me and offered to tie my legs; I begged they would not, and said I would not stir; then they all went to another room; the door of that room was locked; they said, if it was not immediately opened they would break it; they returned again in about five minutes. I heard them go up stairs; a little time after they were gone up, I heard somebody cry, Fire! and swore very much, I then heard a pistol go off.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after you heard the word fire?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. In about the space of a minute. I then ran to the back door, endeavouring to get off.</p>
               <p>Q. On the pistol going off, did you hear any cry or shriek?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. I heard the man cry out, and beg they would not; I could hear no more. I took hold of the latch of the back door, endeavouring to get out, but I found some men at the outside of the back door who prevented me: They said, if they were not my friends, they would blow my brains out. It was when the pistol went off that attempted to make my escape out of the back door.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know then whether the five persons you spoke of were in the house?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. No, I cannot tell; I returned to the chair. Then I heard a very great russling, and screaming, and noise above stairs, as if they were throwing the servant down stairs; and a little while after I heard another pistol go off.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance of time might it be between hearing the two pistols go off?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. A very short space of time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the tussel on the stairs was it before you heard the other pistol go off?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. A very little time. Then I saw the wounded man endeavouring to get down: He came to me, and said, How are you, Ma'am, for I am a dead man! Those were his words: He turned short, and fell down upon the ground; his shirt was on fire close to the wound, and I put it out; the blood ran down his legs: When he fell down I saw the wound; it was just under the shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see blood issue from that wound?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. Yes, and the blood that was running down his legs proceeded from that wound. He groaned very much, and complained of being cold.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing on but his shirt?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. No, nothing. Then I heard the people in the house run from room to room; then they came down to me, and one of them took the buckles out of my shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell who?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. To the best of my knowledge

               <p>Hutchins. I cannot say; I believe it was the little man. Hyam Lazarus; there were three with me then.

            , and him, and another which I can't describe. They took the plate out of the cupboard, and gave it to their companions at the back door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of your plate again?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. No: Then they went into the parlour, where there was a bureau, and broke it to pieces. The doctor and a little man went into the parlour. I followed them. I told them there was nothing there worth their having, for there was nothing but paper. Then one of them struck me in the face with a pistol, and was going to shoot me, for he put his finger in the trigger, but the doctor guarded the pistol off with his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is that man?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. He was a thick short man: he is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177112040036"/> not here; he cut my lip with the pistol, and loosened one of my teeth. They said they must have money and notes; that they came for money and notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the doctor say any thing when he pushed the other man's pistol by?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. Nothing at all. I told them I had a little money. They asked me to shew them where it was. I went up stairs, unlocked the drawers, and gave them a purse with sixty-one guineas; and the same old man turned round, and would have shot me, and said I had notes.</p>
               <p>Q. He is not here?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. He was a short lusty man; he is not here, or my fright don't permit me to know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any silk?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. Yes, a piece of lemon-coloured silk.</p>
               <p>Q. Who prevented him shooting you the second time?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. The same man, the doctor, pushed him by the shoulder, and prevented him.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was the silk?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. In a chair on the left hand side of the parlour, wrapped up in a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you had it?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. I cannot justly say; I had it of one

            , a dyer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing remarkable in the silk that you can know it again?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. There were some spots of grease upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity was there of the silk?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. I never measured it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them take it away?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. No; the silk was there; I missed it as soon as they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they all pistols?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. I saw several; I think they had all pistols.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. In a darkish red sort of a great coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they all dressed alike?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. All dressed in great coats alike. excepting the lusty man, he had not; to the best of my knowledge he had a kind of a light brown coat.</p>
               <p>Q. A great coat?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. I cannot very well say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing particular in their great coats?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. No; only they were so long, they reached down almost to their heels; there were three of them so equal in height, that you might have rolled a ball on their heads.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they bring any lights with them?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. They dou'ed our candle, and in a little time lighted brown wax-candles of their own; there were several lighted.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a wax candle that rolls up?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. Really I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any thing of a box to put it in?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. I saw nothing; they held it in their hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen any of the things you lost?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. I have seen the piece of silk, as I think; I cannot speak positive to it, one piece is so much like another. There were two grease-spots upon it; I objected to it on that account.</p>
               <p>Q. When did they go away?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. Immediately after the man attempted to shoot me because I had not the notes. I found my maid,

               <p>Q. I believe it was desired by somebody present that they might speak, that you might recollect their voices again?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. It was for my cook, not me.</p>
               <p>Q. They all spoke at that time, I believe?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. A question was put to one, that he might give an answer, that you might hear his voice?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. There was a coat the doctor had on, which I thought he had given to the little man; I desired to know if that was the coat he had on; it was not for his voice at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen him several times?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray have not you always, from that time to this, expressed a doubt of his being the person; and Hyam Lazarus and he has been discharged?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. Yes, I had the same opinion of them in the Borough as I have now; I expressed myself so there.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he was disguised by his coat, and hat flapp'd?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean it was button'd up to his face?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Considering him so disguised, and you seeing him before, and expressing great doubts about his being the person, how can you be more positive now?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. Because there are corroborating circumstances have arose since, that strengthen my opinion.</p>
               <p>Q. It is mere matter of opinion then as to the person of the man; your doubts would be the same if it was not for these circumstances of the reality of the man?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. They would.</p>
               <p>Q. You was in equal doubt with the little one (Hyam Lazarus) in the Borough too, I believe?</p>

               <p>Hutchins. I did not care to swear to him; I had the same opinion of him as of the doctor.</p>
               <p>Q. Whoever that person was, you say the person you apprehend be the doctor darted off the pistol from your face when the man would have shot you?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you reason to think that person would have killed you, if it had not been for that man?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those three people up stairs all of a height?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think the men you took to be the doctor saved your life?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. I do believe so.</p>
               <p>Court. You swore you thought the same then as you do now?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you explain what your doubts were?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. Because one face may be so nearly like another.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other reason to doubt about it but that?</p>

               <p>Hutchins. No other.</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. When you saw the little man in the Borough, was there any circumstances respecting his hat you observed?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. There was brown wax on his hat, the same as they had in the house; he had a brown wax candle in his hand in the house.</p>

            .) I jump'd upon my right side, and asked what that was for? one of them answered, D - n your eyes, you son of a bitch, if you speak another word I will blow your brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know which that was?</p>
               <p>Stone. I cannot tell; as soon as they spoke that word, my fellow-servant jumped up, and I heard one of them cry, Shoot him, and directly there was a pistol discharged, and he cried out.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell which discharged the pistol?</p>
               <p>Stone. I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was the pistol to him when it was discharged?</p>
               <p>Stone. Close to him, I suppose; the blood was all in the bed; he cried out, Lord have mercy on me, I am murdered, I am murdered! There were two on each side of the bed, and one stood at the foot of the bed; they went all round, and dragg'd him to the stair-case, all five of them. I lay on that side of the bed next the window. When they had him at the stair-case, I supposed they were going to throw him down the stairs; I jumped up, and got through the window; as soon as I had just got on the outside, and fell into the gutter, they discharged another pistol. I climbed up and got on the ridge of the house; they fired out, I supposed they fired at me; from the ridge of the house I got into a gutter on the lower part of the house; I was there the space of about ten minutes; I heard a man at the door ask who was there? Then the door was opened, and they came out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How many men did you see on the outside?</p>
               <p>Stone. There were two at each door; as soon as the door was opened, they came out; I heard them say one to another, It is time for us to be gone: one of them made a whistle like; and then I heard a man or two come from the fore part of the house to the back part; then they went out of the yard through the fields.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the poor man die that was shot?</p>
               <p>Stone. About three o'clock next day.</p>
               <p>Q. When they all went away together, how many might you see?</p>

               <p>Isaacs. To break into a house with a design of thieving. I had been in their company on an illicit trade, and they consided in me, and asked me to be of this party.</p>

               <p>Isaacs. It was before the feast of our passover, which corresponds with Easter, the months Lessen, which correspond with part of March and April. Sunday night 17th of March we met together at an alehouse in Woolwich-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them together between the 13th of March and the time the robbery was committed?</p>

               <p>Q. What did you give for all these things?</p>
               <p>Lazarus. I bought them all together for 14 l. I sold the watch to Mr. Robinson, the other I sold to one Mr. Douglas, a Scotchman for 9 l. 18 s. he allowed me five shillings and six-pence an ounce. I had a piece of muslin of him in part and the rest in money. They did not at that time tell me where the things come from; but a day or two after I read the news-paper, and I saw murder had been done. I was shocked. I met Asher and Doctor

             after that in Aylife-street, I said these things you sold me came from Chelsea; you have done murder among you; he replied, they were opstropilus; they had not men enough, and they were obliged to shoot the man. This conversation was in the street, and then they told me who was along with them, and which way they got in. I asked him who was along with them, and they told me.</p>

The family hearing a noise, opened the door, and they rushed in. They said a servant maid caught one of them by the collar.

I took it home; we opened it and measured it on my counter, there was about fifteen yards and a quarter on it; we took it into the parlour; my wife complained it was full of wrinkles. She said this end did not turn out so well as the other. I said an iron would take it out, and make it as stiff as the other part. She said if it did she would have it. An iron was put to the fire, the iron immediately upon our applying it, drew three spots of grease from the iron-cloth, and there were two pinches in it which seemed as if screwed up about three quarters of a yard distance from one another.</p>

               <p>Wood. No, I have but half the sight of my right eye.</p>
               <p>Wood. Do you remember any enquiry being made of you about Mrs. Hutchins?</p>
               <p>Wood. Two men came to me to make some enquiry; they asked who kept the farm just beyond me. I told them a widow gentlewoman; they asked me if there was a lodger there, they mentioned somebody, I forgot the name. I believe it was fictitious. I said she let out no lodgings, she was a gentlewoman and lived upon her own farm; they asked me how many men she had. I said two that lay in the house. They asked me how many carters she had, and whether they were married or single men. I told them I could not tell. They asked me whether any of them laid in the barn or the stables. I said I did not know, they were out all hours to go to market. They asked me if any women laid in the barn or stables. I told them there was more or less, I could not tell how many worked for her. I told them I could not tell, nor do I know now when I said she had no lodgers. They said she was a handsome likely woman, and they had been with her and asked for the same name, and thought the man did lodge with them. I keep a public house; my girl carried beer there. I keep the chequers.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this before the robbery?</p>
               <p>Wood. As near as I can guess, two month; there was but one of them asked me any questions; the other stood still; at last he said, shall we go? he paid for his pint of beer; then he turned round in my face, and said, d - n me, you are as knowing as we are ourselves.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a man was that that asked the questions?</p>
               <p>Wood. A short thick well-set man; he that sat down was taller; it was he that asked me so many questions that said that. In half an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177112040044"/> hour's time I sent Mrs. Hutchins word by her caiter.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present at this time?</p>

               <p>Wood. Squire heard part of it, but not the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish by their pronunciation, whether they were Englishmen or not?</p>
               <p>Wood. I did not perceive but what they were Englishmen, they spoke good English, and I have been a serjeant in the first regiment above twenty years.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you certain of the day, that it was the 11th of June?</p>
               <p>Heith. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he stop at your father's?</p>
               <p>Heith. No, he left me at my father's door; her master's name is Foster, in Oxford-road, near Park-street; he is a brazier.</p>

               <p>Heith. It was about ten o'clock when he came in; I said, how came you out so late to-night? he said it was his birth-day, he had been to keep it at Hackney. When he was going to give the receipt for the 15 s. 9 d. he said it was the 11th of June; I thought it was not; he said, sure I must know, when I have told you it is my birthday; I went and looked in the almanack behind the door, and it was so. I am sure I heard the clock strike eleven before the prisoner and I went out of the house.</p>

            . The very day that the charge is, was my brother's birth-day; it was about three or four in the afternoon we went together to the Mermaid at Hackney, because it was his birthday; there we drank tea; then I walked with him till nine o'clock; then he said he would go home; we came to Bethnall-green to Lord Camden's-head; he said, Go in there, I will go to a certain house in the neighbourhood and receive some money. I went into the Lord Camden's-head, and drank a gill of wine; and then my brother came to me. I was there a strong hour, that is, a full hour. My brother then told me he went home with a lady; and then we went together to town; we went to Abel's buildings. Sir John's men took away my pocket-book, where my receipts are, that will shew my business, and with whom I dealt; I can't name them, but my receipts will shew.

               <p>Q. Do you follow any business?</p>
               <p>Kelley. Yes, I deal in fruit; he had a first floor backwards, at 10 s. a month.</p>

               <p>Kelley. No; there is a door comes into the house; the street door comes into the entry; there is a door in the entry into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to remark this 11th of June?</p>
               <p>Kelley. I have a man-servant that sells fruit for me; he came three or four days after, and said a barbarous murder had been committed by some Jews. I asked him if he remembered whether Solomon was at home that night (I took notice of it because he was a Jew); he said, yes, he lay with him that night.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he taken up?</p>

I am the wife of the last witness; the prisoner took a lodging of us; the things were missing; the wife had a pair of sheets to change the bed; they quarrelled and fought; he used then to beat her. I went up, and she pulled the bed-down; I saw there was no sheets on the bed. I got a neighbour to help to get the things out of the room, for I would not let them be there any longer. On the morrow, when they got up, I asked the prisoner's wife for the sheets she had to change the bed, and I put a pair to the fire; I desired her to bring down the dirty sheets; she came down and brought a candle, and set it on the stairs, and went out; she took the sheets from the back of the chair out with her, and pawned them. The constable was sent for: he would not acknowledge any thing about them then; but as they were going to the justice, he acknowledged they were pawned. He followed no good, for he was always a-bed in day-time, and out at night.</p>

            . The morning after the trunk had been cut from behind the Dover coach, I went with the last witness to Gravel-lane, Houndsditch, where I found the prisoner a-bed in his son's house. I told him he must get up, for I wanted to search him; and I found these stockings in his pocket. I asked him where he got them; he said, he bought them on board a ship: after that he said he brought them from Holland. We had heard several things against him and his son.</p>

            . On the second of November last, the two prisoners came to my house. I keep a shoe and hat-warehouse; Backeruc came into my shop, Usher stood at the door; he asked me if my brother was at home. I asked him which brother; he said, your brother the Hatter. I said he did not live with me; with that he went out of the shop, and said something to Usher. Usher said, he should; upon which he returned into the shop, and said, I have a parcel of hats for you. I asked him what they were; he had one on his head; he pulled it off, and said, they were not all like that; some were larger, but all new. I asked him what he asked a-piece, he said 15 d. a hat. I thought them not honestly come by, on which I did not care to have any thing to do with them. I told them my man was not at home, and I did not buy without my man; he said, O, you cannot see them till night, because they are all link. I said, what is that? Why, says he, they are not honestly come by. I said then I will wait on you in the evening. I thought it my duty as a member of society to apprehend him. I went to Mr. Meyers and told him of it. He said, I should endeavour to get the goods in my possession, and he would lay a train to endeavour to apprehend him. Accordingly I waited on the prisoner at night; he was not at home; his wife told me I should come again in the morning. I went again in the morning. I asked him to let me see the hats. I had known him from a child. He said, he would bring them to me at night. I went to Mr. Meyers, and he directed me how to act. When I was gone, about two or three in the afternoon Mr. Meyers sent for me, and told me he had been up to Sir

I took them up stairs; he said first there were six dozen; when we counted them there was but five dozen and one. As we counted them I told him 15 d. a hat was rather too much, as it was an hazardous thing; he said then, we will not stand for that, you shall have them all at even price, a shilling a hat. It was Bakaruc that I bargained with: he said, when shall I come? I said, about six o'clock; he said, very well; I believe I shall have something else when I come; I said, bring it with you. I took some hats to Mr. Meyers; he said I had done right; and bid me come up to him in the morning. I went with him to Sir

I placed them in such a manner that they might over-hear the conversation between the prisoner and me; I placed them on the stair-case; when we came in I said, come up, I will give you the money, and you shall give me a receipt; he said, what signifies asking for a receipt on this account? I said I would have a receipt; poh, poh, says he, what a black you are! I said I would be a black for once. When we came up stairs I said, have you brought that you promised me? he said, I could not get it then, but I should have it in a day or two; besides, said he, I did not know you would buy such things, else I could have brought you, about a fortnight ago, for 50 l. as much as was valued at 300 guineas. I said, I am very sorry you did not bring it; said he, I did not know you would buy; but now I know you will buy, I will bring you some; he said the Jews are so sharp now we don't know who to trust. I stampt with my feet, and the two men came in; we went out afterwards and took in his companion, we bound them, and put them in a coach, and carried them to Sir John; these are the hats ( producing them.) they have been in my custody ever since.</p>

They got over the pales, and burst the door, and took the hinges off. I lost the things in the indictment. They pick'd the lock of the bar-door, and took a bag of halfpence and farthings, about thirty shillings. The porridge-pot, chocolate-pot, &amp;c. were lost out of the kitchen.

            . On the 3d of May the watchman came to me, and told me there was a man in Bear and Ragged-staff yard had conveyed some goods into a stable, and had made his escape. I found these things in the stable: he said he was going to fetch another load of goods to deposit in that stable, because his landlord was going to seize them. He was with the watchman when I came up. I took the key out of his hand, and he said if we would go with him to Cock-alley, we should see where he brought them from. The watchman is not here.

I went up stairs, and the door was shut against us; I broke the door open, and Gulley went to strike me down with a pick-axe. We searched Hurdley's room, and in the drawers found this duplicate in a green purse (producing it). It is Mr. Hopley's duplicate, which directed us to Hopley's house.

            . I lay in the same bed with Gulley. I lodged three years there, he a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, on the former trial, he never lay out a night the whole twelvemonth?</p>
               <p>Sheppard. No, he never did; he was never out after ten o'clock; he used to sit in the room with Mrs. Harris and her husband till ten or eleven o'clock; he used to get up between four and five; he always awaked me when he went out.</p>
               <p>Q. How near does Hurdley live to where he lodged?</p>
               <p>Sheppard. The court joins to the house where I lodge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Hurdley use to be often at your house?</p>
               <p>Sheppard. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he lie at home the night he was taken up?</p>
               <p>Sheppard. He did not lodge there then for a constancy; my landlord and landlady always made him welcome; after he came from Ireland, he only missed one night, and he was taken up the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. So he did not lodge there for a constancy, and yet never missed but one night?</p>
               <p>Sheppard. Yes.</p>

I gave a shilling earnest; he first asked 20 l. for him, then he offered to sell him for eighteen guineas. I said to some gentlemen I believe he is stolen. I told the prisoner I was afraid that he did not come honestly by the horse; he told me it was his father's. He said he lived at Wing, and then at Littlecut.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found him vary in the place where his father lived, did not your suspicion encrease?</p>
               <p>Spencer. No; I thought he might have brought him away in a clandestine manner from him; he said his father sent him with a horse to the White-hart at Barnet; when he came there, the landlord told him the gentleman that wanted it was provided for; so he brought it to sell on his own account. I kept him in custody, and sent for the constable. On Friday the prosecutor came, and I shewed him the horse; the prisoner was then in the Compter. The prosecutor said he was a bay horse; he described the very marks of the horse.</p>

               <p>I had the horse out of the Marsh-ground.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cutler. Do you know this boy?</p>
               <p>Cutler. Yes; he was born in the same parish as I was; he was a good servant-boy.</p>
