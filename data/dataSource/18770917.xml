                  </hi>. I am the wife of the Rev. Mr. Butterfield, of Great Brastead, Essex—before my marriage to that gentleman I had been named to a Mr. Richardson, and had by the first marriage a daughter lamed Harriett, if now alive she would be thirty-six years of age—on the 5th of April last, I saw her lying dead at 34, Forbes Road, Penge—in 875, my daughter Harriett was staying with my nephew Mr. Thomas Hincksman, at 55, Heygate Street, Walworth Road—his wife was a Mrs. Rhodes—she had been married before I believe, and by her first marriage as the mother of the two female prisoners—I believe the two male prisoners re brothers—in 1875, I learnt that Louis Staunton, was paying his addresses to my daughter—at that time she was possessed of about 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—did not think she was in a fit state to marry, and tried to procure her a ward in Chancery, and herself declared unfit to manage her own affairs, but was unsuccessful and my daughter was married to the prisoner Louis Staunton, on the 16th June, 1875, at Clapham—I was not present at the marriage—about three weeks after, I paid her a visit at 8, Loughborough "mark; my daughter opened the door and asked me in—I asked if her husband was at home—she said "Yes," and called "Louis, mamma is here" he came and we went into the dining-room—I did not see my daughter one, her husband was present—I asked my daughter if she was happy—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170004"/>
               <p>she said "Pretty well, mamma middling"—I asked her husband why he did not keep a servant, and be told me he had advertised for one—I afterwards went upstairs with my daughter at his suggestion to see the house; when I came down I made some remark about the rooms not being all furnished, and then said "I must be going"—he told his wife to put on her hat and sea me off to the station, he came with us—I do not think I was in the house more than ten minutes—when I got to the station the train was coming up—I shook hands with both and wished them good-bye, when the train moved off Mr. Staunton took his hat off and I kissed my hand to my daughter; I never saw her alive again—there had been no quarrel or words of any kind—the next day or the day after I received a letter from Louis Staunton, enclosing one from my daughter—I have not been able to find those letters, though I have looked everywhere—I think I must have destroyed them—as near as I can remember she told me in that letter that her husband objected to my calling upon her, and she thought I had better not come as it would cause a disturbance between them—the letter from him was to tell me not to come again—it was a very rude insulting letter, telling me he would not have me go to the house again—I did not visit again, in consequence of those letters—I heard sometime in the following year that my daughter had had a boy—sometime in the following year I heard a statement about Alice Rhodes, and in consequence of that began to make inquiries about my daughter—in February of this year I saw Alice Rhodes, at the London Bridge Railway Station—I asked her where my daughter Harriet was—she said she did not know—I said "You must know where she is, you do know where she is," or something to that effect—she then said "Upon my word I do not know"—she afterwards said she was at Brighton with her husband and child—I asked her to give me her address; I noticed she had on a favourite brooch that had been given to my daughter twenty years ago—it was not of much value, but my daughter was fond of it—I said "You have got my daughter's brooch Alice"—she said "Yes, you can take it if you like, but she gave it me"—I said "I will not take it if she gave it you, but I really do not understand her giving it to you as it was her favourite brooch"—I asked her if my daughter was well—she said no, my daughter had been very ill, but was better now—I said "Will you give me the address of her medical man"—she said "Oh, I do not remember, but if you will give me your address I will send it to you," and I gave her my daughter's address where I was stopping then; I never heard from her—I continued to make inquiries after my daughter, and in consequence of some information given me by a charwoman in the Walworth Road, I went to Cudham, near Knockholt, a station on the South Eastern line—on my way there I met Mr. Patrick Staunton, near the ticket place at the South Eastern Railway Station—I saw him come from the train and told him I was going down to Cudham—I asked him where my daughter was, he said he did not know anything about her, and what was I going to Cudham for—I told him I should go and see the clergyman—he said "If you come to my house I will blow your brains out"—he also said "Damn your daughter, I know nothing about her," and went away—when I got to Halstead Station I inquired and found that Louis Staunton was living in the neighbourhood—I took a cab and drove to his house—Little Gray's Farm was the name of it—I got there about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, on the 5th March, 1877—I think it was five miles from the station—when I knocked at the door Mrs. Patrick Staunton answered it—I</p>

               <p>asked to see Mrs. Staunton, my daughter—then Mr. Louis Staunton came along—he was in a great passion, and swore at me, and said I should not see her; he would not allow me to see her—I said "If you will only let me hear her voice or see her hand on the bannisters, I shall then go away content that she is in her proper place, with her husband"—he was going to strike me with a knife, and Mrs. Patrick Staunton said "No, don't hit her"—that was in a little room on the right hand side, going in from the door, where they appeared to have been dining—he called me a dirty old bitch, and other names—then I begged of Mrs. Staunton to let me see my daughter, and told her "Some day you will want to see your children and you will be denied"—she said "Your daughter is well cared for"—I am not quite sure whether it was Mrs. Staunton who opened the front door, but they bustled me out as soon as they could; pushed me out—Louis and Mrs. P. Staunton were the only persons present; the cabman was standing outside the door—when I got into the fly he pointed out to me a Dr. Creasy who was coming by—I made some enquiry of Dr. Creasy, and then came home—shortly afterwards I made an application to the Magistrate at Marlborough Street police-court—I afterwards went down to Sevenoaks, and on 9th April I went to Bromley, before the Magistrates in Court there, but I was unable to get any information about my daughter—on Sunday, the 15th, I received this telegram from a Mrs. Urridge, in consequence of which I went at once to 34, Forbes Road, Penge—(I had been several times to Mrs. Urridge, she was the landlady of Little Gray's Farm)—I there saw my daughter lying dead—when I last saw my daughter at the end of June, 1875, she was in very good health; she was always in good health; she had very good general health—she was always well dressed, very fond of dress, and knew how to dress—she was a very clean girl indeed; very particular in her person—she was a temperate person, not at all given to drink—I won't say she did not take a glass of ale at her dinner, she was. not in the habit of drinking to excess—this photograph (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which was taken of her about nine months before her marriage, fairly represents her at that time—when I saw her on the Sunday she was in her coffin—I noticed a great change in her, apart from the change from life to death—we always treated her more like a child, because she was so simple—there was no change whatever in her habits as to cleanliness up to time I last saw her; she was looking old, very much older than she really was, and looking very dirty and very miserable; greatly changed; in fact I scarcely knew her—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in my daughter's handwriting; this is her ordinary mode of spelling—she had the opportunity of being educated, but she was not able to avail herself of it—these three other letters were received; this one is from Mr. Staunton, I think—I remember these three letters being received; this one is from Mrs. Patrick Staunton—this is my laughter's letter. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Friday. My own darling,—I write these few lines hoping this will find you well. Will you be down on Sunday? if not, shall be disappointed.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. M. WILLIAMS</hi>. I was very much averse to the marriage from the first—the proceedings in lunacy with regard to my late daughter, were taken I believe at the end of 1874—I thought it was my petition but I understand it was my sou's, I was not aware of it at the time—I have since ascertained that it was my son's petition in his name for me; I remember that I made an abstract of the proceedings—I did not know that my daughter Harriett had made a voluntary settlement on my son of her money, till Mr. Straight read it in Court—I knew nothing of it before and 1 have not heard of it since—Mr. Straight read it and spoke to me about it. Mr. Straight <hi rend="italic">here stated that he did not read it.</hi>) I never heard from my daughter before her marriage that she wished to register that settlement, she never spoke to me on the subject of any settlement at all—she had been living with me prior to her marriage, but the last six months prior to her marriage she was living first in Heygate Street with her aunt Ellis, with whom she stayed till her aunt Ellis died, and then she went to live with Mrs. Hincksman—the house belonged to my sister Mrs. Ellis—Mrs. Hincksman is not my sister; she stayed with Mrs. Ellis four or five months—she ceased to live with me seven or eight months before her marriage, I am speaking to the best of my recollection, I do not think it could have been more—I remember that I made an affidavit in the lunacy petition—I do not remember what it stated; I do not remember stating that my daughter had occasional fits of violence—I have never stated to my knowledge that my daughter Harriett had always been of weak intellect and had a running of saliva from her mouth—I objected to that when the lawyer put it to me when the affidavit was read—I never remember her having saliva running from her month—I was net aware until you told me that I had sworn it, or I would not. have done so if I had known it—she was quick tempered, but quiet and harmless—I said in the affidavit" Believing her to be of unsound mind and unable to enter into any contract, I advised her not to marry; but when I endeavoured to reason with her on the subject she became very violent, and has always been excited when I have spoken to her on the subject, and has even threatened to kill me"—that is true; she did once threaten me—I verily believe she was of unsound mine and—incapable of managing her property—I know that my son Archibald has also made an affidavit, but I have never seen it—he is in Australia, at least he was some months ago—I don't know where he is at the present moment—she showed signs of violent temper to me when I spoke to her of marriage—I persuaded her not to marry; Drs. Tuke and Williams saw her, they reported her to be of sound mind—I say that she was hysterical—I did not say that on one occasion of an altercation I had with her she took out' a knife to me, I said a chair—that was a mistake of somebody's—if I said a knife before the Magistrate I must have confused it, I meant a chair—she took it up in a threatening way—the last communication I had with her after her marriage, after I last saw her, was the letter that has been produced—I only saw her on that one occasion after her marriage—the interview lasted about ten minutes; I had come from Essex—the meeting was quiet a pleasant and harmonious one—when I saw her previously was before her marriage—I saw her once afterwards, about three weeks—it must have been twelve mouths since 1 saw her previously—Mr. Staunton was present all the time of my last visit—my daughter answered the door—it was Mr. Staunton who spoke to me about a servant—we went into the dining" room, but Mr. Staunton was in a little conservatory close by—I con<lb/>sidered</p>

               <p>it was not right to have no servant—I did not speak angrily—I was only doing my duty as a mother—she had scalded her hand—when he told me he had advertised for a servant, I said no more—I then went upstairs—I said the bed-room wanted a bedstead, as there did not appear to be a room for the servant to sleep in—I said so to both; my daughter accompanied me over the house—it is a small house; I do not know that Alice Rbodes was with my daughter at her confinement—the brooch referred to is of very little value, but my daughter prized it.</p>

I made Mrs. Patrick Staunton's acquaintance before she was married, some years ago; before I knew of the' attachment of Louis Staunton to my daughter—I do not know how many children Mrs. Patrick had—I knew at the time she had been lodging at Loughborough Road she had children—I do not know how many—I do not say I had not seen my daughter for nearly twelve months prior to her marriage—I saw her in Chancery Lane in 1874—the marriage was on 16th June, 1875; before that she went to Mrs. Ellis' and remained till her death, and then she went to Mrs. Hincksman—the period of those visits extended over six months, perhaps more—she never wrote to me while staying with her aunt Ellis and Mrs. Hincksman; she could not write—she seldom or ever wrote—she was not a good hand at letter writing; she was a bad speller—she was always violent to me if I spoke of marriage—I did not want her to be married, she was not fit—I know nothing of her threatening my son Archibald, or of the pecuniary relationship between him and her it the time I took the proceedings in lunacy—she had not communicated with me about his being possessed of her money; I do not believe he knew my thing about it; he was not trustee—I do not know that he had the administration of her 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the time of her marriage—I have never heard about it till I was cross-examined before—I never wrote a letter to my daughter after I paid the visit to her in the Loughborough. Road—I received a letter from her requesting me not to call, also one from Louis Staunton complaining of my conduct—I took active steps to discover her whereabouts after I heard of her confinement—that would be in March, 1876—Little Gray's Farm lies back from the road—there is only a small lawn in front, and then the roadway—I noticed part of a shoulder of mutton the table; it appeared as if some persons had partaken of a meal—it was small house—I do not remember saying, when in the house, that I believed my daughter was in a lunatic asylum—I do not remember Mrs. Patrick Staunton saying that that was a wicked thing of me to say, and at she had had dinner with my daughter that day (5th March), and that e was quite well—I will swear that I did not say to Mrs. Patrick Staunton "That is a lie," or "You are a liar"—I was in considerable anxiety and distress about my daughter—I cannot remember saying before the Magis<lb/>trate at Bromley that I begged Mrs. Patrick Staunton to let me see my daughter, or that I said anything about "One day you may want to see one of your children"—I recollect it was said, but not before the Magistrate—ten Patrick Staunton exhibited some anger towards me Mrs. Patrick said don't strike her."</p>

I am a ticket collector at the Penge Bail way Station—I recollect the 8.36 train coming in from Bromley on the evening of Thursday, 12th April—I saw the passengers arrive by it—the four prisoners are those I saw—they had an invalid lady with them—Patrick Staunton lifted her out of the train—I noticed her condition and fetched a. chair to enable her to sit down—I could see she could not stand, but they were holding her up—I did not go near enough to speak to her—I. cannot say whether she was conscious—the lady was carried to a cab by the two gentlemen—it was Hepplethwaite's cab—the porter fetched him—one gentleman got into the cab and took her hand and the other put her in—the cab was ordered to 34, Forbes Road—when Louis Staunton went to give me the ticket she put out her arms—Mrs. Patrick Staunton put the shawl over her arm and said "You shall have your supper directly."</p>

                  </hi>. I was station-master at Penge on the 12th April this year—on the evening of that day I saw the' prisoners moving from the direction of a first-class carriage of the train arriving at 8.36—I afterwards saw a lady supported by two gentlemen on the platform, and ordered the ticket collector, who has just been a witness, to bring a chair, and the lady was placed in the chair—I should say she was not able to support herself; she was shaking violently—I did not notice her face or hear her speak or make any sound at all—one of the gentlemen said they wanted a cab, and I sent for one—the cab was about ten minutes before it arrived; we had to send up into the villiage for one—there are generally cabs at the station, but there were none then—when the cab arrived I advised them to carry her on the chair, as I was sure she was not in a. fit state to walk—they were lifting her by each arm—they acted upon my</p>

               <p>advice, and carried her in the chair to the door of the cab—when they got to the door I advised one of the prisoners to get into the cab and lift her up, and one of my porters lifted the chair up rather higher than the level of the floor of the cab, so that the lady could easily be got from the seat of the chair into the cab—the chair was put as close to the opening of the door as it was possible to get it, and in this way she was got into the cab—the cab then drove away—the female prisoners had left before the cab arrived—I cannot say if they said where they were going, but they made some remark about going—I did not hear one word spoken by the lady from the time I saw her supported on the platform till she was got into the cab.</p>

I am the wife of David Chalklin—I had apartments to let at 34, Forbes Road, on the 12th April last, on which day, about noon, Mrs. Patrick and Mr. Louis Staunton came and said they wanted lodgings for an invalid lady; there was some difference about terms, but ultimately they agreed to give 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week—they said they wanted them for three weeks or a month, or probably more—Mr. Louis Staunton wrote down "Mrs. Staunton, Frith Cottage, Cudham"—I believe that document is lost—he said they had a doctor at Cudham who did not understand her case—Mrs. Patrick Staunton was present when he said that—Mrs. Patrick Staunton said they wished to get her near to London to get the advice of a doctor—he said "I have been given to understand that you have very good doctors in Penge," and asked whether I could recommend one, and I recommended Dr. Longrigg, who had attended my little girl—he said that</p>

               <p>the lady was inclined to be paralysed, and that her feet had begun to swell and I think they considered that her head would become affected—they said that it would be better to bring her at night that the doctor might see her in the morning—they said she was in good bodily health and that she could eat but she would not—Mrs. Staunton said they tried her with some bread and butter, egg and tea, that morning, and with a great deal of persuasion, they got her to eat a little—it was stated that they were to come at 9.30 in the evening—I was directed to have afire in the bed-room, but they would not require one in the sitting-room, because it would be so late when they came—the sitting-room and bed room were on the first floor—I told them where to go to Dr. Longrigg's—I did not write it down—they said they would call on him—when they left they went in that direction—in the evening the two female prisoners came; I did not let them in, I saw them in afterwards—my little girl let them in—I saw them directly after they came in, they were in the sitting-room—they said the invalid lady had come, and that she was very ill indeed during the journey they thought she would have died, and they could not account at all for her being so ill—I found the invalid lady in bed; she had been brought in without my seeing her—I did not see much of her, she was covered up entirely to her face—she did not speak in my presence—she made a kind of gurgling noise and moaned a great deal—I remarked to the prisoners that I was surprised to see her in bed, I had no idea they had brought her—I said "How shocking it is to see anyone lying here so ill"—neither of them spoke to me on the subject, there was no remark made—I said I expected to see an elderly person, and Mrs. Patrick Staunton said her age was thirty-six, and she was the wife of a gentleman who was there in the morning, and that she had no children—she said that Miss Rhodes was married, but her husband was away, and that she had come to nurse the invalid lady—Miss Rhodes had on a wedding ring and keeper—Mrs. Patrick Stannton said that the two male prisoners had gone to the doctor—I inquired if they wanted anything, and they said they had brought all provisions with them except some bread, and they asked whether I could lend them some—I then went downstairs—some time afterwards I was called up by Mr. Louis Staunton—I did not let him in, I think they did—he said that he had been to the doctor's, but he was not at home—he said the servant told him Mr. Longrigg was out and would not be at home till late, and that he asked her what she called late, and she said 1 o'clock in the morning—he said there seemed to be nobody that would take a message—I recommended him another doctor, Dr. Turner, but he said "There is no necessity for it; I do not like to behave like that to Mr. Longrigg without speaking to him"—I did not go into the bed room again' that night; at the time I left all the four prisoners were in the sitting-room—shortly after that Alice Rhodes came to the top of the stairs and asked me to boil some eggs, jiving me two eggs—she said that Mrs. Staunton had woke up and wanted some supper, and she said "I am sure she must require some supper after her long journey"—I boiled the eggs and took them up into the sitting-room—I found Alice Rhodes there alone—I brought up some plates and knives—shortly afterwards Mrs. Patrick Staunton called me up and asked one to boil another egg—Alice Rhodes was alone in the sitting-room putting he tablecloth on for supper—Mrs. Patrick Staunton gave me the other egg herself to boil, which I did, and brought it up myself—they only brought a high basket with them—I took up some bread when I took up the plates—</p>

               <p>I did not see Patrick that night—she said Mr. Staunton and her husband had gone to the doctor—they brought their own table and bed linen—I supplied the plates and knives and forks—the next morning about 8.15 the bell was rung and I went into the sitting-room where Mrs. Pk. Staunton and Alice Rhodes were sitting by the window—they said they had been waiting for the doctor—I received an egg to boil—I did not know who it was for at the time—after breakfast Mrs. Pk. Staunton asked me to have a fire alight before the doctor came; I lit the fire—they had the folding doors open and were watching me all the time—I looked at the invalid lady and thought she was asleep—she was lying perfectly still—I cleared some remains of the egg from the dressing-table—there was some egg spread on bread and butter and a cup three parts full of tea—the remainder of the egg was in the sitting-room—when Mrs. Pk. Staunton asked me to send for the doctor I asked her when, and she said "Presently will do"—Alice Rhodes afterwards called out "Cannot you let the little girl go for the doctor at once," and I said "Yes, the little girl shall go"—I made a remark would not it be better for one of them to go themselves—it was at breakfast time that they said the lady was very ill indeed—Alice Rhodes went to get her jacket, and came in with it in her hand, while I was there about 9 o'clock—she appeared very anxious—she went for the doctor at once in the direction of Dr. Longrigg's—I went down the steps to show her—while she was gone Mrs. Pk. Staunton said the invalid lady came to her house on Saturday to see her, and they dined together and had steak and potatoes; that she appeared apparently in good health and said what a nice steak it was, and she stayed the remainder of the day till the evening, and Mr. Pk. Staunton went home with her and they had supper at the invalid lady's house, and she was taken poorly after supper, and that she did not see her on the Sunday, because she, Mrs. Pk. Staunton, went out to spend the day on Sunday, and did not see her—that would be the Sunday before, but on the Monday morning she went to see her she said, and she noticed how ill she was, and she said "How ill you look my dear," and she said "Yes I am," but she seemed better on the Tuesday, and on Wednesday and Thursday she was very poorly—she. said the invalid lady lived close to her—I heard the doctor come in at about 10.30, and he stayed about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—directly Mrs. Pk. Staunton let the doctor out I went up to ask her what he had said, and she said the doctor said that it was an epileptic fit she had had—Alice Rhodes had gone to the chemist's to get the prescription made up—Mrs. Patrick said what a nice man the doctor was and very clever, and he seemed to understand the case, and that she would probably be ill three weeks, and she was to be kept very quiet and have plenty of nourishment—she did not say whether the doctor said she would be likely to get well—she said she asked the doctor to send a nurse as she wished to go home to her own children and she could not stay herself, and it would be too much for one—she said the doctor was coming back in half an hour—Alice Rhodes and the nurse then came, the little girl let them in—I asked Mrs. Pk. Staunton when she thought she had had the fit and she said "Goodness gracious knows, I don't know"—I asked her whether it was on the Sunday when she was so ill, and that was the remark she made to me—I took a jug of hot water up about 1 o'clock; she rang the bell for it and I had to heat it and she called for it in a great hurry—the doctor had been a second time, between 12 and 1 o'clock—from 2.30 to 2.45 I was talking to the baker at the door—</p>

               <p>while I was doing so Mr. Lee, the undertaker, came to the door—it was nearer 2.45 than 2.30—I did not know that Mrs. Staunton was dead and sent him away, thinking it might be No. 24 instead of 34—ten minutes afterwards I saw Mrs. Pk. Staunton at the sitting-room door and spoke to her about the lady—I asked her how she was and the remark she madewas "She is gone"—I went upstairs shortly afterwards and asked her if I should go for the undertaker and she said "There is no occasion, thank you, he is here"—about 4.45 I heard a rap at the front door and it was Mrs. Pk. Staunton—I was surprised, because I thought they were all at home—when I opened the door she said would I be kind enough to ask her husband when he came home to come to Bromley and he would understand what I meant—I asked her whether Louis Staunton was in time to see his wife and she said he was in the bed-room with her when she died, and that she and her sister were at the station at the time of the death, and she did not know where the nurse was at all—I had not seen Alice Rhodes; the little girl let her in with the nurse—Mrs. Pk. Staunton said. I could please myself about telling her husband of the death—I asked her if I was alone in the house and she said "Yes, my sister has gone some time and the nurse will come in the evening, and I will see you again"—she then went away—Patrick Staunton came at 5.45 and I told him of the death and gave him the message—he said he knew she was very ill when he was there in the morn<lb/>ing—he stood talking a few minutes and then went away—when I came in after talking to him I found the sitting-room and bed-room door locked—the curse came with the undertaker on Saturday night; she unlocked the door—I saw none of the prisoners on the Saturday—I recollect Mrs. Butterfield coming on the Sunday when the door of the room was locked and. Mrs. Gooding had the key, which I did not know till the middle of Saturday—My husband went for the nurse and she opened the door and allowed Mrs. Butterfield to see her daughter—on the Sunday night the police came with the doctor—I had not seen Mr. Patrick since Friday night.</p>

Staunton—they seemed surprised at her being taken so ill—when Mrs. Pk. Staunton told me that the invalid lady was the wife of Louis Staunton she volunteered that information to me, as also that Alice Rhodes was Mrs. Pk.

Staunton said I had better not ask the landlady for she did not think she had any, as the room was poorly furnished—there was no blind to the window—I asked her what I was to do, if I should borrow sheets, and she said she would be very much obliged to me if I would—I went to where I had been nursing, borrowed the sheets, and took them back—when I went to wash the body I found it in such a filthy state I could not wash it—I had never seen anything so dirty before—the head was alive with lice, and the dirt on the body was something like the bark of a tree, as though it had been on for a long time and not washed at all—she had on a white gown and chemise—I tore them off and put her a clean night dress on—before she died Dr. Longrigg came into the bed-room and said to me she was dying—he then went into the front room to the Stauntons—I did not hear what passed then—after I had laid her out, as I was going to borrow the sheets, Mr. Staunton named to me about the undertaker—I mentioned Mr. Lee—Mr. Staunton told me 1 was to give an order for a black coffin, a hearse, and a coach, and that the funeral was to take place on Monday—when I went to borrow the sheets I left word at the Park Tavern for the undertaker to come—about an hour and a half after I had finished laying out the body Mr. Louis and Mrs. Pk. Staunton said to me they were going away as they lived so far off—Mrs. Staunton asked me to keep the key of the room, they expected friends to see her, and it would be handier for them to come to me for the key—I asked Dr. Longrigg if I should come to him for the certificate on Saturday morning and he said "Yes"—in consequence of my conversation with Dr. Longrigg I registered the death on Saturday morning—on Saturday night I had just come out of the house for Mr. Lee when the police and Dr. Longrigg came up with another gentleman and called for the body—the body had been left alone during the Friday, and down to Saturday night no one went in; the room was locked up and I had the key at the Park Tavern.</p>

Staunton, Little Gray's Farm, Cudham," in case I should want to write to him to let him know the time the funeral would take place—he said he wanted the funeral respectable, but not too expensive—I was not told what relation the lady was—I understood that the followers would be him and his mother, or the lady's mother, I am not quite certain—I afterwards left and the coffin was taken in on Saturday, for which purpose the nurse opened the room for me; she unlocked the room and I took in the coffin; I did not fasten it down—I have been undertaker in the neighbourhood of Penge about fourteen years—Penge is in two counties, Kent and Surrey—part of Forbes Road is in one county and part in the other; No. 34 is in the county of Kent, in the parish of Beckenham, and the place of registration would be Bromley—the place of registration for the other part of Forbes Road would be Croydon—the funeral did not take place on Monday, there was an inquiry, and it was postponed for some time—Mr. Staunton, the same gentleman I had seen, paid me 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6.</p>

I am a general practitioner at Penge—I am not a physician—about 11 o'clock on the morning of 12th April Mr. Louis and Mrs. Patrick Staunton called at my house—they said they had got an valid lady living down in the country and they wished to bring her up and put her under my charge; I think it was Mrs. Patrick who said that—I asked the nature of her case and they said the lady was of weak intellect—the statements to me were generally made by Mrs. Patrick, she was chief spokeswoman, but Louis was present and assented, and sometimes made statements of his own; each spoke in the presence and hearing of the other</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170018"/>
               <p>—I cannot recollect minutely what Mrs. Patrick said or what Mr. Louis said, hut I can give the substance of the conversation—I asked if the patient was paralysed and they said "Yes," she had lost the use of the loft side—I asked if she was cleanly in her habits—they said she was—I asked that because in cases of paralysis the patient is often very dirty—they said she was extremely thin, but hearty—after I learnt that she was paralysed I asked if she had had a fit and they said "Not to my knowledge"—I asked who had been attending her—they told me they would bring her up that day from Cudham—he said that a medical man bad been in attendance who lived 7 or 8 miles from the place and could not give the deceased the attention that be would like her to have—I asked the medical man's name—they were very reluctant to answer me, but at last said Dr. Creasy, of Brastead—I asked if it was Dr. Creasy, of Gravesend, as I knew him—they said "No," it was Dr. Creasy, of Brastead—I asked no further questions—I knew that the invalid lady lived at Cudham, but did not know what part of Kent it was in; I thought, perhaps, it might be near Gravesend—the had been ill for some time, I don't know how long—I entered the name "Staunton" in a visiting list and arranged to pay the invalid a visit the following morning—on the Thursday evening I went out to visit some friends and did not get home till 3 o'clock the next morning when I found a note from my assistant from which I understood that I was desired to go that evening to see the lady who had been brought up from Cudham and was much worse—I did not go then, for I thought as they had been twice she must be very bad, and that they certainly would have sent for some other medical man by that time—the time stated in the note was 10.30—the following morning (Friday) Alice Rhodes came to me, about 9 o'clock, before 1 was up—I got up, dressed, and accompanied her to Forbes Road—she told me they had been expecting me all night; the lady was worse—when I got there Mrs. Pk. Staunton let me in at the door—I went first into the parlour, then into the bed-room where the invalid was—that was a little before 10 o'clock—Mrs. Patrick and Alice Rhodes were in the room with me; no one else—I examined the patient—her pulse was very quick and weak, about 110—her arms were rigid; she was perfectly insensible—the pupil of the right eye was slightly dilated, that of the left contracted to a pin's point—the breathing was stertorous and laboured—the features indicated distress—the balls of the eyes were very much shrunken, their colour was a slight bronze—I noticed the lady was very much emaciated and in a dirty condition—I observed pediculi or lice in her hair—her hands were dirty, particularly her finger-nails—I tried to rouse her, but she did not move, or take the slightest notice—I came to the conclusion that it was an apoplectic seizure, and told her friends Mrs. Pk. Staunton and Alice Rhodes, that she was extremely ill and would not get over it; would not recover—they made no remark—Mrs. Patrick said that she had been like that all night with the stertorous breathing, and asked me to recommend a nurse; I sent one in—I wrote out a prescription for the patient to be made up at my own surgery, and said that I would call again—I did not say that she had had an epileptic fit—I might have said she was in an apoplectic fit—I believe I did say so—I may have said there was no accounting for how such things happened—I never in any way conveyed to them that she might be better in three weeks—I knew in my own mind that she was dying and told them so the second visit; I said she should be kept quiet, and prescribed beef tea and milk for her—I had been given to understand that Mrs. Pk. Staunton was</p>

               <p>the sister-in-law of Louis Staunton—about 12 o'clock on that day Mr. Louis Staunton came for me, to say his wife was much worse—I said I would follow him shortly—it was about 12.30 when I got there—the nurse was in the bed-room with the patient, who was dying rapidly—Mrs. Pk. Staunton and Louis Staunton were in the sitting-room; I told them she was dying; they made no remark—I told them I would call again—later on I did call and found that the lady was dead—I saw Mrs. Pk. Staunton and Louis Staunton on this occasion and sympathised with them—on the following day I gave a certificate stating her age, thirty-six, and the cause of death" cerebral disease and apoplexy," that I saw her last on the 13th of April, 1877. the day she died—I had been told she was of weak intellect, and that she had had a fit—I concluded if she had had another fit it would be an apopletic seizure—I did not examine her to ascertain whether she was paralysed, she was so near death the case was so hopeless; I did not go into it at all—I gave the certificate to the nurse and heard nothing more about the matter till the next day when Mr. Cassabianca called upon me—I knew the deceased was Louis Staunton's wife, he told me so when he called, the day before her death—in consequence of a communication that was made to me on the Saturday, I withdrew the certificate and communicated with the coroner—I wrote to him on the 16th April, and he sent me a warrant to make a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, which was made on the 19th of April, at Forbes Road—there were present myself and my partner Mr. Pigott, and Dr. Bright, who came on behalf of the relations of the deceased lady, Dr. Wilkinson, a surgeon to the police, Mr. Lister, a friend of mine who came to me to do some dissection, during the progress of the examination—Mr. Harman, a medical man at Brixton, came on behalf of the prisoners—I made a minute examination of the body—it appeared to be that of a woman forty or fifty years of age nearer fifty, I should say—I made some notes of ray examination—the body was fearfully emaciatad and filthily dirty all over, particularly the feet—the skin of the feet was caked with dirt—the skin was quite hard, horny, the feet were slightly swollen—the horny condition of the feet would be produced by walking without shoes for sometime—there were lice all over the body, principally in the hair of the pelvis, about the vagina and the armpits, and on the head, wherever there was hair on the body—I noticed the bites of these lice on the body, particularly on the abdomen—they are called poverty lice, they breed faster where there is filth and where the body is in a weak, low condition than upon a healthy subject—the hands and nails were very dirty—the interior part of the things were smeared with foeces—there were no signs of marks of violence on the body—the black marks in the posterior part of the back had not existed during life, but were purely <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—the weight of the body was 5 stone 4 lbs.; the height 5 feet 5 1/4 inches, I think—the ordinary weight of that size would be from 9 to 10 stone—the tongue was furred, creamy, like little pieces of egg which had not been swallowed—we found about 4 or 5 ounces of food in the stomach, milk and tea com<lb/>bined with some small pieces of solid food, bacon, undigested—the eyes were shrunken and closed—the white of the eye was perfectly normal, quite clear—we found on the head both real hair and false, not much real—it was very much matted—we were obliged to pull the hair pins out with the forceps and cut or pull the hair off, both real and false, in order to get to the scalp—I should say her hair had not been attended to for a con<lb/>siderable time—the breasts were very small, hardly anything but just the</p>

               <p>nipples—she did not appear to have suckled her child—we removed a portion of the skull and examined the brain—there were old adhesions between the external and internal lining membranes of the brain, and there was a slight deposit there of tubercular matter—the brain itself was remarkably healthy and firm—there was every sign that the woman had been in good health—there was no disease of the brain, but there was this slight tubercular deposit—what I considered the abnormal condition of the brain was the old adhesion and the tubercular deposit—I have often seen old adhesions in the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> room—as to its cause there might have been a tendency to it in childhood—the tubercular deposit, in my opinion, may have arisen from want of nourishment—I did not find any serum in the ventricles—the substance of the brain itself was perfectly healthy, but the external and internal blood vessels of the brain were both in an apoplectic state, gorged—I can give a theory as to what caused that gorging of the blood vessels; supposing the patient had been without food some time and a meal were suddenly given to her, that would produce it; it would produce apoplexy—we opened the stomach and the chest, and in the chest we found a tubercular deposit on the apex of the left lung, a deposit of about two inches square—that indicated the commencement of consumption, but that deposit on the lungs had nothing to do with the death—I examined the heart, it was very small, but very healthy—the sac which contains the heart did not adhere to the heart at all—the liver was remarkably small, but very healthy indeed—if this body had been kept without a proper supply of food, and became emaciated in consequence, the heart, liver, and other organs would diminish in size—the heart weighed 7 3/4 ounces, and the average weight of the heart of a female of the height of the deceased would, I should say, be about 9 ounces—the liver was very small, but heathy, and weighed a little over 30 ounces—I cannot give the exact weight, the decimals, but I think the liver weighed 2 pounds 2 1/4 ounces—from 50 to 60 ounces would be about the average weight of the liver of a woman such as the deceased—the gall bladder was full and heathly—the spleen weighed 4 3/4 ounces; about 7 ounces would be the average weight of the spleen in a woman such as deceased—the spleen was very healthy—the kidneys were healthy but very small, the right weighed 3 1/4 ounces, and the left 4 ounces—the average weight would be 9 ounces the two kidneys—the uterus was normal in measurement, but a little congested—there was a greenish, yellowish discharge from the vagina, and the left labia was excoriated—the 0 lower inches of the rectum were highly congested—that might have been occasioned by inflammation—there was not a particle of fat in the body—the congestion gave me the idea that poison might have been administered or taken into the body, irritant or narcotic poison—the condition of the eyes led me to believe that some narcotic poison might hare been taken—the contents of the stomach were analysed by Professor Rodgers, and from him I afterwards learnt that he had not discovered any poison—having learnt that fact, I gave it as my opinion that the cause of death was starvation—I so stated before the Coroner's jury, and before the analysis was completed; that opinion has not been altered by anything I have since heard, and that is my opinion now—the body was in a state of extreme emaciation—in my opinion it would take a considerable time to reduce it to such a state, perhaps three months, and for a considerable time it must have been apparent to those about her that the deceased was wasting away, there could be no mistake about that—there were no signs</p>

               <p>that the deceased had been of intemperate habits, on the contrary, that she was a woman of strictly temperate habits—there was such a want of muscular development that I should say she could not have walked about for come time before her death—in a case of death from want, there are appearances of congestion at all the outlets, there is general inflamma<lb/>tion of the outlets, and a high state of congestion—that might be produced by congestion or other causes, but it is one of the symptoms—in my opinion the deceased was not in a fit state to be removed from Cudham to Penge on 12th April; that she ought to have been kept quiet and not removed at all—I consider that the removal accelerated her death—the contents of the stomach and intestines were placed in a jar and given to Sergeant Bateman to take to Professor Rodgers.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKE</hi>. In the condition in which the deceased was, death would certainly be accelerated by her removal, and the rough mode in which she was moved would hasten death—in the condition in which She was when I first saw her she might have died if she had been left at Cudham and not removed; the removal of her from one room to another I do not think would materially have affected her, provided she was moved gently; it is a question of degree—my dispenser, Mr. Cox, was in charge when I went out in the evening of the 12th April—I had a conversation with Mrs. Patrick Staunton that day—I asked if the deceased was paralysed, she said she had lost the use of one side—I flexed the arm; it was rigid—you do not get rigidity in paralysis—Mrs. Patrick Staunton told me the deceased had not menstruated for six or seven months—that is a very difficult thing to tell—I considered the statement important at that time—I did not know that deceased had had a child—it did not strike me as of more importance when I had ascertained that fact—I knew it at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—I do not consider the fact of the deceaced not having menstruated for six months important—we were unable to decide by examination whether she had had a child or suckled one—our inability to decide was not attributable to the delay; the body was in a beautiful state of preservation at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—the external appearances were not altered, nor was the internal appearance of the brain affected—I asked if they had a medical man and they said "Yes"—I asked if they had one living near them and they said "No"—I cannot give the exact words—I did not ask how long he had been attending her, nor as to the treatment—she might have had medical treatment, I did not ask, not at that time—the distance from my house to where deceased was lodging is about 500 yards—I found a note when I reached home that night, saying the lady was worse, and requesting me to go as soon as I came home—I did not believe her to be suffering from apoplexy—I looked upon the prisoners as respectable persons and believed their statement—I believed her to be suffering from what I certified—I never gave it a thought as to what she was suffering from that night: I said in my own mind "This woman is worse and they have sent for another doctor"—Alice Rhodes came for me in the morning before I was dressed, and sent up two messages—I may have said to Mrs. Patrick Staunton at my first visit that the lady was in an apopleptic condition—I prescribed beef tea—I don't think I said that the only chance was to give her nourishing things; she had not a chance, so I could not have said so—I don't think I mentioned nourishing things—I prescribed beef tea and very likely I might have said she must be kept quiet; it is so long ago I cannot wear to it—I saw her twice, but I made no communication to the ladies</p>

               <p>there with regard to the state of her hair, her face, or her hands—I had no reason to believe that there were any lice except in her hair during life—I saw them on the head; they breed and spread over the body very rapidly—I do not think they spread over the body after death—I have been in practice ten years; five in my own name and five as a qualified assistant—I have seen and made many <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examinations, and have taken the ordinary hospital notes—I have not my notes here—I took the headings of the different viscera, and when I got home made out my notes in a small pocket-book, which contains private matters besides, I have searched for that book but cannot find it—the last time I saw it was in my consulting-room; it is a small book—I put down the weights and measurements of the different organs—the notes of the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination did not occupy very much of the book; perhaps two pages and a half—I do not think I have said before that they occupied much more than that—when 1 say "I cannot tell how many pages of notes there were, perhaps twelve pages," I understood that to refer to the whole of the book, and two and a half pages of them were my notes made at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination; they were the only notes I made—the book is lost and cannot be found—I have some notes with me—I made the first set of notes, which I have still in my possession, half an hour or an hour after the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I had not seen Dr. Bright's notes; I have my notes here; my dispenser has them in the bag—they are not an exact copy of the notes in the book that I lost; there is a great addition to them—the set of notes I made half an hour after the examination, are on the blue paper—they were made before I had seen Dr. Bright at all; the other set of notes, Dr. Bright's, were made on the Sunday—the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination was on the Thursday, I think—I read Dr. Bright's notes all over; be gave them to me—the notes endorsed "Dr. Longrigg's notes of the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination," were sent to Professor Rodgers—the second set of notes I made contain a narrative of the conversation that took place; I put it down, and then an account of the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> appearances in cases of death from, starvation; they are for my own observation; it was not written when the notes were written, it was a day afterwards—the two sets of notes are the only papers or notes I have of the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the chief part of the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> ex<lb/>amination, the dirty part of it, was done by my partner, Mr. Piggott—I dissected all the viscera and the brain—I think the height of the woman was 5 feet 5 inches; you will see it in the notes—when I speak of the average weight as between 9 and 10 stone, I compare it to a woman of that height; the lightest weight I have known for a woman of that height in average health, is about 9 stone or 9 stone 41bs.; it depends upon the build—I was not informed by Harriett Staunton's mother that her daughter's weight at her healthiest did not exceed 8 stone; Dr. Bright told me that—the weight depends upon the build; it depends upon the framework; if the framework is slight it might not be 9 stone—it is within my experience that a person of the height of 5 feet 4 1/2 inches might be considerably less than 9 stone in weight, and yet a healthy person—the weights of the particular organs were calculated in reference to the weight of the whole body—the heart would be one two hundred and fortieth part of the weight of the whole body calculated in that way—taking the actual weight of the body; the weight of the different organs of the body corres<lb/>ponded with the natural proportions, whatever the weight of the body might be, the heart would be one two hundred and fortieth part of it.</p>

In this case the heart, for instance, corresponded with the actual weight of the body as' I found it; if the body had been 9 stone the heart would have been so much larger—taking the weight of the body, the organs were considerably under the size I expected to find them—9 or 10 stone should he the average weight of a woman 5 feet 5 1/2 inches; if the weight had been from 9 to 10 stone then the internal organs, the liver, and so on, would have been much larger than the organs as I found them in the body that was before me; the organs of the body as I found them were of the same size as I should expect to find them in a body that was only 5 feet 5 inches; the internal organs were proportionate to the weight.</p>

The spleen weighed 4 1/2 ounces and should have weighed 7 ounces—I gave a lower weight than 7 ounces before the Magistrate as a natural weight; I said 5 1/2 ounces to 7 ounces; 5 1/2 ounces would represent a healty state, but it is a mistake that it averages 5 1/2 to 7 ounces—what I said before the Magistrate was "Weighing 4 1/2 ounces against 5 1/2 ounces to 7;" 5 1/2 ounces is correct—the proportionate weight of the liver to the whole body in ordinary cases would be about one thirty-fifth—I did not weigh the brain—my observations during life showed me nothing inconsistent with the account given by the prisoners—I believed what was told me—when I gave my certificate, I had no reason to suspect anything; I gave it in good faith, and so far as I was able, the cause of death stated in my certificate was the cause—I had no idea at the time that there was any starvation—her symptoms did not indicate either poison or starvation—the chief of the head symptoms before death was the dilitation of the pupils and stertorous breathing; the pupils were unequally dilated, and that is evidence of brain mischief, an unmistakeable sign—if I had felt any doubt on the matter as to the cause of death I should have asked who the doctor was that had been attending her, and probably have put myself in communication with him before I gave my certificate; there was a special hurry about the certificate; there is not in an ordinary case, but there was in this—I did not think it necessary to communicate with Mr. Cassabianca, I saw him the following day; he called on me, he was a perfect stranger to me—Mrs. Cassabianca did not come with him—it was the day after the death that Mr. Cassabianca came, the same day that the certificate was given—I did not know anything about the Stauntons having gone back to Cudham when I gave my certificate—I tad not heard that either of them was going back—I had seen the nurse I recommended in attendance myself—I wrote this letter to the Coroner after seeing Mr. Cassabianca, on the strength of what he said. (<hi rend="italic">The letter was here read as follows</hi>:—"16th April, 1877. Penge, S. E. My dear sir,—On Friday last I was called to a case of a somewhat peculiar character, and, from information afforded me, considered the symptoms sufficient to justify my giving a certificate of death; but from what I have since been told me I am of opinion that the circumstances necessitate an inquisition into the cause. The sergeant who delivers this to you will be able to give you all needful information. With kind regards, yours faithfully. Dean Lougrigg. P.

Mr. Cassabianca gave me the information contained in the postscript—he gave me a history of the lady and the family—he said there had been foul play—in consequence of that I put myself in communication with the police and he Coroner—then the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination took place—I was suspicious of poisoning at one time of the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination; I did not come to hat conclusion; there were symptoms resembling poison; the idea was not</p>

               <p>suggested to me, it was my own observation—we had a conversation about if.—we came to the conclusion that death was from starvation—it was after we had finished the examination that I and the other medical gentlemen came to the opinion there had been poisoning, and determined to send the intestines to Dr. Rodgers—we could not find enough disease to account for death—the congested state of the upper part of the stomach was the first symptom that gave me the idea of poisoning, that was discovered in the early part of <hi rend="italic">the post-mortem</hi> examination—the brain was opened first and the chest afterwards—I will undertake to say the word starvation was mentioned during the examination; I daresay 1 mentioned it; I mentioned it as one of the causes of death; we all mentioned starvation—I have seen several cases of persona who died in a state of great emaciation—I have seen <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examinations of cases called starvation and have seen similar appearances; cases not exactly from disease, but from want of food, exposure to the cold, and want of proper nourishment—I have attended such persons before their death; there is no difficulty in inducing them to take food, it depends upon the state of their sensibility—I did not find anything in this case that looked like a refusal to take food—the egg remained on the tongue from insensi<lb/>bility and from inability to swallow it—indications of intemperate habits would easily be discovered; there would always be a trace of those habits if they had ceased some months before death, though not of a very serious kind; I am of that opinion; I do not think there would be any difficulty in discovering it—in the case of a woman who had contracted a habit of intemperance which has been indulged in for, say twelve months, and who was. deprived of the opportunity, and who died six months afterwards, traces of that would be discovered; you would find an enlargement of the liver and of the heart and a dilated condition of the blood vessels of the brain—that would always be present if the person had been a drunkard, or a person of strong intemperate habits—in the case of a woman who, living at her own house, takes too much wine or too much spirit, you would have symptoms of it then, but not so well marked as in a strictly intemperate person—I think hat would necessarily be visible if a person is given to indulging, although it had been abandoned six or seven months—the heart and the liver were not enlarged, but the blood vessels of the brain were distended—I attribute that to other causes—congestion of the coats of the stomach led me early in the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination to a suspicion of poison—the principal matters discovered in the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination which led me to the conclusion of poison, were the congestion of the stomach, congestion about the rectum, the congestion of the vagina and uterus, and the congested condition of the brain externally and internally; I did not form so strong an opinion that poison had been administered as I did of starvation, I do not recollect whether I said before the Magistrate that the symptoms conveyed to my mind were that it was a suspicious case of poisoning, or that I agreed that there were strong signs of poisoning—we thought that it was poison or starvation, and I thought that Professor Rodgers' analysis would find it out—my memory will not carry me so far back as to recollect positively what I said—it is three or four months since I was examined, and you cannot expect me to recollect—if I said I thought Professor Rodgers' analysis would find that there had been sufficient poison to cause death, it is true of course—what I said before the Magistrate was taken down, but I do not recollect using the expression—the symptoms I have mentioned to you as indicating the presence of poison would also be</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170025"/>
               <p>referable to starvation—all the symptoms I did observe were fairly traceable to starvation—I do not think I said the inflammation of the peritoneum was, for instance; but the peritoneum was slightly inflamed—I have never heard of a case where the simple absence of nourishment has produced inflammation of the peritoneum, not what I call peritonitis, that is a symptom of starvation—I know it from what I have heard other medical men say, and from what I have read; I cannot say that I have ever seen it—I cut the stomach open and examined it carefully; I have given you all that I observed as far as I am aware—the stomach was not of its ordinary size substance and thickness; it was rather thiner than in nature—the mucous membrane of the stomach was thin; I had my notes with me before the Magistrate; but they were taken from me—I have had them back since from the Treasury; I have been examined two or three times—I have never mentioned the thinning of the coats of the stomach until you put the question—before the Magistrate I might have said that all the organs were healthy except the left lung, and that was diseased; I was confused slightly before the Magistrate; I am not confused now, but you are trying to make me so—I do not remember all that I said before the Magistrate—I do not think I said anything in the notes made at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> about the coats of the stomach being thin—I have not been examined from my notes—the thinning of the coats of the stomach would be a strong indication of starvation; one of the most natural and obvious signs; that is a matter which I have considered as important—the condition of the brain was firm, that is a condition indicative of the healthy condition of the brain that it should be firm several days after death—it was a very healthy conditioned brain—the brain was not wasted and pale—in a case of starvation the brain, I will not say would be wasted, but it would be pale—I should expect to find it pale; the brain was healthy—I will not be positive, but I believe in cases of starvation the brain is very little affected, or the nervous system at a 1; I should expect to find it pale, but not wasted—there was a very general congestion of the external and internal blood vessels—I do not consider the inequality of the pupils of the eyes a condition of starvation—it is a marked system of brain disease—phthisis will produce emaciation—there was a small patch of it in the present case, but not enough of it to account for death—the taking of certain poisons, I believe would cause emaciation and a bronzing of the skin—diabetes produces emaciation and a dark or bronzed condition of the skin—there is a dark appearance in the skin caused by diabetes, but I never saw a case where the skin was so bronzed as in this case—I have not had much experience of Addison's disease; it is an obscure disease and I am not sufficiently acquainted with it to give an explanation of it—there are frequent head symptoms in diabetes and in Addison's disease, and in the former you have coma sometimes and stertorous breathing—and they would be similar to the symptoms observed in this case—in diabetes there is sugar in the urine; I did not test the urine in this case—there were 3 ounces of urine in the body—Addison's disease would leave its trace in the super-renal capsules—I examined the kidneys, but not separately—in diabetes as death approached you would find occasionally coma and stertorous breathing and dilitation of the eyes—that appearance is not at all uncommon—I have read that tubercles on the lungs are often found in connection with Addison's disease; I did not examine the tubercles on the brain with a microscope; I did not attach importance to it; as they were</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170026"/>
               <p>so plain to be seen, I did not consider it necessary to go further—the finding of tubercles in the brain was important, but not more so than the finding of tubercles in the lungs, but I did not follow up that discovery by any microscopic examination; I know a disease called granular or milliary tubercle, it takes its name from grains like millet seeds in the brain, and is the same sort of thing that 1 found in this case—the presence of tubercles in the meshes of the brain constitutes tubercular meningitis—it is a fatal disease; I have never seen a case recover—I had five cases in one house after fever—it was in children, the eldest was eighteen—it did not produce great emaciation in those cases; they got much thinner, but I could not call it true emaciation—its effects are very rapid, it is seven or ten days, and sometimes only forty-eight hours before death ensues—local disease may exist without tubercular disease, but if in combination with tubercle in other parts of the body, it would create a serious complication—it would produces the disease called acute general tuberculolis—of that disease I have had considerable experience, it produces great emaciation, and there are head symptoms in some cases—tubercular meningitis or acute general tuberculis would not account for the symptoms in this case in this case an acute tubercular disease was not sufficiently established to produce the symptoms I saw; there was not enough of it—if there had been a stronger condition of the disease itself it would have produced all the the symptoms which appeared in this case, except the rigidity of the muscles of the upper extremities—I have not seen any rigidity in death from tuberculolis—I will not say positively that it might not exist, but I have never seen it, and that is the only symptom I can point out that might not have been caused by those diseases—in this case the disease was not sufficiently advanced; I express that opinion positively—the amount of tubercles was very slight, both in the lungs and the brain—I did not examine the brain with a microscope—the microscope is a great advantage to diagnosis, but it would not have told me more than I knew, namely that there was tubercle—you could see with the naked eye the amount of tubercle that was there—I cannot speak so positively as if I had resorted to the use of the microscope—I speak positively that what I saw was tubercle—I did not see what the microscope would show me—I have no hesitation in my mind, I still adhere to the opinion which I have expressed all through—we all found the appearance of cerebral disease in the shape of that tubercles which have been Spoken of—my original certificate does not fairly represent my views—I consider it correct to a certain extent, with modifications—I arrived at the conclusion that there was poison, and was surprised to find Professor Rodgers did not discover any—I thought he might have done so—I formed my opinion before the analysist's report—I said I believed Professor Bodgers might find poison.</p>

               <p>deprives the limb of all muscular power—when a limb is paralysed it becomes atrophied—the bites were produced during life; I have no doubt of that—the bite of a louse is like being pricked suddenly with a pin—bites after death would not produce those appearances—I thought poison might have been administered because of the congested state of the organs I have described—congestion is an effect of an irritant poison, but might be produced by starvation or by eating after going without food for a long period—the appearances I saw in the eyes might be symptoms of narcotics as well as the congestion—there was a general thinning, not only of the stomach, but of all sorts, which might be produced by emaciation—any exhaustive disease that causes emaciation might cause a thinning of the stomach, but it is invariable in cases of starvation—a patient suffering from diabetes would complain of all food, whether liquid or solid, turning to urine, and of the immense quantity of urine that would pass—this causes a gradual wasting of the body, but it is a long time before it terminates fatally, and that time varies very much—I have seen several cases of diabetes—the patient would also complain of great thirst—extraordinary thirst is a frequent accompaniment of diabetes, but not an invariable one—if Mrs. Harriett Staunton had been suffering from diabetes for a considerable time, I am sure those about her would have known it—the passing of an extreme quantity of urine is an invariable symptom of diabetes—the kidneys are also enlarged and spongy—on the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination in this case we found that the kidneys were enlarged, on the contrary they were smaller than usual—I have had no experience in Addison's disease—I believe it is a very rare disease—in ordinary language tubercular meningitis is an iuflammation of the brain—there is a tubercular deposit—tubercular meningitis will produce emaciation, but must exist some time to do that—if Mrs. Harriett Staunton had been suffering from that disease it must have existed for a considerable time, and she would have been in an enfeebled state for some time before her death, and the disease would have been more developed than it was—if she had suffered from acute tuberculolis the brain would be soft; my opinion is that her death was not caused by diabetes or tubercular meningitis, but by starvation—the doctors present at the <hi rend="italic">postmortem</hi> examination discussed the matter amongst ourselves, and we all agreed—Dr. Harman was there on behalf of the prisoners—if the patient suffered from starvation it might bring on a fit.</p>

There was urine discovered at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—undoubtedly with regard to diabetes the examination of the urine is the simplest and most perfect way of testing the presence of that disease—that is generally considered the test symptom—the examination of the super-renal capsules can only take place after death—with regard to Addison's disease there are certain symptoms during life which are unmistakeable—in examining for that disease after death I should feel it necessary to examine the super-renal capsules—I think in this case suck an examination was overlooked—I noticed tubercles in the brain myself—I made no microscopic examination—I remember they were put aside for examination with some of the matter of the tubercular deposit—I have no knowledge if they were ever examined—the presence of tubercles in the meshes of the brain and the existence of tubercular matter in the lungs was a very important coincidence taken together—I have had the treat<lb/>ment of tubercular meningitis—it is a local disease to the brain and very speedy in its effect—it is most frequent in children—as far as I can re<lb/>member all the cases I have seen have run too rapid a course for emaciation, the usual course has been from two to three weeks; that is almost the limit—it is not long since I bad a case under my control—I have not been struck with great emaciation, though it may come on as the result of other conditions—another disease may have produced emaciation, and then tubercular meningitis follow, "which is very rapid in its effects—I can point out three things here which were inconsistent" with death from tubercular meningitis, the very fact of there being some small tubercular deposit in the membranes of the brain led us to examine the brain very carefully, and there was a complete absence of three marked symptoms: first, the flattening and the bulging of the sides of the brain; secondly, and much more important, a complete absence any effusion in the ventricles, in the chambers of the brain; and, thirdly, the absence of any tubercles whatever at the base of the brain—the characteristic <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> appearances of tubercular meningitis is the presence of tubercular deposit in the meshes of the brain, at the base of the brain—we examined the brain more carefully because we thought we found some small deposit of tubercles on the convex surface, that led us to examine more carefully—I made no examination with the microscope—I made a special note of there being a total absence of lymph, but I do not think I did so of the flattening and bulging of the brain—the presence of lymph is one of the most marked symptoms of inflammation—it becomes very serious indeed when there is</p>

               <p>lymph or pus—the first stage of inflammation is a congested condition—we found that present—I must distinguish between the word congestion and inflammation, because the appearances of the brain were characteristic of intense congestion and 1 could not use the word inflammation—the presence of lymph is the third stage in inflammation, and congestion is the first—congestion was present in the brain—all the blood vessels in the brain itself were remarkably congested—a very small quantity of fluid was found in the skull—I doubt if there was more than a drachm; I don't think it was actually measured—it will be found mentioned specially in my notes that there was an absence of effusion, but not, I believe, as to the quantity—I think that was remarkable from the absence of it—I do not remember making; a written note, but I remember it perfectly—I recollect the appearance of the brain perfectly; we expected to find evidence of tubercular disease more marked and we did not find it—I won't say that military tubercles never occur without lymph or effusion.</p>

I said that I could not come to any decided opinion with regard to the immediate cause of death; I think there was enough upon the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination to enable me to come to a conclusion, and I think the right answer would be that the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> appearances of the body were not inconsistent with starvation—there were reasons why I thought there might be in the first instance a narcotic, and afterwards an irritant poison—the difficulty we had was to account for the immediate cause of death—I ought to say the special appearances are not limited either to poison or to starvation; there are certain appearances common to many diseases, in the stomach and so on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an M.

I agree with the doctors who have already spoken with regard to meningitis—I agree with their opinion with regard to the diseases; but not quite so as to their statements—I did not hear them all, but I agree with their opinions—I heard Mr. Longrigg give a description of the symptoms before death sometime after the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—at the time I made the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> I came with a perfectly clear mind and without any knowledge at all of what had taken place—I refused to hear from Mr. Cassabianca what he had to say about the matter—he came with a policeman, and asked me to attend the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>, but I refused to hear him say anything about it; I told him I would rather go unbiassed—at the examination the symptoms were put down to poison, but we thought we Would have an exhaustive analysis and sent the stomach to Mr. Rodgers—I was very dubious as to the symptoms; there was an inflamed stomach, and that was one symptom of poisoning—I concurred in the view of the other</p>

               <p>medical men in their wish to send them, and in the reasons for which they sent those things to Dr. Rodgers for examination—I have had about thirty years experience in the treatment of brain diseases—I have not practically had special cases with regard to brain diseases—I have had general scrofula as you may call it, which is another name for general tuberculosis—I have also had cases of meningitis—those diseases generally do not last sufficiently long to produce emaciation—tuberculosis in the form of phthysis does so—tuberculosis has various forms; some lead to greater emaciation than others—the presence of tubercles in the brain, and tubercles in the lungs in that congested state of the vessels of the brain was too small in quantity to produce any bad result of tuberculosis I think—there are three membranes of the brain—the duramater, the pia mater and the arachnoid—this deposit was on the arachnoid membrane, the size of about a fourpenny or a sixpenny piece—it was very recent, quite transparent, and had not produced any inflammation—there was no inflammation present—I did not even see any congestion; it was a perfectly recent deposit—there was no congestion in the organs of the brain; I mean not connected with this tubercular deposit, there was some general congestion of the brain not dependent upon this tubercular deposit—I have had persons under my care who were suffering from brain disease—those persons for a long period differ in temperament and manner and in behaviour—persons who are afflicted with disease of the brain are very often affected in their temper which makes them sulky—I have not had experience of persons who are under the control of warders in asylums, nor have I visited persons who have been confined in asylums, neither my friends nor patients—vomitting is one of the things that may cause starvation.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKE</hi>. I mentioned before the Magistrate that vomitting might produce starvation—I never had a case of starvation under my care—I have had a case of starvation where a patent refused to take food—it was a grown-up person of weak intellect—it was a case of imbecility—the patient refused for sometime to take food; it had to be forced down by the stomach pump—I saved the patients in that way, for I had two or three, a medical man is necessarily required to deal with a case of that kind—in this case I saw some food on the back of the tongue of the deceased woman—she had already some in the stomach; some that had been recently given her seemed of the same kind—it might have remained there from her inability to swallow, in the state in which she was—there are several writers on the subject of death from starvation—there is Kirk's "Hand-book," Taylor's Medical Jurisprudence," and Kasper's work, and one or two more I think, and there is a long account published of the Welsh fasting girl's case—Kirk does not treat it very lightly; he gives the weight of the organs and the way in which they lose weight—I did not notice anything about the brain that might have been caused in early life—I noticed no old injury to the brain, but there was slight adhesion between the dura mater and the skull-cap—I did not think much of that.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE SOLOCITOR-GENERAL</hi>. Kirk's "Hand-book" gives inflammation in the stomach as one of the symptoms of poisoning—inflam<lb/>mation of the stomach sometimes produced by starvation is given in Taylor's Medical Jurispurdence," and Kirk's "Hand-book," as one of the symptons" of starvation—I desired the contents of the stomach to be analysed in order</p>

               <p>to ascertain by exhaustive examination, what was the cause in this particular case—when poison is excluded as the cause of the inflammation, we hare advanced one step towards ascertaining what it is not—starvation is one of the things that produce it—the several diseases that have been mentioned are characteristic of those diseases, in Addison's disease you get the bronze skin, but 1 do not think the skin of this poor woman was anything at all of that colour; it was a more parchmeuty state of skin, and with regard to diabetes there is an enormous flow of urine which cannot be concealed, and an intense thirst; life may be prolonged by medical treatment, proper diet, and so forth—there is an effect produced upon the kidneys themselves by diabetes—there was no symptom of that in this lady at all—the kidneys were healthy—the tubercles were not in the substances of the brain but on the middle membrane, the arachnoid membrane, one of the envelopes of the brain—that did not fulfil the description of the symptoms which indicates cereberal meningitis—they appear in the substance of the brain, they go through the membranes—they do not assume the form of tubercles; it is an isolated spot of tubercles on the surface of the arachnoid membrane, on the middle membrane, outside the brain.</p>

There was one case which I had particularly under my notice where a person had refused to take food and where it had to be admi<lb/>stered by the stomach pump; I have had three such cases—I did not find in either of those three cases that the patient had on any occasion taken some quantity of nourishment, but refused to take more; it was a general refusal to take any—if I found certain particles of food in the stomach and other por<lb/>tions unswallowed resting on the tongue I should infer that the patient must have taken it voluntarily—in the cases 1 have had under my notice there was no partial refusal, it was an entire refuse.</p>

               <p>time before her death—undoubtedly those about her must have seen the condition in which she was—I have heard the suggestion of several diseases—the patient some time before her death would be able to walk very feebly and latterly unable to walk; I should say from my experience of sickness ten days at least—I was called in to one case of starvation, but then that was after the death—I have seen many cases of starvation where there has been diseases such as cancer, incessant vomiting, fever, and certain other diseases, Bright's disease of the kidneys, and so on, bat always a very long time—I have had these cases under my care—in those cases where—starvation has been caused by disease the disease has prevented the food being assimilated—the emaciation has been caused by the want of proper food—in those cases the shortest time to produce emaciation that I can call to mind was three months, of great emaciation not death; of emaciation such as I have heard described in the evidence—some diseases do produce very great emaciation—it takes a very Jong time—it must have been most certainly obvious to everybody that for some time before the death of this lady she required medical attendance—the appearance of the stomach, the duo denum, the rectum and the vagina, no matter from what cause, not poison, certainly, must have created suffer<lb/>ing which required medical assistance and great care—after a person has abstained from taking food for a considerable time, the effect of taking food in any quantity would be affection of the brain, congestion of the brain—it is a very dangerous thing to be—in my examination I saw nothing to indicate that the patient had been given to habits of intemperance; the liver had not the slightest appearance or indisation of habits of intoxication—if this lady had at one time indulged in liquor to excess and then had been prevented getting access to it, I should have expected in such a case as that to find some appearance, and certainly not the absence of fat in the liver—I should have expected in that case there would have been fat in the liver, and there was not a trace—during the cross-examination of the other medical witnesses I have heard suggestions made as to diabetes—I do not think the condition of this woman could have been caused by diabetes—my reason is that in diabetes there is so much suffering that medical aid would bare been required, and therefore, as no medical aid was ever sought, I believe starvation was the cause and not diabetes—there is an excessive quantity of wine in diabetes, and always excessive thirst—I have seen a great number of cases of diabetes over a lapse of something like forty years, and I have never known thirst absent—the food turns to urine, which contains a deal of sugar—diabetes is a disease of non-assimilation, and the food taken into the stomach has not much influence; the tissues of the body are con<lb/>verted into sugar rapidly—I found no sugar in the liver—in diabetes there is generally enlargement of the kidneys, but these kidneys were smaller than natural; the deceased's kidneys were perfectly healthy—in diabetes patients suffer pain in their limbs, particularly in the bend of the legs, and general weakness and great prostration, and they lose flesh to a very great extent—the symptoms in meningitis would have been far more urgent in requiring medical attendance, and, therefore, as I have not heard of any medical attendance, I keep to the starvation—I have not had any experi<lb/>ence in Addison's disease; that disease is very rare.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170034"/>
               <p>the total absence of fat in the body is regarded by the best authorities as perfectly diagnostic of starvation—tuberculosis does produce emaciation, but in this case there was nothing in the lungs to produce emaciation what ever—there was nothing in the lungs that would account for such a state of emaciation—I was not present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—in giving my opinion that the condition of the lungs would not account for that state of emaciation here, I am not acting upon the notes that were sent me by Mr. Longrigg, but only upon the evidence I have heard to-day—Mr. Longrigg did send notes to me—if there had been excess to warrant an opinion of intemperance, even for a limited time, it would necessarily leave its marks in the organs of the body—if there was intemperance to a very slight extent in this lady, intemperance that ceased six or nine months before her death, I think I should find signs of that; there would be a little nutmeg appearance about the liver, and there would be some fattening, in this case there was a total absence of it—I am not prepared to say that where a person has discontinued the habit, and then not taken any food, and then there has been a sort of system of starvation going on, I am not prepared to say that the indication would not be removed in such case; I think the indication might be removed—in an ordinary case of a person who had contracted habits of intemperance I should, upon a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, expect to find a fatty liver; the fat in the liver might dis<lb/>appear supposing the intemperate person who had died had been starved—after a long process of starvation fat in the liver, the result of intemperance, might be got rid of—I cannot say exactly whether it would if the starve<lb/>tion, that is to say, the abstinence or privation of food, was caused by disease or not—I think three months would be the time during which the process of emaciation would be going on—I am speaking of starvation caused by disease—in consumption you frequently have a space of two or three years constantly losing flesh—my experience has not been in any case of enforced privation of food—the disease which, in my experience, in three months has led to emaciation of this kind is enteric fever—I have a very large experience in the examining and analysing substances—this case gave me a great deal of difficulty from this cause: the appearances warranted the suspicion of poison, therefore, I took a great deal of trouble, in not only analysing by two processes but by verifying the results, and I most decidedly proved the absence of any metallic poison and equally any vegetable—there was no irritant poison and there was no alkaloid poison—the case puzzled me up to the very day of the Inquest, because I could not account for the redness satisfactorily in my own mind, I thought there must still be poison, and therefore I took the trouble in the way of being puzzled to be certain that I was right in the negative results—the redness of the stomach, the duodenum, and the rectum taken together made me think there must be poison, but I disproved its existence.</p>

               <p>opinion is that the cause of death was starvation—I have had a case of abso<lb/>lute starvation under my care, where a woman swallowed vitriol and she got stricture of the gullet; she was unable to take any food after a time, and she died of starvation; the only food she got was food injected through the rectum, and ultimately she died from starvation; my patient died between three and four months from the time of swallowing the vitriol, through in<lb/>ability to swallow food—I have seen cases of persons suffering from want of food and exposure and have made <hi rend="italic">post-mortems</hi> of such cases—my patient lasted between three and four months, I am speaking from recollection; I know it was about that lime; the only nourishment she had was from inject<lb/>tions through the rectum; that was at the last; the gullet was entirely obliterated for about a month before she died—after swallowing the vitriol she took very little food and when she could not swallow any we injected such food as we could; in that case there was emaciation—I observed the condition of the outlets—there was a good deal of diarrhoea and inflammation about the rectum long before she died—there was a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>, which I made myself—the appearances in that case corresponded with the appear<lb/>ances I have heard described in this case, excepting that there was a disease in the gullet, and I do not remember that there was any congestion of the stomach; there was congestion of the brain—in a case where there has been abstention from food of a sufficient quantity for a considerable time, in fact, starvation, and then food is, suddenly administered, it would be likely to produce congestion of the stomach—in this case congestion of the rectum is spoken of; I should expect it; it is usually a symptom of starvation that that there should be congestion of the outlets—I see no reason whatever to suppose that this woman was suffering from diabetes or that she died from diabetes; my grounds for saying that are that she had no kidney disease, I have heard no history of the thirst and I have heard no history of a large quantity of urine being constantly passed—there were no motions, no hard white motions in the intestines which is generally the case in diabetes; there were no hard white foeces in the intestines which are usually found; I can-not say invariably, but usually—if there had been diabetes I should expect the kidneys to be enlarged, and probably degenerated—here, on the con<lb/>trary, they were smaller than usual, and they were healthy—those are my reasons for dismissing diabetes—I have never had a case of Addison's disease under my care; I have seen two or three in hospitals; it is a disease of rare occurrence—I have no reason to think from the evidence I have heard that this lady was suffering from Addison's disease—the pathology of the disease is very obscure and the symptoms are pretty well known; they are great bronzing of the skin, most marked in the cases I have seen, almost like an Indian skin, in fact I may say quite like an Indian skin; there is emacia<lb/>tion and very great lassitude, and it is a very long slow disease—if it had been Addison's disease the patient must have suffered for a very considerable came before her death—nobody about her could have doubted that she was extremely ill if she had suffered from Addison's disease; every one must lave seen that she was extremely ill—I do not think there is sufficient evi<lb/>dence to show that she suffered from the disease called tubercular meningitis, or tubercular deposit on the coating of the brain, and I do not think she died from that disease; my reasons for thinking so are that in death from tubercular meningitis there is usually a good deal of fluid effused into the ventricles of the brain; there is also usually lymph effused at the base of the brain, and there is usually more evidence of tubercles than that described</p>

               <p>in the present case—there is a disease the chronic condition of which will cause emaciation an I will take a considerable time, several months, before it is fatal; during that time the patient would be very much enfeebled; there is also acute tuberculosis—I do not think in this case death was caused by acute tuberculosis—I should expect to find the brain soft, and there was no emaciation—there is also another reason, I do not know of any disease which would account for the total absence of fat in the internal organs—from the evidence I have heard I should not think that Mrs. Harriett Staunton would be able to move about easily for some time before her death—it is my opinion that for two or three weeks she would not be able to move about much or to move at all—I have heard about the removal on the 12th and am certainly of opinion that it accelerated her death; in my opionion it would be an injudicious step to take.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKE</hi>. I was not present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination nor concerned in the case in any way—I have not seen Mr. Longrigg's notes, I have seen his deposition, and have been listening to his evidence to-day, it is upon that that I form the opinion which I have just expressed, in common with Mr. Longrigg, and the other doctors—I cannot undertake to say that Addison's disease was not present—it is true that it is very often the case that when a patient is in a chronic state of wasting disease, another disease will supervene—with respect to the signs that would be visible upon a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of the existence of Addison's disease they are two, the bronzed skin and the condition of the super-renal capsules—J cannot say that I noticed in Mr. Longrigg's evidence that the skin of this lady was bronzed—I think he said it was dark—I have heard that the super-renal capsules were overlooked in the course of the examina<lb/>tion—sugar in the urine is an unmistakable sign of diabetes; I do not say that because sugar is found in the urine it is an unmistakable sign of death from diabetes, but it is an unmistakable sign of the appearance of that disease.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKE</hi>. It is, after death, the one unmistakable sign—I have looked at the depositions but have looked at no notes of the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—judging from the depositions I do not find the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination so completely and satisfactorily recorded as I should have done it myself; I should have recorded the weight of the brain, and the quantity of fluid in the skull if I had found a large quantity, but as there was very little there I should have taken no notice of it except that there was very little; if I had found a thinning of the coat of the stomach I should have recorded that, if is an important symptom of starvation—if I found such a bronzing of the skin as would lead my mind to the disease, I should then have examined particularly the super-renal capsules; I have never seen any thing like the bronzing in Addison's disease—the bronzing in diabetes is to a very small extent compared with the other—a slight bronzing might have directed my mind to starvation or to diabetes—I apply the word "starvation" to mean a process caused by any disease which would prevent the nutrition of the body—I cannot call to mind any specific disease, Addison's or diabetes, to which the bronzing of the face would have directed my attention—my patient, I have given an account of</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. Supposing emaciation had been caused by starvation going on for a considerable time, it would very likely lead to the deposit of tubercles—when a body becames in an enfeebled condition it is much more likely that some other disease will supervene.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. If starvation had been going on for some time, that might lead to it—I am not prepared to say it would have led to sufficient tubercles to lead to tubercular meningitis, but it might lead to a deposit of tubercles, either on the brain, lungs, or other tissues—if deposited in sufficient quantities they might produce the disease of tubercular meningitis—in a case of death by starvation I should expect a darkening of the skin, caused by the loss of vitality and the dryness of the skin.</p>

               <p>take her at once or else she won't last the journey"—at the time that con<lb/>versation was going on she was in the kitchen in a chair—Mr. Patrick Stauuton carried her down in the morning, she was propped up with pillows and seemed very drowsy—Mr. Patrick Staunton tried to rouse her several times—Mrs. Patrick said "You had better let her sleep," and Mr. Patrick Staunton said "If she goes to sleep she won't wake up again in my opinion"—at the latter part of 1876, Louis Staunton was living at Little <hi rend="italic">Gray's</hi>, that is about 2 miles from the house, and from time to time he came to the Woodlands, but not always, to see his wife—I don't think I heard him speak of her, nor do I remember to have heard him say he wished to see her—I have heard him speak to her—Mr. Louis Staunton and Alice Rhodes were living at Little Gray's Farm, but Mrs. Harriett Staunton did not know where her husband was living, or that Alice Rhodes was living with him—I remember picking up a letter which I after<lb/>wards burnt—it was in Mr. Louis Staunton's handwriting, and addressed to Miss Alice Rhodes—I found it in Mr. Patrick Staunton's bed-room at Cudham—Alice Rhodes had been at the house, but she was not staying there then—I don't recollect all that was in the letter, only the first few lines at the beginning—it began "My own darling, I was very sorry to see you crying so much when I left you. It seems as though it would not be but there will be a time when Harriett is out of the way, when we shall be happy together," and then it said "Dear Alice, you must know how much I love you by this time; we have been together two years now"—Alice Rhodes enquired after the letter when she came back to Cudham about a week after—she asked me if I had seen a letter addressed to her, and I told her no—I had already burnt the letter—I was examined at the inquest—I cannot tell the date or the month when I found the letter—I found it at Cudham in the beginning of last year, as near as I can recollect—I believe it was the first time Alice came to stay there—she had been down from Saturday to Monday several times—I went up to the confinement in March, 1876—I believe it was after that I went to Cudham, after I had been to London to the confinement; some time in March, 1876—I remained a month, that would bring it to April; I cannot fix it nearer than that—that was the first time I think that Alice came to stay for a month or some days—I know her handwriting, but would not swear to it—the letter produced I believe to be in her handwriting, but I would not swear to it—to the best of my belief it is—I have seen her handwriting once or twice; once at Cudham when she was making out a list of something. (<hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>: "August 19, 1876. Woodlands, Satur<lb/>day morning. My dearest Louis. I was extremely thankful to have a letter from you yesterday, as you must know it is extremely dull for me here, and baby is very fretful. I have searched all over the house for the lost letter and cannot find it, and I am sure Harriett has not got it, so where it can be I cannot tell at all. Come down to me as soon as you can, if only for a few hours, for you cannot think how happy it will make me to see your dear old face again. With affectionate love, and trusting to see you soon.

I cannot think, after your disgraceful conduct towards my mother, Mrs. Hincksman, and my husband, some months since. You also told Alice you were coining to be faced with a revolver, my husband having said something about using fire-arms.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. M. WILLIAMS</hi>. I think Mrs. Harriett came to Mr. Pk. Staunton's in August, 1876, and remained there up to her death, 12th April this year 1877—I was the only servant at Patrick Staunton's house and was in the habit of going out frequently during the whole of the time, going errands and going to the shops in the neighbourhood, and seeing different people—since I made my statement before the Coroner I made another on 29th May, I believe, and another one to Sergeant Bateman on 8th June; then one on 20th June, was a written one; I cannot say whether I made one on the 23rd or 27th June; I do not know the dates at all when I made them—I was not called as a witness before the Magistrates at Bromley—I do not recollect anything I said before the Coroner; yes, I remember being asked "Was she able to eat and drink?" and answering "She always ate heartily," and I believe I was asked a question as to whether they always had meals together, and I replied "Yes that was not true—I remember saying that Mrs. Harriett Staunton was frequently out of doors on the farm morning, noon, and night; that was not true—I am not sure whether I said before the Coroner that Patrick Staunton struck her—I remember saying that I saw the deceased's clothes; I won't swear that I did not say they were very nice, I do not recollect saying so; I do not know whether I said that they were such clothes as a lady would wear, but I remember being asked—I said her flesh was very clean from what I saw—I made her bed; I will not under<lb/>take</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170043"/>
               <p>to say that I said her bed was clean—I said that the night when she left the Woodlands she had on a cloth jacket, an Ulster, a blue shawl, and a rug—before she started I heard her husband say to her "Will you go?"—I cannot answer whether I said that she appeared all right, but she put her foot on the step, got hold of the brass railing, and got into the wagonette; she sat in between Mr. Staunton and Miss Rhodes—I do not think I said one word before the Coroner about Patrick Staunton saying to her "You must not come downstairs, you d——cat, or I will break your back"—I might have made the statement before 23rd June—I will not swear before she went away in the wagonette that I said she was going to a doctor—I remember being asked if I considered that she was ill and replying "No, not very ill until the Thursday afternoon"—I think I said it was between 3 and 4 o'clock and that she had sat drowsy over the fire—I should not like to say that I heard my master ask her how she was on the day that she went away and that she replied "Pretty well"—I cannot tell whether she answered or not; I might have said that she did—Mr. Patrick asked her in the morning bat I forget whether she answered him—I heard my mistress say that the child was going up to the hospital—I bslieve I said that "Mrs. Harriett Staunton hoped Mrs. Patrick would be fortunate enough to get it in as she hoped it would do it good;" that was not true, Mrs. Harriett had not said so—it was not true when I said that I heard its mother ask that it should be taken to the hospital—Mrs. Patrick Staunton did not tell Mrs. Harriett that she would take the child to the hospital—Mrs. Harriett Staunton did not know with whom her husband was living—I think I have said that Mrs. Louis Staunton knew that her husband was living with Alice Rhodes a little way off and that she was passing as Mrs. Staunton; that was false, she was not aware of it—the prisoners told me to say so before the Coroner, I swear that—I do not believe I said one word about finding the letter begin<lb/>ning "My own Darling, I am sorry to see you cry so" until the last time I gave a statement to the Treasury; I do not remember what the latter part of the letter was, but it-was something about the death of his father—it was six or eight months before the death of Harriett Staunton that I saw the letter I knew what it meant, and I understood what was meant by the sentence "There will be a time when Harriett is out of the way that we shall be happy together; it referred to the death of Mrs. Harriett Staunton; I destroyed the letter; I do not think I ever said one word about it until I came to give my evidence to the Treasury—Mrs. Harriett Staunton used to go out when she first came to Cudham—I have not said that she came home the worse for liquor—I might have said "I have seen her the worse for liquor;" I will not swear that I have not—I believe I saw her the worse for liquor at Brixton once, I am not sure; I went more by what I heard than what I saw; she seemed intoxicated to me—I have said that while at Cud<lb/>ham she went out on one occasion to a public-house in the village and told me that she had been there—I believe that was before she went down to stay at Cudham on the first or second visit—Mr. Patrick Staunton was frequently out from Christmas up to April for hours together—Mrs. Patrick Staunton used to get out sometimes, not very often; she seldom or ever went out shopping; she went out and about the Woodlands, the house and grounds, and she used to go to Little Gray's—at that time Patrick Staunton was out too, and I and Mrs. Harriett Staunton would be left at home—I was attending to my work at home—I have had some conversations with Sergeant Bateman since the inquest, I don't know how many conversations, a few, I</p>

               <p>should say, I cannot give you an idea how many; a good deal more than three or four, it may have been half a dozen; it was not much more than conversation; it was about this matter—I don't remember making a statement to him on 8th June—I remember the end of the Coroner's inquest—I don't recollect making a statement to him about a fortnight after the inquest terminated—I think I did make a state<lb/>ment about six or eight weeks afterwards—ho asked me questions and I answered them—I remember his saying to me that I might get myself into trouble, I don't remember his doing so more than once, I think it was only on one occasion; that was some time before I made the statement to him—I don't remember when it was that he said that to me—I don't think he said anything to me about penal servitude; I won't swear he did not—he did not say "You had better take care, or you may get penal servitude yourself; I will swear he did not say that; I don't recollect that he said anything about penal servitude—ho said that if I went on in the state as I was then I might get into trouble, because he said he knew it was not the truth—I think he used the words "Go to prison"—I think fiat was some time before I made the statement to him.</p>

I remember being examined before the Coroner; I was examined on more than one day—on the first day I was only asked a few questions, and the substantial examination was the second time—I think Mr. Patrick was in the room when I was examined on the second occasion—there were some witnesses downstairs, but I believe Mr. Patrick was upstairs—I believe, but am not certain of that—I believe the others were downstairs—the witnesses remained out of the room, and were called in as they were wanted for examination—I think Mr. Patrick Staunton had been examined the same day, before me—I was called up to the room when I was wanted for examination—I think the Coroner before my examination cautioned me very strongly—I remember on the second day the Coroner saying "Let me ask you to be very particular in the answers you give me, and give me the whole truth, not merely give part, but all that you know, when you are asked the questions; and you must bear this in mind, I have heard your master and mistress, I have heard Mr. Staunton, and I have heard Miss Alice Rhodes, and they have between them given me certain information which very likely may enable me to ask you questions also, and it is with that view I caution you that you may speak all you know, and unreservedly speak all that you know without any fear"—I remember the Coroner saying that, and the foreman of the jury saying "Speak all you know without any fear"—then the Coroner, and Mr. Poland, and Mr. Gye, I believe, examined me, and then I made the statement that 1 have been examined about—I do not remember how long I was in the witness-box that day—Mr. Patrick Stauuton is an artist, paint<lb/>ing clown at Cudham—he used to paint in the large parlour; there was no special room built out from the house for the purpose—there were two parlours—there was a kitchen on the same floor as the parlours, and two bed-rooms upstairs—there were only two bod-rooms in the house, front and back—Mrs. Patrick Staunton occupied the front bed-room—one of the children slept with me, and one with Mrs. Staunton—I slept in the same room as Mrs. Harriett Staunton—Mrs. Harriett Stauuton slept in the chair bedstead—the wooden bedstead, in which I slept, was the bigger one—the chair bedstead was an iron bedstead, a thing that draws out, with cushions—the bed 1 slept on was a four-post wooden bedstead.</p>

The younger one required a good deal of atten<lb/>tion—the washing was done at home—Mrs. Patrick would assist in the washing—I have washed Mrs. Harriett Staunton's things from time to time, but not every week—the little child of Harriett Staunton's cried a great deal—Mr. Staunton objected to the noise it made—I have known the child sitting on the mother's knee making a great disturbance at meal times and I have known him get angry with her because she could not keep the child quiet, and tell her to go upstairs with it—we were not particular as; to the time we got up in the morning—I used to go down first—Mr. Patrick Staunton used to come down about 8 o'clock, sometimes before—the breakfast hour was all times, but about 9 o'clock and it would be generally over by 10 o'clock—there were no regular hours—breakfast used to consist of bread and butter and sometimes eggs, but not always—fowls were kept at the Woodlands—Mr. Patrick Staunton used to complain that Mrs. Harriett did not come down to breakfast in time—I have heard him call out for her—there was a picture on the landing which he rather valued, with a big frame—Mrs. Harriett Staunton used to carry the child down in the basinette sometimes but not very often and then it used to be brought into the breakfast-room—I have seen her in Mr. Patrick Staunton's room where he painted—the meals were taken sometimes in the kitchen, sometimes in the sitting-room, the smaller parlour—I have not sat and played at cards with Mrs. Harriett—after Mrs. Patrick went away on Thurs<lb/>day, the 12th, I did not see her again till the Saturday—I slept alone in the house on the Thursday night with the two children—the first person I saw after she was taken away was the butcher—I saw Mr. Patrick on Friday, I think it was about 8 o'clock in the morning—Mrs. Harriett Staunton had her feet in hot water on two occasions—I think that was in the week preceding the week when she went away—I remember taking her up a tin bath for her feet—that was not the week before it was the same week that she went away.</p>

The notes that were sent to Alice Rhodes down to the confinement were put in the back place—she put them there—I don't know exactly when Alice Rhodes went to Cudham and asked if she would allow Harriett to come for a week—I cannot fix the date, nor do I remember accurately what took place at that time—I picked up the letter beginning "My own darling" in Mrs. Patrick Staunton's bed-room—it was in an envelope—the envelope had been opened—I think I read it over twice, not the whole of it—there was a whole sheet full, four pages—I believe it was all filled with writing—I only read the whole of it once I did not read it twice—I might have read the portion I have given twice or three times—I do not recollect any more of it with the exception of the part about his father's death—I do not remember anything else, or what the words used were—I think I was good friends with Alice Rhodes at the time, but she seldom spoke to me—I had no cause to quarrel with her, I was the same as I always had been, perfectly friendly together—when she asked for the letter I told her I had not found it—she asked me if I had found it to give it her—I had burnt it then—the reason I did not tell her was because I was afraid she would be angry with me for burning it—I have never said</p>

               <p>that when she asked me for it I had it in my pocket—I have said that when she asked me for it I said "No, I have not seen it, but I had it in my pocket all the time'"—that was when I was first asked about it—I burnt it directly I heard them talking about it—I had it in my pocket when I heard Alice Rhodes ask somebody outside for it—I have never been asked to make another statement—I don't remember the date of that statement, but I have never been asked by the Treasury to make any other.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. I read the letter at once, and a day or two after I found it I heard Alice Rhodes enquiring about It—I did not read it after I heard her enquiring for it—I burnt it—the reason I did not give it up was because I was afraid she would be angry at my finding it—after I had burnt it she asked for it—that is a correct account—I have seen Louis Staunton's father several times; he died at Guy's Hospital—I heard it—I cannot tell when be died, but I remembers conversation about old Mr. Staunton having died in the hospital—that was before I found the letter, I think about a month before—I don't know who spoke about it, I rather think it was Mr. Patrick and his wife—I am sure there was something in the letter about old Mr. Staunton's death—Mrs. Hincksman lives at 53, Heygate Street, Walworth—when I wrote that statement I was living at Mr. Judd's at Penge—I had been there only a day before I wrote it—I was living at Mrs. Bradford's when I gave my evidence before the Coroner on the 8th of June—she was a friend of Mr. Louis Staunton's—when I made that statement on the 8th of June to Sergeant Bateman I was not living with my aunt; it was after that that I went to live with her—on the 20th of June, three days after I wrote that statement, I made a state<lb/>ment to the Treasury—I was living with my aunt then—the Coroner cautioned me to tell all I knew about the matter and I signed my statement—I told the Coroner my statement was not true; that was before I signed it, but I told the Coroner at that time that it was not true—I gave my evidence before the Coroner early in May, and on the 29th I went to the Treasury with Mr. Lewis' clerk—I think I said to Sergeant Bateman that my statement was not all correct, and afterwards I wrote out a paper myself—I said I thought I had seen Mrs. Harriett Staunton intoxicated at Brixton;. it was at Mr. Patrick's house, and there was him, and her, and Mrs. Patrick Staunton, and Alice Rhodes, and her, and her sister—I don't think Mrs. Hincksman was there—we had some spirits to drink—I rather think Mrs. Staunton sent for them herself; Mrs. Harriett, I mean—I do not know whether everybody had been drinking—the spirit was gin—when Mrs. Harriett Staunton first came to the Woodlands on a visit, before she came for good, she was nicely dressed, tidy about her hair, and seemed to be fond of her personal appearance; fond of dress—Mrs. Patrick first began to complain of Mrs. Harriett neglecting her hair just after Christmas—I am not quite sure whether it was before or after Christmas, or before or after Patrick gave her the blow on the arm—when he struck her I believe she was in good health—when Mrs. Patrick complained about her neglecting her hair, she was not in good health—she complained of a great deal of pain, of her feet being swollen, and of her hands; and from that time to the time she was removed she continued ill, getting worse and worse—at the time the complaints were made about her hair she was generally up-stairs in the back bed-room—Mr. Patrick Staunton was frequently away from the house, and sometimes Mrs. Patrick was out of the house at the same time; when they were both out she was generally upstairs, and when</p>

               <p>they were going out they often used to tell me to keep her away if anybody came to the door, and let no one see her—sometimes while they were out people came to the door—I used to tell her to stop upstairs and she gene<lb/>rally obeyed me; but sometimes she would attempt to come down, and when she did I used to tell her I would tell the master if she did not go back, and then she would go back at once—at Christmas I was left alone with her for two or three days; myself, Mrs. Harriett, and Mrs. Harriett's baby, and one of Mrs. Staunton's babies—during the time I was alone with her she did not attempt to get out of the house; she stayed in—there was a four-post bedstead in the room where I, Mrs. Harriett, Mrs. Harriett's baby and one of Mrs. Patrick's children slept; it was the same bedstead that was there when the police came, but I believe the posts had been taken off—they projected up above the level of where the bed was placed, but before Mrs. Harriett Staunton was removed they were there—there had been curtains, but they had been taken off—Mrs. Harriett and myself slept in the bed, but after<lb/>wards she slept on a chair bedstead; but when that alteration was made I do not know, nor do I remember how long it was before she left—I don't recollect whether anybody directed that it should be done, or whether Mrs. Harriett and I arranged about it—the bedstead that was there before her removal to Penge was there when the police came; the bedstead on which, we slept—I did not see her slam the door in Mrs. Patrick's face, but I heard say she had done so—we were not all downstairs; I was in the room with Mrs. Staunton, but in bed—Mr. Patrick was in his bed-room—it was night—Mr. Patrick came up and asked Mrs. Harriett why she slammed the door in Mrs. Patrick's face—Mrs. Harriett laughed, and he got out of temper and struck her with his hand on her shoulder or the back part of her arm—that was at the time she had got a black eye, which Mr. Patrick said she got by striking the bedstead—I am sure when Patrick Staunton came into the room he struck Mrs. Harriett—I believe he asked her why she shut the door in Lizzie's face, and she laughed, and after that she had a black eye—she got the lamp when Patrick had gone, and showed me her eye; it was very much swollen and black—after she had the black eye she went to Mr. Keene's; when she went it was rather black, but not so black as it had been—when she went to see Mr. Keene, she wore a bonnet with a dark fall; a rather thick one—Mrs. Harriett's child used to cry a great deal and annoy Patrick, and' he used to send her upstairs; this was before Christmas—I have seen him flog the child more than once in the back bed-room on its face and arms and hands—he gave it a very severe blow once which left a bruise on its cheek, when it was taken to the hospital; that was for crying when it was laid down—the bruise was there before it was taken to the hospital; I think the blow which caused the bruise was inflicted about' a week before the child was taken to the hospital—the photograph produced is of the Woodlands; it is correctly represented—there is a front and a side door—the side door opens into the kitchen—the residents of the house go in and out the front door—there is a little lobby as you enter the front door—there is a kind of passage before you get into the living part of the house beyond the lobby—there are two sitting-rooms, one on either side—on the right-hand side is the place where Patrick Staunton used to paint, as you go in at the front door and get into a sort of lobby—there had been another little door before you get into the regular passage, but that was taken down—directly you get through the doorway there is a door leading into the studio on the right-hand side, and on the left-hand side of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170052"/>
               <p>passage is a small parlour—the passage leads into the kitchen—on the right-hand side of the kitchen there is the pantry and scullery leading out of it, so that if you went in at the side door (the kitchen door) you would walk through the kitchen and face the pantry and scullery doors—that is the whole of the ground floor of the house—I cannot tell the length of the biggest room of the two; I should think it might be about as long, perhaps, as the box where the jury are, or a little longer—the steps lead from the left-hand of the passage into the cellar—there is a flight of stairs before you get into the passage leading from the lobby to the upper rooms—there are only two upper rooms—I slept in the one which faced the staircase—I generally dined in the kitchen with the rest of the family—I generally breakfasted with them; we had all our meals together—Mrs. Harriett Staunton and the baby were the only ones who were upstairs, the rest of us dined together—we lived pretty well—I think Mrs. Patrick Staunton gave directions as to what was to be had in the house—Louis Staunton and Alice Rhodes used to come over on the Sunday and dine with us—latterly on those occasions when they were dining there Mrs. Harriett Staunton was generally upstairs and had her dinner sent up to her—we dined in the sitting-room or in the little parlour—when they came to visit, they did not always go up and see Mrs. Harriett Staunton—Alice Rhodes used to see her sometimes; I don't think Louis Staunton ever went up to see her, unless it has been upstairs in his brother's bed-room—he has seen her down-stairs—he saw her between Christmas and April when she was removed; it was during the early part of the year—I cannot tell when it was—I cannot recollect the last time he saw her before she was removed; it was about three weeks or a month, I think, because I remember her saying something to me about her not seeing him for a long time—I first noticed she was getting weaker and failing about six weeks or a month before she was taken away—I believe it was after that that Louis Staunton saw her—Alice Rhodes saw her on the Wednesday before she was taken away; she saw her in the kitchen—when Mrs. Harriett first of all came she was in the habit of going up to the meadow or round it, up to the meadow gate—she did not seem very fond of going out—I think she went out nearly every day—I recognise the photograph (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); it is that of Mrs. Harriett Staunton—I think it is like her as she was when she first came—I have not seen her dressed like that—I have seen her in a black dress, but that had a body to it—I recog<lb/>nise that as being like what I recollect of her.</p>

I saw Mrs. Harriett Staunton the last time on the 23rd October, 1876, when she came to my office—she was then wearing a black bonnet and a black veil; I believe she was in mourning for Mr. Staunton, sen., her husband's father—I did not notice anything peculiar about her face that day—on the previous occasion (the 17th) I did—she was then wearing the same sort of dress; I noticed a discolouration under one of the eyes, it was just underneath the eye—I won't venture to say what it came from; I saw it.</p>

                  </hi>. I made the plan of the Woodlands produced—it shows the ground floor and the bed-room floor, it also shows the block plan and where the stable is—it is an accurate plan to a quarter scale—I should think the house stands back from the road from about 80 to 100 yards, but I did not measure it—there is no carriage drive, up to the door; you have to cross a pasture to it—I have the Ordnance map here, that is the plan of the Ordnance sheet showing the Woodlands—it is a correct plan—I find the Woodlands marked there; at the back of the house the wood almost touches it at one corner—it is a large wood at the back and at each side; that also shows Little Gray's Farm—the distance by the way across the fields from the Woodlands to Little Gray's Farm is 1,500 yards; that way is through the fields; by the ordinary road it is 2,000 yards, 1,760 being a mile—the rooms are small, the big sitting-room is only 13 feet 2 inches by 12 feet 10 inches, and the smallest 13 feet 2 inches by 8 feet 2 inches, an irregular-shaped room; the passage has been taken off since it was first built—the kitchen is 16 feet 10 inches by 14 feet 6 inches; the side entrance does not open into the kitchen as stated by the last witness.

                  </hi>. I am a gamekeeper and live about three quarters of a mile from the Woodlands, adjoining Bombas Farm—I used to work in. the wood—the other Woodlands, that belong to Mr. Copestake—I recognise that photograph as the lady at the Woodlands—I have seen her nearly every week round the house and in the woods adjoining the Woodlands, from August, 1876, up to the end of October or the beginning of November—I remember leaving a wagonnette—I believe it was about the 19th of October—Patrick Staunton was with me, no one else—the wagonette was Mr. Louis Staunton's—the lady went away in the wagonette, I tucked her dress in at the side of the wheel—shortly after that I saw her again at Patrick Staunton's stable, the stable connected with the Woodlands—I was in the stable looking at Mr. Patrick's pony he was there too—I saw the lady come to the stable door without her bonnet—Mr. Patrick said to the lady "I have a policeman in here, if you ain't off I'll run you in"—she turned and went away towards the house—that was the last time I saw her—after that I continued to be about the wood as usual and passed by the road every day—I remember hearing about some enquiries that were made by Mrs. Butterfield—I did not know then what the lady's name was—inconsequence of what I heard I went intentionally round the Woodlands two or three times a day to see if I could see the lady—I continued to do so to almost the time that she was taken away, but never saw her—I knew the other inmates of the house, Mr. and Mrs. Patrick Staunton their two children and Clara Brown—I never knew the third child—when I last saw the lady she appeared to be in good health and properly dressed.</p>

My business was to look after the game—I have seen the lady hanging out clothes—I remember giving my evidence before the Magistrate—I said then "The expression 'I have a policeman here and will run you in,' I put down as a joke," and I did think so at the time; it was said in that kind of way—I remember seeing Mrs. Patrick Staunton in the woods with a baby in arms—she said something to me, but I don't recollect what it was about—I will swear she did not tell me it was her sister-in-law's child—I had not had a tiff with Patrick Staunton; there was a little coolness shown about putting up a hedge, but there were no words; he wanted the pond fenced in to him, but it was not on his ground and I told him not to do it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. M. WILLIAMS</hi>. The prisoners were surrendered by arrangement—I made notes of the statements which the different prisoners made, the same night when I returned; I have not got them here—I made a copy about two days afterwards; I destroyed the original note—Louis Staunton said that the child only lived a few days; he certainly did not say that it had only died a few days—I was present before the Coroner when Clara Brown gave her evidence; I heard her give it—I believe the Coroner cautioned her two or three times—I have had several conversations with her since the inquest—I put question to her, I think, on two occasions—I did not threaten her at any time, in no way whatever—I did not say that she would be imprisoned—I told her that I knew that the evidence she had given before the Coroner was wrong, and I told her that I had evidence to prove that what she had said was wrong, and she had better be careful, if she liked to persist in saying what she had said, she could do as she pleased I told her that for what she had already said she would be liable to</p>

               <p>imprisoned—I said if she went on in the way she was going on she would be likely to get herself into trouble—I did not say she would, only that she would be likely to—she did not make any statement to me on 8th June; on 8th June we were at the Bromley Bench—to the best of my recollection I got no statement from her on 8th June—I think she made a statement there to Mr. Pollard—I remember Clara Brown saying "I made an untrue statement with reference to the bed-room of the deceased, and about the food she ate. I now say that the food was put before her, but whether she ate it or not I cannot say—what I have said, both to the Treasury and before the Coroner, I was told to say by the prisoners them selves"—I do not remember when that statement was made—I cannot tell you whether I told her of her liability to imprisonment, before or after she made that statement to me—I have no recollection of the date—I told her on two occasions of her liability to imprisonment if she' kept on in the way she was going, and stated what was natrue—the last occasion I told her so was 24th May; no, I cannot say whether that was the first or the last, but one occasion was on the 24th May, when she went to Cudham with me—I do not know the date when I took her to live at Penge, it was fourteen or fifteen weeks ago—I did not then have a conversation with her on the subject, but I expect I had a conversation with her in respect to this charge—I did not tell her on that occasion that she might get herself into trouble—I took her to Penge because it was arranged that she should go there to live—she came from her aunt's at Heygate Street—she had no relations at Penge—a number of witnesses come from Penge—the Treasury paid her expenses, and I took her where I pleased—I live at Penge, and I took her there to be under my eye—she has been there ever since, and she came from there to-day.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STRAIGHT</hi>. It was after she was examined before the Magistrate that I took her to Penge—she came to Bromley by my instructions, and was there in attendance to be called as a witness—that was on 13th June, she had then made the statement which Mr. Williams has called my attention to—I did not write a statement out and forward it to the Treasury, headed "Bromley police-station, 8th June"—this is my signature to this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), but none of the document is in my writing—it was written by Mr. Pollard, senior, but it is signed by me—Clara Brown was, I believe, in attendance at all the examinations before the Magistrate—I said before the Magistrate "I asked Mrs. Patrick Staunton how long she had known Mrs. Staunton, she said 'For a long time.' I asked her how long she had been at her place and she said 'Some months'"—I did say "I asked her how long she had been at Her place, she said 'Some months'"—I said that she had known her some time and she said "It is some months"—I asked Mrs. Patrick Staunton whether Mrs. Harriett had ever slept away from the house and she replied "No, not once"—that was referring to Mrs. Patrick's house—in addition to the answer she gave to my question whether she had sufficient to eat and drink, she said that she was very fond of a drop of spirits—that was in my original notes—I asked Mrs. Patrick whether it was possible for her to get to a chemist's shop, and she said that it was not—when I asked her about the state of health of the deceased lady the reply she made was "She has not been ill, but rather poorly for a few days, the last day or two before her removal she did not care to eat without being forced to do so"—I did not tell that in my examination in chief because I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170067"/>
               <p>did Dot think of it—I also said Mrs. Patrick said "She was generally in good health, on Tuesday she was poorly, and I gave her some castor oil, which was the only medicine she had"—Mrs. Judd, with whom I got lodgings for the girl, is not the wife of a policeman—I did not fetch her from there—she did not come up with me this morning—I saw her last night and saw her again this morning—I have read a very small portion of her evidence in this morning's paper, not a quarter of it—I read, or heard spoken of, the portion of it where it is said that I spoke about prison; I do not know which.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. It was a few days before 13th June, that I was examined before the Magistrate at Bromley—that was when we signed the depositions—I stated all I knew, and I was examined for a long time—after the Coroner's inquest, Clara Brown was taken to the Treasury—she went with Mr. Lewis' clerk on the first occasion, and I happened to be there at the same time—more than a day or two after she had been to the Treasury, she made a statement to me, and I gave information that she had made such a statement—the statement was that she had not told the truth—she said "I made an untrue statement with reference to the bed-room of the deceased and about the food she ate; I now say that food was put before her, but whether she ate it or not I cannot any, what I have said both to the Treasury, and before the Coroner I was told to say by the prisoners themselves"—after she told me that when Mr. Pollard the elder, was at Bromley, he asked me if she wished to make a statement, and he called her in to make a statement—I told him what she had said, but I cannot say when it was—I told him she had said "What I have said to the Treasury, and before the Coroner I was told to say by the prisoners themselves," and after that I was instructed to get her away from where she was living, and I got her lodgings at Penge, because I was stationed at Penge—since that time I have taken her two or three times to the solicitor to the Treasury at the Treasury; I knew from inquiries after she gave evidence before the Coroner, that she had not been stating what was true—when she was called upon to sign her depositions she said that what she had said was not true, and that who she came to give her evidence she I would have to correct it all—it was in consequence of what she said before the Coroner that I made the remark to her about getting into trouble—I have never endeavoured in any shape or way to get the girl to make any particular statement, or to say that which is not true.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Coroner for the County of Kent—in consequence of information given to me I held an inquest on the death of Harriett Staunton—on Wednesday, 18th April last, the inquest commenced—Harriett Butterfield identified the body of the deceased—Clara Brown was asked two or three questions, then an adjournment took place to 25th April, on that day Mr. Gye appeared on behalf of Louis Staunton, and then the inquest was further adjourned to 10th May to allow of the analysis—on the 10th May Mr. Gye again appeared and continued until the end of the inquest—Counsel was also there representing the Crown—on 10th May, Louis Adolphus Edmund Staunton was sworn and examined—I took down his evidence in writing; I have it before me now—Alice Rhodes was examined on the same day after he had been examined; she was the next witness—I have before me the evidence which she gave on the same day Elizabeth Ann Staunton, the wife of Patrick Staunton was examined—I took down the evidence she so gave—then the inquest was ad<lb/>journed to 11th May—on that day Patrick Llewellyn Staunton was called and examined; I have before me his evidence, which I took down in writing at the time—on the same day, after Mr. Patrick Staunton had been examined, Clara Brown was re-called—when all the evidence had been given the inquest was adjourned to the 14th—there were several adjournments, ten days, I think—after the adjournment I appointed a day for the completion of the depositions; on that day neither of the four prisoners attended to sign their depositions; they did not answer to their names; on inquiry I was informed they did not intend to be present—in the interval prior to that Mr. Douglas Straight appeared, representing one of the parties, Mr. Patrick Staunton, I think—Clara Brown did attend to sign her depositions.</p>

These documents are not in my own handwriting, they are copied from my own notes at my dictation and my examination; I have the original notes at home, but these depositions are got up for all and each of the witnesses to sign; they were not read over, because the prisoners did not attend, but the depositions on the various days on which Clara Brown attended were read over to her—the prisoners were not present—I asked the reason why—the learned Counsel said they were not present in consequence of the alarm existing in their minds as to whether the multitude would not attack them, and further, that if they were present they would refuse to sign, under the advise of Counsel—I have the original notes of the depositions, they are partly in shorthand—if I should read my notes it would be found they are word for word, but they are partly in shorthand, partly abbreviated, and partly longhand.</p>

From May to November, last year, I lived at No. 6, Corby Terrace, Upper Norwood. I was there an auctioneer. I married the deceased, Harriett Richardson, in June, 187"), at Clapham Church. There was no marriage</p>

               <p>settlement. One boy was born on the 23rd March, 1876. He died 8th April, 1877, from convulsions.' He died in Guy's Hospital. My wife was quite well up to Monday, 10th April last; she then complained of her feet swelling. I reside at the farm alone with Alice Rhodes. I have no servant. I have been separated from my wife since November last, by private arrangement. She lived at my brother Patrick's, at Frith Cottage, Cudham, about a mile and a half from my farm. I supported her, and allowed my brother one pound a week. I saw my wife two or three times a week there. I was on very good terms with her. She was addicted to excessive drinking almost daily; she drank spirits. I saw her on Saturday, 8th April; I had tea there; she was quite well On Tuesday, 10th April, she was not so well, but she ate well; in fact, she was always craving for food. She was not allowed any spirits. Her face was swollen with a cold. I stopped there to tea and supper. On Wednesday I sent round some new laid eggs by Alice Rhodes, who brought word she was not so well. I immediately; went there; she was sitting over the fire, and appeared very drowsy. I asked her how she was; the only remark she made was 'Pretty well' I asked her what she was going to have for dinner, if she could not eat a steak. She said 'No, your brother has killed a fowl for me.' I then left. I went again in the evening and consulted as to what had better be done, as she did not appear to be getting any better. I suggested I should go up on Thursday morning and look for a place nearer London where we might get advice for her. On Thursday morning Mr. Patrick Staunton came with me to Penge. We drove to Bromley, and came on by train. I knew Penge very well to be a place where they let a good many apartments, and also where there are a great many medical men. I saw apartments to let in the window of a house in Forbes Road from the train. I went there and took the apartments at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week and extras. I told the landlady it was for an invalid lady, and I thought it was a sort of paralysis. I said I would bring her about half-past 9 that night. I paid a deposit of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I did not say who she was. On Wednesday her memory appeared to fail her. My brother's household consists of himself and wife, two children (girls), 3 years and 15 months old, and the servant Clara Brown, and my wife, and nobody else. I am told by my brother that Clara Brown is related to his wife. Up to Monday, April 9th, my wife was in a perfect state of good health. Mr. Richard James Bradford visited at my brother's. The mother and sister of deceased did not visit her. My wife declined to see her relations, because, before the marriage, they tried to make her out insane, and put her into a lunatic asyium, and it gave such a hatred of them that she would never have anything to do with them since we were married; in fact, she had always quarrelled with her mother. I have seen Mrs. Butter<lb/>field at Brixton when she saw her daughter. She has not seen her since—I saw Mrs. Butterfield myself about two months ago at Cudham. Mrs. Patrick Staunton was there. I did not tell her where my wife was. My wife was not at my farm. Mrs. Butterfield asked to see her. I told her on no consideration would her daughter see her, nor would I allow her to do so. I heard that inquiries were being made indirectly as to where she was. She wrote twice to her mother, once when living at Brixton, requesting her never to call upon her again after her shameful conduct. My wife asked mo to write a letter and date it from 'Brighton,' and to post it there to make her mother believe she was down there. I wrote the letter, and I went to Brighton and posted it. In the same envelope there was a letter</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170070"/>
               <p>from my wife to her. It was about 3 o'clock on Thursday, April 12th, that we returned from Penge. My wife said she would get herself ready as soon as possible. I said I would be round about half-past 6 with my trap, a small wagonette with one horse. Alice Rhodes went to Frith Cottage in the afternoon. When I got there they were not quite ready. Deceased was in the parlour, they had dressed her once, but she had to be re-dressed again. She had the run of the house there. She had a private bed-room to herself. When ready I assisted her on one side, and my brother on the other, to the trap. She was able to walk with support. She assisted herself up into the trap, put up one of her legs, and her hand out to catch hold of the rail. She sat on the front seat between me and Alice Rhodes. My brother and his wife went with us. it was dark. We drove to Bromley Station. It was my intention to drive right up, but I thought it would save trouble taking the train from Bromley. We had a first class compartment to ourselves. The train was just coming in. I asked them to stop the train as I had an invalid lady. The deceased was taken out of the trap and put into the train. We came to Penge. During the journey in the train she appeared very exhausted, was not able to speak. She got worse during the journey from Cudham to Bromley. At Penge a chair was got for her. Alice Rhodes and Mrs. Patrick Staunton went on to the lodgings to see that everything was ready. A cab was sent for and she was put into it by myself and brother. We could not get close to the house owing to the state of the road. The cabman assisted. She was not carried. The cabman did carry her from the gate up the steps into the house into the bed-room. The front door was open. Mrs. Patrick Staunton and Alice Rhodes came up for the pur<lb/>pose of stopping with her while she was ill, at least Alice Pthodes was to have stopped. My wife was on friendly terms with Alice Rhodes; very friendly. She had been with us since six months after our marriage. Whilst they were undressing her I went to Mr. Longngg's, he was not at home. I saw his assistant, and left word for Mr. Longrigg to come round at once, as my wife appeared so exhausted. I was told he would be in shortly. I then went back to the house. I did not seek any other medical man. I went again to Mr. Longrigg's and his assistant said he would leave a note for him to come in immediately be returned. I said 'I will sit up for him all night.' About half-past 11 o'clock I went to the train and returned to Cudham. After she was in bed she appeared rather better, and said 'I am tired,' that is all I heard her say. I took no advice as to removing her from Cudham, nor was she attended by any medical man there. Mr. Longrigg was a perfect stranger to me, I never said to Mrs. Chalklin or to any one that she had been attended by a medical man—I suggested on Wednesday to Mrs. Patrick Stauntou that she should see Dr. Creasy. She said 'He is no good, I have no faith in him, far better take her to London." I thought if any physician was wanted that I should sooner get him at Penge than I could at Cudham. Dr. Creasy lives at Brasted. I saw Mr. Longrigg the morning we took the apartments. I told him I wished him to attend her, and I did not exactly know what was the matter with her, her feet were swollen, and he seemed to understand the case, I did not tell him anything at all about the medical man having attended her, or that Dr. Creasy had seen her. I did not say that Dr. Creasy and other medical men had been attending her. I said the only doctor in the neighbourhood was Dr. Creasy, but he was so far off it would be better to bring her up—I told him I believed it was a sort of paralysis, that she had lost her memory and shook</p>

               <p>a good deal. I returned on Friday, at 11 o'clock. My wife was then insensible. My brother came with me. I found the nurse there. I remained until she died. I was not present in the room at her death. Alice Rhodes had left, Mrs. Patrick Staunton was with me. Her death was announced to me by the nurse. It was the drink that caused the separation between us. The marriage was not with the full sanction of her family, I had some property with her. I had derived benefit to the amount of between two and three thousand pounds. She was entitled to some reversion, which I have sold. The deceased herself wished to be brought up near to London. <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. The child was brought up to Guy's Hospital, and died the same day. The child's name was Thomas Henry Staunton, aged one year. I paid the undertaker 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to bury it at Plaistow, in Essex. The child died on the 8th April last, and was buried on the 16th April. I did not attend the funeral My wife was told of his death. I did not inform my wife's family. I never went to Guy's Hospital myself. I am 26 years of age. My wife was 35 years. Alice Rhodes is 20 years of age. My wife was not of weak intellect; I never noticed it. I did not hear the police were in search of her, or that her mother had been to the Bromley Magistrates for their aid to find her. I know of no one who ever saw her outside my brother's house. I cannot name any one whoever saw her the worse for liquor. I never noticed her emaciation until the Wednesday, 11th April. She was not neglected. She was always clean in her person and dress, but she has always since her marriage had lice in, her hair, her false hair. There was nothing the matter with her but a cold. No box of clothes was brought with her, a hamper with some food. She dropped one of her slippers when carried from the trap to the railway carriage at Bromley Station. She did not speak of supper. She was not conscious when I left Penge. <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GYE</hi>. She would drink if she could get it. I have seen her outside my brother's house. She was a great eater. She was well clothed and had plenty of clothes. She never complained of not being comfortable. She wrote to her mother twice. Until the Monday she was not ill. In the trap a blanket was round her feet. She had her Ulster on, and a shawl, and a rug. Alice Rhodes passed as Mrs. Staunton all the time we have lived at Cudham, and as my wife. I am not aware that my wife knew it We left Norwood the last week in October. Deceased was at Cudham last summer for a short time. Alice Rhodes did not pass as Mrs. Staunton before we came to Cudham. I don't know whether Alice Rhodes is expecting to be confined. The deceased passed as 'a relative' at my brother's.""</p>
               <p>Alice Rhodes, of Little Gray's Farm, Cudham, single woman, says:—I left Little Gray's Farm, about three weeks ago, and I went to No. 3, Park Villas, Lower Norwood, at Mr. Bradford's an auctioneer, where I am now staying. I have known him two years. I knew the deceased six years. I went to reside—at Loughborough Park with Mr. and Mrs. Louis Staunton about six months after they were married. Deceased. said she wished me to remain with her until she went to Norwood. About November she went to Cudham to Mr. Patrick Staunton's, and I went to Little Gray's Farm to keep house for Mr. Louis Staunton. I passed as Mrs. Louis Staunton there, but never before. I often saw the deceased. I did not know she was ill until Wednesday, the 11th April, and she was not very M then. Mr. Staunton sent me to see how she was. I accompanied her to Penge on Thursday. Mrs. Staunton asked me to go with her; she sat between us in an open conveyance. The cabinan carried her into the house,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170072"/>
               <p>but she was able to walk. She undressed herself and took out her own earrings, and was put to bed immediately. She took a little egg that night; In the morning she was a great deal worse. I did not remain until she died; I left about 1 o'clock. I do not know whether she knew about the death of her child. At Cudham she was not attended by any medical man; there was no occasion for it. She was in good health; her illness came on suddenly, I cannot account for it. She was not of weak intellect; she was a little nervous. I never heard of her friends seeking to find her. <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. I saw Mrs. Butterfield at London Bridge Station. She asked me how her daughter war, and where. I told her she was at Brighton with her child and husband, but I did not know her address. I did not tell her what name had been given to the child. I did not tell her I had not seen Mr. Louis Staunton for months. I knew the deceased was not at Brighton, but at Cudham; I said it for a <hi rend="italic">blind</hi>; deceased asked me to tell her mother so. She said she had written to her mother to say she was at Brighton and advised me to say the same. I never saw the deceased at any shops at Cudham. She never cared to go out. Latterly she walked down Cudham, once or twice, not very long ago. I do not know of any visitors coming to Mrs. Patrick Staunton's house. I have seen her outside the meadow several times and generally alone. She did not want to see the tradespeople. I should not say she was of weak intellect, but she was particularly nervous. She disliked being alone. I went to her house, not to manage it for her, but to help her to manage it, to assist her. She was not under the influence of other persons, nor was she easily frightened when harshly spoken to. She appeared to be very fond of her child and nursed it herself. I do not know whether she grieved at its death. She was very weak the evening she left Cudham, but I daresay she could have walked alone had she tried. She was too ill to tell me why she was coming to Penge. She got worse on the journey. She was not able to converse with me freely; she was too ill She helped herself to bed and unfastened her things as quickly as she was able. I did not see that she was in a filthy state; I did not know that she was covered with lice; I did not notice the dirty state she was in. I have seen her the worse for drink, both at Loughborough Park and at Norwood, and 1 think once at Cudham. I never spoke to her of the death of her child, nor did she ever allude to it; I thought that strange. Mr. Louis Staunton took the child to the hospital. Mr. and Mrs. Patrick Staunton were in the trap also. They came back to the farm and said they had left the child at the hospital. They stopped all night and went home on the Monday morning. I heard on the Monday night it was dead. The deceased was quite able to take the journey when we started from Cudham. We sat up all night, expecting the doctor. I intended while we stayed at that house to sleep with the invalid in the same bed."</p>
               <p>"Elizabeth Ann Staunton, wife of Patrick Llewellyn Staunton, an artist of Woodlands, Cndham, sworn, says:—The deceased came to us in November last in a perfect state of health. She had a wish to stay with me. She has been in good health ever since until Monday, 9th April last On Sunday, 8th April, I took the child to Guy's Hospital. I gave there the name of 'Henry Staunton.' I believe the child had another name, bat I do not know it. The child was ill. My husband went with me. Louis Staunton waited at the hospital gate for us. We left the child about 4.30. On Monday night, 9th April, I heard of its death; my husband told me. He had been to take it sonic clothes, and found it was dead. It died on</p>

               <p>the Sunday night soon after we left it in the hospital. I went with the deceased to Penge. She was sitting by the kitchen fire before we started. I helped her to dress. She put her own earrings in. Her hair was always done every morning before breakfast. She always appeared very nice and always had clean clothes. The cabman helped to carry her in. She sat up and began to undo her dress. She thanked me and appeared sensible then. I laid on the bed by the side of her after 3 o'clock a.m. We were expecting the doctor. I left the house about 5 o'clock p.m. I had previously told the landlady she was dead. The deceased requested me to come with her to Penge. Mr. Louis Staunton told the landlady and also the medical man that he was her husband. <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. It was first arranged that the deceased should go to Penge on the Thursday. She had never complained. She was always a thin person. She always had her meals at the same table with ourselves. She was constantly out. The doors were always open. I have seen her out six times at least. I saw her write one letter to her mother. Dr. Creasy once attended my little girl about September last. We took a wicker basket to Penge with us containing clothes for the deceased, and a small parcel containing eggs and butter. I saw Mrs. Butterfield at Little Gray's Farm making inquiries about her daughter. I did not hear her say If I could Only hear my daughter's voice I would be satisfied.' I do not know whether the child was ever christened. The deceased was not at all a woman of weak intellect. <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GYE</hi>. She always had meals at our table; plenty of food. She came down to breakfast daily and washed and dressed herself regularly. She did as she liked and wore what she pleased. She had plenty of clothes, was always well dressed, and clean and fit to be seen. She had several dresses and jewellery. She could go in and out as she liked. My husband was not satisfied with Dr. Creasy when he attended our little girl. We had to hurry away on Thursday. We had no visitors at Cudham. I told Mrs. Butterfield I had dined with the deceased not twenty minutes ago. She said it was a lie. I had directions from Mr. Louis Staunton not to give deceased any spirits. I have not paid Dr. Creasy's bill; I suppose my husband has. Mr. Louis Staunton did not mention Dr. Creasy's name to Mr. Longrigg when we called on him."</p>
               <p>"Patrick Llewellyn Staunton, of Woodlands, Cudharn, artist, eworn, says:—I am brother to Mr. Louis Staunton. In November last I agreed to board and lodge the deceased and her child at 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week. She came in perfect health. She partook of our meals at our table as a relation. My brother desired me to prohibit the deceased the use of spirits, as she had taken them too freely. I had twice seen her the worse for liquor at Brixton, soon after she was married, and many times since, indeed, constantly. I did not see any change in her health until Monday, the 9th April, and then only knew it from what she told me of her feet being swollen; her feet were put into hot water and she was then put to bed by my wife and my servant. My servant waited upon her constantly and regularly. I saw her as she was going up to bed and afterwards when she was in bed; the servant told me she was awake, and I went in to ask her how she was. She answered that she felt all right and the next morning she got up in the usual way. I went the next day to see my mother, at Brixton, and I told her the deceased was not well. I went to Guy's Hospital on Monday, the 9th April. I started at 10 o'clock, got back about 4. I drove to Bromley, then took the train. At Guy's I went into the office and saw</p>

               <p>clerk I was told the child was dead. I called at my brother's and told him of the death. I stayed there about half an hour. I then went home. I told the deceased and she said 'I thought as much,' and she walked out of the room. I swear this positively. She asked no questions, but walked out of the room. Her husband came to see her in the afternoon. I was not present. On Wednesday morning her husband advised and I recommended her removal. She was consulted and consented to go to Penge. He and my wife went to take apartments, and on their return I assisted her in and out of the trap. She did not speak. I don't know that she was insensible. I don't know that she was carried into the train, as my brother was on one side of her and I on the other side, and she put her foot on the ground. She was carried on a chair from the train and put into a cab, and the cabman assisted me to carry her into the house and into the room. She seemed to be then more sensible. She did not speak. I remained until half-past 10, when I accompanied my brother to the doctor's. I left at about 11, and returned to Cudham. The next day I came up with my brother about 11, and was told she had had an epileptic seizure, but no information was given me that she was dying. I left about 2 o'clock and went to my mother's to tell her she was very ill. On my return I found every one had left, and a message for me, and I went to Bromley. There I met my brother at the station. Me had been to tell my mother. The child was born at Brixton; 8, Loughborough Park. I believe it was registered. Dr. Russell, of Coldharbour Lane, attended at the confinement, and recommended a nurse, who remained the usual time, the month. The child was named Thomas Henry. The child was brought to my house, at Cudham, some months before the deceased came in November. It slept in a cot in our room, and my wife attended to it assisted by the servant, Clara Brown. On Saturday, the 7th April, it had convulsions; it was always a thin child, almost all skin and bone. The deceased suggested that it should be carried to Guy's Hospital No medical advice was had. On Sunday it was worse, and I and my wife and my brother went up with it to Guy's. My brother waited outside the hospital and I and my wife went in and left the child with the doctor. I did not attend the funeral. I knew that Alice Rhodes was passing as my brother's wife, as Mrs. Staunton, but I did not know there was any criminal connection whatever. I cannot say whether she so passed for a deception or not. I took the Woodlands two years ago, leaving Brixton to go there on account of my profession. I was not assisted in taking the house in any way with money got from the marriage of my brother with the deceased. The child who died was the child of the deceased.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. Clara Brown was at Brixton, in March 1876, at the time of the confinement. In August, 1876, the deceased visited us at Cudham, and stayed a week with the child. She visited us four or five times; she was then living at Norwood. When with us she had perfect health; she was not a person of weak intellect and was perfectly capable of managing her household and her own affairs. We had no visitors, but Mr. Bradford. The deceased used to go out for—walks. We have seven acres of ground, she used to go in the wood and on the public road. I have seen my brother drive her out in a wagonette. I knew that Alice Rhodes passed as his wife; the deceased passed as a relation. My brother and Alice Rhodes came constantly to our house, three or four times a week, and deceased sat down at the same table with them and us, and partook of our</p>

               <p>meals and made no objection and showed no jealously. Deceased was in perfect health till the Monday, 9th April, washed and dressed her child herself. Deceased knew Dr. Creasy had attended my child, when it had been ill, knew that he had called five or six times, but she did not suggest he should be sent for to attend on her own child. She suggested it should be sent to Guy's; she said when told of its death 'I thought as much. She never asked where it was buried, nor the name of the doctor, nor what ward it was in, nor express any wish to see the body of the child, nor as to wbrt members of her family should attend the funeral. Deceased was in perfect health. I saw no change in her till the Monday. I did not send for Dr. Creasy, as I have no faith in him. It would take twenty minutes to go to my brother's. He had a wagonette which could have fetched a medical man in half an hour, but no medical advice was sought.—Deceased had a slight impediment in her speech on the Tuesday, a slight stutter. Although I knew that the child died immediately subsequent, to removal it did not occur to me to take medical advice previous to removing the mother. I suggested taking her to Penge, so that a physician might be obtained, should the doctor there think it necessary, but I did not consider her so seriously ill as to require a physician. I did not call on Mrs. Hincksmau, on the Wednesday. The distance from my house to the station is about 8 miles, then there was the railway journey making it about 10 miles altogether. I do not know how long it took us to drive. It takes me about an hour to drive it. I met Mrs. Butterfield, at London Bridge, one day, and she enquired about the deceased. She abused me and got a great crowd round us. I had arrived from Cudham, by the train. I told her that her daughter was quite well. She said "No, she was not, she was confined in a asylum. I told her she was not in an asylum, and she swore at me and I walked away then. I did not say 'Damn your daughter.' I never used such a word. She said 'I am going to Cudham.' I never said 'If you do I'll blow your brains out, as I keep a loaded gun.' I did not use that expression, nor any similar expression. I said I did not see what she could gain by going to Cudham. I said she would not see her daughter, because I knew she would not be allowed to Bee her. I was at London Bridge Station the railway porters were there, and a crowd she collected round us. I did not knew that she had applied on the 9th April last, to the Magistrates at Bromley. I never heard of it. The removals of the deceased and the child were not in order to evade registering the deaths in the district, or to avoid inquiries. I made no inquiry as to what district Penge was in, nor did I know in what district it was. While in the trap the deceased made some remark about a dog, and she also spoke to her husband. She said nothing about the slipper that was dropped. I was not aware that she had lice upon her, and I was much surprised to hear it. When I first knew her she was a very cleanly person, and she dressed as a lady should. I was at Penge on Sunday, 15th April I then saw Mr. Lougrigg. I went to see him to ask why the funeral did not take place after his giving his certificate; we thought there must be some mistake. I id not go to the undertaker's. The undertaker and Sergeant Bateman came to Cudham to my brother's, and by chance I was there. I undertake to say that I saw the deceased the worse for drink at least three times while she was in my house; I do not know how she got the drink. <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GYE</hi>. The deceased looked after her child herself, washed and dressed it, looked</p>

               <p>after it in every way until its illness and removal. The child had plenty of clothes; clothes were brought to my house for the child several times by my brother. The deceased bad plenty of clothes of very good description. She looked after her own clothes and the child's. My wife did not interfere, She was allowed to do just as she liked; she went out and about of her own free will; there was no sort of restraint put upon her, none whatever. The child had pretty good health, but was always thin, it had never had a lie attack before. I was much dissatisfied with Dr. Creasy and did not, there fore call him in. Deceased understood the child was ill and understood the purpose of its going to London. She was quite well up to the Monday. It was on the Wednesday she stammered, not on the Tuesday. She appreciated the suggestion that she should go to Penge, and was willing to go. I noticed nothing wrong with her, except the swelling of the feet, and she said her throat seemed a little sore, she said she thought she had a cold. She put one hand on my shoulder and the other on the rail of the trap and put her foot on the step to get into the vehicle. She had list slippers, because her feet were swollen, and she had a blanket to keep them warm. Clothes were taken with her in a lady's travelling basket, a wicker basket, lined inside. I did not pack it, but as far as I know, that basket was full of clothes. There were no appearances in the deceased which, in my judgment, rendered it unwise to take the journey, none whatever. It took us about an hour and a quarter to drive. I had not the slightest idea that her death was so near, or that her stace was in any way dangerous. She had no influence exercised over her to induce her to go. During the time she was in my house she was, in my opinion, capable of taking care of herself. I said Mrs. Butterfield would not be allowed to see her, not that she could not see her.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Alice Bhodes saw Mrs. Butterfield on a different occasion. There was no particular reason for having the door of the lodgings at Penge ready opened; the landlady could have opened it if we had rung the bell I contradict the statement of the lady that she did not know until an hour and a half after we arrived that we were in the house, she knew it under the hour. I do not know whether the child had any godfather or godmother. It is about a mile to my brother's farm from my house, in twenty minutesl can walk it, at an ordinary pace. The deceased was not kept secreted. I did not telegraph to my brother to warn him that Mrs. Butterfield was coming down. There were no precautions and no pains taken to keep her private. I never knew the inspector and sergeant on duty at Sevenoaks were about my place. I swear positively that 1 neither directly or indirectly bad information of any application to the Bromley Bench of Magistrates. I presume Penge is in the County of Surrey; I did not think about what district it was in. We talked of driving all the way, but we did not know the road, and I think that was the reason we took the train. When I took the deceased there I did not think anything at all about what county it was in. I did not tell the deceased on the Sunday night about the child. I stayed at mj brother's, as it was a pouring wet night. I told her nothing about it until I told her on the Monday night that it was dead. She was not restrained in any way, only with regard to the drink. I have not paid Dr. Creas's account, unless my wife has."</p>

I am a batchelor of medicine at the University of Oxford, a member of the Royal College of Physicians, assistant lecturer on pathology at St. Thomas' Hospital, examiner in pathology at the University of Edinburgh, and editor of Jones and Sieveking's "Manual of Pathological Anatomy"—I have had a large experience of <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examinations, and have been engaged in the study of subjects relating thereto for several years—a summary of the depositions of the medical witnesses taken before the Magistrates, and copies of the notes of be <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination were submitted to me by letter by Messrs. Lewis and Lewis—I forget the precise date, about the end of July this year—it was before the last Sessions of this Court—I was anxious not to be called as a witness upon general grounds, but not with reference to this particular case—I have been in attendance during the trial except the first day—I was here on Thursday and heard all the medical evidence on that day; I heard Dr. Longrigg say that the symptoms he discovered were inconsistent with tubercular meningitis, and inconsistent with rigidity of the arm—if 1 understood rightly Mr. Longrigg was asked whether the symptoms observed by him would be consistent with a disease known as tubercular meningitis, and he answered that if the disease were sufficiently established the symptoms would correspond with one exception, that exception being rigidity of the arms—in my experience, rigidity of the limbs one or more, is very common—the rigidity of one or more limbs is a very common symptom of tubercular meningitis, the present case at all events—I believe that symptom is mentioned in most, if not all the books on the subject—the appearance in cases of tubercular meningitis of a flattening and bulging of the sides of the lobes of the brain depends on the amount of fluid contained in the brain, and if the amount of fluid is small that appearance is not produced—in my opinion the absence of it is consistent with the fact of death being caused by tubercular meningitis—with respect to the position of the tubercles found in the brain, they are found in different parts of the brain, in different situations—undoubtedly they vary very much in number and appearance as well as position—the symptoms spoken of, namely, the flattening and bulging of the lobes of the brain, and the effusion into the</p>

               <p>ventricles vary very much—they are much more marked when the tubercles are found at the base of the brain—I think the fact of death from tubercular meningitis is consistent with the fact of no tubercles being found at the base of the brain—I should add to that, no tubercles visible to the naked eve—in the event of tubercles being found in the upper part of the brain, it is very likely, by microscopic examination, you would find that there were appearances which were not visible to the naked eye—it is probable that if you found tubercles in one part of the membrane of the brain, there exists the probability that on a microscopic examination you would find others in other parts which were not visible to the naked eye—if you found some tubercles which were visible to the naked eye, it is possible by microscopic examination you would find more in other parts of the surface of the brain—I heard the statement made by Dr. Longrigg in regard to the average weight of different portions of the body—of some of them I took a note, but I am not sure that I did of all—I heard Dr. Longrigg say that the average weight of a woman of 5 feet 5 1/4 inches high would be from 9 to 10 stone—I think a much lower—weight than 9 stone would be consistent with health—the weights of different organs of persons in health vary very considerably.</p>

I think the weight of the heart as stated in this case to have been 7 3/4 ozs. is very much below the normal weight for a person in a healthy condition—I do not say below the average weight—I say below the weight consistent with ordinary health, bat only a little below it—I understood the liver to weigh 2 lbs. 2 oz.—whether that is correct I do not know—in my experience the average weight of the liver of a woman like the deceased as stated, viz. from 50 to 60 ozs. is somewhat too high—I should say probably 48 or 50 ozs. giving a rough estimate; about 3lbs.—it is very" difficult to say what the lowest weight would be, compatible with health—I think the weight of the liver was much below the average—with regard to the spleen which is said to have weighed 4 3/4 ozs., that is an organ—the weight of which is very variable, so that no very great importance can be attached to it—with regard to the kidneys the weights I took down were 3 3/4 and 4 ozs. respectively—those weights seem to me to be scarcely below the normal weights, a little below the normal but very little—I heard the statement that inflamation of the peritoneum was discovered on the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I do not think that is a symptom which would arise from deprivation of food, taken alone—with regard to the congestion of the brain and stomach, and of the outlets of the body, I do not think deprivation of food, taken alone, would produce congestion of the brain or congestion of the stomach—with respect to the condition of the outlets that is mentioned in several books as occurring in people who are deprived of food—I understand by that that the orifices of the body which are exposed to the air and to irritation, such as the lips, the nose, the anus and so on become inflamed—I have never seen it, but I have heard it described, or rather read the description—the congestion of the brain I should attribute to the tubercular disease which is described as having been present there; the inflamation of the peritoneum I cannot explain, unless there were possibly tubercles present there also—in other words I regard the tubercles and the congestion, as a part of the same disease—this kind of tubercular disease in the brain, namely the small</p>

               <p>milliary tubercles, accompanied by great congestion in most cases indicate) a general infection of the whole body which we call acute general tuber<lb/>culosis—my judgment as to that was greatly confirmed by the presence of tubercles in the lungs—with regard to the inflamation of the peritoneum, that in my judgement might be produced by tubercles invisible to the naked eye—bronzing of the skin is nearly always present in Addison's disease, and there is some approach to it in diabetes—I do not know of any other certain indication of diabetes than sugar in the urine after death—in Addison's disease 1 know of no other invariable sympton except the condition of the super-renal capsules—I think the traces of intemperate habits are discoverable after death, if the intemperate habits have lasted a long time—if they have only lasted for a few months and had been discontinued I think the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> appearances would be fallacious—we often have people in the hospitals who have formerly been intemperate—I have no doubt 1 have had <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examinations under such circumstances, but 1 cannot recollect any particular one at the moment; after a few month's discontinuance there might be no trace—tubercular meningitis or tubercolis does not so much produce emaciation, as it is a fact accompanied by it, and sometimes produced by it; it would produce it if it lasted long—it is not so much a consequence as an accompaniment and sometimes a precursor; it is not so much produced by it as proceeded by it—he loss of flesh is sometimes the only premonitory symptom of tubercular meningitis—it is often the only premonitory symptom, which comes before the outbreak of other symptoms—when it does manifest itself it is a rapidly fatal disease—by rapidly, I mean from two days to a month perhaps—it is quite possible that up to the time the disease actually manifests itself, progressive emaciation is the only symptom—in my judgment I think if the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> appearances are correctly described, of course I am not responsible for the description, but if they are correctly described I think they are consistent with death from tubercular disease—with regard to the symptoms during life which have been described, as coma, unequal dilitation of the pupils, rigidity of the arms, and stertorous breathing, I think they are quite consistent with death from this decease—I think starvation alone does not explain either all the symptoms before death or all the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> appearances—in the course of my experience I have seen death result from that disease in a considerable number of children and a considerable number of adults—not from starvation, from this disease—I may say that I have had considerable experience of this disease at the hospital for children where I was formerly assistant physician—I have seen it chiefly in children, and also in adults, the disease being far less common in adults than in children—in the course of my practice I have seen emaciation to a very great extent; I could not however say to the same extent as in this case without having seen the thing myself—I am not prepared to express an opinion as to the degree without having seen it—I can quote a particular case from memory—it was the case of a child an out-patient at the hospital for children—I attended the child there and afterwards at it's own home—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination and found that it died of tubercular meningitis combined with some tubercles in the lungs, and it was so emaciated that I remember particularly a remark made by the mother who was ex<lb/>tremely affectionate—she asked me to explain the death of the child, because she said the neighbours accused her of starving it—I was told that the condition of the child gave rise to the suspicion of starvation in the minds of</p>

               <p>the neighbours—I have never seen a case in which, tubercles were present in the pia mater without producing some symptoms; more especially I should I say indicating disease in the head; head, symptoms—I have seen cases of tubercular meningitis in which there was not softening of the brain—they are not frequent or common—after that disease it is stated that in some cases the brain is found to be firm and not softened—the fact of the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> being delayed until after the patient had been dead six days would Dot affect the possibility of drawing accurate and safe conclusions on most points—there are no points which have occurred to my mind in which the delay in the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> would throw doubt on the accuracy of the conclusions; not on the material points which I have heard mentioned.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. Taking the notes of the <hi rend="italic">postmortem</hi> examination and the depositions as I have read them, I come to the opinion that death in this case was caused by tubercular meningitis—that opinion has been confirmed by the medical evidence that I have heard—when I speak of tubercular meningitis I mean the acute form of the disease—I am not prepared to say what is the average weight of a woman of 5 feet 5 1/4 inches, but, generally, I should say, about 9 stone—if this woman was 9 stone on the 23rd October, and on the 12th or 13th April she was 5 stone 4 pounds, I should, undoubtedly, call it a case of extreme wasting and emaciation—it was a case, from what I have heard, of extreme emaciation—I do not think the <hi rend="italic">postmortem</hi> examination disclosed how long this acute tubercular meningitis had been going on—the acute stage could cot, from the evidence, have been more than a few days—the disease is more likely to make its appearance in an enfeebled condition of the body than in a person of good health—tuberculosis sometimes supervenes on emaciation caused by any wasting disease—it would be more likely than in a perfectly healthy patient, undoubtedly—it is a rare complaint—in treating the disease I should prescribe nourishment, tonic medicine, and so forth—warmth, of course, is necessary in all cases of illness—it would be bad treatment to keep such a patient in a room without a fire in winter—it would be exceedingly dangerous treatment—the necessity for such a patient having exercise in the fresh air would depend on circumstances which I do not know; it would depend on the state to be relieved—judging from the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> appearances I should say the disease could not have been present more than a month at the outside—I cannot tell what caused the emaciation, without consideration of the history—we call the three coverings of the brain collectively, the meningitis, and in this disease the condition would be chiefly the deposit of tubercules, with more' or less inflammation—probably the deposit of tubercles would cause inflammation, but that is a question of opinion—the condition of the brain generally in this disease is in the majority of cases soft, and a deposit of tubercles is found at the base of the brain—I known Dr. Bristowe—he is physician at St. Thomas' Hospital, and I am assistant-physician; I know his work—in one passage he say "Meningitis, due to the presence of tubercles, nearly always commences at the base of the brain,—is often limited to the base and is generally most intense there"—I agree with nearly all of that—I do not know that starvation ever causes congestion of the brain—it is said in the last stages to be accompanied by convulsions—if a patient had congestion I should not necessarily expect convulsions to follow—I should not be surprised to find that condition if he had convulsions—if after death from convulsions I found congestion</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170084"/>
               <p>of the brain I should rather presume that the congestion caused the convulsions, than that it was caused by the convulsions—I am not' pre<lb/>pared to say that congestion causes convulsions, it would be likely—you might find congestion after death, because the convulsions and the congestion might have arisen from the same cause—maniacal delirium, I think, would be rather caused by congestion, than be the cause of congestion—in the case of a ship-wrecked man in an open boat becoming delirious, the delirium would be caused by starvation and thirst, the man becomes mad; that is described here—I have no doubt that it is the result of deprivation from food and drink—I should not expect congestion of the stomach, from starvation—in the case of a person enfeebled from want of food and having a pretty substantial meal suddenly administered I should expect to find the stomach then as it is during digestion, that is, full of blood, or, as you say, congested—if the vessels are gorged they are congested—I do not know what to expect in such a case as you put—I never saw such a case—I should feed such a person gradually—I am not prepared to say what the precise harm of doing otherwise is, but it is a matter of experience that harm is done—I understood Mr. Longrigg to say that stiffness of the arms was inconsistent with meningitis; I did not understand him to say that it was not consistent with paralysis—paralysis does not produce stiffness of the limbs—it may produce stiffness of the limbs if it has lasted a long time, when the patient has not motive power, but has rested in the same position for a long time—I do not find from the evidence in what part of the peritoneum, that is the bag containing the stomach and intestines, the inflammation was found—it might be in the coating of the stomach or it might be in the walls of the abdomen; I have no information—I do not think the giving of food in a considerable quantity to a starved person would be likely to cause inflammation of the stomach, or of the coating of the stomach—I am not prepared to say whether the internal coating would be likely to be inflammed, I have had no experience—I have never seen a case of wilful starvation—I have seen a case of virtual starvation, where the patient could not take food for a considerable time—emaciation comes on in those cases steadily, not always rapidly, because you combat it, you administer as much food as you can, and if you cannot administer it by the throat you inject it—I have listened to the evidence and have heard the condition of the lady before she was removed from the" Woodlands, and the evidence of Clara Brown, and I think the removal from Cudham would be likely to accelerate her death.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Doctor of Medicine and Fellow of the College of Physicians—I have not been consulted in any way in this matter before to-day—I sent you (Mr. Clarke) a private note in this matter—I am senior physician at St. Thomas's Hospital, and examiner in medicine at the College of Surgeons—I have heard the evidence that Dr. Payne has given, and I agree with it entirely—in cases of death from tubercular meningitis it is a frequent thing to find rigidity of the limbs—that disease is very various in its symptoms, it is not infrequent that the acute manifestation of the disease is preceded by a period of progressive gradual emaciation—it may be a long period of emaciation—emaciation is one of the recognised symptoms of tuberculosis—in its acute form emaciation is often the only sign of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170085"/>
               <p>the disease—the tubercles are often so minute as almost to defy detection; they sometimes require the microscope for their detection—I have never seen a case where there were tubercles in the pia-mater where there were no head symptoms during life—I have not looked up my experience for this examination as to there being capes of tubercular meningitis where there is do tubercle at the base of the brain, but I believe it does occur; I have seen cases where the tubercles have been limited to the upper part of the brain, but it is rare—there would in such a case be an absence of the flattening and bulging of the lobes of the brain and absence of effusion—I have necessarily a large experience of vermin on the body, at a hospital—it is a fact that where there are vermin at all on the hair they constantly spread immediately after death—they would spread over the body in a few hours; as the body cools the vermin spread over the whole body, over the trunk—in the case of a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>, examination where the body had not been washed after death, the presence of vermin all over the body six days after death would not necessarily indicate any great amount of filth before death; it would depend on the condition of the patient before death—if the patient had been bed ridden or comatose before death, or had lain for several days or weeks before death, it is common to find even in a well ordered hospital, that the head is infested with vermin—I should expect then to find them in great numbers—in any case where there had been vermin in the head during life, and the body was left unwashed and intended during six days, the might vermin spread over the body, and I should expect to find them spreading.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. I do not think vermin as a rule bite the skin, not ordinary lice; they rather live on the scurf of the hair, they are rather scavengers—I do not think that body lice bite, I am not prepared to say—I agree generally with Dr. Payne, in every essential particular—I have not talked this over with Dr. Payne; I only returned to London on Saturday, and have not had an opportunity—I enterain no doubt of this being a case of acute tuberculosis—as to the emaciation I have not gone into the early history of the case—I should say that 9 stone for a woman of 5 ft. 5 inches would be rather above the average; I do not speak positively, these are matters which require one to look into figures—I have read the evidence in the papers, that is all the knowledge I have of it—no doubt it was a case of considerable emaciation—I do not know that I can attribute that to anything without knowing more of the case—it is consistent with starvation, and with emaciation produced by tubercular disease—a patient may emaciate as rapidly as the deceased in less than a month, and to the same degree—I know nothing about the emaciation in this woman, and can give no opinion on the point—I do not suppose it took place in a month—I have undoubtedly known a case of acute tuberculosis which produced emaciation such as this—I cannot give you the particulars of any one case, but I have seen a good many cases, where it has been proved at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination that tubercles have been in progress for more than a month; but where the symptoms have not been apparent more than a month, and emaciation has preceded the acute symptoms, it is likely to happen in the case of a person who was very much emaciated, but who is not suffering from tuberculosis that you would have tuberculosis supervening—it would come on in the course of it, but not be produced by it—I do not know that it would be accelerated by it—I should not call tubercolosis the cause of the emacia<lb/>tion,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170086"/>
               <p>but the result of it—the emaciation has gone on and might have been caused by a variety of things, and then tuberculosis sets in—I should not, in that case, say that emaciation was necessarily caused by the tuberculosis; or, on the other hand, that the tuberculosis caused the emaciation—tuberculosis takes place not only with the enfeebled, but in the stout and comparatively well—tuberculosis might come on in a body in an impoverished state, but not as the result of previous emaciation or ill-health—where that has been the case we have found evidence that there has been tubercle beforehand, before the acute symptoms manifested themselves—I mean to say there is no necessary connection between tuberculosis and emaciation—tuberculosis may come on in a person who has been exhausted by disease, or it may come on in a healthy person, or it may not have manifested itself by acute symptoms in the way that Dr. Payne has described—it is impossible to say if tuberculosis had not assumed the acute form, how long it would take to produce such emaciation as 1 have heard of in this particular case—I have no means of saying whether emaciation, when caused in this way, may have been produced in a month, six weeks, or a year—I believe I have seen an entire absence of fat round the omentum, in the acute disease; lam not quite sure—I should not expect to find it after death from acute tuberculosis only—I still entertain the view contained in the passage from my work which you read to Dr. Payne—I should generally expect to find effusion about the seat of the tubercles—I do not know that there was none in this case—I only know what I have heard in Court.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Peabody Buildings, Islington—my husband is John Carmody—the prisoner was married to my husband's niece, Bridget, nine years ago come November—they resided in Russell Street, Brighton, and the prisoner was carrying on the business of a working tailor—they had four children; the youngest died in June last—the deceased was very much distressed at the loss of it—she came up from Brighton towards the end of July, and came to me about 2.30 with two children—I had had the oldest girl with me since Whitsuntide—she stayed with me till the Friday evening, when her uncle came, and he and she went to look after her husband—she came buck and stopped with me that night—on Monday, 30th July, I went</p>

               <p>out with her for a walk, and when we returned we found the prisoner lying on the bed—my husband was then at home—that was about 5.20—the deceased went into the room where he was lying—the eldest child, who was staying at my place, went in with her—she did not remain there very long—the child came running out and said "Dadda is beating mamma"—my husband sent her back again—she ran out a second time, and my husband then went out and brought in a policeman—while my husband was out I went into the room, and the prisoner got up and struck his wife in my presence, at the side of the head—he then lay on the bed again—the deceased was crying, and she was in a great passion, because his father had beat her in the street—she went towards the prisoner as if to hit him, and he made a kick at her as he lay on his back on the bed—my husband came back with the policeman and he put the prisoner out of my place—while the constable was there the prisoner sat on a box putting on his boots; the deceased went over to speak to him and he—went to hit her, but the constable warded off the blow—when they went out the constable wanted to know if my husband would give him in charge—he said no, he only wanted him out of the place—in about ten minutes the prisoner came back—he came to the door and demanded her to go with him—she came out on the mat of my door to speak to him, and her uncle with her—she said she would not go with him till he had a home to go to, and with that he struck at my husband and my husband struck at him—he then went away—the deceased did not remain with us that night; ire had to send her away, the superintendent would not allow us to keep her—she went to Mrs. Prentice's, a widow, in Commercial Street—she afterwards came to me on the Thursday evening and stayed with me till Friday—on the Friday evening she went to meet my daughter coming from work, and they returned together—she was then crying very much, and her lip was cut and her mouth bleeding—her handkerchief was full of blood—she stayed with me that Friday night—on Saturday morning she went out about 10 o'clock—she came back about 2.30—she did not sleep at my place that night, she slept with a friend in South Street, a Mrs. Prentice—on Sunday the 5th she came to my place about 9 o'clock in the morning, and remained there during the day—about 5.30 in the afternoon a child came in with a message, and the deceased put on her things and went out—I went with her at her request—we went to the corner of Green Man Street, where we met the prisoner and the three of us walked to<lb/>gether through Essex Road and down River Street to Marquess Road—during all that time we had been on the best of terms, no words were spoken in anger—at the comer of Marquess Road the prisoner asked us to come and have something, and we went with him into the public-house at the corner, the Myddleton, I think it is—he called for a quartern of Irish whiskey and some lemonade—I and Bridget sat on a seat outside the bar and he stood at the bar—I drank out of one glass and he drank out of the other with bis wife; he paid for it—we were there about ten minutes—we then went down the Canonbury Road—on the way Bridget turned to him and said "Is there anybody waiting for you?"—he said "Only Martin and <hi rend="italic">Patsy;</hi> those are his two brothers, Martin and Patrick Lynch—I said "I won't go where they are, Bridget, I don't want to meet those Lynches again after their behaviour in my house"—the prisoner turned to me and said "Now, Mrs. Carmody, you must not be disagreeable, I warrant you there will not be a word of quarrelling, or a word of anger"—he whistled, and his brothers came up and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170089"/>
               <p>joined us—Martin said "We will go on back again to the public-house and have another treat"—so we all went back to the same public-house again and one of the brothers called for some whiskey and a pot of stout; some of us par<lb/>took of one, and some of the other—we remained there about twenty minutes—<hi rend="italic">Patsy</hi> said he was glad to see them together again—the prisoner said he had so many shops to work at that week that he had to give his brother Martin a quantity of it—after leaving the public-house we went down Canon<lb/>bury Road again, and they then proposed to go into the Two Brewers at the top of King Street, we did so, and they called for some more drink there—we then came out and stood talking in the Essex Road about the three brothers going home together in a cab—I told the prisoner there was a cab rank in Rotherfield Street—they saw a Hansom coming, Patrick whistled to the driver, and he and Martin got in—the prisoner was waiting—I said to him "Come on, John, there's a good fellow, you get in, and I promise you she shall be up at 10 o'clock to-morrow morning;"' that was to meet him up at the West End, where the brothers lived—when <hi rend="italic">Patsy</hi> had got into the cab Bridget turned round to me and said "Aunt, what do you think, <hi rend="italic">Patsy</hi> says <hi rend="italic">Johnny</hi> has a razor"—I can't say whether the prisoner heard that, he was only a little way off, he made no remark—I went up to the cab door and spoke <hi rend="italic">to Patsy</hi>—I can't tell whether the prisoner heard what I said, he was about 2 or 3 yards off, he stood with his back to the kerb—I said <hi rend="italic">"Patsy</hi>, you never would be so wicked as to say your brother has a razor"—he made some reply, and Martin jumped out of the cab and said to his brother Patrick "You b——so-and-so, now I shan't go with you"—Bridget then turned to the prisoner and said "<hi rend="italic">Johnny</hi>, surely you never have got a razor about you, what should you want that for?"—he made no reply that I heard; she said "Let me try your pocket, <hi rend="italic">Johnny</hi>, I have often tried your pockets, it is no harm "—I was quite close to her when she said those words—he wore his coat open—she went to put her hand in his left coat pocket, and as she did that I saw his right hand raised up—she was facing him—I thought he was going to catch her by the neck, and she then said to me "Aunt, I am killed"—I did not see what he did—she said those words at the moment, as soon as his hand was raised; she then wheeled round and ran like one wild, across the road, and when she got on the other side she dropped—I followed her quickly, I saw the blood pouring, and 1 could not go near her; she sat or fell on the kerb—I saw her head falling down as I went over—up to the moment when she said those words to him about the razor they, appeared to be on friendly terms, he was quite satisfied to let her come home with me and meet her on the Monday morning; there was not a word of anger, except between themselves; she had not quarrelled, or shown any violence, or temper—I turned into the road and cried "Murder!" and "Police!" and asked the people to fetch a doctor—I afterwards saw the prisoner in the custody of a policeman, by the side of the body; she was dead in a moment—I said to him "Oh, you villain, you have done it, you have killed her, you villain"—he said "Yes, and it is all your fault"—my niece was twenty-four years old on 19th August.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Mr. Gathorne Hardy, of 17, Grosvenor Crescent, and am a customer of Madame Elise, a milliner, of 170, Regent Street—on 23rd July I received this letter "21st July, 1877. Madam,—We beg to enclose your account, and as we have some heavy accounts to remit to the Continent on Monday next, we should feel much obliged to be favoured with an open cheque on account through our Mia Rowe, who will have the pleasure of waiting on you for that purpose on Monday next, at 11 a.m. Yours respectfully,—Elise, p.p. F.W." (<hi rend="italic">The paper was embossed</hi> 170, <hi rend="italic">"Regent Street," and the envelope bore the monogram "E"</hi>) A sum of money was due from me to Madame Elise—I received an account that morning, and I concluded from the note that it came in that envelope—I had requested Madame Elise to send in her account—a young woman called that morning at 11 o'clock when I was out, and in the afternoon, when I saw her—she said she had called for the account—I said I thought it very odd that Madame Elise should send her bill in to me so punctually—she said it was equally disagreeable for her to call, but that there was a pressure for money that morning and she had been all round the neighbourhood collecting bills—I could not find my keys and told her that if she would come in the evening I would have a cheque drawn and pay the bill, and she said she would call about 6.45—I have never seen her since—I subsequently went to Madame Elise and paid the cheque, when they said they had never sent, and I found out that it was a fraud—the girl who called on me was a common looking girl.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had been out of town previously to receiving the letter—my things were sent to the railway station and given up to me in my car<lb/>riage, and on my way to Grosvenor Crescent I read some of my letters—my memory does not serve me as to the account coming in the same envelope with the letter, but I thought it probable from reading the note.</p>

Hardy for the account, or to ask for an open cheque—subsequently to Mrs. Hardy bringing me the letter a letter came to my premises addressed to the prisoner—our chief clerk brought it to me, and seeing the similarity of writing I opened it and read it—I subsequently re-sealed it and gave it to the chief clerk to give it to the prisoner—these fragments comprise the letter. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "As soon as you get this, meet me at once in Golden Square as I want to speak to you particularly you must come at once. F.") After the prisoner had received the letter I went to Golden Square where I saw a man and a young woman standing at the corner—the prisoner came up and spoke to them and remained in conversation about five minutes—I went up to the prisoner and asked him to come back to the office—I asked him to show me the letter he had just received and he said he had not got it, that he had torn it up and thrown it in the waste paper basket—I went to the basket and took out these fragments which I have pasted together—I asked him who the people were who he had met and he said the tall man was a friend of his father's, and the young woman he had no knowledge of—he could not give me their names or addresses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had a character with the prisoner, which has turned out to be fictitious—while in our employ he wrote letters to French houses for goods—he had access to the room where the safe was—I thoroughly trusted him—he would draw bills and get my acceptance to them—we originally advertised for a boy; the prisoner applied for the situation, we offered 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I mean to convey that the character was forged; it was in writing—I do not believe the person who wrote it ever employed him—he has not told me that he had not—some people who had employed him before called on us and showed us a character they had received with him—we cannot find the person from whom the character purported to come—when we came back from Golden Square I sent for a constable and asked the prisoner to give the name of the young person who spoke to him—I asked him why he had sent the letter and account to Mrs. Hardy, and he denied having done so—he made no attempt to escape but walked back with me.</p>

I am stage manager at the Princess's Theatre—Mr. Chatterton is the lessee—the prisoner was employed as dresser, and had charge of one of the dressing-rooms; he had to attend upon the actors in that room—Mr. Clarkson contracts for those rooms to supply wigs, towels, and soap—the prisoner was engaged by the housekeeper of the theatre—I believe I had been at the theatre twelve months, and the prisoner for a few weeks—Mr. Terriss brought him, I believe—the dressers have no right to take the soap, or any perquisites, to my. knowledge; nothing of the kind is recognised by the management—on 22nd August, about 11.30, Phelps the porter brought the prisoner to me. and said "This man, Harris, on leaving the theatre, had a bundle under his arm containing this quantity of soap, and I stopped him"—I told him he had better get a constable and give him in charge, as I had strict orders from Mr. Chatterton that any employed leaving the theatre with articles was to be searched.</p>

I am assistant to Mr. Russell—on Saturday, 11th August, at about 1 o'clock, I was in the shop when the prisoner came in with another boy to look at at a set of studs, which I showed to the other boy—the prisoner put his hand in the window, took out a gold watch worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and ran out, I ran after him and caught him in Maidenhead Court—I saw him in the act of throwing—I then picked up this ticket, which was attached to the watch—I did not find the watch—I took the prisoner to the station—I did not lose sight of him from the time he took the watch to the time I came up to him—I left the other boy in the shop and he ran in an opposite direction—I cannot account for what became of the watch—the railway runs at the side of Moorgate Street and I am afraid it went over there—the ticket, being light, stopped behind.</p>

I live at 138, Upper Park Road, Hampstead—Chapman was in my service nine months up to the time of his being taken in custody—Gee had been my groom and left about eighteen months ago—he lodged near our place at the time of the robbery—I left home about 5th or 6th August, and on the 27th, in consequence of some informa<lb/>tion I returned home—before going away I hid locked my billiard-room, and put the key in my bureau and locked it—I found that in the same condition as when I left with the exception of the things taken from the bureau mentioned in the indictment—I found my billiard-room had been opened and four pieces of carpet, a piece of Chinese matting, a leather bag, a pair of mittens, a silk hat, a pair of trousers, and other articles had been token from it—I also found that a silver watch, a gold pin, a locket, a pair of sleeve links, a signet ring, two blankets, and various other articles of clothing to the value of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been taken from my place—I went with a detective to Gee's place—on leading us to his room I observed my carpets on the floor, and I said "These are my carpets," and then I said "Now I want two blankets belonging to me"—he immediately turned up his bed and gave them to me—they were between the mattrass and the iron part of the bedstead—they were nearly new—the policeman asked him if there was anything else, and Gee said "These are all the things I have belong<lb/>ing to Mr. Hawkins"—on further searching the room we found the four pieces of carpet, the piece of Chinese matting, a leather bag, a pair of mittens, a silk hut, a shaving brush, &amp;c.—he said he had bought the things to help Chapman, on the road to Hamburg—the trousers were found on the prisoner—they were a pair belonging to my groom that he left, and which had never before been in Chapman's possession; they had been abstracted from the billiard-room—I had not given any of the things away—I bad last year a gold ring, which Gee admitted-at the police-court, at Hampstead, he had lost.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I mentioned the ring at the Hampstead police-court, and he admitted to Mallett, 270<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., losing the ring—I cannot say whether that was taken down in the deposition—I believe it was read over to me as part of my evidence—I cannot swear that the policeman told me he admitted losing the ring—I believe he did—I have never given my groom any of my clothes—I did not say at the police-court "I have occasionally given my groom old clothes"—this is my signature—I do not think I said</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Lattey and Hart, solicitors, of 142, Gresham House, Old Broad Street—we are agents to the official assignee of the Insolvent Debtors' Court, Calcutta—on the 11th August, we received from the official assignee of the Court in Calcutta, a letter containing: this first, exhibit A.

(<hi rend="italic">This letter represented that Rushton Brothers had made arrangements to give the prisoner a quarter share of all Rushton Brothers' European, American, and Egyptian business, with certain exceptions, and was signed "B.

Rushton had given the prisoner into custody on the previous day for stealing a telegraphic code—I learnt it afterwards.</p>

I am a merchant in partnership with three others in Calcutta—we commenced the partnership in 1860—I knew the prisoner while I was in Calcutta—he was a merchant, I heard in England of his having failed—I came over to England in February, 1875, for the purpose of establishing a branch—I took premises in Lime Street—I had no personal communication with the prisoner till January, 1876—I had received a communication from my brothers, after which I saw the prisoner—I did not refer to that communication to him nor he to me—I said "Take a seat in the office and go on with the business"—I knew he was coming, by the communication from my firm in Calcutta, and by that only—I arranged with him to pay him 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month, which was to be debited to the account—his duties were Continental correspondence and Continental business in general and to bring in some of his old constituents to our business—he was to have 25 percent, on business he brought in—he remained in our employ until the morning of the 27th June, 1877—he brought in some business, not to a very large extent, perhaps 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the gross amount of value of the goods; the transactions resulted in a loss—I have not, under my arrangement, to pay him on those—two or three telegraphic codes were started about March 1876, and May or June, 1877, by the prisoner—he was to make them for our business—some time subsequently to January I increased his salary to 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month—I entered into no agreement with him whatever beyond what I have stated—I was never indebted to him beyond the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month excepting any profit he might have brought in—as a matter of fact there' was no profit—I certainly never at any time made an arrangement with him which would entitle him to claim 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I repeatedly gave him my blank signature upon letters and memoranda—he was not authorised to draw bills or promissory notes on our account—the signature</p>

               <p>on the promissory note A is mine—the handwriting is the prisoner's—I gave him no authority whatever to write that—I had no idea of any such com<lb/>munication as that being made to the official assignee in Calcutta—he made a remark one day about paying his creditors, in the presence of two or three people—a broker came in and said "What are you at that again," referring to the code, and he said "Yes, as soon as this is finished, Rushton Brothers will pay my creditors," at which we all laughed and thought it a very good joke—we never undertook to pay him anything for the code—there is no truth in it—this letter of the 23rd November, 1876, bears my signature—it is written on our office paper Limp Street; and the body is in the prisoner's handwriting—I did not authorise him to write it and knew nothing about it—the first I heard of it was at the Mansion House, and I then looked at the letter-book—it is the original of the press copy—this letter of the 1st May 1876, headed "Memorandum to B. H. Hirsch, from Rushton Brothers, Lime Street" is signed by me—the body is in the prisoner's handwriting—this paper was delivered in my office about the 19th August, following the May it purports to be written on—I never used memorandum sheets similar to that before August—I can speak to that solemnly—the body is an entire fabrication—I never heard of the contents, I certainly never gave the prisoner authority to draw for 200,000 Rupees—it is a question whether I could draw it myself—the business has improved since the prisoner came to us, because we started in London and had his services as a clerk in the office with four or five others, and naturally the business would increase—it has not increased through any introductions of his.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was born in the Province of Bengal—I left India for the purpose of going into business about January or February, 1875—I had previously been in England—I left the prisoner in Calcutta—he was at that time a merchant; he had only just started, about a year—I knew him for some time before that—he had been in a large firm, and so made friends with a number of commercial people; that is what I mean by his consti<lb/>tuents—I first saw him in London about the beginning of January, 1876—I left my brother Hayward in Calcutta—I did not know anything about the document proved by Mr. Lattey to come from Dignam and Robinson; they were solicitors to our firm, and may be now—I do not remember hearing of the powers of Attorney—I had a communication from my firm in Calcutta with the text of the agreement which had been come to; I think it was about August, 1875—the business of Rushton Brothers in London was principally a jute business, direct through me—this list of forty-six names comprises principally names of constituents we had before our dealings with the pri<lb/>soner—there do not seem to be any jute men, except one—I should say the whole business, including the jute, would be about 200,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—the jute would represent, perhaps, half—the agreement I was advised of from Calcutta was never signed, I believe—I believe the prisoner wrote to my brother in Calcutta in February, 1876, the month after his arrival in England—my brother is here—these are specimen sheets of the telegraphic code (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I was not aware that the prisoner had been five years com<lb/>pleting the code until he said so—I paid Messrs. Straker as much as 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for printing with reference to the perfection of this very code—the copying work was the work of the prisoner's—it is copied from other codes and put into this shape—it is not a very difficult thing to make a code—the sheets were supplied to Straker for a period of more than two years—I never supplied any of the copy for the printing—I did not know that the prisoner</p>

               <p>laboured until midnight and 1 o'clock in the morning for the purpose of perfecting the code, I have heard it so said—I think it was the 29th June, 1870, that I gave him into custody for stealing the code—I was not there purposely—it was not my brother, but my clerk, Mr. E. J. Short, gave him into custody, by my instructions—I had consulted Mr. Thomas Beard about arresting him—I did not in the meantime go to the prisoner's lodgings with a detective without a warrant and get access to them—I have no recollection of twenty copies of the code being carried off from his lodgings; I did not know that twenty copies had been made—I have had five copies made since he was given into custody—I gave an order that if the prisoner delivered up the code they were not to press the charge, but if it were not given up he was to be kept in custody for stealing the code—five copies have been given up and ten more—the first telegram I had from Calcutta after I arrested the prisoner was on 30th June, 1876, the day after, and the day after he was at liberty—I did not go to his place then, nor he to mine—as to this document being a copy of that in the book, it may be a miraculous thing, but I should say it is a copy; not having seen the actual operation of copying, I cannot swear to it—it is not a fact that I expressed a desire in the presence of Mr. Von Kalin to break up the whole business of Rushton's; I should be very sorry to—I have two brothers in England and one in America—I have never expressed feelings antagonistic to them, I could not do such a thing—I never made any agreement at all with the prisoner that the amount of his claim upon us should be paid to the official assignee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> These codes are very much used in mercantile firms now—a cipher or letter will represent a word, and in that way we save expense—the telegraph companies recognise it to the extent of ten letters to the word—this code consisted of copies from many houses, improved upon as time went on, not an original idea—I paid part for the materials and am liable for the balance—the prisoner is not liable for a farthing—he left our employ on the morning of 27th June—when my brother and I arrived at the office, after staying there a few minutes, the prisoner walked in and said, with his back to me and facing my brother "Oh, I see you are not going to carry on that second agreement, I am discharged, and am off," and he put on his hat and walked out, and I never saw him again until I had him arrested—that was the first mention he had made of the second agreement, and I looked up in astonishment—after he had gone I found some of these telegraphic things had gone also—I wanted to have him arrested at once, but my brother said "No, don't do so, you may find them at the printer's"—I ascertained the fact at the printer's that they were gone—I never gave him. authority to take them—I consulted a solicitor and acted under his advice—our names are printed at the top of every page of the code—the prisoner never made the slightest claim to them—I learnt from the officer who took him into custody that he had given them up and had been released—I after<lb/>wards heard that he had only given up a very small portion; some are missing now; the police have them, but we cannot trace one or two; they got the others since this prosecution—the prisoner said nothing more when he put on his hat and walked out of the office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Bilton and Powell, in Great Russell Street—in March, 1876, I was out of employment, and whilst so I got employ<lb/>ment from Edward Thompson to look after the warehouse at 29, Paternoster Square—the name of "A. Thompson and Co." was on the facia—Alfred Thompson used to come there, and Edward, and Walter sometimes, not regularly—I saw Walter there, perhaps once or twice a week, and Edward every day; Alfred not so often, perhaps once or twice a week—whilst I was there I re<lb/>collect the house at Monkwell Street being opened—I used not to be there, but I have, called there frequently—I saw Alfred and Walter there; the name of A. Thompson was up there, I believe—I believe I have sent there for goods that were delivered at Paternoster Square—I believe there was a parcel came in the name of Bass and I think I have an idea of sending it back again; there was no such name there; I did not sign for it to my re<lb/>collection; I know nothing about it, except what I have been told; I was not told anything about it by either of the three prisoners—there was no one named Bass at the place—I recollect a piece of card being given to me in March or April, 1876, either by Edward or North, I do not know which—I hired a cart or van and the goods were brought to Paternoster Square—they were pictures from Caro's, thirty-two I think, like those produced—they stayed there some time, and they were hung up round the warehouse—after that some Mr. North had, and some Mr. Edward had at his private house, I think North had four; twelve were sold by Mr. Edward—I was in charge of</p>

I am a draper's stocktaker and draper's valuer—I have been in the habit of buying drapery stock for the last nine years—I reside at 26, Park Street, Cainberwell—I know the three Thompsons—in 1874 I was in possession of the premises and stock of Walter and Edward, at Newington Causeway—I could not say the exact date at which I saw Walter Thompson in reference to some goods; I have seen him so many times in reference to goods—I think I bought a stock of him about February, 1876; at least I bought a stock of De Chastelaine about that time—that was at the time I was with De Chastelaine—he showed me some stock—that was at Paternoster <hi rend="italic">Row</hi>—it was in the early part of 1876, I could not say whether in February or March—they were new goods, but they were out of the wrappers and in a very confused state—Walter asked me to make an offer for the stock—I said I must make an abstract of it and see what it consisted of, and divide it into compartments—I made out a stock sheet and he called it over—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my writing, with the exception of the blue ink writing at the top and the pencil marks in the body—I took an account of the stock—I gave my prices and I made him an offer for the whole—I almost forget what it was; I think it was something like 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he refused; my offer was not good enough—I saw him a few days afterwards and he said he sold it at a better price to Roberts, of Islington—at that time the silk market was in a very uncertain state—you could buy goods at all sorts of prices—these were plain goods, most of them—I cannot say that two or three days would make much difference in the price—it is the difference of a man's opinion upon them—in June, 1876, I again saw Walter Thompson about some stock—I buy for Davis, of Hull—I do not know that I bought any goods of him on account of Davis, in June—I think I bought of Edward a parcel, but I am not quite positive as to the dates unless I see the documents—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) refers to a parcel I bought from Edward at Paternoster Row, in Juno, I</p>

I was aware that Edward Thompson was carrying on business at Paternoster Square—about February or March I remember going and seeing the stock there—previously to buying the stock I sent portions of the samples to Davis of Hull—taking it as a whole I should call it a very job lot—there was a small bit of calico amongst it, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—all sorts of odds and ends—there was some good stuff as well as some rubbish—I had to take 75 off—there is nothing unusual in purchasing a job lot with good calico amongst it, or something of the sort—it is a thing very often done to give it a respectable appearance; to give you something that you can sell—that was the only transaction I ever had with Edward, except buying some umbrellas once for Watts, of Liver<lb/>pool, for about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe he had bought them at a public auction; at least, he told me they were bought at Burton's, at Ludgate Hill—they could not have come from a wholesale house, because they were damaged goods—I think it was in July that I bought them—there is nothing unnsual in the sale of job lots of drapery to a large extent—we know that wholesale houses offer goods at extra discounts off—I took 20 per cent, discount off the calicoes—if you bought them in the ordinary way you would have five months' credit—this was ready money—there are a variety of discounts; the average is from about 47 to 49 1/2.</p>

I did business with De Chastelaine in 1874 before I saw Walter Thompson there, and from time to time up to the time I have been speaking of, at various intervals—I always bought them at Paternoster Row; sometimes at a discount and sometimes at a price all round—I saw De Chastelaine, and he has called upon me—at the latter end of 1875 he drove up to my place, and after that I used to see him three or four times a week—he has often asked me to call and see goods when he had them—I almost forget when the last transaction was made—I saw him there up to June, I think—he was a great deal out—I have bought on occasions; I. cannot say whether I did so during April and June—during those months Mr. Thompson had the principal management of the affair—I should imagine he was the first who saw the goods that were ultimately sold to Roherts—I don't know whether they had been submitted to Fisk and Co:, of Ipswich; I never heard of them—no doubt several parcels might have been submitted to half-a-dozen persons before I saw them—of course I bought them at the best price I could; I suppose my price was the best; I think I gave a fair price for them, considering it was a cash transaction—</p>

Thompson, or order, and it came back endorsed A. Thompson—the invoice is headed "Bought of Alfred Thompson"—I bought alt the goods in the invoice except the hose which were sent on approbation—I selected them at Monkwell Street; Walter Thompson was present—I have been there occasionally and seen Alfred there—the goods in this invoice marked "5 L" I bought in March of Walter Thompson at 61, Paternoster Row, in the name of De Chastelaine—I may have seen De Chastelaine about it, but Thompson was the man I did business with—these are some of the invoices sent to me from Pater<lb/>noster Row, they are all in De Chastelaine's name—he never explained his being at Paternoster Row and also at Monkwell Street, he hardly commenced at Monkwell Street till De Chastelaine called in 1876, and then Thompson appeared—De Chastelaine's transactions were all in March; I paid for them by this cheque for 135<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it is payable to Edward De Chastelaine—Alfred Thomson came to Ashford once after some money for some goods sold by Walter—this cheque does not correspond with any particular invoice—I do not know whether it takes in several—it is endorsed by De Chastelaine.</p>

De Chastelaine came down once with Walter I believe—I think there was a discussion about the price on one occasion, and De Chastelaine was referred to—that was the only occasion on which he came down; when 1 made North an offer, he did not always accept it at once—he appeared in most cases to act for himself) but on the occa<lb/>sion that De Chastelaine was down at our place, he did not decide at once but referred to him—the last transaction I had with him at Monkwell Street, was I think in December, 1876—you will find plenty of Thompson's transactions in May—this one cheque is payable to De Chastelaine.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been managing clerk to Mr. Parry, of Basinghall Street, up to the last <hi rend="italic">few</hi> days—North was introduced to the office by Walter and Edward Thompson, at the end of 1874, or the beginning of 1875—I attended to the proceedings in North's bankruptcy, he con<lb/>sulted me in July—I think Edward Thompson was present the first tune—North had an execution in his house, I believe it was by Dent and Alcroft, and we were at that time seeing him for Mr. Bult, on two bills of exchange—if I recollect rightly he had heard something about a private meeting of his creditors, and he did not know what to do; I suggested that he should call a meeting of his creditors—I think Edward Thompson was present—I then went down to Hertford and filed a petition—on this list of creditors on the first page, nearly all the figures are in my writing, and No. 10, 11,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170132"/>
               <p>and 12 are names of creditors Caro, Blunt, and Downing—the rest is written by Mr. James Walham—I got the information to write down, from a list; I cannot say who gave it to me, though I have thought a good deal about it for the last three months—I am quite certain Mr. Alfred did not give it to me, but I will not say whether Edward, Walter, or North did, it is utterly impossible; I was very much engaged at the time with the two Thompsons in a Chancery suit, and it was done in a hurry—nobody but the Thompsons took an interest in North's affairs—before the. first meeting of creditors there was a conference between us as to what offer would be likely to be accepted, and what offer North could make, he told us that he had 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of book debts good and bad, and no stock or other effects or furni<lb/>ture—Edward and Walter Thompson promised to assist him in paying the first composition proposed, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound; 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was first talked of, but they said they did not think it likely to be accepted, and that they endea<lb/>vours to get Mr. Hands, who they had just made friends with to secure the other—this proof of Alfred Thompson's is my writing, it was sworn before Mr. Parry at his office—I understood that it was partly for horse hire, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. damage to a horse by hard work, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for some goods—four bills were given to me, but not as Hunt describes—before the first meeting of creditors Hunt came with Edward Thompson, the meeting was at 11 o'clock: Walter and North were in the office at the same time, and I think I prepared Alfred's proof—I cannot say at this length of time who produced Hunt's bills, but I know they were all complete when they came into my possession—I looked at them casually and gave them to Mr. Walham, who made out Hunt's proof, and had the four bills, and the proxy for Mr. Parry, but I did not produce them, because Mr. Lovering and Mr. Mason held a large amount of proxies and any I held would have had no effect—Mr. Hunt was in very great trouble, bankruptcy proceedings were taken out against him, and he was in hot water till the time of his conviction, he was afraid he would have to make a clear breast of it; he consulted me, and I advised him that all unnecessary papers should be destroyed, and they were torn up by him in my office and by nobody else—at that time I was not aware of what was taking place—there was no dividend and nothing to receive—it is not my habit as a solicitor to consider bills and things of that sort as unnecessary documents, but Hunt told me that the money was not owing to him—I thought he had better tear up the bills, and the less said about the trans<lb/>actions the better.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You, knowing that it was a fraudulent transaction, recommended Hunt to destroy the evidence of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You must not take it in that way—I had known him a long time, he was in very great trouble, and I did not think it necessary for him to get into further trouble; I did not advise him to destroy the evidence of a fraud, he had never proved, and he said that the money was not owing—as far as I can remember, there were three 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bills and one 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this first item, Herbert Hunt, 340<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was, I think, 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. ori<lb/>ginally and has been altered; that was made out in liquidation; I cannot throw any light upon it, as the three bills only amounted to 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the four bills were not all together when the proof was made out, the list was filed on 3rd August and the meeting was not till the 29th—Hunt is the drawer of the bills, and I understand that they are in his writing—North is the acceptor—we went into a private room and North was asked to put down the names of six debtors to his estate owing over 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the offer of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound was refused at a moment's notice and he went into a little room at</p>

               <p>the back of my private room with Walter Thompson to put down the creditors, and when they came out North had six names down, one of which was Dr. Hodson, and the offer was then increased to 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I considered that Walter was really going to assist North to pay the composition of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and that he was going to get Mr. Hands to pay the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I have a letter from Mr. Mason to that effect—Walter Thompson showed me this letter of 23rd August at, I think, 15, Monkwell Street, on, I believe, the day it is dated—Mr. Parry was acting for Walter and Edward all the time in several matters, but not in North's matter—I told Walter Thompson that North stated that he owed him a lot of money which had got him into trouble; he said that it was all false; he, North, had paid for everything he had—later in the day I saw Walter again and he showed me this letter and said that North would not be able to tell any more lies about him—I never saw this letter till some mornings ago, it is written on paper very similar to what I use in the office, it appears to be the same and the paper of this receipt came, I should say, out of the same packet—the August letter appears to be on a half sheet of draft paper; it is different to the other.</p>

I am a public accountant, of 35, Gresham Street—I have acted as trustee in a great many liquidations and bank<lb/>ruptcy cases with wholesale warehousemen of London—I was concerned in the liquidation of the Thompson's—I know De Chastelaine, I am a trustee under his bankruptcy, but I have not the date with me when he stopped payment—he did not attend the appointment for his examination, he absconded—I have not the date with me—I acted for the wholesale house in the liquidation proceedings of North; I attended the first meeting of creditors at Mr. Parry's office—a list of creditors who I represented was taken down at that meeting—it included the names' of Seof, Hunt, and others; I had a copy of the list, it was produced to the meeting by Mr. Benton—this on the file is either the original' or a copy of it; it sets out the amount of book debts without giving any names; there is no other list of debtors—there was no explanation at the time the books were lost, and I requested North to give me the names of the debtors to his estate—there were no assets whatever—at the liquidation he stated that he had lost his books and could not give any account—I asked him to give me a list of some of the persons to whom he owed 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he gave me about half a dozen—the debts were estimated to amount to 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the cash in hand was 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—no disclaimer was made at the time of the liquidation, on 28th August, of Walter and Edward Thompson being indebted to North—no discovery was made of the dealings with North of Edward, Walter, or Alfred Thompson—I was made acquainted by North, or by the Thompsons, of the disposition of goods obtained from wholesale houses in February, March, and May, 1876—I have attended the preliminary inquiries before the Magistrate, and have been present during this trial, having in my hands the exhibits from the wholesale houses, and also the sheets marked R, Islington, R 1, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I find goods bought of the London Warehouse Company on 15th February, 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and sold to Roberts, Islington, on 23rd February, for 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., being a loss of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and that is excluding the loss for carriage from the London Warehouse Company to Tottenham, Hoddesden, and Islington, which is a loss as well—I give the loss without the cost of travelling, without the working expenses—by Exhibit T, I find goods bought of Tucker and Co., on 18th February, 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and sold, on 25th February, to Roberts, of Islington, for 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—by K 1, I find goods bought of Kynaston and Son, in February for 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and sold to Roberts, of Islington, for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—by this invoice of Rotherham and Co., I find goods sold by them, on 18th February, for 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., disposed of to Roberts, on the 24rd, for 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., being a loss of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I also find goods sold by Caldecott, on 14th February, for 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., disposed of to Roberts, on 23rd February, for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., being a loss of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,' and goods bought of Hitchcock, Williams, and Co., on 21st February, for 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., are sold, on 23rd February, to Roberts, for 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., being a loss of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., irrespective of carriage. (<hi rend="italic">The witness went through the whole of the list, showing that the whole of the goods were disposed of at a loss, within a few days of being purchased.</hi>) Those are all the goods that have been traced—we cannot trace anything sold by North, but goods were bought by North and sold by Thompson—this pencil memorandum marked N 5, corresponds with goods sold to North by the London</p>

I am a cabman, living at Linton—I went through the form of marriage with the prisoner in the Parish Church of Linton, on 6th April, 1875—she described herself as a widow; this is the certificate—I had known her four or five months previously—she came to Linton about October, 1874—when I found she had a husband living I gave her in custody for bigamy—she never told me after our marriage that she had heard that her first husband was alive—I found it out at Kilburo, where her husband worked, and where I went from Pontypool, in Wales—I did not go away and leave her to live with another woman—she could not make herself contented and she tried to ruin me—she spent her money—I had been a, widower twelve months.</p>

I am a clerk in Mr. Swain's office, the defendant's solicitor—this is the signature of Thomas Hetherington; I saw him sign it—I accompanied him to Mr. Parkinson's room to have the oath admin<lb/>istered—Mr. Swain has been solicitor to Messrs. Edwards and Hetherington for two years—they have been carrying on the business of commission agents and warehousemen, 21 and 22, Gutter Lane, Cheapside—they placed all their papers in the hands of Mr. John Finney, of the firm of Collinson and Finney, the accountants—I do not know whether it was the month of May or April Mr. Field commenced his action—after Messrs. Edwards and Hetheriugton had called their creditors together, an assignment of assets was made at a meeting to Mr. Finney by the advice of the largest creditor—an offer was first made of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—every creditor signed the assignment by which Mr. John Finney was to get in the assets and dis<lb/>tribute them, except Mr. Humphrey Field—the estate is now in the hands of Mr. John Finney for the purpose of distribution—on the writ being issued, Mr. John Edwards (not the defendant in the action) came to our office and brought with him a quantity of letters and correspondence from Humphrey Field to the firm of Edwards and Hetherington, and a copy of the writ—this is the original writ of 16th May (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I don't know whether these are all the papers—they may have brought another letter afterwards</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170151"/>
               <p>—a disputed account as to commission is shown in the correspondence—Mr. Edwards told me on that occasion that Mr. Field had appointed the firm of Edwards and Hetherington in the month of February their London agents on Yorkshire terms, which means 2 1/2 per cent commission, not only on orders personally transmitted, but all orders in London, either directly or indirectly sent to Field—he called my attention specifically to letters show<lb/>ing an order from James and Pike for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of woollen cloths—this is one of the letters: "February 26th. Gentlemen,—Humphrey Field to Edwards and Hetherington. Yours of the 24th enclosing order for twenty pieces at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—that refers to James and Pike's order—this is another, 10th March, 1877—this is a copy of the order 10/3/77; 1,000 pieces at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this is another: "28th March, 1877. Gentlemen,—Humphrey Field to Edwards and Hetherington. I have six patterns in work for James and Pike which can be sent next week. I hope you will get some orders for Winter goods to go on with."—this is a telegram also of the same date: "Harry Field to Edmunds and Hetherington" that is the son when he was in London "sixteen pieces get to send James and Pike in work; deliver next Thursday," meaning that they were going on—this memorandum from Pike was brought to me by Edwards: "April 5th. Humphrey Field to James and Pike. Gentlemen,—I enclose a copy of order I received from Edwards and Hetherington on the 10th March. You will find that the delivery was up to the 10th of this month. I have six<lb/>teen pieces now ready to send to you, but if order given as enclosed copy you are in honour bound to take them "This is "Humphrey Field to Messrs. Edwards and Hetherington April 6th. Gentlemen,—You should not have taken the pieces in. I shall return the invoice by the post to James and Pike. All goods were passed when I was in London. The pieces in dispute were the sixteen which I have here"—on the same date there is another one to Mr. Edwards, personally, blaming Messrs. Edwards and Hetherington for allowing James and Pike to leave the goods on their premises: "Humphrey Field to Edwards and Hetherington Sir,—You must send back the sixteen pieces to Messrs. James and Pike as I shall see them," &amp;c., Mr. Edwards claimed the full commission on the order of 1.000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Mr. Edwards explained to my firm on what the com<lb/>mission was due and I then advised him that he was entitled to commission having regard to the correspondence; they accepted the order for 100 pieces and say they will supply them according to order"—March 22nd refers to another, Chappell and Humphreys; then there—is another letter which Chappell and Humphreys appear to have given to Mr. Edwards, addressed to Chappell and Humphreys by Mr. Field—I don't know that this is a copy letter that was with the correspondence; it is a copy, I imagine, sent to Messrs. Chappell and Humphreys—it may have been in duplicate: "Gen<lb/>tlemen,—I beg to return you enclosed invoice as I shall return you the goods and not take them in. When you received my invoice you said nothing about their being too late," &amp;c.—then a letter of May, I think, refers to issuing a writ against James and Pike for the amount—I prepared the draft affidavit afterwards sworn by Mr. Hetherington—there was also a. letter saying the commission due must be left until James and Pike's account is settled—Mr. Edwards said to me that he had made several applications for the commission, I also heard reference made to Mr. Devas' order—this affidavit I dictated to a shorthand clerk and he afterwards drew it out, and I considering the draft was not exactly as</p>

I live at 97, East Laue, and am a lighterman—between 12 and 1 o'clock on the night of the 14th August, I was in Turner Street, Whitechapel, when Baker came up to me two or three times and wanted to get into conversation—I told her to go away as I didn't want to have anything to do with her—she went away for a little while and just as I was going along, I felt an arm put to my neck to stop me, and, the other hand dragged my watch from my pocket and snapped my watch guard; no sooner was the chain snapped than I felt a blow between my shoulders and I was knocked into the road—the blow could not have been done by the woman; she was in front of me—she ran across the road and a man sprang past me and they both ran away together—I did not lose sight of either of them—I did not recognise him at that time—he ran from behind—I called to the police "Stop thief," and a policeman came up and stopped them in the same street, and I pointed them out—I never saw another soul in the street until I saw the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 21, Hackney Grove, which, house was broken into on the early morning of the 25th July, on the night of the 24th—the doors and windows were fastened when I went to bed, with the exception of my front dining-room window—I saw all the shutters, that will fasten, closed—I am not certain about the front dining-room window—a little before daylight I was disturbed by a noise and went downstairs after a little while—it would be between 3 o'clock and 3.30—I moved about a little while first—T thought it was a door that was standing open, so I left my room and shut the door and then went downstairs, and I saw my dining-room door was open—I had shut it over night, and I saw that a long horizontal bar had been removed from the shutters opposite the end of the front dining-room, and the shutters were partially open, and the first thing I then noticed was that a pair of very old boots not' belonging to me, were placed on the carpet—then I noticed that two desks had been forced open, and the contents of one of them removed—I saw a plated top claret jug placed near, and a case that had contained a dozen knives and forks thrown on a chair, and the contents gone—I had left that the night before on the dinner waggon—a cigar case of mine had been taken from the mantelpiece and the cigars taken away—there was one of the knives left—I saw the empty scabbard of a sword of mine (I was formerly in the Artillery Com<lb/>pany), and the drawn sword was placed near the door—a cupboard was forced open and a pair of boots taken from the hall—I was quite undressed, and I went upstairs and searched the house inside to see if there was any<lb/>one concealed—afterwards I went to the front and gave a constable an account of what had happened—I examined the house and found distinct marks of an entry having been made at the dining-room window—my</p>

                  </hi>. I am potman in the service of Mrs. Spinks—on. Saturday, 25th August, Lewis came to me and asked me to become a third person to attempt to break into the house of Mrs. Spinks—I saw him outside—I said "How is it to be done?"—he said that a certain amount of money was taken during the week, Saturday's and Sunday's takings altogether would amount to between 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that was put in a black bag and was then put in the small bar parlour previous to banking on Monday morn<lb/>ing—I asked him "How is this ever to be done?"—he said "We will arrange to get over the wall, you and I, and over the stable and drop into the yard; you must arrange to have the shutter of the window so "as we</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170160"/>
               <p>can get in"—I led him to understand I would agree to it, and asked him previous to making any further arrangement, when I should see him again on the subject, and we arranged for the Wednesday following, that would be the 29th August—in the mean time I made a communication to Freeman, Mrs. Spinks, and the barmaid—I saw Lewis again on the Wednesday—I was going to deliver some beer, but previous to my going out with the beer, Lewis, Head, and another came into the parlour—I said "Come outside; Well," I said. "What about this affair you were speaking to me on Saturday night about?"—"Oh," Lewis said, "that is all right;" and putting his hands up so to his face in a thinking mood, he said "I have been thinking, we won't do it the way I was telling you about on Saturday, there is another way to do it which will be better"—I asked him which way it was—he said "You know the window at the comer in Clarence Road! Do you know that window don't fasten right up to the top?"—I said "No"—"Well," he said next Sunday morning when you are about to leave, I shall want you to pull that window down a little more, and a day or two before we commence operations I want you to break a globe in the window, so that it will not cause any suspicion afterwards, because the globe will be in our way in getting in"—of course I promised to break that, but I merely removed it—I was to leave the door open as well, the near parlour door leading to the bar—then I asked him "What about this third person, who is he? it is not the boy," meaning Head—he said "No, another person"—I went into the bar and saw the manager and told him what had happen<lb/>ed, and I pointed out the one who was to make the third party, to the bar<lb/>man—he is not here—the day was fixed for Monday morning, at 12.30 Sunday night—I met Lewis with Head—we went from there across Hackney Downs up a passage, till we got into Kingsland Road—I took them to a coffee stall and we had some coffee together—we came back by Hachney Downs, and we got to a blank wall, and he said "You meet me at the Pool," and we separated—we met again at the Pool, Clapton Road, and he gave me one tool and put the other in his pocket—this is the one he gave me (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>) and this other he left behind on account of the policeman coming up—we met at the Duke of Clarence; Lewis and I went up to the window; Lewis pulled the window down first, Head was round the corner—after Lewis pulled down the window we stepped into the middle of the road; we went back again to the window; he put his hand against the window, and when we pulled it down, out came the detective, and Lewis ran away—I did not see whether Head ran away; he was round the corner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was close to the window when Lewis pulled it down; I cannot say whether it was partially open then, I am almost sure it was shut—it was when it was pulled down a second time that it came right down with a bang—head had nothing to do with the tools—none of the conversation I have related took place in Head's presence.</p>

I tried to get it out"—we took them back to No. 53 and found a key in the lock—we roused the inmates and enquired of the lodgers in each room; the prisoners were there and could hear what passed—first Mr. Nettleton asked his wife, and she said she had not left a key in the door—Nettleton searched his pocket and found his own key—then we went to the lodgers in each room and they said they had not left their keys in the lock—this is the key (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); it is too large, and I had some difficulty in getting it out of the lock, and when I did it was scraped as if it did not fit—Mar<lb/>shall was 4 or 5 yards from the door when I first saw him on the same side of the way, and Stannard about 1 1/2 yards—we took them in custody; they said they were out walking and were going to Highgate—it was quite daylight—they were taken to the Caledonian Road police-station—Hefford refused his address—I went to the address Marshall gave and saw his mother.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was signed by the prisoner, stating that he would call on the prosecutor on Monday.</hi>) I afterwards saw him; he said he was sorry, and asked me to wait a little while, I consented to do so, and I afterwards received this letter from him. (<hi rend="italic">This was from the prisoner, stating that he had paid some momey in and. requesting the prosecutor to present the cheque again.</hi>) I paid it into my bankers again, and it was again returned unpaid—I then received this letter, dated 2nd July, making excuses, and a week or two afterwards I took out a warrant—I saw the prisoner again, he still promised to pay; he told me his child had been buried—I afterwards heard that there were more of his cheques about.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant of the Hackney Road—I collect accounts for the prosecutor, Mr. Hall, and audit his books—in March, 1875, I received instructions to collect a debt 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mr. Todd, and saw him on 27th March—he then paid 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and arranged to pay me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. weekly till the debt was paid—on 19th April, Mr. Hall handed me the prisoner's acceptance for 61<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., requesting me to see Mr. Todd and make some arrangment for its payment, I saw Mr. Todd on 20th April, and said "I have called respecting Mr. Hall's account—you promised to pay me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week three weeks ago, and I have seen nothing of you since"—he said. "I understood that you would send for it"—I said "Not likely, it would never pay me to send here every week for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., you must send it to my office?"—he said "I will do so"—I then replied "There are three instalments due now, will you pay me those?"—he replied "I cannot"—I said "Will you pay any of them?—he said "I have just been across the water and have laid out all my money"—I said "I cannot take that excuse, besides there is your acceptance what are you going to do about that?"—he replied "When I accepted the bill, Mr. Hall gave me the undertaking, if I could not meet it he would take it up"—I said "Well he has taken it up, and here it is (<hi rend="italic">showing it him</hi>), and you must make some arrangement about its pay<lb/>ment?"—he said "Well, I cannot pay more than 1 am paying"—I said "As a matter of fact you are paying nothing, but if you were to keep up your engagement, it would be three years at this rate before that bill would get paid, that won't do!"—he replied "I cannot do impossibilities"—I said "I don't suppose you can, but—you must make some better offer then that?"—after considering a minute he said "Well, look up on Saturday, and see me on Saturday and I will pay you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. then, and I will see what arrange<lb/>ment I can make about the bill"—I said "Very well, I will call up between 1 and 2 o'clock"—I called at his place of business about 1 o'clock on Satur<lb/>day; he was not there, I waited there three hours for him, but he did not come back, and I left my card with one of the men—on the following Mon<lb/>day, 26th April, he sent me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., reducing the amount to 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I called about three weeks afterwards and Mr. Todd had then gone away and</p>

               <p>left the place—the place was closed altogether, the shutters were up—about March or April, 1876, I heard that Mr. Todd was carrying on business in Wilderness Row, and I then took the bill down to Messrs. Milner and Clarke's office and saw Mr. Clarke, Mr. Hall's solicitor—I gave him certain instructions—the prisoner was summoned in the County Court for the smaller sum, and the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was recovered by execution—I lost sight of the prisoner after that and have not seen him since, till these proceedings were taken—I found he was carrying on business in Goswell Road at the beginning of this year, and I then went to Mr. Clarke and gave him certain instructions—I have read the affidavit, which forms the subject of these proceeding?, in which it is stated the plaintiff offered to endorse the bill of exchange to one Mr. John Matthews—I know Mr. Matthews and collect his accounts in the same way as Mr. Hull's—the bill was in my hands from 19th April, 1875; to the time I gave it to Mr. Clarke in the present year—I had not made any reference to Mr. Matthews that this was an accommoda<lb/>tion bill—T did offer to sell the bill to Mr. Matthews for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not said that it was an accommodation bill, and if sued for by a third party the full amount could be recovered—I never brought bills from Mr. Hall—Todd never made any representations to me as to an overcharge in his account, and never disputed the amount of 61<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on the ground that it was an accommodation bill.</p>

                  </hi>. In 1874 I was in Mr. Todd's employ—on one occasion I was instructed to communicate with Mr. Hall about some bides he had left and did so—the hides were afterwards taken away, I believe, by Mr. Hall in a van—I recollect a conversation about the charges for some hides—Mr. Todd complained to Mr. Hall of the excessive charge and said he could not carry on business if he paid such a heavy price for his goods—Mr. Hall said he was obliged to charge heavily for being behind hand; I do not exactly remember the words—I told Mr. Hall from what I understood of the price of hide I thought it was a very excessive charge—I have heard Mr. Todd complain to Mr. Hall on more than one occasion.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer carrying on business at 71, Coleman Streeet, City—on 7th May last, I saw the prisoner at my office—he wanted 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of me—I said "I shall want a bill of sale on your furniture, and a declaration that the goods are free and unincumbered and that you are solvent"—that was supposing the goods to be of sufficient value—I showed him the form of declaration—he said he was perfectly solvent, he could make that declaration—he wanted the money to complete the lease of a house that was finishing at Wood Green—I went to see the furniture at his house in Ambler's Road, which articles are enumerated in the sehedule of the first bill of sale—the declaration was prepared—he read it at my office and signed it—its provisions were fully explained to him by me. (<hi rend="italic">The declara<lb/>tion stated that the prisoner liad no other name, that he resided at</hi> 25, <hi rend="italic">Ambler's Road, the goods were his sole and absolute property, and there was no other right or title to them, that they were not charged or incumbered in any way, and not on hire; that he made such declaration fully cognizant of the pains and penalties of making false declarations, that he was in a state of solvency, and all his liabilities exclusive of the bill of sale just given did not exceed</hi> 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. It was signed, "Charles Vere," and declared at 25. Coleman Street.) I saw the prisoner sign it—with reference to his not owing more than 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I said you had better say 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. above that—he said that was more than he owed—I then lent 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. clear, reserving 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my charges and interest—this was paid in different sums by cheque, as he said he was settling accounts for which he wanted the money to clear him—I found the furniture sufficient and the bill of sale was executed on the 7th May—it was not registered—it was part of the agreement that it should not be—it is a common thing not to register bill of sale for the purpose of keeping the name out of the trade circular—a second bill of sale, a duplicate of the first, was afterwards given which was registered—I believed the statement that the prisoner was solvent, and that he did not owe more than 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on which faith I parted with my money—I think it was on the 11th June that I heard of an execu<lb/>tion on the prisoner's goods and that the Sheriff of Middlesex was in possession—the prisoner came to me and told me that he had got the Sheriff in—I said "What the dickens does this mean? I thought you didn't owe more than 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the world"—he said he was very sorry; he did not think it would come to this—then. I said perhaps the best thing I could do would be to pay the Sheriff out if I got any more security, and he offered me his stock-in-trade in Jewin Street, and a bill of sale was prepared for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I was to pay the expenses and the amount of the execution by the Sheriff, 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. if he would not withdraw—the stock was valued at 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by a clerk of mine—I did not see it then, I subsequently sold it and it realised 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think, which money I retain at the present time—I have received notice from the bankruptcy people not to dispose of that money—I cannot use it—three or four days after the 11th June I heard of the prisoner-filing a Petition in the Court of Bankruptcy for liquidation—before 1 could deal with anything or do anything I was restrained by an order from the Court in consequence of the petition, and was prevented handing over the 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I dare say the petition was filed on the 18th June, it was before I could</p>

(<hi rend="italic">the proceedings in Bankruptcy were put in.</hi>) There was an interpleader issue between the Sheriff of Middlesex and myself, which was to come on for trial at the Hertford Assizes—we did not go on with the action because the resolution under the bankruptcy proceedings failed, and if I went against the Sheriff I should have lost against the trustee, so a <hi rend="italic">stet processus</hi> was entered—the sum total which the prisoner gives as his liabilities is 1,320<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the furniture at Ambler's Road on which I advanced formed part of the assets, and passed to the different creditors—this is the prisoner's signature to his statement of affairs.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTOX</hi>. I have been well acquainted with lending on bills of sale for twelve years—I have forms of bills of sale and declarations regularly prepared and drawn up by the dozen, printed, which can be filled up with any name and amount—I have no doubt I said the same before the Magistrate that I have said here—I heard the case dismissed to the astonish<lb/>ment of everybody in Court—all the witnesses who are here to-day were not examined before the Magistrate—I cannot say how many were examined—my clerk was not examined—the prisoner when he asked me for the money was introduced by a Mr. Casey, not a friend or acquaintance of mine—he is a manager in a solicitor's office—I don't know that he is not a solicitor—I have known him for six or seven years—he was not in the habit of introducing people to me—he never introduced anybody to me before, he has been doing business during the six or seven years—I knew him by his being managing clerk to Messrs. Buchanan and Rogers, and I have come across him—I should have registered the bill of sale but for his being a clerk there—it was part of the under<lb/>standing that it should not be, and it was to be reniewed every twentyone days—the prisoner first asked me for 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I did not ask for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for myself—Mr. Casey was present when he came to apply for it, he was not acting for me—he saw the declaration and the bill of sale—I read them over and explained them thoroughly; I am in the habit of doing that—I found the furniture was unincumbered, and it would have been a sufficient security if the piano had not been on hire—I said before the Magistrate "The furniture after paying the Sheriff and the stock might, with care, have been sufficient to pay my debt;" which it might, with the security I then had—he did not say he wanted the money to pay pressing debts, but to pay the tradespeople engaged in finishing a house at Wood Green, because the lease would not be granted until the terms of the agreement had been complied with—I did not hear the Magistrate say that no jury would convict on the evidence—I was out of Court then; I gave the prisoner cheques for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave him several small cheques—I cannot say whether the lease was in the possession of Casey—I did not ask him—he is clerk to the solicitors conducting this prosecution—the prisoner did not tell me that his pressing liabilities did not amount to more than 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I swear—I don't know what was asked before the Magistrate—the declaration of solvency was signed by the prisoner on the 29th May—my clerk Jones attested it—I cannot tell you the time of day it was signed—Casey had come the day before and said he would come the next day—the second bill of sale was signed in my office on the 29th May—I heard on the 11th June of the Sheriff taking possession for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my claim by interpleader issue was found on the second bill of sale, we went down to the Hertford Assizes to</p>

               <p>try the issue, but it was not tried—my clerk went down with me; I dare say to swear he saw the prisoner sign the bill of sale on the 29th—I went down to prove that I paid the money on the 7th May—I was not present when the bill of sale was signed on the 29th May, my clerk told me that he was—I saw Mr. Ribton down there in Court, and I was told that the bankruptcy resolution was rejected and Mr. Kemp advised us that if we went against the Sheriff we should lose against the trustee—I did hear before I withdrew from the action that several witnesses were in the town from Boston, to prove that the defendant was in Boston on the 29th and could not have signed the document on that day, and that if my clerk got into the box he would be indicted for perjury and I for suborna<lb/>tion—I think the debtor's solicitor said something of the kind; it was not on that account that I withdrew from the action—we instructed Counsel and paid the costs, 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we could not get our costs—we were really fight<lb/>ing for the trustee—it was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. instead of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we were perfectly good as against the Sheriff—there is a third bill of sale, dated about the 11th or 12th June—I did not say before I got the third bill of sale that I was in a very awkward position with Vere—I told you what I said—I said "What the dickens does this mean?"—I told the prisoner at one interview that he had made a false declaration, and he said he was very sorry that he had done it—I certainly did not say "I cannot be the loser, if I can't have a pocket of meal I will have a pocket of malt;" that is an invention—he did not say "I cannot help it, you yourself misled me by asking me what I wanted the money for, and also as to my pressing liabilities,"or" Why did not you ask me what I owed altogether if that is what you meant"—I got the third bill of sale for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner's place of business was somewhere in Jewin Street—I didn't go myself—the business was that of women's underclothing—my clerk valued it at 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was after I got the order from the Court of Bankruptcy—I received a summons two or three times, but did not attend—I had an order from the Bankruptcy Court not to sell the stock; I sold notwithstanding—I told Jones not to attend the summons—Casey in<lb/>troduced the prisoner to me—I did not hear Casey ask the prisoner to read the paper over or the prisoner say to Casey "Must I sign it?" or Casey say "Sign anything he wants you to, only 1 must not be present"—Casey is here—I did not ask the prisoner whether he could not get some goods on credit, so that I might seize them, I could not seize what was not in my bill of sale—I believe there is an erasure in the second bill of sale, the "27th" being altered to the "29th"—I do not know when that was done—the 29th would not be late—it does not matter so long as you renew before the Sheriff seizes—it is good against the Sheriff—I don't think I ever had an interpleader issue directed before; one case of false pretences before, three years ago, I stood in the dock myself fourteen or fifteen years ago, 1863, with Henry Feast, my brother; we were both charged in 1865 with conspiracy to obtain money by false pretences; I don't see that that has got anything to do with this—I have been fourteen years in Coleman Street—my brother and I pleaded guilty and were sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment—I was well aware this was going to be asked, it was held as a threat over me I have been ever since that in the same ward and the same parish of the City of London—since that I have not had even a County Court summons or anything against me, and it is hard to bring this against me and make me lose this money, my client's money—I have lost 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the last few months, simply because when anything happens this question is to be asked</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170184"/>
               <p>—I did not start in the money-lending business at all—I went to a gentle<lb/>man and learnt my business—my principal business is not lending money on bills of sale—I came back to London after the affair at Hertford—two months did not elapse before I summonsed the prisoner on this charge—I charged him before the Magistrate, I think, three days after the costs were taxed, perhaps a fortnight after the Hertford business, I think it was the 25th July—I got myself bound over to prosecute—the summons in bank<lb/>ruptcy was about a month ago.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> So far as I know, Buchanan and Rogers knew nothing of Casey introducing the prisoner to me—the pianoforte was included amongst the furniture at Ambler's Road in the first bill of sale, it was, in fact, some<lb/>body else's—there was no fee offered me to go to the Court of Bankruptcy—I was advised not to go.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. I did not get a list from Streeter of their customers and send round my circulars to them—I did not carry them in my head after ten years, I exhibited a letter of Mr. Streeter's in my office at Piccadilly—I was desirous in February, 1876, that Butlin should join me—the solicitors I employed were Messrs. Matthews and Co., of Bedford Row—their clerk was Mr. Swaine—I knew that the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I lent, and the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. his mother lent was to pay a pawnbroker a sum that had been advanced on certain goods; I knew Matthews and Co. as Butlin's solicitors only—I do not know that they were bringing actions against pawnbrokers that they might have to give up the property—the money was to be paid over to pawnbrokers to relieve certain goods,. some might belong to Mr. Webb, so that the money went to redeem property as early as February 1876—Butlin's salary was paid to him on the first of every month—he was given into custody on the 28th August—he had been paid on the 1st August—the time had not arrived for me to go through with him, the commission account from 31st March, 1877, up to the time of my giving him into custody—I had back 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of my 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the commission from 31st March up to the time I gave him in custody amounts to 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—a lady to whom you allude put a large amount of money into my business, which I was to invest to the best of my ability in jewellery—she was always satisfied with my judgment, and her own being perhaps as good as mine, she satisfied me—a much larger</p>

               <p>sum than 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was received by me from that lady of quality, for the purpose of buying a set of earrings, which were afterwards sold to a noble Marquis for 825<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—those earrings were bought between us in partnership for 400/.—this lady did not care to give the credit, and I gave her a certain fixed sum down, as her profit on them viz., 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I taking the whole responsibility of the thing on myself—I was giving what 1 considered a long credit—I did not represent that those earrings had been bought for 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when in fact I bought them 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not cause an invoice to be made out as if those earrings had been purchased from a person of the name of Abrahams, he cannot write—I have had lists made out, but never made use of them beyond my own business—Abraham's name was put in the list because he was a dealer—the articles were never bought for him; some articles were had from him—I have no recollection of asking Mr. Butlin to write the name of Abrahams and he declining saying "The lady will know my handwriting;" and I did not say "I will get Lanthal the boy to do it"—he did not say "It must open the eyes of the boy a great deal"—there is no partnership between the lady of quality and myself—I have the agreement for the loan here—I cannot recollect what the ring on the 12th March was pawned for—I have seen the tickets relating not only to ray property, but that of Messrs. Blogg and Martin—I have heard since that they entrusted the three rings to Butlin—I could not identify as to whose property it was when before Mr. Newton—I did not look over the articles and swear that Messrs. Blogg and Martin's were mine; I believe 87<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was the amount for which the property belonging to me was pawned—the pawn-tickets referring to the Hon. Mrs. B.'s property were for the sums of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—it did not come to my knowledge until after this affair that the Hon. Mrs. B.'s property was absolutely lent, not to be redeemed until the month of October next—I did not know that Butlin was actually in treaty for a loan to be made for him in October—I know Mr. Lynch by sight; he was not a gentleman who promised to make a loan in October—I never permitted Butlin to wear the jewellry—I have never seen him wear anything in my presence, neither pin nor studs—I did not know that the ring and pin had been pledged over and over again and redeemed—I do not remember what you refer to by a moss agate box of the Hon. Mrs. B.'s being entrusted to me to sell; yes, there was something sold for her; Butlin sold it, he was entitled to commission on everything he sold—I do not think the box sold for anything like 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., whatever price I returned to her I gave her a cheque for and she was perfectly satisfied—I had no diamond brooch belonging to Mrs. H., of St. John's Wood—I did not enter into any arrangement to make it up in rings and charge her just the price of the settings—with Mrs. B. I have had such transactions—the prisoner was not entitled to commission on those rings—the cost I returned to Mrs. B. of making up the rings was 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think it cost more than 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—for the first twelve months I had implicit confidence in Butlin, and he was trusted with property to the amount of several thousand pounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> At the police-court I identified things only as my own and not others—Butlin was a very good salesman and I was anxious to secure his services—he was well known to persons who buy jewellery—the advertisement stated that he joined mo, not as a partner, but as an assistant—I said nothing to a contrary effect in the agreement—I did not draw the indictment; I left that to other people—I did not suggest that expression being put in stating that Butlin was a beneficial owner—I had not access to</p>

               <p>any of Streeter's books but my own sale book; I had no opportunity—there was a slight balance in my favour on the commission account between Butlin and myself—respecting the 825<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the earrings I gave twelve months credit and stood the whole risk, and the lady had returned to her 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. capital and 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. profit—the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. capital was in my hands for a few months only—I took the difference, she having declined to give credit at all—there is do truth in the suggestion that I have made up a list of invoices in the name of Abrahams with the intention of doing it fraudulently—I have a book containing an account with each of my wholesale dealers of goods on sale and return—I have one relating to the rings in this indictment (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—one ring in April is struck out as returned, which I have since indentified at the pawnbroker's, and also a set of diamond studs is struck out as being returned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Further cross-examined.</hi> The pawnbroker produces the ring of the 12th May. (<hi rend="italic">The pawnbroker's assistant did so.</hi>) I do not know that that is the ring referred to as being struck out—the ring, No. 1,256, with a pen run through it, is returned from Webb and Co.; the same people who brought the action for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is entered in January, 1877—I swear that is one of the rings; the number is scratched on it, that is how I identify it—there are three single-stone diamond studs entered in this book as 1,648—I do not think you would find 1,648 on so small a thing; they came from Webb and Co.—I kept one commission book and the prisoner kept one—I have not taken possession of everything in the upper part of the premises, 3, Piccadilly—there is 543<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd brought forward which I am giving him com<lb/>mission on—the previous half-year which he is to have the benefit of, I have credited him with 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Further re-examined.</hi> Butlin has never complained of my neglecting to account to him for commission—this is the first time that anything of the kind has ever been imputed to me—I have not got Mr. Butlin's com<lb/>mission book, and I do not know where it is.</p>

I am a surgeon, of 83, Central Street—on Sun<lb/>day morning, 29th July, I was called to Seward Street at 1.10, and found a woman lying on the floor on her back—Mrs. Ambling was with me—the woman was dead and had been so about an hour—on the same evening, by the Coroner's directions, I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—her age was about forty—the body was well nourished—I found a bruise on the left eye, the right eye had been blackened from a blow, and was contused, and the nose was recently fractured, within a few hours or a day—I think the nose bad been fractured quite recently, because it was bleeding when I first examined the body—there was a bruise on the right hand, arm, and shoulder, and on the right shin bone—the cause of death was rupture of the spleen and effusion of about two pints of blood into the abdominal cavity—that, in my judgment, would cause death—the rupture of the spleen had been caused by violence; a blow, a kick, or a fall" on a sharp instrument—I found no external wound corresponding with the rupture of the spleen—I found no external mark to indicate a fall upon any sharp instrument, therefore I exclude that from consideration—a kick on the ribs would be likely to cause the rupture of the spleen, and I found the four ribs on the left side and. the filth rib on the right side fractured; those ribs were too high in the chest to cause the rupture of the spleen—that had nothing to do with the death.</p>

                  </hi>. I am living with my uncle, Admiral Sir Adolphus Slade, at 3, Hyde Park Place—in 1869 I was travelling with my mother in Turkey, where I was introduced to Theodorides at the house of some friends—I saw him only a few times in Constantinople, and later in 1872 he called on my mother in London—he continued to see me, and I made an engagement to marry him in the Summer of 1873—I addressed letters to him and received letters from him—he said it was always best to destroy letters because people might find them, and he also told me that he always destroyed mine, and he advised me to destroy his, which I did soon after receiving them—the engagement was broken off in the Summer of 1874—it extended over about twelve months—I addressed a few letters to him, I think, in 1875, after the engagement was over—the engage<lb/>ment was renewed again, but only for about a month, and then it was finally broken off—soon after that I asked him for my letters; he first of all said that he had destroyed them as I had his—I several times asked him to give me my letters back, and he said my mother was prejudicing his character, that was in September, 1875, I think; and he kept the letters for that reason—that was after he said he had destroyed them, but when I asked him for them again he said he had kept them—I did not believe that he had destroyed them all—no other letters of a friendly character passed between us—T saw him once in 1876, in the Park, I think it was—I had not seen him to speak to him previous to that—I also saw him in the Park this year, in June—he asked me if I had any emnity towards him—I answered "No"—he asked me if I was sorry I had not marrid him—I said "No"—he then said he was in great distress, he had had some unfortunate specula<lb/>tions and had lost everything, and would very likely be made a bankrupt, in which case all his papers might be examined, and my letters as well, to prevent which 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be necessary to enable him to pay off his most pressing debts—I said I could not give him that sum of money—he said that my letters were in the hands of two other people, and, there<lb/>fore, if I wished to get them I must pay that sum—I said I would consult my friends about it, my trustees, and he made me swear that I would not tell anybody until he gave me leave to do so—nothing more passed then, but he wrote to me two or three letters asking me to meet him and</p>

               <p>My dear Miss Slade,—I have not yet answered Mr. Golero, expecting to hear from you. If by to-morrow's post I do not receive any answer to my Wednesday's letter I shall understand you wish to leave out of my hands this unfortunate affair. Without ex<lb/>plaining to Mr. Golero what the papers are I will tell him they are different papers concerning you, and that he had better come and see you, and then you can make whatever arrangement you like. I tried my best to save you and your dignity, and as I tell you, by to-morrow Mr. Golero ignores what the box contains and shall not know it from me. Unfortunately, the 18th is not far off, then I shall have done with the matter. The remaining letters in my possession you can have. Those which are out of my hands, and which are, as you know, dreadful, can be got by the 18th, provided I know by to-morrow's post the answer for Mr. Golero. Again tell me what are your wishes. What can be managed privately and confidentially now for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., God only knows what will be afterwards. Constantine Theo<lb/>dorides.") There is a reference thereto Wednesday's letter—I had received the letter from him on the Wednesday, and I had received other letters—I tore up the first ones and sent my maid into the Park to fetch the eight letters to which he referred—he said he would give me the remaining letters for a sum of money, and some of my mother's; there were eight altogether—the third time I saw him he said that he had no more letters, except eight, which were all in Golero's hands—I only saw him three times—I cannot fix the date—this other letter is in his writing, it is partly in French and partly in English. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 18<hi rend="italic">th July</hi>, 1877, <hi rend="italic">signed Constantine Theodorides</hi>, 27, <hi rend="italic">Bishopsgate Street, stating that he had received an anonymous letter; that he had seen Golero, who had promised not to open the box, except before him; that there were seventy-four Utters in it of Miss Slade's. and also a few of her</hi>

There is an allusion there to an anony<lb/>mous letter—I suppose I did not sign my letter—on the 18th Golero came to my uncle's house—he sent up a card, but I refused to see him—I then received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), in consequence of which I communicated with Mr. M'Coan—after the prisoners were given in custody a large travelling box was brought to the police-court, carried by Sergeant Butcher—all the letters in it were addressed to Theodorides—seventy-four of them were de<lb/>livered to me, besides which there were fifty, I think, in the large trunk, but there were hundreds of others—there was nothing but letters in the box—I have destroyed the seventy-four letters and the fifty taken from the trunk—all those were letters which I had written to him during the engagement—I do not know the writing on this card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) "Prince's Gate Hotel," but it is in the same writing as Golero's were—here are names in it of friends of my family, please not to read them out—the whole of this one (<hi rend="italic">another</hi>) is in Theodorides' writing, but I am not quite certain about the bottom, it is written rather quicker—this one, the third, is in the same writing as Golero's letter—this address, "Prince's Gate Hotel," is Theodorides' writing, but I say nothing about the others—the writing in ink corresponds with Golero's letter.</p>

Lewis and Lewis, on the 23rd, or 24th July—I called at Theodorides' lodgings, 13, Rathbone Place, but he had gone to the City—I then went on in an omnibus and overtook him and Golero in Holborn together—I got out and joined them—I had known Golero many years before in Constantinople, and recognised his face and name—I had the two letters of Theodorides with me which have been read, and one of Golero's of 18th July, signed "Golero"—we adjourned from the street into a coffee-house in Holborn—I said that Miss Slade had mentioned the matter to me and asked me to settle it, and I asked Golero what he wanted—I began the conversation by producing the letters—I asked Golero if those were the letters he had written to Miss Slade—he said they were—Golero does not speak English, but they both speak French—I said to Golero "I do not know exactly what you want, or how much you want" and I asked him for an explanation—he said that Theodorides owed him 695<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the balance of a debt, and he showed me a memorandum purporting' to be a statement of account between them shewing that balance on an original debt of 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—he said that as a material guarantee for the payment of the balance; he had got possession of a box of Theodorides containing letters, and as Theodorides could not pay him the money he must have it from Miss Slade—I said it was idle to ask such a large sum as 695<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but as soon as I had seen Miss Slade and Sir Adolphus Slade I would see what could be done by way of arranging the matter—during the conversa<lb/>tion Theodorides frequently spoke to Golero in Italian, thinking that I did not understand it, but I did—the meaning of what Golero said was this, Theodorides appeared to be inducing Golero to take a less sum than 695<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170204"/>
               <p>but Golero said he would not take less than 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not quite recollect whether it was at that interview or the second that he spoke of taking two-thirds in cash from me, and an acceptance from Theodorides for the balance, indorsed by some solvent person—I then made an appointment for the fallowing day at the Cafe Monico, in Tiehborne Street—we met there and pretty much the same conversation passed—I said that when a sum was finally agreed on I would give my cheque for it—Golero shook his head and smiled, saying he would have no cheques, he would have nothing but bank notes—I asked him where the letters were—he said they were in safe custody and could be produced in ten minutes—Theodorides in some stage of the conversation asked me in an aside how much I was really disposed to give and he again suggested to Golero in Italian that he should not press for an impracticable sum—I said in an aside also that I thought I should not go beyond 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Theodorides then spoke again in Italian communi<lb/>cating the substance of it to Golero, and we made another appointment for the following Saturday, the 28th, at the Cafe Monico, at 12 o'clock—I found them waiting for me when I got there, and in the meantime a warrant had been taken out, but as the arrangement was not ripe for execution I said that 1 was not. ready yet, but on Monday I hoped to finish it altogether—Golero was very angry when he heard of another adjournment—he said he would not stand it any longer, he would take immediate steps—he threatened to begin on Saturday, but said that I could arrest them by obtaining a settlement on Monday—I said that if he did I should decline to carry out the matter, and he would only be cutting off his nose to please his face—he calmed down a little, and consented to suspend it till Monday—the last sum he had mentioned was 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I led him to think that I would give him that sum, or a greater part of it—on Monday, at 4 o'clock, I went to the Cafe Monico, and found them waiting for me—a negotiation for the amount was then opened, and to satisfy them that I meant business I showed them a roll of bank notes—Golero said "Well, it is understood that you are to give me 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—we were all three sitting at the same table—I said "No, that is really too much, but go and bring the letters and we will fix the figure"—Golero went out and was away a quarter of an hour, Theo<lb/>dorides remaining with me—Golero returned with the box, which was tied with red tape—it was opened—I examined its contents; it contained seventy-four letters of Miss Slade's, and two or three little objects, a tobacco bag, and something else—I closed the box and said that it was a very serious matter, that they had put themselves within the reach of the law, and in fact they were arrested—I had only been able to obtain the warrant that morning, which accounts for the postponement—two police-officers in plain clothes then came forward and took the prisoners in custody to Vine Street station—I wished to retain possession of the box of letters, but Golero applied to the inspector and said that it was his property, and the inspector sealed it up—Theodorides asked to see the warrant—the officer said that he would show it to him at the station—I saw that the seventy-four letters were in Miss Slade's writing, and were addressed to Theodorides—they were given up to her before the Magistrate—Theodorides had assured me that those were the whole of the letters remaining in his con<lb/>troll—I was present at the subsequent examination of the contents of the box, but I afterwards saw a trunk produced by Sergeant Russell, in which 1 with Miss Slade found about sixty-three or sixty-four of Miss Slade's letters, and a great many other ladies' letters also.</p>

From Paul Golero, importer, to Miss Ernesta Slade: Miss,—Last Saturday upon the repeated instances of Mr. Constantine Theodorides, I made it my duty to come and see you personally about the sealed box in my possession which concerns you. Although at the door I asked to see you, I was shown in to the Admiral, and he said he could bear all concerning his niece. I have no doubt your uncle communicated in detail the interview I had with him in reference to the sealed bos. Certainly I was ignorant of the contents, or else I should have understood of what importance were the documents it contained, and insisted on seeing only you and alone. A correspondence similar to that between you and Mr. Theodorides is of too great importance to allow any in<lb/>terference of third people. It is very astonishing, Miss, in spite of my great delicacy towards Mr. Theodorides and yourself, you let pass the date for the opening of the box without occupying yourself to take it off my hands. I have read your letters in full, and I assure you I admire your indifference. I expected to find some bonds or valuable objects. I have only found some letters and other papers without value. However, I am more than satisfied. I can now for the first time sleep soundly about my debt, and I shall know how to get back my debt in making use of your letters. If you have a good memory you must know what is in them, and who had' such a correspondence with you. I shall act against whoever it may be to get my debt of 650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Theodorides cannot pay, I know. Therefore I trust to you before address<lb/>ing myself to third people. I regret that there should have been no witness at the opening of the box. In case, Miss, I am not paid by the 20th, I shall commence more efficacious measures. Perhaps I shall send some copies to your uncle, the admiral, and save the honour of the family before publication. I shall see what I have to do, being complete master, and nothing shall stop me. Take notice of what I say."</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and am now living as wet nurse with Mrs. Barales, at Sydney Cottage, Walthamstow—I was confined in the Isling<lb/>ton Workhouse, on 27th March of a male child, which I suckled for three months and a fortnight up to 16th July, when I—made an-arrangement with Mrs. Barales, who arranged with the prisoner to take my child at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week and keep it—my sister, Mrs. Smith, was to send clothes, and the prisoner was to give it the necessaries of life—she said she would do a mother's part to it—my sister introduced the prisoner.; mine was a fine healthy child—I paid the money regularly to the prisoner by post-office order every week, which I sent to my sister for her—a fortnight, afterwards I heard that my child had diarrhoea, but I afterwards heard from my sister that it was better—I then heard no more—I got anxious about the child and informed my mistress, who went to see it—on 3rd September, I received a letter from the workhouse saying that it was dead—four days afterwards I saw it and identified it at the inquest—I could not recognise it at first, but the second time I went to see it—I recognised its toes—two of the toes on each foot were joined together.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Barales, an independent gen<lb/>tleman, of Sydney Cottage, Walthamstow—on 16th July I engaged Eliza Onslow, at Islington Workhouse, as wet nurse of my baby—I saw her child; it was a very beautiful child, four months old and very healthy—there was a suggestion that her sister should take care of her baby, and I went with her to her sister, Mrs. Smith, who sent for the prisoner and introduced her—she engaged to take the baby and was asked her terms</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170212"/>
               <p>she said 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, for which she would act a mother's part, and the sister promised to provide it with clothes—the mother was to pay the money—the prisoner took the child there and then a fortnight afterwards I heard of it having diarrhoea, then that it was better; but hearing no more I bad a conversation with Onslow about it, and on 27th August, went to Mrs. Smith's house at Dover Street, Islington, and went with her to the prison<lb/>er's house a few doors off—a little girl was standing at the door and Mrs. Payne told me to go upstairs—I did so, and found the child lying on the bed in a very deplorable condition—I recognised it chiefly by its dark eyes—it was moaning and crying with its mouth wide open—it was very dirty, its frock and pinafore were miserable—I only saw its clothes then—it was a perfect skeleton, and nothing like the child I had seen six weeks before—I went home and spoke to my husband, and next day, about 2.30 in the afternoon, he went with me to the prisoner's house—we went unexpectedly—the prisoner was out, we saw the little girl—we went upstairs and found the child in the same state, worse, if anything—its body was very dirty—it was covered over with an old black shaw l—it was making no noise that day; it was very quiet—I sent for something for it—its mouth was very sore—I asked for the baby's bottle, which was given to me in a very dirty state in<lb/>deed—I sent it down to Mrs. Payne to wash it, and asked for some warm water—I then gave the baby the milk from the bottle, which it took very ravenously—it had no diapers on, and its clothes were very much soiled—its flesh was very much wrinkled—we then went to the Islington Work-house and saw the matron and afterwards the relieving officer, who went with us back to the prisoner's house—we found her there—I had told the little girl that we should go for a policeman—the baby had then been changed into clean clothes and the prisoner was feeding it with brandy and egg—I told her I was very shocked to find the child in that way, and it was very unkind of her to treat it so badly and in that dirty neglected state—she said that she had not neglected it—she had left it with her little girl to look after it—the relieving officer went with me and we took it to the union and left it with the night nurse—I had never seen a child in such a state before—it was very scantily clothed—I touched it, it was cold; it had no socks on and nothing to keep it warm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My husband was an earthenware dealer—I have seven children and have considerable experience in the care of young children—when I took the child to the prisoner I did not say that it was for six weeks—I said that it had no socks, and that its feet were cold, but its feet were covered over—I am not in the habit of paying visits to very poor people this was the 26th of August—it was remarkably fine weather—I should load clothes on a sick child at that time of year—I have had a child of mine suffering from diarrhoea, and I lost one nine months old—I do not think it was ill twenty-four hours—when I left on the second occasion to go to the workhouse, I did not tell the prisoner when I should return—I had given no suggestion or directions and yet I found her when I returned feeding it with egg and brandy—the girl was fifteen years old—there is nothing remarkable in a girl of that age attending to a baby—when the child was first left with the prisoner I paid for some milk and for a bottle, out of my own pocket.</p>

               <p>she has been taking in children to nurse on and off all that time—some were left there by the day, some by the hour for a few hours together, and some altogether—I remember the child Onslow coming there—I saw it; it was a very nice baby—the prisoner was sometimes out all day, and some<lb/>times she was in and out—at times I hardly know whether she was in or out—a little girl of 10 or 11 used to have charge of the child, but she does not look so old—she sometimes minded the children, but she was downstairs the best part of the time when her mother was out—I never saw the baby out but twice, and that was when the prisoner took it to a doctor—I used to hear it cry nearly all day—I have had it downstairs two or three times, and I washed it once, but I only went upstairs to see it when the lady asked me to wash the bottle—it was very dirty indeed when I washed it—I fed it on two occasions, and it took the food as if it would choke itself—after it had been there some weeks it looked as if it was dying—I gave it nursery biscuits, which I bought for my own children—one evening, when I went to bolt the back door, I heard the prisoner say "Put a little drop of water in the bottle and a bit of sugar, and that will do for Willie to-night"—I do not know who she spoke to—Willie was the baby which is dead—the children used to call him Willie—I have never seen any food provided for the child; no milk was taken in at the door—the children used to fetch a pennyworth, and that was all I ever saw—Mrs. Johnson had five children and this baby made six, and a pennyworth of milk was all they had during the day—the children passed through the passage and my children were at the door, and they used to say "Who is that milk for? and the answer was "Willie"—I told the prisoner the baby looked bad, and said "Are you going to take it to the doctor's?"—she said "I have taken it to the doctor, and it is getting all right"—I said "It does look a deplorable little crea<lb/>ture"—I have said to her that it was a shame to go away and leave the child crying like that, and she went upstairs—when Mrs. Barales came she sent for some water to wash the bottle, and of course I took it up and saw the child—it was lying on the bed with another child belonging to Mrs. Langridge—the gentleman gave the child the bottle, and it took it as if it was going down a sink almost—I used to hear the child all the week it was there, night and day—it used to make my heart ache to hear it cry, being the mother of eight children—I heard crying and moaning too—when I went up into the room I saw that it was in a neglected state—it was afterwards taken to the workhouse, and the lady and her husband came back again about 5 or 6 o'clock—I did not think the child would live till it got to the workhouse—the gentleman offered me a sovereign to take it there and then—the prisoner has no husband; she goes out nursing people, and did so during the time the child was there—she would never let any<lb/>body know her business—she has sometimes had three or four children there—she got her living, as far as I know, by going out nursing and taking in children.</p>
               <p>

               <p>take it to a doctor—I do not think I have heard her express any anxiety that the child should recover—I believe she showed a disposition to neglect it—she might have gone to the doctor many times without my knowing it—there was never more than ld. worth of milk brought into the house in a day for the six children; whether the others had any I cannot say—I never saw any preserved milk in the house and never heard of any coming in—I have not seen empty tins about—I pay as much as 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week for it my self—it is not unusual to feed children on condensed milk I give them biscuit as well—condensed milk does not come into the house in the same way as other milk, it comes in quietly—when the child has been crying I have told the children when they were playing to go up to the baby and they have gone up—I heard the girl of fifteen say to her mother once when she was coming downstairs "I'm not going to look after the child"—I never sent the girl to the pawnshop, she went of her own accord to take a thimble because she wanted bread—I do not know when that was, but she came home and said "Oh, Mrs. Payne, they have kept my thimble, I wanted to take it because I wanted some bread"—she asked me to get the thimble back—I had no altercation with the prisoner about it—the other child which was with Willie was going the same way, but it is now going on well it gained 1/4 1b. of flesh in nine days.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent night nurse at Islington Workhouse—I saw the deceased on 28th August; it was so weak that it could not take the breast, but after carefully feeding it for two hours it was able to do so, but very feebly—I fed it with beef tea and arrowroot and milk for two hours and warmed it, and then it was able to take the breast—it went on pretty well to the Friday and then began to sink, and it died on Satur<lb/>day morning the 2nd of September—I never heard it cry, it was too feeble—it was very thin and emaciated—it had no diarrhoea then.</p>

                  </hi>, M. R. C. S. I am resident medical officer for the Islington Workhouse—I attended Eliza Onslow in her confinement, and on 28th August the child was brought to me by Mrs. Barales in a very emaciated condition—I ordered it to be taken up to a suckling woman, and also to have some beef tea and arrowroot—I did not expect it would recover, it had the ordinary signs of emaciation; wrinkled skin, prominent cheek bones, and sunken eyes—there was no apparent disease—it was then clean and there were no signs in the flexes of the thighs and such parts as though it had been neglected—there were no sores from non-washing and drying, but there was a little external redness of the anus, which indicated that there had been diarrhcea—I was told by the day-nurse that it had had diarrhoea for two days after its admission; that nurse is not here—I spoke to Eliza Judge about it; nothing was said about diarrhcea—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—there were no marks of violence externally; the whole of the organs were healthy, except two, although they were deficient in blood—the brain was healthy, but between the skull and the dura mater—there were 3 ounces of serum; the mesenteric glands were somewbat degenerated—the middle part of the intestine was empty, the large intestine contained fair-looking fcecal matter; I say fair, in a healthy sense—the other organs were all healthy—the enlargement and degenera<lb/>tion of the mesenteric glauds is sometimes constitutional, and is pro<lb/>duced by bringing children up by hand—the state of the mesenteric glands was not sufficient to account for death—the cause of death was mesenteric disease and emaciation, and the question is how that emaciation was produced—there was serum in the brain, but there was no disease to account for that; that is a symptom when the current of blood from some debilitating cause becomes more slow, and the capilaries give out serum—that is common in exhausting maladies, in children especially—that is common whenever the condition is debilitated, from whatever cause—the condition of the mesenteric glands and of the brain, was not sufficient to account for death—there was no disease of the brain to account for death—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170217"/>
               <p>I have heard the whole of the evidence—the emaciation might be produced from neglect or from diarrhoea—diarrboea would produce almost the same symptoms as neglect—the emaciation is almost in appearance the same as it would be from severe diarrhoea—there was nothing on the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination which enables me to say whether the emaciation was caused by the one or the other.</p>

I am a plate layer, of 28, High Street, North Woolwich—on 28th July I was at the North Woolwich public-house, and the prisoner, Henry Shadd, put his hand on my shoulder and asked me if I was going home—he then snatched my watch from my waist-coat pocket, struck my mouth and made it bleed, and passed my watch to one of his mates—I got hold of him round the arms, held him till a policeman came, and gave him in custody—I did not see the other prisoner then, but after Henry had been remanded by the Magistrate, William came to me and said that he knew where the watch was, and he would give it to me if I would not prosecute his brother—I said that I would not, and he took the watch out of a white pocket handkerchief and gave it to me—I was afterwards told that I should get into trouble if I did not prosecute, so I told the sergeant, who took him in custody—this is my watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Henry Shadd.</hi> I was not lying asleep on a chair at the Three Crowns—you tried to get away from me, and your mates tried to get you away—you stayed on the stairs with me, and said "You had better search those who are behind and send for a policeman"—the landlord turned me out and said that I had no watch on me—when we got outside you were free, you did not attempt to run away because a policeman was there.</p>

On 1st August, Smith pointed out William Shadd to me and I took him, and said that he very likely would be charged with receiving a watch and chain, knowing them to be stolen—he said "I know different to that, last evening a man came up to me in Albert Road, who I do not know, and gave me the watch and chain and asked me to have them passed back to the prosecutor, and said that he wanted a little recompense, but I did not give him anything"—I took him to the station and charged him with receiving—I found the broken bow of another watch on him—I was present on the night of the robbery, Smith appeared sober, the prisoner Henry accused him of being drunk—I said he is not drunk; he smelt a little of drink; he appeared to know very well what he was about.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">William, Shadd 'produced a written defence, stating that on the night after the robbery a man gave him the watch, stating that he picked it up under one of the tables at the Three Crowns, and asked him to restore it; to release his brother; who was his only support, and that he picked up the watch bow some months ago.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a sandman and work for Mr. Lee, at the loam pits, Deptford—about February last, I was driving a cart, which was run into by another vehicle driven by Mr. Harriett's carman—I was taken to the hospital by a City officer, and four or five days after I came out I met the two prisoners in High Street, Deptford—my wife was on the other side of the way—I told them I had met with an accident, and must have somebody to write a letter for me—they said "Well, you may as well give the case into our hands"—they both said that; I knew them before and always thought Mr. Chappell was a solicitor—they said they would call on me in a day or two, and Mr. Chappell gave me this card "William Hicks, solicitor," with "Mr. Chappell" in the left hand corner—Chappell crossed out the address "3, Strickland Street, Deptfcrd," with a pencil and wrote "20, Prior Street, Greenwich"—about five days afterwards Dobsou drove up in a cab to my house—he came in and said "I shall charge you 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and. I will give you a. copy of the letter," and my wife gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but we did not get the copy until we had paid a guinea for the writ—the letter looked like this.

Received of Samuel Ballard one guinea, on account of costs. Miles John Do! son"—eight or nine days after that they both came in a cab—my wife said again "I do not believe you are solicitors" he had said so at the Amersham Arras, and they both said Well, we should not take the money and represent ourselves so if we were not solicitors"—they wanted 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more to show an appearance in a higher court—my wife said "Then you will not have it"—they said "Then you will get yourselves into trouble and us too, and you will not have a bed to sleep on"—Dobson had got the witness's papers in the action in the City, who look me to the hospital, and (he second time he said "Now, pay me some more money and I will give you up the papers and get somebody else to take further proceedings"—I did not give him any more money—I shewed him some and he thought he was going to have five guineas, and pulled out a receipt, but 1 put the money in my pocket and said "Thank you, I will take it somewhere else"—they wanted five guiueas to take the case up to the Queen's Court at Westminster—they both said that—they did not go away—I walked out of the house and left them there—my wife was at home—I saw no more of them—I instructed somebody else and the result was a summons in this case—I authorised my wife to pay the money because I thought they were solicitors as they represented themselves.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. I have known Chappell about twelve years and always thought he was a solicitor—I have not seen him at police-courts—I was cross-examined at the police-court as to the offence for which I was tried—it was thirty years ago since I came out of Brixton for seven days—we were a lot of boys together in a field roasting <hi rend="italic">laters</hi>, and twenty years ago 1 got three months for stealing a sack of beans—I have also had six months for gambling in 1866—I have been home thirteen years and nobody can say anything against me—I call it gambling, it was for stealing money from the person—there was not six months for gambling us well—the first statement I made to the Magistrate was that Chappell gave me the card and my wife paid the money—I had to admit in cross-examination that I had the card five days before any money was paid—I cannot read much, nor can my wife—we did not read the card—nobody read it to us till I took it to the solicitor—I saw the prisoner outside the Centurion at Deptford, and told them that I had had a horse killed—I did not say "I have got a bit of a law job on"—I said "I have got a bit of a hard job on"—I said I should have to get somebody to attend to it for me—I did not go for the purpose of getting Chappell to attend to it—they stopped me and said "Halloo, Bailard, how are you getting on?" and I told them, and they said "If you are going to have anybody you might as well put it in our way, we are both solicitors"—when I said I had a bit of a law job on 1 intended to ask Chappell to do it for me, thinking he was a solicitor—I should not have told them anything about it or asked them to attend to it if 1 had not thought they were soli<lb/>citors—Chappell said that he could not stop to talk the matter over then</p>

               <p>and I went away—it was five days before I saw them and paid any money—the next time I saw them was on 15th February, at the Amersham Arms, when I paid the money, but Dobson got the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at ray house when Chappell was not there—I did not go to the Amersham Arms for the purpose of seeing them, they met me in my cart and told me to meet them—I sent my wife to see if they were there and they were both there—I did not ask Chappell which was the cheapest way to take a summons out in the Mayor's Court, or the County Court, nor did he tell me that if Mr. Harriett was in the jurisdiction of the Mayor's Court it would be cheaper to go there—the Mayor's Court was mentioned; it was to be taken there for 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that was to show an. appearance—I had had that card five days before that—I went into the Amersham Arms and came out again—they both represented themselves to me as solicitors outside the Amersham Arms—I did' not say before the Magistrate that nothing of the sort was said at the Amersham Arms; I said that it was not said inside.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170222"/>
               <p>for a receipt for the guinea—they said they did not think he wanted a receipt for a guinea and they would have to go to the Queen's Court to get the writ—they gave him this receipt, I put it on the file and the copy of the letter too—I should not have paid the money if they had not represented themselves as solicitors—they both said "We cannot go just yet, we must wait here till 12 o'clock to see a lady on the same business, as her husband has met with an accident, and one journey will serve for two—we met the prisoners a couple of weeks afterwards coming out of a railway station and Dobson said "Mrs. Ballard, I want you to give me 235."—my husband said "What for?"—Chappell said "For putting in an appearance"—I said to my husband "I don't think I should let them have anymore"—he said "I don't think I shall let you have any more," and Chappell said "If you do not give Us the money you will get into a great deal of trouble, you will have everything taken from you, and not only that you will be sent to prison besides"—I saw them three or four times after that, and on each occasion they asked my husband for money.</p>

That silk is stolen from a warehouse in Southwark Street; I want you to account for the possession of it"—he said "I bought it of a man for samples"—I said "When and where?—he said "I bought it of a man in a public-house in the City Road"—I said 'What is the man's name, and the sign of the house?"—he said he did not know, I then asked him for a description of the man—he said "I cannot give you one"—I held the receipt up and said "Here is a receipt for 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that Johnson paid you"—he said "Well, I did not write that receipt, that is not my writing"—Johnson said "You were present when it was written"—Allen said "Yes, but it is 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., not 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I then said "Did you receive that 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said "Yes, I received it and paid it to the man who brought the silk, and he gave me a half sovereign for my trouble"—I asked him if he had got any receipt or invoice; he said "No"—I said "I will search your house"—in the kitchen drawer I found this piece of black ribbon—I asked him how he accounted for it"—he said "I bought it some five or six days ago"—I said "When and where?—he said "I bought it in the street of an old clothes woman, off a barrow"—I said "What street? how much did you give for it"—he said "5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>"—I took Allen and Johnson to the station, and they were charged with stealing the goods—I went to Harris, the father's house, in the evening, and he gave me this receipt "Bought of F.

I am a merchant and live in Poland, I bad been in England five months in May, or June, 1877—I do not know whether that was the date of my going or of my coming back—I do not know a word of English; I corresponded with the prisoner before I left here—I arrived in London again on Wednesday, 8th August, and put up at the hotel Causier, 23, Broad Street, Bloomsbury, and telegraphed to the prisoner announcing my arrival in London—he came to my hotel the same night about 6 o'clock, and I had a conversation with him in Polish—he told me he should be able to purchase some Chamois skins—he did not say who from, only that he would call next day about them—he said that to-morrow about noon we should go to the merchant, but did not give me the merchant's address—about 11 o'clock next morning his wife called and I went with her to 43, Clifton Crescent, Peckham, where they live—we went into the dining-room where I saw the prisoner in bed, he said that he had caught cold and had sent for the merchant who would be there in two hours—I remained there, and at the end of that time Mrs. Pfeiffer came upstairs and said that the merchant had arrived—the prisoner put his clothes on and went down with me to the merchant, whom I had never seen before—I have since pointed him out at the Cafe Monico, in Piccadilly, to Mr. Woolf; his name is David Von Hand—the would be merchant produced a little bag in which there was one Chamois skin as a sample, and they conversed in English which I did not understand—I examined one skin and made a bargain for</p>

               <p>170 dozen of them, which amounted to 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. English—Pfeiffer asked me twice to give the money to the merchant—I said that as I had the pleasure of seeing the merchant for the first time in my life and did not know him, I would rather not part with my money until I got the skins—they conversed together and Pfeiffer sent out for some brandy, and we had a glass together—it was arranged for Pfeiffer and the merchant to come to my hotel, and we were all to go to the warehouse and inspect the skins—no address was given where the skins were—Pfeiffer told me that I could trust any amount of money with the merchant, that he had had transactions with him to a very large amount—after several attempts made by Pfeiffer to induce me to part with my money to the merchant, he told me to give it to him, and I gave him a deposit, for which this receipt produced was written; the body of it is in my writing and the signature is Pfeiffer's—the figures on the receipt stamp are mine—I gave him 2,200 Prussian bank-notes, marks, and 1,000 francs in French gold. (<hi rend="italic">The receipt as translated was for</hi> 2,200 <hi rend="italic">Prussian bank-notes, and</hi> 1,000 <hi rend="italic">francs; as a deposit for the purchase of</hi> 130 <hi rend="italic">dozen Chamois skins; to be returned if the bargain was not concluded, and signed Martin Pfeiffer</hi>, 10<hi rend="italic">th August</hi>, 1877.) The date is a mistake, it took place on Thursday, the 9th—the next day Pfeiffer came to my hotel without the merchant—he said that the merchant had not come, no doubt something had happened to him and I must be quite easy, very likely I should see him to-morrow—next day Pfeiffer came again without the merchant and said that most likely very important business had kept him from coming on so slight an affair—I smelt that the business was not right and said "This is not <hi rend="italic">bond-fide</hi> business, it looks like a swindle"—on the following Sunday I went to Pfeiffer at Peckham, and told him to go to the—merchant—I said "I do not want any skins, give me my money back"—he said "I have not got the money, I gave it to the merchant"—being Sunday he said "We cannot go and see him, the merchant does not live in. London, he is only a travelling merchant"—we went on that very Sunday to look after him in a public-house or coffee-house—he told me that generally the merchant was there about 6 o'clock in the evening and very likely we might meet him there, but the place was shut up—Pfeiffer then told me he should try and find him to-morrow, and for certain he would come to me on the Monday, and said that he was not able to find him—I asked for the merchant's home and residence; he told me he did not know it himself, that he only met him in that coffee-house—he had said on Monday that the merchant was a Frenchman—I saw Pfeiffer every day after that—I returned to Nottingham on Sunday, 19th August, and returned on the following Tuesday with Mr. Woolf—with the exception of those days I saw Pfeiffer every day until I gave him in custody—I kept secret that I wanted to arrest differ; I did not see him after the 16th—I went to Dover on Thursday, the 16th, that was the Thursday before I went to Nottingham—the prisoner went with me to the station, and was with me up to the starting of the train—I paid for my ticket; I asked the prisoner for my money, and he said I should have it when I got into the carriage—when the train was going to start I asked him for the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him I was going to Poland, but my intention was to keep secret in London that I might arrest him—I did not. get the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I wished him good-bye, the train started, and he stopped at the station—he was taken custody on Wednesday night, August 22nd, after which Mrs. Pfeiffer gave me a card of Mr. Kipps, of Bermondsey—I went there on Saturday, 25th August with Mr. Woolf, who spoke to Mr. Kipps in.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). I remember seeing the defendant between 6th and 10th August outside Mr. Holyhead's shop, and she asked me if I would be kind enough to re-direct all letters from Orchard Row to 14, Treherne Road, as she had removed to Mrs. Watson's house in the name of Harris or Harrison, and I told her to write to the post-master, I could not do it—I fix the date by its being a day or two after bank-holiday—she seemed as well as ever.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I never gave this evidence before, either at the police-court or here to-day—I am certain it was not on the 3rd or the 11th, that I met her—it was previously to my delivering the post-card—this was not suggested to me after I heard Mr. Coombes' evidence, I volunteered it—I was called to prove the delay of the post-card.</p>
