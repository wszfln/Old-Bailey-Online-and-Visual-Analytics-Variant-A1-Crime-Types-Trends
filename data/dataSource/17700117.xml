I was going across Church-court; I heard a running up the court; I made a stop just at the corner; by that time, the prisoner and this young man came up; he catched the prisoner by the coat. The prisoner turned round, and dropped the candlestick from his left hand. I took it up directly. He fetched the young man a knock, but with assistance he was soon secured. I went with him to Sir

               <p>Mr. Roberts. I had seen it hanging up in the parlour that day before I went out, about four o'clock in the afternoon. When I came home, between seven and eight o'clock, my maid gave me a direction to go to the swan and two necks, in Lad-lane, for a box. I went there the next morning, but no box was there for me. (That direction I left at Sir John Fielding's ) When I came home, I asked my maid what sort of a man it was that left that direction? She said, he was a very tall, thin man. Such was the prisoner. In looking round the room, I missed my sword; I went and got it advertised, and the Saturday following, Mr. Fielding sent for me to come to him on the Monday, at eleven o'clock. He said a man was taken up for stealing a silver candlestick, and he thought he might be the man that had stole my sword. I went and found the prisoner there, and my sword (produced in court.) This sword is my property; I have wore it five or six years.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Roberts. On a Wednesday in last month, the prisoner knocked at our door. He asked if Mr. Roberts was at home? I told him no. He asked what time I expected him in? I said that was uncertain. He said he was book-keeper at the swan and two necks in Lad-lane, and there was a box left there for my master, and had been there above a week, and he called to let us know, fearing there might be something of consequence in it. He asked me leave to write a direction. I asked him to walk into the front parlour; and gave him a pen and ink.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The sword hung in that parlour.</p>
               <p>J. Jones. While he was writing the direction, another man knocked at the door; I went to answer at the door, and left the prisoner in the parlour. The man at the door asked if a captain did not lodge here? I told the man we had no lodger at all. He said, a friend of his had fell down in the street, and broke his leg, and he would be very much obliged to me, if I could direct him to a captain, naming a name, to assist in getting his friend into the hospital. While I was talking to him, the prisoner came out of the parlour, and delivered a direction to me, and desired me not to forget to deliver it to my master, and went away.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>J. Jones. This was about a quarter after six in the evening. I thought it very odd, he should come so out of the parlour. I went in after he was gone, but did not miss any thing then. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177001170004"/> next morning I missed the sword and belt, and told my mistress of it. When my master returned  he soon missed it. I am sure the prisoner is the man that came in and wrote the direction; he had the same great-coat on he has now: he had it open. I know his face and his voice; and am certain he is the man.</p>

            . I am servant to Miss Ware. I was with her when she was robbed. We were stopped by four young men; it was on a Friday evening, about nine o'clock, not an hundred yards from our own home, as we were coming from town. When they came up to us, they asked for a little of our money; mistress said she had no pockets on; they searched her, and found she had not. It was the short man that took her cloak. Then they came to me, and asked for my money; I gave them a shilling and some halfpence. As they came up to us, one of them said, Shoot her! and when they went away, one of them said they would blow her brains out, because she said, Pray don't take my cloak. I took notice of their faces. I know Corby and Busby; Busby is the short one. I gave my money into one of the tall one's hands, but whether it was Corby, or one of the others, I cannot tell. It was Busby that took my mistress's cloak. I saw them the Tuesday se'nnight after at Sir

            . I keep the crown ale-house, in Brumpton-road. On Friday the 8th of December, there were four young men came into my house, and staid and drank till about nine o'clock, then they went away; and the next morning I heard of this robbery. I am sure Corby and Busby were two of them, and I believe Butler, the evidence, was one with them; I thought so when I saw them again at Sir John's.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177001170005"/> My house is about 140 or 150 yards from the place where the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Busby. I was in that house with two other men; but I cannot say who they were.</p>
               <p>W. Butler. I am near 18 years of age. I am a plaisterer. The three prisoners were with me in Bow-street; but only Corby and Busby were with me in the Brumpton-road. We saw the lady; we went to her, and asked for her money; she said she had none: then Corby took her cloak from her. Corby had a broken pistol that would not fire; Busby had one that would. I had no pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. Who else was with you?</p>
               <p>Butler. I do not remember any body else being with us. I was very much in liquor; so were they. She said she had no pockets on. I went to feel for her pockets, and found she had none. The other young woman was with the lady; we heard them squeak when we ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Who said, Blow her brains out?</p>
               <p>Butler. I did not hear it. I was very drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you acquainted with them?</p>

Going down Princes-street, we saw this gentlewoman; I ran after her, and laid hold round her neck; said she, What do you want? I said, I want to kiss you. She said, Go along. I took her cloak off and put it behind me. She went to catch at me, and I hit her once or twice. I seeing some people on the other side the way, I ran down Leicester-fields. The two prisoners were not with me then; they were in Princes-street. I carried the cloak to Westminster. After I got there, they came to me, and said, What did you do to the woman? I said, What is that to you? I hid the cloak in the house, and afterwards gave it to Peg Warden to pawn it for me. The two prisoners had none of the money; I had it all myself.</p>

I had left the bill that was due from Mr. Hall, for his goods, with Mr. Williams, the keeper of the tavern; and had shewed to his servants, what were Mr. Hall's property; they were separated from the rest of the goods. I know I left the pistol in the room, which was afterwards missing. It was such a thing I never had in my hands before, made me take notice of it. It is made to turn round, in order to fire both barrels, one after the other. (A double-barrel pistol produced.) This is it.</p>

               <p>Langley. A few days after the prisoner was taken up, I went to him in prison, and asked him, whether or not he was guilty in taking other things? He said he could give no answer at that time, because there were two other persons with him I said, there is a remarkable pistol found, which I understand will be advertised. Said he, I wish you would go to the auctioneer in Holborn, and tell him not to appear against me, for I did take it, and I will pay him for it. Instead of going to Mr. Nelson, I went to Mr. Hall, and told him of it. Then Mr. Hall went and told Mr. Sing of it.</p>

It was a red-and-white linen one. I took it up from the ground; it lay about half a yard from his feet. He asked me what I laid hold of him for? I told him, his conscience would tell him. Some other lads, that I supposed to be his confederates, jostled my shoulder, at the instant that I felt the attack at my pocket; they were impertinent, and asked me what business I had with the boy? which rather determined me to prosecute him, or I know not but I should have let him have gone. The prisoner said, indeed he did not take it, and went on his knees once or twice, and desired to be let go. I took him to the Poultry-compter (after that he broke out of the compter ) I thinking I should never hear any more of him, used the handkerchief in common. And about a fortnight ago, coming over London-bridge, I had it picked out of my pocket, so cannot produce it. I had produced it before my Lord Mayor, and before the grand jury, when they found the bill.</p>

            . I am servant to Messr. Garrat, and Co. On the 9th of December, I had ten papers of halfpence, three shillings worth in a paper, delivered to me to pay the carmen, who were to bring 20 hogsheads of sugar. I had laid them upon some buts in the warehouse; I was obliged to turn my back at the time the prisoner (who was one of the carmen) brought his cart in. The first cart was unloaded, and I was going to pay that man; but upon telling my papers over, I missed one. There were three carts came together. I charged all the three men; they all denied it. Upon going to search the prisoner, he laid his hay out of his hay-basket, for me to look into the basket. Another of the carmen bad him take me up for scandalizing him. I searched his cart, and found the paper of halfpence in his cart, by the side of a hogshead, with some litter upon it: then I charged him with it. He cried, and said he had taken it for his fare. The fare was 3 s. but he had first denied knowing any thing of it.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Kates, pawnbroker in Chandos-Street. On the 29th of December in the afternoon, a woman brought this watch to pawn. I asked her how much she wanted upon it: she hesitated some time, and at last said as much as I could lend her. She seemed not to know whether it was a gold or metal one; first she asked twenty pounds, then ten. She said a gentleman sent her. I told her it was necessary to see that gentleman. She took me to him. I got assistance and took him into custody. It was the prisoner. He acknowledged he sent her with it, and claimed it as his property. I had one of Mr. Fielding's men with me. We took him into my master's parlour; there he acknowledged how he came by it. Then we took him to the prosecutor, who said by all means he would prosecute him. I heard him acknowledge he took the hood and ring off, and where they were. The key that was delivered to me by a woman where we had the ring and hook, opened the lock as well as if made for it.</p>

I was so much frightened that I returned to my own garret and was afraid to leave my room all night. I sat up till the watch went twelve, and my landlord came home about half an hour after.

               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Brewer. It was not very dark. I came to the cross road that goes to the Half-way-house: the road goes to Stepney. I turned my head over my shoulder and saw they were just the same as they had been all the way up the road, walking single one after the other. I had not stepped four steps before one of them came up to me. He catched hold of my right shoulder and said, Sir, we have need of you to night. I said I hope you will not go to use me ill; take what I have got. He took my watch and put it in his pocket (a silver one): it cost me five guineas. Then he felt for my money, which was loose in my breeches pocket, as near as I can guess there were seven or eight shillings in silver, some half-pence and farthings: one of the other two came up and took my handkerchief out of my pocket. They were then all three abreast of me: then they bid me go along. I said I wish you all a good night. One of them up with a broom stick and offered to strike me; another said, Don't use the gentleman ill, we have took what he had got. I did not see any weapon the others two had. The first that came up to me was a short thick man, with a flapped hat and a sort of a blue coat on. The prisoner is the very young man that stood at my left hand: whether it was he or the middle one that took my handkerchief I cannot say. The prisoner is not he that took my watch and money. The prisoner's hat was neither flapped, nor cocked, so but that I could see his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>Brewer. No, I did not. I never saw him before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your watch again?</p>
               <p>Brewer. No, I never did. I applied to Sir

He said, Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177001170011"/> Brewer, I believe I can shew you the people tomorrow. It was so light that I could tell the colour of their clothes: one had a blue coat, another a white one, and the other a brown one. I went the next morning with two men: we saw the prisoner and another going down Lemond-Street. Robinson, that went with us, said, Do you think that is one of the party? I said I do not know till I get nearer. Said he, we will go and get him in at a public-house, and you shall come in and have a full sight of him. He went and took him down Mill-Yard, and asked him if he would have something to drink. I kept a little behind: they went into the Noah's Ark; I went in after they were in: after they had drank their liquor, Robinson stepped to me and whispered me and said, Is that any of the men? I said it is; I knew him directly. I said he might venture to take him. We let him go that morning; and the next morning he took him. We let him go then, thinking we might see them all three together. We brought him up to the Angel and Crown Whitechapel; there the prisoner denied the charge. I said he was the man that stood at my left side: it was a taller than he that had the stick.</p>

            . I live at the White Bear in Well-street. The prisoner was at my house on the 18th of December, in the evening. I was in my bar; he said, Landlord, have you any company up stairs? I said no; said he, Are you not to have some to night? I turned my head, and looked at the dial; it was almost seven. I said, please to go into that room, some gentlemen will come soon. There was another with him. They went into the room, and called for a pint of beer; before they drank that, in came five or six of the gentlemen; the prisoner and his comrade went up and stayed above half an hour, as near as I can guess. Then they came down and had two Welch rabbits for supper. The maid drawed them a pint of two penny. After that they both came up again, and never quitted the club room till the company broke up, which was about half an hour after eleven. When they came down, they had a glass of brandy at the bar; then the girl said, gentlemen, there are two Welch rabbits to pay for, and a glass of brandy. The prisoner said, You are right, my dear, and put his hand in his pocket, and had not money enough, and he borrowed a penny of another man. After the prisoner was taken, I went into the prison to see him; he told me he was innocent of the fact. There is now one confined that did the robbery.</p>

They asked me whether I had a watch, I told them I had, and put my hand into my left pocket and took out four or five shillings, and said that was all the money I had about me, and they were welcome to it: they searched my coat and waistcoat pockets: they took my watch, my salvatory, a steel pencil case, a lances, some halfpence, and one of my buckles out of my shoe; they bid me say nothing to any body, and have pity on the poor weavers; then they left me: it was so dark I do not know the men: I remember one of them had a blue jacket on. I have nothing to say against the prisoners at the bar.</p>

            . I am high-constable. I was at the rotation when the prisoners were there. They all wanted to be admitted evidence. Conway was taken into a room. He desired to speak with me. Mr. Brebrook went into the room with me. Conway said he could make a greater discovery than the rest. He took this lancet out of his pocket (produced in court) and delivered it to Brebrook, and said, this lancet I took from the gentleman that I took the watch from. (A silver watch produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my watch, which I was robbed of that evening. At the same time, they took from me such a lancet as this. It was of the same man's make, and it had such a case; but lancets may be so much alike, I do not chuse to swear to that.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Elliot. Did the prisoner, Conway, mention this without being assured that he should be admitted evidence?</p>

            . I attend the rotation at White-chapel. Upon an information that was given there, I was at the apprehending these prisoners at Shadwell, the day after Christmas-day. We took them into a public-house; there they were searched, We found some gunpowder and shot upon Chapman, and two flints upon Paterson. The next morning they were taken to the rotation-office. While they were examining, the man at the public-house, where they had been taken in and searched, came and brought his watch that is here produced.</p>

There were two men before me, one took my watch out of my fob, and another took about five shillings i n silver, and about eighteen-pence in halfpence and farthings out of my waistcoat pocket. They d - d me, and told me, if I spoke a word, I was a dead man. When they first laid hold of me, they took a bunch of keys-out of my pocket, but they gave me them again. Then they d - d me, and bid me go about my business, and if I offered to call out, they would shoot me. I cannot say I saw any fire-arms. I immediately went home.

The man said he had but three farthings about him. Chapman put his hat on my head. Milbank went home. Then we went down Mile-End road, and stopped a man upon a horse; he had but three farthings. Chapman or Paterson gave him a penny to get him a pint of beer. Then we stopped a farmer, and he had no money; and we gave him three-half-pence to get him a pint of beer. Then we turned back again. Coming by the World's-End, by Stepney Church, there we met Mr. Chambers. We went a little past him, and Chapman went back again, and knocked his lanthorn out. Then Chapman and Paterson rummaged him, and the other and I stood by. I do not know who took the watch, it was given into Conway's hand. They searched him, and he had no money about him. He had some halfpence and farthings and a pocket-piece in his waistcoat pocket; he said he had no silver. Coming to Mackmullings's house, Conway said he could get but twenty shillings upon the watch. We shared the money, and had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177001170014"/> some brandy. Then we all went home. He was to have twenty shillings, but he got but eighteen shillings.

Chapman ran back and tapped me on the shoulder, and said, if I did not stop, they would blow my brains out, and clapped a pistol to my head. I desired him to put the pistol from my head, which he did, and put it across my shoulder. Then the other, Paterson, took my money away. he had a white waistcoat stripped with red on.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a light or dark night?</p>
               <p>China. It was not a light night, but there were three links on the road at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were the links to you?</p>
               <p>China. They were about the length of the court from me. I thought they were going to rob me, and I took my money out of my breeches pocket, and put it into my coat pocket. They felt for my watch; and they were in such a tremble that they did not find it. I had my hand in my pocket when they stopped me.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you lose?</p>
               <p>China. They took a guinea, a half guinea, a quarter guinea, four shillings, or four shillings and sixpence. Then Paterson went to take my buckles. I said, my friend, they are only plated, they will be of no service to you. Then Chapman said, d - n it, never mind it. Then they took my hat; it was a new one; and away they ran. That was brought to me by an evidence here. (Produced and deposed to.) Chapman stuttered. I looked upon him to be in a flurry and frighted, but since I see it is only an impediment in his speech.</p>

            . I attend the rotation at times. Martin was taken up in regard to a watch and a pair of buckles. He said if you will admit me an evidence, I can tell you where all the parties are that have done all these robberies on the New-road. Upon his evidence, we went out after these men, in order to go to the Star in Star-street. There were Levi, Robinson, Pointon and Smith with me. We saw these men were got from the door about twenty yards. I said to Levi, I believe them to be the men: Do you go back, and see if any of them know you. Conway said, Levi, how are you? I ran and took hold of Chapman, and carried him to the next public-house. Paterson ran away, and the rest pursued; he fell down and was taken by Robinson. I there saw them all four together. Milbank that is cleared was one. I took this hat. that has been produced off Chapman's head. Said he, Don't take my hat, for it is my own. I put it on his head again, and we hand-cuffed them together, and brought them along the back-lane. Chapman takes this hat off with his right-hand, being hand-cuffed with his left, to the other prisoner's right-hand, and attempted to heave it away. I catched hold of it, and said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177001170015"/> What are you going to heave it away for? Said he, I am not going to heave it away. Then he made an attempt to pull the paper out of the inside the crown, where was the maker's name. Then I took it from him, and said You shall have this hat no more, perhaps there may be an owner for it. The next day the turnpike-man heard there were some footpads taken up. He applyed to Mr. China, and Mr. China attended the Rotation on the Saturday, and there the hat was produced; and he swore to it.</p>

            . I was at the apprehending these men; we took them in at the Wheat-sheaf, a publick-house, and searched their pockets. There was powder and shot taken out of Chapman's pocket; and some gun-flints, and a knife that will screw a gun, out of Paterson's. As we were bringing them along, through the turnpike, I saw Chapman wanted to sling his hat away, and Paget took it from him. We brought them up to the Man-in-the-moon, by Whitechapel church. We had stopped by the way, and had had a pot or two of beer. I believe it was about half an hour after nine o'clock when we got to the Man-in-the-moon. We searched them again, and under their shirts they had two ruffled ones.</p>
               <p>Chapman. The prosecutor said before the justice, he could not swear to any of us.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I said I should be very loath to swear against any man, but I knew them. I did not say I could not swear to them.</p>

On the 5th of this instant, a little after three in the afternoon, the prisoner came to our shop, and desired to look at some black silk lace; she said the same sort she had had a few days ago, at 2 s. 8 d. a yard. There were two customers in the shop. There was a drawer of black lace at the lower part of the counter; she made up to that; I went and took out three cards, and laid them down by the side of the drawer. One of the customers desired me to cut her off a yard of ribbon, saying she could not stay. I did, and at the time glancing my eye towards the drawer, I saw the prisoner make a motion with her left hand, which drew my attention. She then sat down upon a stool, and put, as I then thought, some lace under her left-hand side; I looked, and missed one of the three cards that I had put by the side of the drawer. I observed by her motion, she shoved it under her petticoats, and put it into her right-hand pocket, with her right-hand: then she got up and stood behind a lady that was looking over some double blonds; during this time, I was doing up the yard of ribbon. The lady wanted change for a guinea; I could not change it: I said it was the same, she might pay another time: she went out of the shop. Then I went up to the prisoner, and said, Is any lace here that will do? She said, I find that is gone that I had of before, and you may have more in two or three days, and I'll call again, and went out of the shop. I went out after, and took her about the midway of the window and brought her back again, and said, You have got a card of lace in your pocket. I took her in as far as the compting-house door. She took the card of lace out of her right-hand pocket, and threw it down before me, and said, There it is, let me go. I said, I cannot possibly, we must have some further conversation. I rung the bell, and my master came down. I took her into the compting-house, and asked her her name. She would not tell me, nor her place of abode. At last, she said she lived in Smithfield, and I had five children. I said, Can you send for any person of character to speak for you? She said she could not, and was rather impertinent. I sent for a constable, and took her to the Mansion-house; it was too late for an alderman there. I took her to the Compter; and before Mr. Alderman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177001170017"/> Turner, the next day. ( The lace produced in court and deposed to.)</p>

            . I was coming up Ludgate-hill, on the 10th of this instant, about the hour of seven. I observed the prisoner and another boy before Mr. Darke's window. As I came near, the prisoner ran off, and in his running, I heard a noise as of silk drawing through some confined place, and as he ran, something dragged after him; I followed him across the way, and about the middle of the Old-bailey, I took hold of him, and said he had robbed that shop; he said he had not. He was stuffing something into his breeches; I asked him, What he was pushing there? he said it was his pocket handkerchief. I took hold of the end, as he had not quite got it in, and pulled it out: it was this ribbon. (Produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor). I took</p>
               <p>him back to Mr. Darke's shop; there he confessed he took it through the hole of the shutter, where it screws to the outside shutter.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The block that the ribbon was upon, was on the inside, at the screw-hole. We imagine he got at the ribbon by a wire, but that might be safely conveyed away.</p>

(There is a statute of bankruptcy in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177001170018"/> the house.) This was between the hours of three and four o'clock in the afternoon; one Mr. Phillips, a founder, came in with her; they had something to drink together, but I can't tell particularly what. He parted with her at the bar, and went away. She called for a pint of half and half. The kitchen and parlour join: the door was open; she came to me in the parlour, and said, Landlord, give me change for a guinea. I said, I will, What have you to pay? She said, I have only this pint to pay. I put my hand in my pocket to give her change. Said she directly, Will you lend me a guinea? I don't want for money, and pulled out a box of gold, I believe there might be eight or ten guineas in it, and said to me, I'll lend you five guineas, I'll be d - nd if I don't. Before she went out of the room, she there pulled out another box of gold; besides money, there were several gold rings, above twenty, I believe. Said I, your shewing me your gold, is nothing at all. What do you want to borrow a guinea for, when you have so much about you? I pulled out my money, three guineas and a half, and a shilling. She took a guinea and a shilling out of my hand, and said she would keep it. I said, What do you take my guinea for? you want change for a guinea. Said she, I'll keep it. I said, What should you keep it for? I never saw you before in my life: I shall punish you, if you don't let me have it again, without any further trouble. Then Mr. Cook said, Give the man his guinea again, he is only a servant here; he can't afford to lose his guinea in this manner; if you don't he will send for a constable. Said she, I don't care for that; Where will you send me? I am well known there, if he does: I'll keep it for a trick that I know. By that time, my wife came into the room, and said; What is all this noise here? There were eight or ten farmers by. She swore she would be d - nd if she gave it me again; and if I had her before a justice, she would swear I wanted to be bad with her; and made use of many bad, indecent words: this was before the farmers. But when she took my money, there was no body in the room but she and I, and Mr. Cook.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your guinea and shilling again?</p>
               <p>Gilbert. No, I never did. She was there three or four hours. I left Mr. Cook with her, to see if he could persuade her to let me have my money again. She told Mr. Cook, if he would do so and so to her, (meaning in her indecent language) she would give him a crown of it. Finding I could do nothing with her, I charged a constable with her.</p>
               <p>It not being a felony, but a trespass, for which he might, and was advised to, bring an action against her, she was <rs id="t17700117-23-verdict155" type="verdictDescription">

I kept my eye upon them. They went from the Pater-noster-row to Newgate-street, and back again. They met this little boy, named Wright; one of them, seemingly out of kindness, took him by the hand to lead him, to shew him the fire, while the rest of the gang picked his pocket, just at the end of <placeName id="t17700117-25-crimeloc163">Pater-noster-row</placeName>

Trigg pushed Harris on to take the handkerchief; he took it out: as soon as that was done, he that had the lad by the hand, ran away. Harris turned about and delivered the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177001170019"/> handkerchief to Trigg; then I believe Trigg saw me, and I believe he knew me; he immediately gave it back again to Harris. Then I took hold of them both with my right hand, they were so close together, and I took the handkerchief from Harris. and carried them to Guild-hall, before Alderman Trecothick. I think Harris said he was but eleven years of age. I found four handkerchiefs upon him.</p>

            . On the 13th of December, there were twenty-eight bags of pomentoe on Botolph wharf. I employed three men to carry them up to a warehouse in Cross-lane, at so much a bag. The prisoner lent them a hand with them upon their shoulders; there being an odd bag, he desired I would let him carry that. I told him, I would give him a pot of beer. It was put on his back, but he never took it to the warehouse. I took him in Old-street, about a month after, and charged him with stealing it. He owned that he did steal it, and said he sold it at two places. I went and enquired at both the places, and both the people are off; one was a man over the water, and the other, a woman in East-Smithfield.</p>

When he came up to me he put his left hand to my collar, and with his right hand he put a pistol to my throat; he said something about blowing brains out. I said, What do you mean? I got hold of his collar: then another man came behind me and pinioned my hands down, while the man that stopped me robbed me. He took my watch (a silver one), six guineas, and two shillings: the watch was engine-turned on the edge of the case. I never found it again. As soon as they were gone I hallooed out thieves! and ran immediately after them. The people ran out at the Cross-Keys, and several neighbours saw them, but did not know what was the matter till too late. They took towards St. Giles's. The next morning I went to Sir

They put him into the Round-house; and on Monday he was sent for before Sir John; there he told many false stories about his lodgings. We went from place to place; and when we came to the place where he said he lodged, the people said he never lodged there; they knew no such person. He begged to be sent to Tothill-fields bridewell; he was carried there. He was brought up again on the Wednesday to be examined; then he brought a parcel of girls to swear he was with them the night I was robbed, till a quarter after eleven o'clock. There was a girl swore she parted with him at the time of lighting the lamps, and went down with him to where she lived at Westminster, and they were there together some time.</p>

               <p>Q. ARE you sure the prisoner is the man that robbed you?</p>
               <p>Thyer. I am. He was in the front of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Thyer. There was a lamp over my head at the time, and two in the front farther on.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed?</p>
               <p>Thyer. He had a brown coat on, buttoned up: and he had that same coat on the next morning when we took him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>Thyer. I never saw him before, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did you not say at Sir John's that the man had a wig on?</p>
               <p>Thyer. In my fright I did say at Sir John's I thought he had a sort of a cut wig on, but I was not sure. (The prisoner had his own hair). I took particular notice of his face.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether you did not before Sir

               <p>Thyer. No. I said it was about ten yards from the hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did you not say I was like the man as one man may be like another?</p>
               <p>Thyer. They said, Are you sure that is the man? I said as much as one man is like another. Said Justice Wright, What do you mean by that? I said I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Would not Sir John have discharged me if you had not insisted upon prosecuting me?</p>
               <p>Thyer. A gentleman said, Let us have the two brothers up: his brother was brought up (or another man in that name ). I said they are not like each other. That is the man that robbed me, and pointed to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did you not swear before Sir John it was before the watch was set?</p>
               <p>Thyer. When I cried thieves (upon their running away) the watch was gone: then I thought the watch was not set. I told Sir John it was as night ten o'clock as possible, and that the watch was not set.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been that night?</p>
               <p>Thyer. I had been with a gentleman from Lynn in Norfolk, at the Coachmaker's-Arms, Long-Acre. That was the only house I had been drinking at.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Thyer. I was as sober as I am this minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in your way home?</p>
               <p>Thyer. I had been with that gentleman from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177001170023"/> Lynn (he is a cousin of mine) part of the way to his inn: he lodged at the Bell and Crown in Holborn, and I went as far as Turn-Stile, Holborn, and there I parted with him, and was going home and turned down Drury-Lane, and crossed over and turned down Brownlow-Street.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did not you say at the Mogul, after the examination in the afternoon, that you could not swear to the man, because he had a black wig on?</p>
               <p>Thyer. No, I never thought he had a black wig on; I thought he might have a brown one. I said I was quite clear he was the man. I allow the wig had a little puzzled me, but when I came to recollect the man's face, it was all over.</p>

            . I am a carver, and live in Rebecca-court, on the top of Well-street, Oxford-road. On the day before Christmas-day, my wife and I, in coming home, about seven o'clock in the evening, met the prisoner in the piazzas, Covent-garden; we went to the Green-man, in New-street, and had a pot of beer, and staid there rather more than half an hour; he seemed to be a little in liquor. I parted with him at the door. He is a taylor. I don't know where he lodges.</p>

He told me, it was done when he went his rounds. I ordered my apprentice to sit up till day-light, as no fastening could be done then. They had made an attempt at all the shutters of my fore-parlour; they got the middle shutter so far loose, as to turn it on one side, so as to get at the sash to fling it up. I found my bureau broke open, which was fastened over night; several drawers were taken out, in which were many papers, and turned bottom upwards. I missed 15 guineas in gold from one drawer, several crown and half-crown pieces, some little Spanish pieces of money, and a yellow canvas bag of halfpence, to the value of 5 s. 6 d. a pair of silver shoe and knee-buckles, and a large black leather pocket-book, with many notes in it.

We were out three nights: the third night I came from the road about half an hour after ten o'clock, which was the 15th of December, to bridewell. There was a person had been waiting for me two hours; he said, he could tell me where the people were that had committed robberies on Chelsea-road.

            . I have been acquainted with Burkitt and Moody about six months; and have been very well acquainted with Jones. I cannot justly tell the time, we all four went out together, to take a walk, with no intent to rob any body, or to break houses.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before or after Christmas?</p>
               <p>Settle. It was before Christmas, I believe three weeks or a month. We went from the Hole-in-the-wall, in Bow-street, towards Chelsea, in the evening; we drank some beer, and spent all our money. Coming home, we did not know what to do for more; we made an attempt to break a house; I don't know whose house it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was it?</p>
               <p>Settle. I cannot justly say; I believe there was somebody sick opposite the house, and they heard us, and we were disturbed. We went away through some courts. Then I staid at a distance, and they all three went away by themselves; I might be an hundred or two hundred yards distance from them, for fear any body should come by. When they came to me again, hey never said a word to me; but we went down to the Hole-in-the-wall again, and had a pot of beer at coming in.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had they been gone from you?</p>
               <p>Settle. About ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the house you made an attempt on?</p>
               <p>Settle. It is in Petty-France.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when you got to the Hole-in-the-wall?</p>
               <p>Settle. I cannot say what time, I believe it was morning. I went to bed there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any money of either of them?</p>
               <p>Settle. I received none, nor saw none.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go to bed there?</p>
               <p>Settle. I do not know; nor do I know where they went.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave them there when you went to bed?</p>
               <p>Settle. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see them again?</p>
               <p>Settle. I saw them the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any buckles then?</p>
               <p>Settle. Then Moody said he had bought a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177001170027"/> pair of shoe-buckles and a pair of knee-buckles; and shewed me a tall young fellow, that he said he bought them of for eight shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that young fellow?</p>
               <p>Settle. I do not know that I saw him ever before or since.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Jones in the house at that time?</p>
               <p>Settle. He was. I told Moody they were very cheap; and asked him if he would sell them again. He said yes, I should have them for a shilling advance. I said I had no money. In the winter time I shall go to Billingsgate and buy fish, and in the summer time I go a fishing; when I got money I would pay him. He told me I should have them, and pay him when I could. He let me have them. We drank together, and then went to Mrs. Jesson's in Blackfriars.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went with you?</p>
               <p>Settle. Moody and Burkett went with me. I had the buckles in my pocket, and desired Mrs. Jesson would go and pawn them for me. She asked me if they were my own? I told her yes. She went and pawned them for seven shillings.</p>
               <p>Here it was observed by the court and the jury, that in the course of his giving his evidence, he had his eye constantly looking at the prisoners; and that from his first coming into court, there had been winking and motions made to each other. He was ordered not to look towards them.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with that money?</p>
               <p>Settle. We spent about a shilling of it in liquors. She drank some of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Moody and Burkett hear what past between her and you?</p>
               <p>Settle. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the rest?</p>
               <p>Settle. They had no money, and I gave them some of it when we came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this yellow canvas bag. Do you know it?</p>
               <p>Settle. I have seen such a bag like this, at the Hole-in-the-wall. I cannot saw that this is it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see it?</p>
               <p>Settle. I do not know that I saw it, till I saw Mrs. Heydon have it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see these pistols or chisels that night you were out together?</p>
               <p>Settle. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Jesson. Were Moody and Burkett present at that time the evidence brought the buckles?</p>
               <p>M. Jesson. Not as I saw. He came alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink some beer with them that night.</p>
               <p>M. Jesson. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Do you remember any opposite neighbour being sick at the time your house was broke open?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, I do not.</p>

            . I live with my uncle, the prosecutor. He gave the same account of the house being broke, and the things missing, as the prosecutor had done before, with this addition; that when the watchman called them up, it was as he was calling the hour four; and that he went to Covent-Garden round-house to Settle, who told him he was one at the breaking the prosecutor's house in Petty-France, and that there were somebody sick in the opposite house, as he thought; and that it wanted a quarter of one; and on hearing the watchman coming, they ran down a little alley, called Horshoe-alley, till he was gone by; then they came to the house, and forced the shutter; and Burkett was the first person that went into the house, and Jones followed him, and came out again, and said he could do nothing with the bureau; and then Moody went in and broke the bureau.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you inquired whether any body was sick opposite your house?</p>

               <p>Q. to Heydon. Had Settle laid often at your house?</p>
               <p>M. Heydon. He lay at my house a great many times.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing of a lusty man selling a pair of buckles at your house?</p>
               <p>M. Heydon. No, I do not.</p>

               <p>M. Heydon. He had a pair very much like these.</p>

               <p>I bought these buckles of a young man at Mrs. Heydon's house for seven shillings; and Settle seeing them, he asked me what I would have for them? I bought them for eight, and paid him five, and was to pay him the rest.</p>
               <p>Burkett's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was along with Moody and Jones at the Hole-in-the-wall. A tall young man came in with a pair of silver shoe and knee buckles. Moody bought them of him: I cannot say how much he gave for them. Soon after Settle came in, he desired to see them. He asked Moody if he would sell them. He said yes. Settle said, I have not money about me, but if you will trust me, as soon as I have it, I will pay you. He sold them to him. Said Settle, I am going down to Mrs. Jesson's, will you go along with me? They went together. When they came back, Moody said, he gave him five shillings in part. I asked Moody to lend me a shilling.</p>

I was out of place at that time, and my mother allowed me eight shillings a week till I got a place. I went to my aunt for the money allowed me, and returned to the Hole-in-the-wall, and lay with a soldier that was quartered there.</p>

               <p>Barnet. I had seen him on horseback in a bye-lane two nights before. We rode after him, and enquired, and found he had not gone through the turnpike. Then we rode towards Little Chelsea, and between the Queen's Elm and Little Chelsea, we let him go past about two hundred yards. We had each a pistol, and rode to him, and said if he did not submit we would blow his brains out. He had a cane in his hand, and began playing away with it, and broke my fellow-servant's head very badly. It was a little cane, and I believe it had a bullet in the end of it. After a good deal of resistance we secured him. There came a hackney-coach, and we put him into that, and carried him before Sir

He shewed me a pistol and demanded my money. He was without boots and had white stockings on, cotton or thread. I delivered to him, I believe, between three and four pounds. I know there were six half guineas, a six-and nine-penny piece, and a five-and-three-pence in a silk purse. It was done very quick. He was not above a minute with me. I believe it was the prisoner, but I will not be positive; one man may be like another; he is very much like him, and had on the same kind of cloaths the prisoner has on now.

            . On Sunday the 19th of November, as I was returning in a post chariot with Mr. Elliot from Belfound, where I had been to see my wife and child, about a quarter of a mile on this side the thirteenth mile-stone, the glass of the chariot being up, there came by a person, who seemed to me to be the prisoner, mounted on a chesnut or sorrel horse. He had white stockings on. He turned round immediately, and the chariot stopped. I saw a pistol at the glass. The person swore very terribly to let the glass down directly. Mr. Elliot could not get it down. I assisted but could not. I pulled down the glass on the other side, and put my head out with my money to give it him. He said, if I did not take my head in, he would blow my brains out immediately. I don't positively swear the prisoner is the man. It was but a short time he was with us.</p>

Dunk took from my left breeches pocket, half a guinea. They said, D - n you, you have more money, and if I would not hold my peace, they would do me farther injury. I said, gentlemen, I cannot say what money I have got. I never am without some. You are both looking for it, take what you can get. After they had done, they said, Go along, Sir.

             what had happened. He sent four men with me to search the Ambury. We searched, but could not find any of them. On the Sunday after, I was sent for to come on the Monday morning to Sir John. I went. The prisoner and Marshal had been taken two days before. They were brought there. Sir John asked me, if I could swear to either of them. I said, I was pretty sure they were the men, but I did not swear to them till I had recollected myself. They were in soldiers jackets when they robbed me, and I took particular notice of their faces and voices. When I gave information of them, I gave an account of the colour of their clothes. Marshal told every particular of the robbery, and where the woman at the bar sold the watch. He said, they met me about the middle of the park, and that he took from me my watch, and three shillings in silver; and Dunk took the half guinea: and that they saw me afterwards going home towards Rosamond's pond. He said, the woman sold the watch to some Jew in Duke's-Place, and the prisoner and he went to some public-house there, while she sold it; and that she told him, she could dispose of the King's crown, if she had it there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your watch again?</p>
               <p>Read. No, I never did. The woman was brought there. She at first, when charged with it, denied it, and at last said, if she knew where she sold it, she would tell me; but she did not know the house. She admitted she had sold it. I had described the watch to her. It was engraved with a basket of flowers on it.</p>
               <p>Paterson. He told me he had lost such a watch, and he would give me a guinea if I would tell him where it was. I said, I knew nothing at all of it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did offer her a guinea. A gentleman there said, if you offer her a guinea, perhaps, you may get your watch again.</p>

            . I was on the guard at Kensington palace. On the 31st of October, Marshall was on the guard along with me. Dunk came there between six and seven in the evening to the suttling-house, and called for a pot of beer. Marshall and he drank together. One of the men that were at guard with me, had some words with them. Dunk, out of bravado, pulled a watch out of his pocket; whether it had a ribbon or a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177001170031"/> chain I do not know: or whether it was metal, silver, or gold, I don't know.

I said to him, there are a couple of men on the other side the pond. As we went on, I observed them following us. I said, they will hear what we are talking about. When Mr. Clark came within about ten yards of this side the gate that leads into the grove, all on a sudden the two men surrounded us. They bid us stop. My husband said, what must we stop for? They pulled out two bludgeons, and held one over my husband's head, and the other over mine. One of them said, D - n you, stop, or I'll knock your brains out. I burst out a crying, and said, I was in a great deal of trouble, having lost my children, and begged they would not hurt me. One of them put his hand into my left hand pocket, and took out seven silver tea-spoons, a pair of pearl necklaces, a red and white handkerchief, and out of my right-hand pocket, they took out between three and four shillings, and two or three pennyworth of halfpence. I took a quarter guinea out of my pocket, and put it in my mouth, and looked in one of their faces, fearing he should see me, and take it out, which made me take more notice of him. I saw the other man take my husband's watch, by giving it a jerk. They took what money he had in his pocket, which was not much. They took a parcel of keys from him, and gave them to him again, saying, they are of no use. After this, my husband pulled off his hat, and said, I thank you, gentlemen, for not hurting my wife. After they were gone, my husband ran, thinking to get to them before they got out of the park, but he missed them. They turned as if they were going down the Queen's-park.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them was it you took particular notice of, him that robbed you, or him that robbed your husband?</p>
               <p>A. Clark. Of him that robbed my husband. I saw him since at the Brown-Bear, Bow-street; that is the man now at the bar. He had just such a coat and waistcoat on then as he has now. My husband went to Sir

            . I was at the apprehending Dunk and Paterson, together, on the 4th of November, in a lodging, in Stable-yard, Westminster. Looking round the room, I saw some soldiers clothes. I asked him if he was a soldier; he said, No. I asked him whose clothes they were; he said, a friend of his. I asked his name; he, at last, said Marshal. I found this seal on the mantle-piece there, which Mrs. Clark's husband said was to his watch when they robbed him. Dunk said, there was a necklace at one Flumery's. I went there, and found it. (The necklace and seal produced in court.)</p>
               <p>A. Clark. This necklace I was robbed of at that time in the Green-park, when they took my spoons. This seal was to my husband's watch at the time. He has had it twelve years. I have been married to him ten, and know it very well. My husband can't be here. He is a prisoner in the King's Bench.</p>

            , came to me, and asked me if I had a man that threshed in my barn? I said I had. He told me, he thought he was a rogue. I asked why the thought so? He said, he and Church had been at his house, and offered to sell him some barley; and he said they were to come again, and he would send for me. I was accordingly sent for; there were the two prisoners, and two of my sacks with barley in them. The sacks were the wrong side outwards, but my marks were plainly on them, H. S. I asked the prisoners how they came by the barley? I had at that time eleven quarters stood in sacks. I asked if they took it from them? They said they did not; they took it from a heap that was threshed, and cleaned it.</p>

            . On the 17th of December, Church asked me if I would buy any barley? Poney was by at the time. I said, I did not want any, I only kept a couple of hens. He said, you keep a hog, he will eat barley. I said yes, but I have very good pease. I was loth to let a rogue go. Then I said, I did not care if he brought some. Then Church said, two shillings a bushel is the price. I said I do not mind the price; you may bring a bushel. When they were gone, I went and let Mr. Stevenson know, they had told me they would bring it on Tuesday night, the 19th; then they brought two sacks, with about two bushels in them. Mr. Stevenson came; they were his sacks. Mr. Stevenson said, did you take the barley out of the sacks? They said no; they had cleaned it from the heap.</p>
               <p>Poney's Defence.</p>
               <p>I never put any barley in the sacks, nor ever took it out of the barn. I have a wife and three small children.</p>

About the 14th of December, (I am not particular to the day) a neighbour, named Spilsbury, sent for me, and acquainted me, he had some reason to believe one of my journeymen had robbed me. He said he had brought something to melt down, which he had done for him once; and he had brought him some a second time, and upon melting, he found it was half silver. I took a warrant out, and apprehended the prisoner; and going to the justice in the coach with him, I said, How came you by that lead and silver? He told me he had it of a labourer, who found it at the fire in the Butcher-row. I told him if he would tell me where that man was to be found, I would apprehend him; as it was proper the thing should be brought to light. He told me the man lived at Plastow. When I had done at the justice's, I took a post-chaise and went to Plastow, where I saw the prisoner's wife (his family are there). I asked her if she knew any body that had given her husband any thing to sell, because her husband was in hold, upon suspicion of robbing me. She said she knew no body; and I could not find any body. Between that and the Thursday following, a person came and told me that the prisoner had pawned an ingot of silver, in the name of Bogey. I went to the pawnbroker and found the ingot.</p>

            . I am of the same trade the prosecutors are. On a Monday, about the 11th of December, the prisoner came to me, about 8 or 9 at night, and brought a lump of lead; it appeared to me very dirty; he said a labouring man found it at the ruins of the fire in the Butcher-row; he begged of me to melt it for him, for he believed there was silver in it. We had some words about it. I took it; and on the Wednesday following, my boy cut it in half. It looked like lead, but it snapped when about half way thro'. I put it into a melting pot, melted it, and poured it out into the form it is now. (Produced in court) I made an assay of it; the report was, six ounces three pennyweights worse, that is, about half silver and half lead. Upon this I thought proper to send to Mr. Aldridge and his partner, to acquaint them of it. I have kept the ingot in my own possession ever since I melted it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual in your way of business to have so large a mixture of lead and silver together?</p>
               <p>Spilsbury. No, I think not; it is altogether lead and silver in one mass now.</p>

               <p>Mr. Aldridge produced his iron ingot, in which he pours his melted silver; the silver ingot is put into it, and fitted exactly. Then he produced a silver ingot, cast in the iron one; [they were inspected by the court and jury] the bottoms and sides of the two silver ones corresponded so as to leave no doubt but they both were cast in that iron ingot.</p>

I said I could not. Then they asked for a glass of gin? I said they must get in themselves, I had none.

It was a very clear moon-light night. I gave a halloo, and said, Who is there? Upon which I saw a tall man come out of the parlour window; and after him, a short man: I could distinguish all their dress. Then I went down stairs; I found a tinder-box and some matches, and a candle and half, which they in their confusion had left. There was a night-cart passed by; I desired the man to call the watch; as soon as the watch came, I described the men and their dress. The tall man had a blue surtout coat on, and was about six feet high, and had short hair, without a hat; and the other, a little, thick-set man, with a lightish coat, a red waistcoat, and a hat with a dragoon cock. He told me, he could not stay with me, but would send another, which he did. About four o'clock, that watchman came and told me, of such men being taken at an ale house in Goswell-street, and if I went to the watch-house, I might see them. I went to St. Luke's watch-house; there were the two prisoners, dressed as I had described. I knew them to be the men, as soon as I saw them. I charged the watchmen with them. They were searched, and a large knife was found on Broadhurst, and a broken one on Hart. In the morning about ten o'clock, I went with them to Justice Girdler's. I went to bed that night about half an hour after eleven o'clock; my shutters were fast then. I found the sash broke by forcing it up in the morning. I am positive the prisoners are the same men that I saw come out of my house, by all the circumstances that my eyes could see.</p>

            . I am a watchman. The man with the night-cart came to my box, and desired me to make haste to this gentleman's house: I went; the gentleman told me his house was broke open; I found the shutter hanging by one hinge. He desired I would go and get some watchmen to sit up in his house. I went, and sent him that belonged to that beat. Then I and another watchman went to his house, and asked if he could tell what sort of men they were. He described them as he has now. In going my rounds, I went in at the Wind-mill, in Goswell-street, for a penny-worth of purl; there I saw the two prisoners sitting. I left my brother watchman there, while I went to the watch-house for assistance. I brought three more watchmen, and we took and brought them to the watch-house. Broadhurst was ready to faint as we were carrying them along. When we had got them to the watch-house, I went and told the prosecutor. He came and saw them. There were several people in the watch-house. The constable gave the prisoners all the fair-play he could. The prosecutor pitched upon Broadhurst to be one; (he is the tall one) he said he could swear more clear to the short one, than the other. Then he pitched upon Hart, for the other. We found a large knife upon Broadhurst.</p>

            . I am the constable. We had got the two prisoners, and then sent for the prosecutor. He said, Had that tall man a hat on when he came to the watch-house? I said, Yes. He said he had a great deal of time to see the small man more than he had the other, as he took more time to get away. He could swear to Har, he said, more than to the other. I had told the prisoners, I would shew them all the fair-play I could. I let other people stand with them, that the prosecutor might pick them out; he pitched on both the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the prisoners behave?</p>
               <p>Hunter. They behaved very quiet. Broadhurst cried very much. One of them told me, they lived at Low-laton, and had been walking all night; and after that, the other said, they had been at the Coach-and-horses, in Aldersgate-street, all night, and were turned out from there. (The tinder-box, flint, steel, and matches produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Broadhurst's Defence.</p>
               <p>That evening I had been out into the country, and came back again about eight o'clock, into White-cross-street: it rained very hard. This other man (meaning Hart) had been drinking at a public-house where I had been; I over-took him; he said to me, where are you going? I said, Home. Said he, I believe you go my way, will you go in and have a pint of beer? We went into the Pyed-bull, in Gloucester-court, White-cross-street; we had, I believe, two or three pots of beer, and each of us half a sheep's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177001170038"/> head. It rained prodigious hard. He said he lodged in Aylesbury-street, Clerkenwell-green; and I lodged in Mutton-lane. It was past eleven o'clock; we set out, and went into the Coach-and-horses, in Aldersgate-street, and staid there some time. Going for Swan-alley to go home, I said to a watchman, I should be obliged to him, to tell us of any body that was up. He said, go to the Wind-mill. We went there, and had a pot of half and half; I desired the watchman to comein and drink. I took off my hat, and hung it by the fire to dry. When the watchman came in, seeing me without a hat, he thought we were the thieves, by the description he had had. After that there came in more watchmen, and took us to the watch-house. I have been in the Train of Artillery, and have a shilling a day allowed me from the Board of Ordnance.</p>
               <p>Hart's Defence.</p>

                        targets="t17700117-39-defend511 t17700117-39-deflabel285"/>. I was locked out of my lodging in Aylesbury-street, at the Bell and Star. A Whitfieldite keeps it, and I was sure I could not get in; it rained so powerfully hard, that kept me longer than I chose; they generally lock up between eleven and twelve. I thought to get into a house to drink a pint of beer. I went to the Coach-and-Horses; there was a troublesome man there, whom they turned out; then we went to White-cross-street. We saw the watchman; he directed us to the Windmill in Goswell-street. This man hung his hat up by the fire; and they were talking about a house being broke; and they thought he was one, because he was without his hat, and they took us to the Round-house.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoners.</p>
               <p>Powell. I am a watchman. We took the prisoners at the Windmill. They called at my stand in the morning between three and four o'clock, and asked where a house was open. I told them the Windmill. They said if I would come there I should drink with them. When I came there Broadhurst began talking about a watchman that belonged to us, that was tried last sessions. (See No. 18. in last Session Paper). I said there is a house broke to night. He said, Where? I told him. He said he knew it very well, he had been out all night, and had come by it about one in the morning.</p>
               <p>Broadhurst. I never said no such thing.</p>
               <p>Powell. He did say so. I sent them to the Coach-and-Horses, there they staid till almost four.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they both hats on when they went by your stand?</p>
               <p>Powell. I believe they had; they had been at the Coach-and-horses from one o'clock till almost four. After the other watchman described them, as he said the gentleman had to him, he desired me to go and take them up, and he would go and describe them to the gentleman, to see whether he knew them. I staid there till he came again with the constable and others, and we took them in charge. Broadhurst seemed ready to faint, and said he could hardly speak for himself. We staid he was only taken upon suspicion, and if he was innocent he would be cleared. When we came to the watch-house, one was put to one part, and the other to another; there were other people there. Mr. Hunter said he would give them all the liberty he could. When the gentleman came, he asked if the tall man had a hat on? We told him he had. He looked at the little one, and said, I am clearer to the little one than to the great one.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Did it rain betwixt one and two when you was at the window?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, it was clear and no rain at all. It had rained between eleven and twelve, and when I came out at four it did not rain.</p>
               <p>Q. to Teesner. Did it rain at the time the night-cart came by?</p>
               <p>Teesner. No, it did not. It was some time cloudy, and some time very clear: it rained in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether it rained between the hour two and the time the men were taken?</p>
               <p>Teesner. I cannot tell whether it did or not.</p>
               <p>Powell. It was clear between one and two.</p>

He had a white foot, and a spot on his near side. My brother and my son came to London, and found him. I came up and found him in a stable in Bartholomew-close, and I swore to him. The prisoner lived not a mile and a half from my house. He was a journeyman tallow-chandler a little while; since that he has done day-labouring work. He said he bought the horse of one Claringbull, on the Eltham-road. The horse is worth 20 l.</p>
               <p>Street Holding. I am a relation of the prosecutor's. He came to me on the 5th of December, and told me, he had lost his horse. His son and I came up to Smithfield; there I saw the prisoner with the horse. I said to him, Is this your horse? He said, Yes. I said, How old is he? He said nothing. I looked in his mouth, and saw him coming five years old. I had the bill of the marks with me; that mentioned five years old, and the marks answered. Then I laid hold of the prisoner, and said, You shall not go from me, till you give an account how you came by this horse. He said, he bought him that morning, of one Claringbull, at Lusham. I asked, Who saw you buy him? He said, No body. I asked, Where he paid the money? He said upon the road. I sent for a constable, and delivered him into his care. And the next morning I sent for Mr. Collier, who came and swore to the horse.</p>

I told him I was a widow, and had five small children; and that if he paid ready money, I would serve him as cheap as any body; otherwise, I could not give him credit. He said he always paid ready money. We agreed for a parcel. He said if I sent them in he would pay the money. This he said several times over, and ordered me to send the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177001170041"/> bill and a receipt. I sent some over-night, that I had by me, and was to get the rest in the trade. He came with a man, which he called his packer, which I have reason since to believe, was one Fisher, who was transported from this place. ( See No. 196, in the last mayoralty). He said he must have them immediately; the packer could not pack them if he had not; and turned round to him and said, You see, packer, you cannot have them now; she must have time to get them; you must wait, packer. I sent and got the goods, and sent them; they came to fourteen pounds ten shillings. Instead of returning my money, he took off the receipt and sent that back, and said he would call on me as he came from 'Change, which he did, and asked me to give him a pen and ink. I did, thinking I was to write a receipt. He said I must take a note for six months. I desired him to let me have my goods again. He said they were packed up and gone abroad; and I could not have them again. He came to three months, then to twenty-one days. He wrote and left a note on the counter, and went out of the shop. I never got my money. I did not agree to take the note. I took him the sessions before last. There were about thirty-six of us with these complaints against him at once before Sir

            . I have kept the house, No. 121, in Fenchurch-street six years. The prisoner took a lodging there in December, 1766. He had only a bed room up two-pair-of-stairs, and a little counting-room. He was about three weeks there off and on. I remember the young man coming with the first parcel. The prisoner carried them out the same night, but where I know not. I did not see the other parcel brought in. The prisoner pretended he was going to Birmingham.</p>

He said he had been in a fray at Blackfriars, and had lost his coat the night before; and that he had lodged some things in Newgate-street, and he was going to a shipmate in Whitechapel for some money. I said he had no occasion for that, (I looked upon him to be my cousin) I would lend him a little. He wanted a bag. I lent him one, and a five-and-three-pence. He said he would make my wife a present of a silk gown. I went along with him to fetch the things. I carried the bag till we got to Newgate-street, then he took it. He ordered me to wait at a public-house, for him. My wife went to Newgate-market and bought something for supper. He would not eat off any body's plate but his dear cousin's. He said if his father in America knew he was at his dear cousin's, he would get drunk for joy. My dear cousin did not come back to eat with me. I never saw him till the 23d of December:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177001170042"/> then another cousin had him in hold in the street for serving him so. Then I charged him. He told me he never saw me before. I went on board the Indiaman. They told me there was no such man on board.</p>
