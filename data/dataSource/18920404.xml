                  </hi>. I live at 33, Great Coram Street—on 20th March, about 12.30 a.m., I was going home up Drury Lane and heard a shuffling of feet behind me; I was seized by my coat collar and thrown violently to the ground on my back, and the prisoner knelt on my chest, put his hand in my right trousers pocket, and took out a purse containing about 15s.; a man with him said, "Have you been right through him, Bill?"—the prisoner got up and they both ran away down a turning which I am told is Goldsmith Street—I got up; I was a bit shaken—I saw two constables, who advised me to go to Bow Street Station, which I did, and gave a full description of the prisoner—on the Monday I identified the prisoner from about a dozen men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The robbery did not take much more than a minute—this was on Sunday morning a few yards from Goldsmith Street, about fifty yards from Holborn—that part of Drury Lane is not well lighted, and the shops were closed—I had had some supper at Harris's in the Strand; I left there about 10.30 and then had one glass of stout nearly opposite Somerset House; I stopped there talking till a little before 11, but did not go into any other house—I was perfectly sober—I had not seen either of the men before—I gave a full description to Inspector Tilsley; he took it down in writing in a book, and next day Detective Collins came to me for full particulars—I went with him to Bow Street on the Thursday, and picked the prisoner out from twelve other men—Collins was not there then—I touched the prisoner, and said, "That is the man"—he said nothing—he was taken away and charged—he said nothing to me, but he denied to Tilsley that he was the man—besides the man who knocked me down and the man who knelt on me there were two others, but they did not join in the attack.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 168, Cornwall Road, Notting Hill, and am a boot machinist—on 20th March, before going to bed, I locked up my house and fastened all the windows, and locked and bolted the door and turned the gas off at the meter—I went to bed about half-past twelve—I came down next morning about eight o'clock—I found the gas alight in the front kitchen, the kitchen door leading to the area open, a cash-box turned upside down and open on the table, the inside of it was taken out—the night before that cash-box was locked in a bureau in the kitchen—I found that a square of glass in a back room window leading into the basement had been taken out and laid on the ground; it was large enough for a person to get through without undoing the window—the glass had been cracked previously—in the cash-box there had been about £7, the money of a club—I also missed from a drawer a canvas bag with £12 10s. in gold and silver; and a gold watch and two gold signet rings—at the foot of the bureau on the floor I picked up a piece of tobacco that had evidently been chewed—in the garden at the back of the house I noticed in my fowls' run, which is not covered at the top, but is wired at the sides, footprints and prints of something round; they were too large to be made by an ordinary wooden leg; but I came to the conclusion that they were made by some one who had a</p>

               <p>deformed foot or a wooden leg; they were perfectly round holes, the size of a tumbler at the top—there were several such marks; there was a boot mark close to one—the person must have come over the wall into the fowls' run, walked along that, got over the wire on to a seat just outside it—I traced the footmarks from the wall to that seat—the window is about six yards from the seat—there were no marks from the seat to the window, because it is very hard ground—we traced the footmarks over the adjoining garden and two other gardens, and saw wire that had been broken, where someone had come through—a few days afterwards a constable brought the prisoner to my house and compared the marks with the prisoner's wooden leg; the leg fitted the marks; it stood up in them—the constable covered the marks up to keep them clear and distinct.</p>

Do I look like a burglar?"—on the way to the station he said, "Who are the other men? Is one Skedgel?"—I said, "Yes"—he was one of those in custody—he said, "Who is the other?—I said I did not know—he said, "Is he tall or short?"—I said I did not know—the same evening I went to 168, Cornwall Road, with the prísoner and the Inspector—the prisoner voluntarily took off his wooden leg and handed it to the inspector—we compared the footmarks with it; they corresponded exactly—the leg exactly fitted in the marks, which were about one inch deep—on the way back to the station the prisoner said, "What time did it happen?".—I said I did not know—he said, "I can prove I was in bed at a quarter to one"—the bottom of the leg was wood; it was not shod.</p>

On Sunday morning, 27th March, about twenty minutes past two, I was in Green Street, Bethnal Green, and noticed the prisoner and two other men coming one way and one going the other; they met about fifty yards from me, and the person nearest to the man going along by himself struck him on the side of the face and knocked him into the gutter, and all three set upon him—the one who had knocked him down held him down, and the other two rifled his pockets—I could recognise two, the one I caught and one of those who got away—I saw the prisoner rifling the man's pockets—I ran up, and when I got within five yards the one holding him down said, "Look out, here's a copper," and they ran up Smart Street—the prisoner tried to throw me over him, but I held him down till I got my breath, and then picked him up and brought him back to the prosecutor, who was <hi rend="italic">kind of</hi> senseless—I said, "Are you going to charge this man?"—he said, "Yes"—the prisoner had on the hat which was owned by the prosecutor—I took the prisoner to the station; when charged he said he did not know the man, he had never seen him in his life before; he said he had been set about by three men, and that he had got in the scuffle before this happened, and that he was coming along at the time this affair happened, but there were only three persons with him at the time this happened—I asked him</p>

               <p>why lie ran away, and he said he did not wish to get into trouble—he might have had a couple of glasses, but he was not drunk.</p>

In December last I was a detective officer of Scotland Yard—on December 11th, about 12.30 p.m., I was in Mornington Road, in plain clothes, and saw the prisoner standing outside the garden-gate of No. 66—I crossed over to the opposite side to one of the front gardens, and kept observation on him—he left the gate and walked to Park Street, and then came back into Mornington Road again; then to Park Street and Albany Street on to the Canal Bridge, where he opened his coat—I stopped him and said, "What are you loitering about here for at this time of morning?"—he said, "Loitering; what do you mean?" and drew this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> from his inside coat pocket, and raised it to strike me; I caught his wrist with my left hand and blew my whistle, and Ainger came up—he then said, "I will go quietly now you have come"—we took him to the station, and I charged him—he said he was a horse dealer, and that the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> was a shoe-horn which he used to pull the shoes off the horses' feet, and this knife, which was found on him, was for cutting horses' tails—this rope was found on him, which he said was for leading a horse, and the bag was for carrying a I saddle in; also this box of matches, they are not silent ones—he was taken before a Magistrate the same day, remanded for a week, and bailed—he did not surrender on the 18th, and the recognisances were estreated—I arrested him at Ipswich this month—he was detained there by the police.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The officer who came up was in uniform—there were only two of us—I will not swear whether I told him at first that I was an officer; it was my duty to do so—he gave me a correct address; it was not at the house of a constable, but he had been a constable some years before—the key I found on him was the latch-key of that house.</p>

               <p>of Mr. Hensman—on arriving there I found the prisoner, about ten feet from the gate, dressed, in her slippers, and a shawl over her head—I endeavoured to induce her to return, but finding that she would not, I went into the house to see if I could render assistance to the boy—a communication had been made to me before I got there—I went in at the back door, and at once went to the breakfast-room; I there found the boy lying on the floor with his throat cat, quite dead—the body was lying near the window, his head near the window, his feet under the table—there were two distinct pools of blood; one near the feet, the other by the head—the wound in the throat was the cause of death—I found this knife on the table; it is an old carver, used as a bread-knife; it was covered with wet blood—seeing that I could be of no assistance, I locked the door and went in search of the prisoner—I found her in an unoccupied house, about 85 yards from her own home—I asked her to return with me—she at first declined to do so unless accompanied by a female; she said she thought somebody would kill her—I went outside and procured the. help of Mrs. Philpot, a woman outside—I did not examine her neck minutely, I just looked at it and covered it up immediately; I found a wound on the neck two inches long; there was no severe bleeding then; no large vessels had been severed—she was conveyed to her own house and put to bed—she said she had never been cruel before, she had that morning—I had not said anything to her about what I had seen in the breakfast-room—I had occasion to attend the prisoner professionally since December, 1890, from time to time for slight ailments—on the 26th February, the day preceding this occurrence, she called to see me at my surgery and had a conversation with me; it was of such a nature that I kept this memorandum of it—at half-past three p.m. she was shown into the surgery with her little boy—she said at once, "I wish to speak to you privately," so I took her into a dressing-room—she then said, "Have you ever heard that I am mad?"—I said, "No; why, does anyone accuse you of being mad?"—she said, "Oh, yes; people are saying that I am insane; but you don't think so, do you?"—not thinking so then, I replied in the negative—I had no reason at that time to believe so—she said, "It is no reason because my father committed suicide, and my mother in an asylum, that I must be mad too; is it?"—I replied, "No"I then endeavoured to get her to name authorities for her statement that she was insane; but this was evaded—she was a good deal troubled in her mind, but was not outwardly much affected, from the fact that a former servant of hers, two or three years ago, had stolen a sovereign, she referred to that incidentally, and seemed troubled about it—I said that was a long time ago, and not worth while bothering about—she went on to speak about people libelling her and charging her with being a drunkard; and she inquired whether I did not think it was a dreadful accusation to make against anybody—that, I think, terminated the interview; it lasted about a quarter of an hour—I asked her to send her husband to me; that was in consequence of the impression left on my mind at the close of the interview; I wanted to see him as soon as possible—I formed the opinion, from that interview, that she was commencing to be of unsound mind—her husband did not come that evening, and I did not see her again till the next day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Solomon Levine, of 47, Portsdown Road, Maida Hill—last year I was living at 44, Bedford Place, Russell Square—I manage my father's business of a moneylender—on February 1, 1891, I received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">From the prisoner¡ applying for a loan.</hi>)—I answered it, and went down to Panels Farm, North Morton, and there saw the prisoner—I told him I had come down in consequence of his application for a loan of £100—he said that since writing he had modified his request, and he only wanted £50, as he had some money come into his hands—I asked what security he could deposit—he said he had only his live and dead stock, furniture, etc., which was worth £900—I told him that could only be done by a bill of sale—he did not object to that—I submitted to him the printed form for my expenses, twelve shillings, that was for inspecting the security he offered, and told him I should require proof that there were no arrears of rent—he said, "My rent is paid up to Michaelmas, 1890," and went into the adjoining room and produced this receipt for rent to Michaelmas—I proceeded to take an inventory for the bill of sale, and went over the whole house, except one bedroom at the top—he went with me—I made a rough inventory, and he saw me making it—an arrangement was made for him to come up next day to execute the bill of sale—he came to the office next day, and my father was there—he took out of his pocket the fire insurance policy, and this rent receipt, and showed them to my father—I required him to sign this form of application. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that the rent was paid up to Michaelmas, and that there were no arrears of rent, and proposing to pay the principal and interest in twelve monthly payments.</hi>)—he wrote that himself, and executed this bill of sale at the same interview—these are the original notes I made—my father wrote an open cheque for £50, and gave it to him—he did not object to making the bill of sale—he agreed to it at the farm—he seemed to understand what he was doing; he read it, and said he was perfectly satisfied—we do not lend money where the rent is not paid, because there would be no security; the landlord could come in first—we afterwards got a letter from some solicitors saying that the bill of sale was procured by fraud, and on 20th March Clark brought an action against my father—I heard him examined and cross-examined, and remember the details of it—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the original notes I took on the spot.</p>

               <p>him sign a bill of sale, pretending all the time that it was a simple agreement at 5 per centre also swore that I never went upstairs, and never took out a pencil all the time I was there-that was false—I was there two or three hours—I do not remember his swearing that I was only there an hour—I may have sent him this circular—it is one of ours—we generally enclose a directed envelope with them—my father is the money-lender, and I send them out on his behalf—my father registered the title of the company, I believe, at Stationers Hall—the circular says, "Moderate interest"; it was 60 per cent, in this case—where securities are deposited, of course, the interest is much less—there are no fees—I took nothing out of the £50, nor did he give me anything after he got the £50 the 12s. was paid on February 4 when he arrived at the office—the total he paid was £2 12s. 6d., which included the whole of the travelling expenses and the stamp and registration of the bill of sale, the difference was for my loss of time taking the inventory—I do not call that fees—he did not tell me that his great object was to prevent any local exposure, or that he had once had a bill of sale which nearly ruined him, and that he would not have one on account of it being registered—he brought the receipt with the fire insurance policy next day, but he showed it to me when I was down there—I thought it was the receipt of Mr. Hedges, the landlord, and was perfectly satisfied; the forgery did not come out till he persecuted me, and then it came out on tai own evidence—I did not know anything about the landlord's position in life—the prisoner did not say, "I rent the farm, and my father and grandfather had it before me,"nothing of the sort, he has sworn falsely, and persecuted me cruelly—I registered the bill of sale within a week, I am bound to—I never received a letter from the prisoner saying: Sir,—I find you have turned our transaction into a bill of sale by fraud, and I have instructed my solicitor to take proceedings against you"; your counsel said so—the solicitor sent us a letter—the prisoner swore that he posted the letter at the pillar-box at North Morton—he called on us with Mr. Slade, his solicitor—I cannot fix the date; it was at the end of February—I will not swear whether it was within three days of February 13th—he offered us the £50 then and there, and we would not take it—we asked a reasonable amount for interest, and told him w, should take half the interest, which would give us £8—we did not want the £50; we said, "Keep it"—I do not think I said in Mr. Slade's presence, "You have made your bargain; you must stick to it"—we said "We are no more entitled to call on you for the money than you are to come here and offer us the money after giving us all the trouble"—Mr. Slade refused to take proceedings, and the second solicitor who took it up saw the fault; I can only say I have been ruined through you client—an action was brought against my father, and while it was going on he kept up the instalments till he paid us £30; he then missed paying he two next instalments, and eventually we put in an execution and realised £44—when we went down to take possession we found the place securely barricaded, and we were kept outside fifty-eight days, and the whole amount went in expenses; there were fifty-eight days possession men—I made out this account (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there was also the rent of a stable for the goods to be stored in—I paid that; I have the receipts at home—three or four men were employed, but no Pugilists—I was committed by the Magistrate for taking possession contrary to law by</p>

I live at Moncrieff Road, Peckham, and am now managing a manufacturing business—I was employed by the prisoner as his cashier and bookkeeper till the trustee was appointed—I endorsed this cheque for £270 1s. 7d. in the prisoner's office, St. James's Road; it may have been a few days after the date it bears—the prisoner gave me the cheque, with directions to endorse it—I had been in the habit previously of endorsing his cheques—after endorsing it I gave it back to him—on 28th October a special manager had been appointed, and was in possession of the premises—neither he nor his clerk was there when I was asked to endorse the cheque; no one was present but the prisoner and myself—I did not open the letter containing the cheque; both cheque and letter were handed to me, and I handed them back to the bankrupt—there is no regular letter-box on the premises, there is only a hole in the door, and letters fall through on to the mat—the prisoner occasion<lb/>ally</p>

I am an accountant, of King Street, Cheapside, and trustee of the bankrupt's estate—I did not find out from him until I had found it out from other sources, about December 20th, that he had received this cheque—I did not see the letter that accompanied it till I taxed him with it—the money for it has been given to me this morning—he did not account for the proceeds of the cheque in his statement of affairs—his son, who used to carry on business in Love Lane, has left the country; he did not inform me that he had the cheque; he left the country before I discovered it—I assisted the bankrupt to make out his statement of affairs—I questioned him about them; he gave no information about this cheque—in the statement of affairs in "I"it appears that the balance of certain bills unpaid and running is due from the London Chartered Bank of Australia—the prisoner had received half of the value of two bills from the London Chartered Bank of Australia, leaving a balance of £265 10s. 1d., to which rebate of interest £5 7s. 10d. was added, making £270 17s. 11d., less 16s. 4d. for telegraphing, £270 1s. 7d.—on October 23rd Mr. Viney was appointed special manager, and I was appointed to assist the prisoner in getting out his statement of affairs—if on evening of 28th or morning of 29th he had received a cheque, he ought to have disclosed it to me or to the special manager—the morning before this statement of affairs was sworn,</p>

Bristow, of London, amounting to 216,000 francs—we insured the parcel with Messrs. Dunlop and Co.—I produce the receipts—I packed the bonds myself in the packets, put a tape round, and sealed them—amongst the bonds so packed were 425 Turkish Priority bonds of £20 each, and twenty-five shares on the National Bank of Mexico—the number of one of the Turkish bonds was 336887—I gave the numbers of the bonds at the Police-court on January 19th—the numbers on the two pages of this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are correct—the parcels I packed were given to two of our employés to take to the railway station; they were entered in this receipt book by the railway company—we advised Messrs.

P. Peach £890 in cash in exchange for my Turkisn Priority bonds for £100 each, and his acquittance shall be a good and sufficient discharge for the same, Melville"—in consequence of its being Saturday, and after banking hours, it was not carried out till Monday—on that same evening I received this telegram from Melville: "Will come three o'clock Monday.—Melville"—on Monday, the 27th, Peach came about two, alone—he produced twenty Turkish Priority bonds, and also this agreement.

I have known Peach twelve or thirteen years—during that time I had many transactions with him—he has let houses for me at Hadley, near Barnet—I had bought other bonds through him or lent money upon them—I had no difficulty with regard to them—I bought a bond of him for £200, payable to bearer; that was a Baltimore and Ohio bond, an American railway bond; that bond was all right, I gave him the full market price for it—I bought a Great Indian Peninsula debenture stock, they were two bonds for £360, and there was one debenture—I don't think he was acting for me throughout all the bond transactions; no, he could not have been—I know he was acting for somebody else, because he produced his principals, on three occasions I think; one was a lady, and one was a man who had something to do with a partnership affair for him; the other was a man I did not know; I took the bonds up from his principal—those were the three occasions—he was really an estate agent's clerk when I first knew him; he afterwards developed into what they call a financial agent at the West End—I have no occupation; I am not a financial agent—these were friendly transactions almost—I have an income—on November 9th Peach sent me a cablegram from New York in a letter he had received; it was in relation to some property that he had asked me to look out for him—I hardly know now what it was—I did not look out for any property—I told him he might go and inquire in Regent Street—I don't know the fact that he wanted premises, I doubted it—he told me he did—when I took these bonds they had the September coupons on them, not the March coupons, I never had them—my suspicions were aroused about the bonds when he sent me the letter of August 28th—I had my doubts about itit was a large sum—I did not think much of it; it would not have troubled me very much, it was my own money; I felt that he would redeem them at the time by some means or other—in October I raised a loan of £1,200 on the bonds—that was from the Union Bank—that was after I became suspicious—a mortgage deed was not executed, they were merely deposited; I signed nothing in relation to them—the loan was raised at the end of October; it was completed on 2nd November, before other bonds were deposited, a day or two before I and my wife went to the bank; she generally goes with me on any matter of business like that; not always, very seldom; she goes if a large amount of money passes—she was interested in the loans—I drew the cheque, and she signed it—it is her account—she would not lose, she would have been recouped by me—it was quite a private arrangement between us—I had an interview with Peach on 27th July; there was some conversation, but I cannot remember the nature of it—it is possible that the name of Mr. Peter Higginson was mentioned; I can't say that I remember it—on 19th September the manager of the bank and I did not go over the bonds together; I merely took them out of the box and gave them to him—the paper Peach showed me was the <hi rend="italic">Investors' Gazette;</hi> it was not the <hi rend="italic">Investors' Manual</hi> of 1st July, 1891—it was the same as this. (<hi rend="italic">This was said to he the</hi> Investors' Manual of 1<hi rend="italic">st June</hi>, 1891)—Mrs. Scears was present at the interview of 27th July—I think Peach had a letter in his hand which</p>

I have not large transactions in bonds and securities of this sort; these are not the first bargains I have had to deal with—I have not had a good many—I never lent money to anyone but Peach—perhaps I have bought £20,000 worth of securities, and perhaps as much for my wife; I watch the prices of securities—I occasionally read financial papers—if I see any things go down it is not pleasant reading, and I avoid them—one is interested in them, to see the rise and fall of securities—after the letter of 28th August I entertained suspicions; I thought it strange that he should tell me not to touch the coupons; it was only a vague idea that there was something not right about the bonds—I did not convey my suspicions to the manager when I asked him to lend money on them; I knew the manager would not lose anything by the transaction if I did—I could not define my idea of the thing—I did not think the bonds were stolen, but something like not rightly come by—when the manager saw the bonds I did not look at them—he knew where they came from—as I trusted Peach so he trusted me—he handed them to the coupon clerk—there was nothing about them to excite his suspicion or mine—I felt that my advance was secured by the bonds—I did not ask any questions about the lady who was about to be married—I had seen Melville once before; I am not certain of the name he was introduced as, but I think it was Graham.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 86, Terminus Road, Eastbourne—I attested the signature of A. H. Melville on an agreement—to the best of my knowledge, Selwyn is the man—Peach was present when Melville executed it—Peach came into the office and said Mr. Melville was a gentleman staying in Eastbourne, and asked me to attest a deed which he wished to execute—I said, "Certainly"—I saw Melville, and asked him if he had read through the deed and understood it—he said, "Yes"—subsequently I received this letter of 3rd February, 1892, purporting to be signed Walter Selwyn—I received it after I had given evidence against Peach, and before Selwyn was in custody.</p>

Mr. Melville has resided for some years in India, and is about to buy a house near the Knightsbridge Branch."—I notice a difference in his appearance, his hair, moustache, and eyebrows were black—he brought with him a cheque for £1,000 on the Richmond branch, drawn by Emily Selwyn—I com municated with the Richmond branch on the subject of the letter and cheque, and as a result opened the account in the name of Percy Melville, and he operated on that account—in April, 1891, he deposited some French rentes, and borrowed money on them—he afterwards instructed me to sell some; his account was overdrawn pending the sale—he afterwards deposited further French securities, and having had them valued, I save him a credit of about £2,764—the first lot being sold realised £1,126, and the second lot £1,637—those were French rentes—all the securities deposited were French bonds—he offered further securities, which were not accepted—a few days after the sale I got some information about the securities being stopped—we them all. (<hi rend="italic">Two letters of Selwyn's were then put in, and the following passage in one of them was read:</hi> "I know that they were not in the official list of stock bonds, published in Paris at the time I bought them, as it has been a rule of mine for years not to deal in this class of security without first sending for the 'Bulletin des Opposition.'")—that letter was written in my presence on 9th December—I saw Selwyn write it on the bank paper, but with the address, "44, Markham Square"—this other letter of 7th December was not written in my presence—the sale was four or fire days previous to that letter—I received this letter or 23rd February, 1892. (<hi rend="italic">This was signed Melville, and stated that for some time he should be residing in France.</hi>)—<hi rend="italic">this</hi> cheque for £48, dated 3rd March, 1892, payable to W. Cooper, was the last cheque presented on that account.</p>

Pemberton, Esq., 29, Agate Road; that was in October—I never saw Pemberton.</p>

                  </hi>. I was for many years in the police force—I have lately retired, in my thirtieth year of service; I was then chief inspector—in January, 1890, I received information of the robbery of a parcel of bonds on board the <hi rend="italic">Mary Beatrice</hi>—I saw it circulated in the ordinary way; I was not specially employed then—in the course of my experience I have acquired a knowledge of dealing with foreign bonds and the persons employed in dealing with them—in March, 1891, I went to Calais, and kept observation on the steamers arriving and departing there—I took Sergeant Lowe with me, as he spoke French fluently—on the morning of the 9th April I saw four men I knew leave the mail steamer <hi rend="italic">Breeze</hi>, arriving from Dover at a quarter to one a.m.; they left separately—one was named Powell, another Sinclair, and the two others, <hi rend="italic">Red Bob</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Shrimps</hi>—I was in communication with the French police, and arrangements had been made—I indicated those men to the French police, and they were arrested—at the Police-station at Calais a cloak-room ticket was handed to me by one of the French officers in the presence of Powell—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the remains of it; it was in a pulp; the officer forced Powell, and made him spit it out—this is dated 24th March, 1891, relating to a hatbox left at the Victoria Station of the London, Chatham, and Dover line—this cloak-room ticket was also handed to me, dated 8th April, some keys were taken from Sinclair and handed to me; one of them I found to be a master key fitting all the safes on board the London, Chatham, and Dover mail boats—the <hi rend="italic">Breeze</hi> was one of those boats—the other two keys were keys of Chubb's padlocks used on the steamers—the safes are placed in a square wooden box on the deck, and the outer box is padlocked—I afterwards tested one of them in the outer box of the <hi rend="italic">Wave</hi>, and it fitted; the other fitted the outer box of another steamer—from Sinclair a wax impression was taken of the padlock belonging to the <hi rend="italic">Breeze</hi>, the boat they had left—a piece of wax was also taken from <hi rend="italic">Bed Bob</hi>, but he destroyed the marks on it; it was impossible to identify it—the four men were detained—I afterwards went to Dover, and there obtained the parcel that was referred to in the Dover cloak-room ticket; it was a bag containing a dummy parcel in brown paper, an exact imitation of a parcel of bonds, in an oilcloth cover, with a plain label ready to be addressed—I found three parcels, exact imitations of parcels of bonds, which might be used for replacing any parcels of bonds that were taken—I went to Victoria Station with the other ticket, and got the hat-box, in the lining of which I found a</p>

               <p>sealed packet, and there were some old shirts in the box—the sealed packet contained sixty-two coupons, which had been cut from the bonds contained in the stolen parcel of bonds for March, 1890—the whole of those coupons related to twenty of the bonds deposited with Mr. Scears—the four men that were taken in custody at Calais were detained until August, and were then expelled from France—on 4th September, 1891, I went to the cloak-room at Cannon Street, and there examined a Gladstone bag, which had been deposited there some months prior, and in that I found twenty Turkish Priority bonds for £100 each and twenty Mexican bank shares and five £20 Turkish—I produce them—there were also twenty-three loose coupons relating to the same stolen bonds—I gave instructions to the railway company, and on 8th October I received a communication from them—the bag was left there, but I took the contents—in consequence of the communication I received I kept observation on the South-Eastern Railway office in Piccadilly Circus; the day previous to that I received a telegram, and went to the Café Monico, and there saw the man Powell in conversation with a man called Kotchie, a man aged about sixty, and 5ft. 6in. in height; a Polish Jew, thin, with hollow cheeks, a haggard expression, and grey moustache; that was the description given by Mr. Wain—on the 9th I was in the receiving office in Piccadilly, and while there I saw Kotchie come in; about four I saw a woman outside speaking to him—they waited about there, walking backwards and forwards, and about six o'clock the woman came into the office; she went up to the clerk; I could not see what she had got—she. went out, and in going out I saw her communicate with Kotchie; he banded her something, which he took from his waistcoat pocket; she came into the office again—I saw her pay money, 14s. and something, and this Gladstone bag was handed to her; it was the bag I had seen at Cannon Street, out of which I had taken the bonds—she then rejoined Kotchie, and they got into a cab and drove away together; I did not follow them—I afterwards ascertained where they were going to, and afterwards went to the place, 4, Portland Terrace, St. John's Wood, where I found Kotchie and the woman living—I interviewed them—up to this point I had been acting on my own account in my capacity of police-inspector, with the knowledge of the Marine Insurance Company—on the 2nd November I got information as to the presentation of some of the coupons; the secretary called at our office, and as the result I was put in communication with Mr. Scears—I inquired into the matter, and in conjunction with Mr. Scears and Mr. Maugham, I swore an information, and obtained a warrant for the arrest of both the prisoners—on the 21st December I met the prisoner Peach in Glasshouse Street, Regent Street, about eleven in the morning; Sergeant Lowe was with me—I said, "I am an inspector of police, and this is a brother officer; I hold a warrant for your arrest for obtaining from Mr. Scears £890 on some stolen bonds"—he said, "I am perfectly innocent"—we went to the Vine Street Station, close by, and I read the warrant to him—he remarked, "I hall be able to explain it more fully; I believe Mr. Melville is in Scotland, shooting, and will return in January; I have known him since 1886. I met him some time ago, and he asked me to raise a loan on these bonds; he said he had bonds to the value of £4,800, and I obtained the loan from Mr. Scears on twenty £100 bonds. I afterwards met Mr.</p>

               <p>Melville in October at the Primrose Club, and he asked me to take charge of the remainder of the bonds, and I did so, he also asked me to sell them in January, and then redeem those in the possession of Mr. Scears"—I said, "As a police officer I cannot ask you anything, but as you refer to the missing bonds, I may tell you the owners are very anxious about them, as they form the remaining portion of £8,400 which were stolen"—he said they were in perfectly safe keeping, and would be produced after he had consulted his solicitor—on 22nd December I went to Richmond, and saw Peach's wife—she appeared to be very ill, as well as in great poverty—I gave her ten shillings—she said she had no bread in the house—on 29th December the question of these bonds was mentioned before the Magistrate, who made some statement, in consequence of which I spoke to Mr. Cooper, the solicitor appearing for Peach—I went with Mr. Cooper to the house of Mrs. Peach, and had some conversation with her—she seemed then to be in a very much better position than when I had seen her last—I went with her upstairs; there was a bedstead in the centre of the room—she pushed it on one side, and moved a piece of carpet from the centre of the room, and indicated a board there, which I lifted up, and took from the hole in the floor a parcel containing twenty-three £100 Turkish Priority bonds, which had formed part of the stolen parcel that I was looking for—I found some letters in another part of the house, which I produce. (<hi rend="italic">These were put in, and referred, to as showing communication between the prisoners, and were used for the purpose of comparison of handwriting</hi>)—during this time I was looking for Selwyn—he was arrested on 2nd March—I had observation kept on a house in Harewood Square, Marylebone, and Selwyn was brought out of that house and put into a cab—Sergeant Lowe told him who I was, and I said I would follow to the station in another cab—Selwyn said, "There is plenty of room; pray come in here"—on the way in the cab he said he was at Peach's house the night following his arrest; he said, "If I had known there were any bonds there you may take your oath they would not have been found"—he said, "I have been through the depositions the night before last"—nothing was said about the account opened in the name of Percy Melville—I was not present when he wrote a cheque—I do not know Graham.</p>

H. Melville, to the agreement in Mr. Scears' case, document 4, purporting to be the authority of Peach to receive money from Scears, and the signature of Melville on a bank-note—comparing the signature of Melville to the agreement with Selwyn's admitted writing, I say that it is Selwyn's disguised writing, and the same as the signature of Melville on the £100 note—I recognise a similarity between that writing and the writing of the document produced by Mr. Montagu through the letter "J,"which is the connecting link—I believe the letter addressed to Miss Beeby, in the name of Walter Selwyn, is Selwyn's genuine writing—the letters in the name of Retlaw and Hughes are both in the same writing—I am prepared to point out the peculiarities on which I base my opinion.</p>

P., went into the matter with me—I never heard of a meeting of my workpeople at Mr. Lyon's office, nor was there a meeting in my own firm, to my knowledge, but it could have happened—it is the first I have heard of a meeting to express dissatisfaction—Mr. Gibbs is my manager.</p>

                  </hi>. I am undergoing a sentence of penal servitude at Wormwood Scrubbs prison in reference to a robbery of stamps from the <hi rend="italic">Astrea</hi> in the Royal Albert Docks—I was convicted in December—last June I was acting as a stevedore's labourer on the <hi rend="italic">Astrea</hi> in the Docks—I began work there on the 8th June—I superintended the general lading—the <hi rend="italic">Putney</hi> came alongside on Friday, 12th June—on the Saturday, 13th, I was working at No. 1 hold; that was the day I was convicted for—I worked "on that day from 7a.m. till 5 p.m. at No. 1 hold, and at no other hold that day—on the Monday I started at No. 1 again at 7 a.m. and worked till 10.30a. m, I would not be certain to a minute—we put the hatches on No. 1, and moved to No. 2 hold at "eleven o'clock, and worked till five o'clock—I was away from half-past three till twenty minutes past four for some beer, while they were shifting barges—I remember this wooden case coming from the <hi rend="italic">Putney</hi>—I handled the whole of the cases; the <hi rend="italic">Putney</hi> had between 2,000 and 3,000 stones and cases for Bombay; there was no bulkhead, it was all dear—the things for Kurrachee were at the fore and after ends—I handled this case as it came down the hold, I took all the oases out of the sling and put them down myself, about a quarter to three on the afternoon of the Monday—every case that came down in that sling was in good condition—when I came back about twenty minutes past four, and went into</p>

You know I am charged with stealing those stamps on the 13th, and you know they did not come in until the 15th"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "This is a nice <hi rend="italic">pickle</hi> you have got me into; I told you there would be a nice row over this, and I have got to suffer for it"—he said, "You will be all right; you will get off; we have got a counsellor"—I said, "Mind, I want you there, Morris, Hunt, Webster; I want Robert Ashton, William Simmonds, James Willingham, as witnesses for me on the trial, and you see they are there; if you will promise me that I will keep quiet till then"—I asked that they would come and tell the truth to prove the stamps came in on the 15th, as I was charged with stealing them on the 13th—there were two charges; one was giving them to the firemen, and the other breaking open the case and stealing them—he said he would see that everything was right—he said Mr. Sharman had got the brief written out, and paid the counsel, and everything would be all right—he did not come before the trial—I saw Elizabeth McEwan, my niece, before the trial, but not the prisoner—I was tried in December—Robert Ashton was the only one of those witnesses there; he was not called—Mr. Sharman never called a witness—I was convicted, and sentenced to seven years' penal servitude—in the interval of about two months between my conviction and sentence I sent for the prisoner by my niece—the prisoner came to see me at Holloway early in February—I asked him why he was not at the trial—I got onto him <hi rend="italic">something cruel;</hi> I said, "What is this going to be?"—he said, "I don't know; I don't know what to do"—I said, "Well, I shall soon know, if you don't know"—I said, "I sent my niece to you, and I told her to tell you that if you did not come to me I would soon send some one to find you"—I told him my niece had told me that he had told her that if I rounded on him he should round on the lot—this was after my conviction and before I was sentenced—the prisoner said, "I don't know what to do; I don't know whatever to do; I shall have to put up with it if you do"—'I said, "Is there another man in England that would screen you the way I have done, to stop in prison all this while?

               <p>he understood foreign stamps—I did not understand them—he said, "Yes; let me see them," and I said I would let him see them—Osborne was not one of the witnesses I wanted at the trial—I gave them to Osborne to deliver to Malpas, who was to look at them—I asked him if he knew what foreign stamps were—half of Malpas's evidence was perjury—I never asked Malpas to lend me half-a-crown on those stamps—it is not true that I told Malpas I could not pay him 4d., or that I called him outside and gave him about 120 stamps wrapped up in a piece of newspaper, or that I asked him if he would lend me half-acrown on them till I got work; it is a lie—Malpas gave the stamps back to me—he did not say, "I don't think these are all right"—I did not say, "Oh, yes, they are all right, Fred; I would not take you in; they are all right"—he did not say, "I don't think they are; my wife is kicking up a bother about them; you take them back again, and I will not have anything to do with them; what good are they to me?"—I did not tell Malpas that I got the stamps through their being sent to me as remittances from India—if Malpas said that he was telling a lie, and he knew it—Egan, Hargreaves, Gaiety, and Webb were liars, Malpas was half a liar, and Mr. Sharman was selling his client—I do not know why Malpas should commit perjury; Webb would do it for the brokers, because the barge came alongside on the 12th, and was not touched on the 15th—Gaiety, Hargreaves, and Egan committed perjury because they bad made a mistake and could not alter it; they altered it once, and could not do so a second time—the eight men in that gang can come here and say that case came in on the 15th—I make this statement in the interest of justice; it is the truth, and I should have made it before only that Clarke and Humphries begged so hard of me not to <hi rend="italic">round</hi>—Humphries was the cause of me and Clarke doing it—Humphries and Clarke were guilty—I own I took the stamps and gave them to the donkey-man, but if you can fetch me a man out of that gang who saw me take the stamps out of the case, or who can swear that the prisoner did not do it, I will give in.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> One thing in Hargreaves' evidence that is untrue is about my saying that I could give him plenty to make double the money of—it was on the 15th that Hargreaves took the stamps out of my hand, not the 13th; the stamps never came into the ship till the 15th, Monday, and I was not in the Liverpool Arms on Saturday, the 13th—when Gaiety said I gave him stamps on the 13th, it was wrong, it was on 15th; that is what it means when I say he committed perjury—I was charged with breaking the case and stealing the stamps on the 13th—I picked them up on the 15th, and took them on deck and gave them to one of the servants—I thought Gaiety was looking, and he told me not to make a song about them and he would burn them—I wanted to call witnesses to prove that they did not come on board till the 15th, and I thought I ought to have been acquitted on that ground; as I was charged on the wrong day, an his Lordship said to the Jury that if they found the stamps were take in on the 15th they must acquit the prisoners—I sent some of the stolen stamps to Malpas, asking him if he understood what foreign stamps were.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk and cashier to Mr. C. T. Birchall, solicitor, of 5, Mark Lane—I have been in that service about fourteen years—in the early part of 1890 Mr. Birchall was solicitor for Mr. Hendry in an action brought by him against the defendant to recover an amount for machinery made by order of the defendant—that action was tried before Mr. Justice Charles on the 7th and 8th of November, 1890—Mr. Davis, his present solicitor, was his solicitor in that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189204040075"/>
               <p>action, and Mr. Ellis J. Davis his counsel—it resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff, Mr. Hendry, for £124, and the taxed costs came to £97—Mr. Justice Charles refused to stay execution—on 13th November the defendant called on me at the office—prior to that I had made inquiries about his financial position—I was not alone in the outer office—I saw him alone in the inner office—I said, "Permit me, Mr. Springmuhl"—Springmuhl was the name I knew him by; that was the name under which the machinery was made for him, and under which we sued him—the first action was brought in the name of Springmuhl, and then he entered appearance to that in the name of You Weissenfeld—I said, "Permit me to point out, before you make any statement, that you are legally represented, and that it is contrary to professional etiquette that I should hear what you have to say without your solicitor; let me see your solicitor, and any terms you have to offer let them come through him"—he said, "I have just come from my solicitor, and I have his approval"—I said, "If you say that that alters the case; what do you offer?"—he said, "£ 100; I am to have the machinery; half the balance to be paid on 1st March, and the balance on 1st April"—I said, "I could not advise Mr. Hendry to do that, to part with £150 worth of machinery for £100"—he said, "If you don't take this you will get nothing; I have not £100 myself, but some friends of mine would Day it if they could get the machine"—I replied, "I have no doubt they would be pleased to take it at that price"—he said, "I have not anything myself; I have got a bill of sale on my furniture, so I am secured"—I said, "I know that; I found that out some time back, and it is all the more reason why I should advise Mr. Hendy that he has security for the due payment of the balance"—I told him that I had instructions to take proceedings in bankrupcy, that I was in the act of preparing the papers as he came into the office—the papers were before me, and I was preparing them—I did not point them out to him, because we were in the inner room at the time—I said, "I cannot,"or" will not take the responsibility of refusing your offer myself, and with a view of saving time I will write to Mr. Hendry to see Mr. Birchall, my principal, at his private house the first thing in the morning, and in the meantime I shall complete the papers in bankruptcy;"as I told him if the offer was accepted I would let him know—I said I should not hold out any hopes of its being accepted—it was only in the event of Mr. Hendry accepting his offer that I should write to him—that ended the interview—I have told the Jury all that took place—there is no truth in the suggestion that I said to the defendant that if he gave me a £10 note I would induce Hendry to accept a small amount in settlement; it is absolutely untrue—I communicated with Mr. Hendry, and received certain instructions from him—I mentioned to Mr. Birchall the defendant's call—on 27th November notice of appeal in the action was given; no notice had been given when he called—on 8th December the defendant's solicitors were told that bankruptcy proceedings would be taken, and on the 12th the petition was filed—the matter was adjourned till 1st January, and then till the 15th, and on the 19th I ascertained that the prisoner had gone before another Registrar, Mr. Registrar Hazlitt, on his own petition—I then went before the Registrar, and got his petition made the petition of Mr. Hendry—the prisoner in his own petition had omitted the name of Springmuhl on which he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189204040076"/>
               <p>had got credit, and had gone by the name of Weissenfeld—on 1st January, I think, the Registrar agreed for adjournment till the 15th, provided two sufficient sureties were given to secure to Hendry any sum of money that should be found due to him—two such names were given to me—it was my duty to make inquiries as to their solvency, and I was not satisfied, and reported the matter to the Registrar—the prisoner and his advisers were very angry—the Registrar did not blame me, but said I had done my duty, and did not accept the sureties—the appeal from Mr. Justice Charles's judgment in the High Court was dismissed; on 4th March, I think, that was—there was an appeal from Mr. Justice Vaughan Williams to the Court of Appeal, which was dismissed against the prisoner on 25th March—in every legal proceeding taken by the prisoner he has always been defeated, and Mr. Hendry's representatives have been successful—on 10th February Mr. Burchall showed me these documents—the letter and envelope addressed to Mr. Burchall are in the prisoner's writing—the document containing the libel is printed. (<hi rend="italic">The libel was put in and read; it stated that when he, the prisoner, went to Messrs. Burchall and Wood's and offered to pay the invoice price and taxed costs on delivery of the machine the prosecutor said that if Von Weissenfeld would pay him privately</hi> £10, <hi rend="italic">he would induce their client to accept a small sum in settlement, but otherwise they would at once take proceedings in bankruptcy against him.</hi>)—Mr. Burchall showed me those—I communicated with Mr. Waddy, and showed him the correspondence and the libel—he was our counsel in the action before Mr. Justice Charles—in consequence of the advice he gave me, the first criminal proceedings I took against the prisoner were on 28th February, 1891, when I swore an information, and a summons for libel was granted—I could not serve that summons; the prisoner had disappeared—the bankruptcy proceedings were adjourned till a warrant was issued for him in the Court of Bankruptcy in July, 1891,1 think, but we did not see anything of him till January this year; he did not surrender to pass his public examination in bankruptcy, and the warrant was not served on him till then—we were unable to find him during the whole of 1891—then, in January, 1892, an application was made that the warrant should be suspended that he might give evidence, and Mr. Justice Vaughan Williams suspended it, and he came and gave evidence—Mr. Justice Charles refused to stay execution, and it was my duty, as clerk to the plaintiff's solicitor, to inquire what goods could be realised—I found the prisoner had a bill of sale and practically no assets—it was my duty to take action against him at the instance of Mr. Hendry; if he had satisfied the Registrar that he was solvent, the bankruptcy proceedings would have been stopped; the Registrar adjourned it on the last occasion for four days for him to bring money into court, and then he filed his own petition the next day—he says in the libel that he at once appealed against the judgment, but he did not appeal till the 27th—I heard the prisoner give evidence on the last occasion, when the Jury disagreed; he then said he offered £100 and the balance in two bills, at one or two, and two or three months; in the libel he said that he offered to pay the invoice price and the taxed costs on the delivery of the machine.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189204040077"/>
               <p>Charles's judgment—the prisoner has had opportunities to have it, but he never has had it—I do not think that we commenced these bankruptcy proceedings against him after he had commenced his appeal—the file of bankruptcy proceedings is here—the notice of appeal was served on 27th November—we could not serve that notice, we had to get substituted service; we could not find the prisoner; he was denied to us at his house—we filed the bankruptcy petition on 12th December—we knew then that he was appealing from Mr. Justice Charles's decision, and in the face of that we proceeded in bankruptcy, because we did not feel it was a <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> appeal, and we notified him to that effect—Mr. Justice Charles's judgment was not varied by the Court of Appeal; it' was an absolute dismissal—he did not after that ask us to hand up the machine, or complain of our keeping the machine and having judgment at the same time—the evidence in the action was that the prisoner used the machine and approved of it; Mr. Justice Charles found that—the conversation which resulted in the alleged libel might have lasted five, ten, or fifteen minutes; I cannot say—I did not say that my client was a "pig-headed Scotchman"—there is not a word of truth in the suggestion that I said I thought he was pig-headed; that he would not accede to the terms which the prisoner proposed to me, but that if he made me a present of £101 might be able to induce Hendry to accept the offer—the prisoner was abroad for some time—he said at the Bankruptcy Court that he had been abroad partly on business and partly to have an operation performed on his eye; he also said we could all go to the devil—on one adjournment he wrote to the Registrar that we could all go to the devil—he said he was going to San Francisco—we believe he had an operation performed on his eye years ago, and I don't think he went to have another—after the libel was published, in commenting on it I might have said Mr. Hendry was pig-headed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> This machinery was made for a patent taken out by the prisoner, and was useless except for that purpose—Mr. Hendry dare not sell it—Mr. Justice Charles treated it according to its value as old iron, and allowed £20, as its value, out of a judgment for £144—when that went to the Court of Appeal our side was not called on to argue, but the appeal was dismissed—the Master of the Bolls asked us whether we would deliver the machine on the money being paid, and we said, "Decidedly"; and that was added as an addenda to the order, but was no part of the order—the money has not been paid for the machinery—we were not going to give a machine to a man with a bill of sale on his furniture without having the money down; if we did agree to it Mr. Hendry would not do it, and perhaps an action would be brought against us.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>). I now reside at Stanley House, Paradise Road—I am M. D. and M. A. of Leipsic—I take great interest in scientific matters—at the time I gave this order to Mr. Hendry I was consulting chemist to the Concentrated Produce Company and to the Californian Company—when I called at Mr. Burchall's office in November and saw Flaxman, I said, "I come here to settle this matter; I offer £100 in cash and the balance, for costs and so on, in two bills, "one, I believe, the 1st March, and the other the 1st April," and I want the delivery of the machine"—Flaxman said his client would not deliver the machine under any circumstances, because he had received judgment for damages; that I must go to the Court of Appeal; and he added, "I have very good means to prevent you succeeding in the Court of Appeal"—I did not ask what the means were, but he said there were two means to prevent me succeeding with the appeal; one was bankruptcy and the other was a prosecution for perjury—I said that was somewhat in the Dodson and Fogg line in "Pickwick Papers"—then Flaxman tapped me on the shoulder and winked with his eye, and said, "Well, if you can find a £10 note I shall settle the matter; our client is a pig-headed Scotchman"—he said he had plenty of bankruptcy forms in his desk—I had to deliver the machine to other parties, and I had not the money to pay for it without getting it—Flaxman said, "Oh! you have property"—I answered, "No, I have two houses, but there is a mortgage on them, and I have furniture, but there is a bill of sale on it"—I dont remember that anything else was said—I was there less than half an hour—no one was present but myself and Flaxman—subsequently, I instructed my solicitor to repeat the offer, and he did so—I went to his office, saw his clerk, and made a communication to him—I have written books under the name of Springmuhl—I have never, in any shape or form, attempted to conceal my right name as Von Weissenfeld—my right name is Springmuhl von Weissenfeld.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I believe I had 200 of these publications printed; I don't know when, in 1891 very likely; in January or February—besides the three I sent out I have shown them to many persons—I don't remember if I have sent them to others—I have shown them to my solicitor—I believe I showed them to Messrs. Ashurst, Morris and Crisp, or their clerk; he was acting at the time as my solicitor—he was not acting for any one of my debtors—Mr. Davis was my solicitor in the action before Mr. Justice Charles—Ashurst, Morris and Crisp were solicitors in a sale of property to Mr. Willis and others; they acted for Mr. Willis, not for Mr. Dowden, who was nobody; he was nominally the purchaser—I may have shown the publications to other solicitors; very likely I have shown them to a number of people—a petition was presented against me by Mr. Hendry before one Registrar, and my solicitor went, with my sanction, to another Registrar and got me declared bankrupt on my own petition—my name was always Springmuhl von Weissenfeld, and I should sign a document in that name—when I went</p>

               <p>before the second Registrar I put George Ferdinand von Weissenfeld—I omitted the Springmuhl because I did not want to damage my name under which I wrote books—I slept last Saturday at a friend's, not at Stanley House—I was at Stanley House on Saturday; I left it as soon as I got a telegram from Mr. Davis to come here—I bought Stanley House in 1889—when I presented my own petition in bankruptcy I gave my address as 97, Portland Road, which is Nelson's Hotel—Mr. Hendry, in his petition, put me as residing at Stanley House—this petition is in my writing—I say, "Lately residing at Paris and at 5, Glebe Terrace"—5, Glebe Terrace is Stanley House—letters are addressed to both; 5, Glebe Terrace is the official name—I generally date my letters from "Stanley House"—I do not know if I gave this card to the Registrar—I have been unsuccessful in my principal action—I had no action in bankruptcy—I swore in the witness-box that Stanley House and Grafton House belonged to the Concentrated Produce Company—I think Mr. Justice Vaughan Williams said he could not believe that—in the Court of Appeal Mr. Justice Fry said he believed it—they did not upset the judgment of the Court below—I did not also say that certain furniture over which I had given a bill of sale was the property of the Concentrated Produce Company; there was a bill of sale on it, the bill of sale was with the Company—I said the Concentrated Produce Company had found the money for the fresh bill of sale; and so they did—the Court decided they did not—all the money of the Company was in my wife's banking account—I had no furniture or property to hand over to the trustee; I have not handed it over—I wanted the machine to be given to me on payment of the £100 and bills; on the £100 and two bills being given I expected to get the machine—my solicitor offered to secure the payment of the two bills, I believe—I told Mr. Flaxman I would give him the houses as security for the bills—he did not say, "Could you give me any security for the payment of those bills"; he only spoke about the houses—I believe he said, "If you don't pay us, and have got no security, we know you have a bill of sale on your furniture"—I told him my two houses were mortgaged; but the property was worth £450 more than the mortgage—the mortgagees were not actually in possession at that time.</p>

Kuhn"—he would not have received that cheque if I had not believed him to be a member of the firm—about a quarter to six on the evening of the same day I called at Boynter and Kuhn's premises, at 21, Addle Street—I saw both Boynter and Kuhn—as to the money the prisoner had received, Boynter told him he was quite surprised, and did not know what he should say to him; he said he did not want to use any stronger expression to him just then on account of my presence—we spoke about the £30 cheque which had been stopped at about a quarter to four, because Boynter had called at my office at half-past three or four, in consequence of the bankers having sent the cheque back to Mr. Boynter to ask whether the endorsement was right; I was not in at the time, and I afterwards went round to Boynter's office, and by that time it was known that the cheque had been stopped—Boynter was very angry.</p>

               <p>nothing about the position of affairs in the office in November, only that they were going to part—Mr. Boynter took another office about the beginning of November, but he did not go into it till the 14th or 15th—I believe he was backwards and forwards there, he was principally, I believe, at Addle Street, at our place—I knew Boynter and Kuhn were going to part—I did not know exactly what part of the business the prisoner was going to take over—I thought the musical branch—I knew what he had attended to before—I believe Mr. Hodgson kept the books there; he came there of an evening occasionally—I think I heard something about an application being made for a balance-sheet to be made out; I think I heard that Hodgson was asked to make a balance-sheet—I did not hear anything more about it—I don't know whether he made it—I don't know why it was it was not compiled—I did not hear Mr. Boynter's instructions to Hodgson—I think the prisoner told me that they were parting, and that he was going to take the musical branch—I know nothing about where he was going to get the money from to buy Boynter out—things went on after the 4th and up to the 20th, as they had gone on before, I think; but separate books were kept, that is books with regard to the branch which Boynter was to take over, and the books with regard to the branch that Kuhn was to take—Kuhn came into the business just before I went there, I believe—I do not know what money he brought in—Boynter is now carrying on business at 21, Addle Street, the same place—Kuhn did not tell me that Lang and Polen was one of the businesses he was going to take over, nor the Machine Twine Company—the business that Boynter attended to was the ammunition and powder business—the letters written after 4th November were signed by the prisoner "Boynter, Kuhn, and Co.,"I believe; I have seen it in the book—the letter-book was left in the desk out of sight, but the desk was not fastened in any way, and anyone could open it if they knew it was there—there was no difficulty in opening it and reading the business letters, if it was known it was there—the letterbook was never asked for—any time between 4th and 20th November Boynter could have seen the letter-book if he had asked for it; I never mentioned anything about it, but I should have told him where it was if he had asked me—the letters he wrote were copied into another book, not into the old book—the double set of books started from 4th November—at this time I might have seen the solicitors, Messrs. Osborne, once or twice at the office—Dr. Weber, the prisoner's father-in-law, came to the office last November, I believe—I did not hear Boynter ask him for £1,200, or say he would have £ 1,200; I heard nothing about it—I did not hear Weber ask for a balance-sheet to be prepared or offer to pay any money that could be found on that balance-sheet as against the prisoner; I heard nothing of the kind—I only saw Dr. Weber there once—the press copy letter-book which the prisoner told me to place in his desk commencing the 4th November was the new book which was started from the 2nd November—Boynter's letters were copied in the old book—I believe the prisoner looked to the twine people's business—I said, "He also asked me to place letters from the machine twine people in his desk or on one side,"to put them on one side and out of sight; in his desk he said—that was a branch which the prisoner had attended to, I think he always wrote to those people—letters before they were copied would in most cases be put in a basket on</p>

                  </hi>. Down to the 4th of November last I had carried on business in partnership with the prisoner at 21, Addle Street, City, for some eight years—some short time prior to 4th November there were negotiations between us for terminating the partnership, and on 4th November this deed was signed by both of us dissolving the partnership, which existed up to that date, and constituting me the prisoner's attorney to receive all debts, etc., owing to the partnership—at the same time this other deed was signed. (<hi rend="italic">This was read</hi>)—the 3rd December is mentioned as the date on which the purchase is to be completed—as a matter of fact, nothing was ever done towards completing the purchase; no Sum of money was ever paid with regard to it, and nothing done for the purpose of carrying it through—the arrangement between us as to the prisoner's position between 4th November and 3rd December was that he should carry on his branch, that was taking orders for the branch which he took over in case he paid his liabilities, and writing them over, but the firm was to be Boynter and Co. as. I wrote to the bank on the morning of the 5th in his presence—I wrote that no other signature but my own should be honoured; this is the letter—I drew his attention to that letter—no monetary arrangement was come to after that under which he stayed on till 3rd December, except that at the end of each week, as I knew he had no money, I gave him £6, I think—I think he remained a fortnight longer in the business—he was not entitled to receive moneys owing to the old firm prior to 4th November and he had no authority to receive money owing to the firm with regard to past orders which had been executed—I did not know of his receipt from Harding of £60 on 4th November, nor of £46 on 6th November he brought a cheque for £50 from the North British Rubber Company on 12th November, saying they gave him a cheque—it was paid into the bank on the 12th—it is possible the cheque of the 14th is the same—with regard to two sums of money alleged to have been received on 18th November, one from the North British Rubber Company and the other from Mr. Jacobson, I had already taken new offices, and while I was moving in a gentleman from the Capital and Counties Bank came and made a statement to me, and I went round and saw two cheques, and he' asked me to go and stop them—I went and asked the prisoner for the money he had stolen, which he tremblingly handed back to me, and asked me not to prosecute him—he returned me the money which he had already received from the bank, and I paid it into the bank—up to that time he had not said anything to me about the receipt of those moneys—up to my asking him he had not said anything about haying been to the North British Rubber Company about that money—he had no authority from me to go there or to Mr. Harding or to Mr. Jacobson—when I spoke to him he said, "Please don't say anything more," and he drew the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189204040084"/>
               <p>money out of his pocket—I said to him, Give me the money you have stolen—he took the money out of his pocket and said, "I could not help it," and he said something about a bill he had taken up—I was not very well; and I got the money and paid it into the bank—that would make the two sums of £30 and £45.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We never had a partnership deed—he paid nothing when he came into partnership with me, I swear; nor has he paid me any money during the time he has been in partnership with me—he attended to one branch of the business, I attended to the ammunition and powder part of it—he had accepted some bills; I cannot tell for what amount; it has been going on for years—I have been liable for about £160, I swear—he is an old schoolfellow of mine—I learnt that I was liable for that £160 on 4th November—the arrangements for dissolution were pending before that—there was no money to get for him to purchase his part of the business—I don't call it a purchase; he had more liabilities than assets almost at the time—he asked me to give him three days to get the money—it was to come from Dr. Weber, his father-in-law, he told me—there is such a person, a man of means and position, I dare say—there had been letters between us before 4th November to arrange the terms upon which we were to part—the business was that of acting as agents for firms abroad, and collecting their moneys—the liabilities of the firm to the people abroad on the 1st November I took from, the prisoner's figures—I must go by his figures, because all those figures were his part of the business, and I went by his figures, and have not ascertained at this moment what the amount is—the liabilities were over £1,000 at that time; the nearest figures I can give are £1,500 or £1,600; it may be roughly about £1,500—the assets were merely stock-in-trade and book debts—the stock-in-trade was worth, say, £250, or something—I had the money to discharge my liabilities—I proposed that with regard to taking over his share of the business he should do nothing but pay his share of the liabilities, I paying my share, and he had to pay me the half share of the assets which he took over, which means the stock-in-trade and the book debts—the arrangement proposed to him was not that he should take over the whole of the liabilities; I do not know that—there were no other assets except book debts and stock-in-trade—he was not represented by a solicitor; I took him to mine—he was to hand me half of the amount of the liabilities for the purpose of purchasing his share of the business; we could not make out altogether what he was to pay me, but roughly it was £1,200 or £1,500—that would be half the liabilities and half his share of the assets plus the bills which he had accepted, which came to about £600—I was to be relieved of all responsibility if he took over all the business of Boynter, Kuhn and Co.; but he was to have half the assets—my object was that, as I was primarily liable for the liabilities of the firm, if I sold the business he must give me half the liabilities, so that if I were sued I should be protected, as half would be due from him—if he paid me half the liabilities in cash I had to pay mine at the same time, and I made him a present of the business—he told me he wanted to get the money in three days from his father-in-law—when those deeds had been signed I wrote to my manufacturers telling them that I had dissolved partnership, and that my new office was at Suffolk House—I took new offices—I believe he had arranged</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189204040085"/>
               <p>with the landlord to take those offices—I supposed he was going to carry on business in the name of Kuhn and Co. from the date he purchased—I attended at the office daily, but I was out almost all day, as I had to go over to my new ones—I had a balance-sheet prepared soon after this by our old bookkeeper; I could not say exactly when—the last balance-sheet before 4th November was prepared in 1887—no balance-sheet had been made up after that—Mr. Hodgson prepared a balance-sheet and showed it to me, I think, soon after the 4th November—he did not point out to me that I was taking credit for a sum of £480—I heard him swear that I did tell him to do so; he was perjuring himself—I said to the prisoner that he stole this money which he bad collected—I don't remember if I also told him that it was a criminal offence to accept the bills, but, anyhow, I gave him a piece of my mind—I took him to my solicitor's office on 4th November, and again on 20th November—I did not tell him that I should prosecute him unless he made a statutory declaration; nothing of the kind—I asked him to sign a statutory declaration in order to know my liabilities of the moneys he had stolen and the bills he had accepted—I cannot say exactly if my wife was there on that day—she has been there once or twice—I did not know the prisoner's wife was ill at the time—I don't think I said in the presence of my solicitor that if he did not sign a statutory declaration I should send for a policeman—I cannot remember every word I said; it may be I said I would send for a policeman; I cannot remember it—I did not say if he did not sign it I would send for a policeman; I don't know what I said about a policeman—I did not take him nor go with him to a telegraph office—I did not tell him I would prosecute him if he did not telegraph to his father-in-law for £1,200; I remember now, I wanted to prosecute him then already, and he begged me not to; Mrs. Boynter was there—I did not dictate to him the terms of a telegram to his father-in-law, nothing of the kind—I know of his sending a telegram; I was not with him when he sent it; I stopped at my solicitor's office with my wife, I think—I do not think he came back—I have not said that I made him send a telegram in my own words—when I took him round to the solicitor after the two sums of money had been taken I wanted to know my exact liabilities; he came and said in that declaration that he had embezzled about £187, and there were coming in £500 to £600 of bills that he had accepted, and when that came out said I had had enough of it, I would rather prosecute him; and he begged of me and Mrs. Boynter as well to allow him, he would do the whole matter in three days, his father-in-law would be over here, and he would settle the whole matter, and at last I did not trouble him, and he' went to telegraph over very likely himself—I did not give him the words of the telegram—all this took place on 20th November—I gave him into custody in January, I think, two months afterwards—his father-in-law came over—I did not demand from the father-in-law £1,200; I even refused to see him when he called once at my private house—I did not fix any sum that was demanded—the father-in-law did not say he would, pay any sum that could be found on any balance-sheet to be due from his son-in-law; he said nothing except that he wanted first to see the balance-sheet—he did not, to my remembrance, say that he would pay any liability if the balance-sheet were produced to him; I should not forget that—he came</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189204040086"/>
               <p>because he wanted very likely to settle this matter—he wanted a balance-sheet to decide afterwards, and it was not ready at the time—he did not say he had the money with him and would pay any difference of account between us, nothing of the kind—I did not fix on any sum I wanted, I did not know, myself—I never mentioned any sum—I never demanded any sum—such a sum as £1,200 was never mentioned that I know of, except in this document—the sum that Dr. Weber was to pay was not discussed at the solicitor's office in his presence; it did not get from £1,200 to £650, at least I know nothing of it—Dr. Weber did not say he would refuse to pay anything unless he were satisfied from independent sources and not from me that a sum was due; what he said was that he wanted to see a balance-sheet—he did not say he would leave the money in the hands of Mr. Goldberg, his solicitor, for any person who would prepare a balance-sheet; I got repeated offers, which I refused—I knew Mr. Goldberg was advising Br. Weber in the matter—I do not know that Mr. Goldberg held the money to pay if the matter was gone into, and a proper balance-sheet prepared; I heard afterwards that Mr. Goldberg had forwarded about £400, which he offered repeatedly, and which I did not want to take—I believe I offered Dr. Weber the balance-sheet prepared by Hodgson; was it not at Mr. Osborne's office?—I believe my solicitor has it—Hodgson made it; I did not trust it—I swear there was one; I believe Mr. Osborne has it—Hodgson did not refuse to act in the matter because I insisted on his crediting me with £480 I was not entitled to; to say the least that is an invention of Hodgson's—during this time, after 4th November, I was receiving moneys—on 12th November I received £50 from the North British Rubber Company, paid by Kuhn; he brought the cheque over—I paid it into the bank—at that time I was a customer of Seller and Bellet; they belonged to the ammunition branch—the Rubber Company would be quite a distinct business—I did not send the £50 from the Rubber Company to the ammunition people; I paid another cheque—this is my bank-book, in which is the entry of the £50 from the North British Rubber Company—no notice of the dissolution had been given to any of these people from whom money was received, and they would pay the money to the firm, Boynter, Kuhn and Co.—I think I paid the sum of £50 the same night to Seller and Bellet—when Kuhn gave me the cheque for £50 he said he had been to the North British, and they had paid him a cheque for £50, because he went there several times a day; I was a good customer—that was on 12th November—I don't know if that is a cheque described as a cheque as of the 14th—during this time I saw some of the letters written by the prisoner—I looked at the letter-books—I saw a bill accepted for people abroad; I don't know for how much it was—every month our musical people sent us over a bill for acceptance for goods we had had during the previous month; I wanted the prisoner to keep that business; a word of mine would have been sufficient to deprive him of the whole matter, because he had no capital when he began; but I enjoyed good credit in Germany, my father being a governor in Eastern Prussia; I did not want to harm him, and I did every possible thing to help him into a new life; and I wrote to my manufacturers and moved to Suffolk House; I did not write to his manufacturers, if I had they would have given up the whole thing—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189204040087"/>
               <p>had all these contracts made in Germany, and they traded on my credit alone—that bill became payable, and he put it in the safe; he offered to pay the money in three days; I gave him three or four weeks—I left the bills in the safe, and a few days later I said, "This bill most be accepted; but if you will accept it I shall have to sign Boynter and Co.; I don't mind leaving it for a few days, but it must be done"—he left it for a few days, and next day I saw in the letter, which he wrote in my name to those people, that he said he had torn the bill by mistake and must have another one; and then one morning I was away ill, and when I could not find it I asked where it was, he said, "I sent it away"—I said, "How did you accept it?"—he said, "Boynter, Kuhn and Co."—I said, "How dare you do such a thing"—he always tried to sign Boynter and Kuhn, and I told them they must not look to his signature—that bill has been accepted without my knowledge, behind my back, and with the wrong signature—this is my entry of it in the bill book on 5th November, as a bill payable—I have nothing in my letter-book on 16th November about a sum of £48 15s. 3d. sent to the twine people, because he copied that branch into his letter-book—this is the new letter-book which he started after 2nd Novembers—it says in it that £48 15s. 3d. was sent to the twine people; I did not know it at the time—I gave him a cheque for the £18 15s.—he drew on his own account for £30 and got from me the £18 15s. without my knowledge; he wrote out a cheque for £18 15s. and asked me to sign it; I knew it was going to the Twine Company; he said he wanted to settle the account, and I gave him the cheque and he kept the book in the drawer where it would not easily be detected—I saw the letters left to be copied—I have the fact of £48 15s. 3d. being sent to the twine people; of that I supplied £18 15s.; you can see from the scrawl that the name was meant to deceive those people—he was to trade as F. Kuhn and Co. from 3rd December, and I as Boynter, if he had completed his purchase—in this letter the Kuhn is made almost so that no one can make out what it is meant for—the advantage of altering the signature was because he wanted not to let these people know that we were separated, and to make them believe that he was still the old firm of Boynter, Kuhn and Co.—the old firm still existed, because it was his branch—if he had signed Boynter and Co. they would have wondered why he signed like that, and I wanted to help him—I do not suggest it was fraud; I say he did not sign as usual—he signed Boynter—he knew he had no right to sign Boynter and Co., and Boynter, Kuhn and Co. did not exist any more—in early letters I find the signature Boynter, Kuhn and Co.—he several times tried it on, and I told him—I saw the letter-book and the letters—he did not sign them at all sometimes—the objection to his signing Boynter, Kuhn and Co. was because that firm did not exist—the dissolution of partnership was not advertised—after the 24th November he had no right to sign Boynter, Kuhn and Co. if the purchase had been carried out—we kept the dissolution secret, and it would have been extraordinary not to write in the name of Boynter, Kuhn and Co., but it was strange for him to sign in that way, because he was not a partner—on 17th November he collected £45 from the North British Company—I find an entry of that in my book on 17th, and there is an entry of £30 from Jacobson—Jacobson's cheque was stopped after Kuhn had the money—I had the money from Kuhn, and afterwards the cheque for £30 was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189204040088"/>
               <p>stopped—I had £45 from the Rubber Company and £30 from Jacobson, which the prisoner handed to me, so that I got £75 on that day from him, and I paid it into the bank and got the benefit of it to my credit—before that I had caused Jacobson's cheque for £30, which had been paid to the prisoner, to be stopped, because Kuhn had received from the bank already the £75—he did not get the benefit of the £30 cheque because another cheque came back which he had sent over to those people for £30; that was his own cheque which came back unpaid—he had already had the £30 for Jacobson's cheque—it was stopped by Jacobson at my instance, but the prisoner handed me the whole £75—he produced £75 out of his pocket as the money he had received from the North British Company and Jacobson—although the cheque was crossed he said he was rather in a hurry, and they cashed it for him, so my bankers told me—my principal desire was to help him—I did not send circulars round to people in. Germany, but I did to my customers here, not to pay any one but myself—I took round the statutory declaration and showed it to customers; and sent a circular asking them to pay outstanding money to myself—I wrote round to the manufacturers—a sum of £80 which had been collected in July was due to Rheineker and Jasper on 30th November—I ascertained afterwards that it had been paid—I did not know it when I wrote to them a letter, of which this is a copy; I was away when the money came in, and Mr. Kuhn paid it into the bank, and I knew nothing about it—I found it out as soon as he had given the declaration of the moneys he had stolen; I did not believe it then even, because the sums did not agree—I did not know it was in the book—it is marked in the day-book "P"—I did not look from the day-book to see whether I had had the money—I showed the declaration to perhaps two or three, and perhaps to the North British Company, that was all—I showed it to friends in a friendly way; that did not go on through November, December, and January—I did not charge the prisoner before, because I did it very reluctantly, and only when I found he went round impersonating me among people; till I feared more harm would come of it—I was driven to it after all; that was the effect of it—I did. not instruct my solicitor not to take the £650—I was not informed over and over again that if I would let some person make out a balance-sheet I could have what the difference was; I never heard that—I never heard that Mr. Goldberg had the money—I refused some on Saturday.</p>

I am the son of Sidney Smith, a grocer, of Kirkdale, Sydenham—on the evening of 11th March the prisoner came into the shop and presented this envelope, enclosing a note and a cheque—I read it and said, "I see you want change for this, and I am not sure I have got it"—he said, "Well, I should like you to oblige me if possible, because there is a party on, and a little baccarat"—we have a customer named Craig, but I do not know his writing—I had not got enough, and got it from Mr. Glass, and gave the money to the prisoner, and three bottles of whisky—he then said, "What champagne have you got?"—I showed him the list; he selected a pint bottle, and told me to send a dozen next day to Mr. Craig—I did so, and it was returned the following, week—I endorsed the cheque and gave it to Mr. Glass, and it was returned marked "No account"—I had been to the station the day before and described the man as a man in evening dress, but I did not describe him fully—Frederick Newland, our stableman, was about the premises.</p>

On March 23rd I was with Newland in Balham High Road at 10.30 a.m., he pointed the prisoner out, and I said I was a police officer, and should take him in custody for uttering a cheque on March 11th to Sidney Smith, of Sydenham—he said, "You have made a mistake, I am surprised at your stopping a gentleman in the street like this. I have been in Balham fifteen years. I am just going to pay my taxes; did you say Sydenham? I have not been there for 'three years, I suppose I can go before a Magistrate to-day. Can you tell me what sort of day it was on 11th March?"—I said, "It was snowing"—he said, "That man you have with you belongs to the Powis's, who hare done this"—I took him to the station, and found on him four memoranda, a tax-paper and cheque, five pawn-tickets, one albert, one eraser, one knife, and fourpence. (<hi rend="italic">The cheque was for rates drawn the London and South Western Bank, Balham branch, signed George Motte.</hi>)—I said, "Is this your writing?—he said, "Yes"—I found two cheque-books at his house, one of which was on the London and South-Western Bank, Clapham branch—I compared the letters found on him with the letter asking for the cashing of the cheque, and there is a similarity in the "f' s" and in the "C"in "Conservative club," and told the prisoner that the letters corresponded—I placed him with ten more at the station and told Smith to see if he knew any one there—he looked</p>

I am an accountant, of 46, Darley Road, Croydon—on 22nd February I was at the Horse Repository, at the Elephant and Castle, attending a sale—while there the prisoner Forbes came up to me and asked me for information about the repository—he said he had a horse for sale, and asked mo to go out with him and see the horse—I did so; we went to the side of a public-house—Russell was in charge of the horse—Forbes asked me what I thought of it, and what it would fetch at the sale—I am very little judge of horses; I told him it might fetch £12 to a tradesman; but at a sale £4 would be a good price—we then went back to the repository and met Biggs—Forbes introduced him as his companion—White then came up and said his master wanted to buy the horse; he introduced Bucknell as his master—some words took place between Biggs and Bucknell about the horse, and Biggs refused to sell it to Bucknell, chiefly owing to his dislike of White—after a little talk Bucknell asked me to buy the horse for him and said he had offered £12 for it, and he would pay me for it immediately I handed it over to him—I saw Biggs, and he said the lowest he would take was £12—I only saw the head of the horse, it was covered up; I did not see it moved—I told Bucknell that I could not get him the horse for £12, and he increased his price to £14, and I was to have £2 10s. out of it—I went back to Biggs, and he said he would let me have the horse for £11, as he wanted to get home, and I could make what I liked out of it; he did not intend to sell it to Bucknell, as he had quarrelled with him—I went and told Bucknell that I had bought the horse and paid £3 deposit—he said I must pay for it in full before he gave me the money—I had not sufficient money about me, and I asked Bucknell to give me the difference—he said he was not a money-lender,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189204040101"/>
               <p>and I must find the money myself—I said I could give him a cheque, but he refused to take it—Biggs gave me this receipt for the £3,"February 22nd, 1892, sold one horse for £11 to Mr. Davis. Received £3 on account; balance on demand £8, signed Wood"—Forbes wrote out the. form, and Biggs signed it in the name of Wood—I agreed to meet Bucknell next morning about ten at London Bridge, so that he could see he horse before completing the purchase; the horse was then in charge of Russell, in the mews in Ripley Street—Forbes wrote out the address for Russell, and Russell gave it to me as his address, as he had not a card—next morning I went to the stable and saw Russell and Biggs—I asked Biggs to have the horse out that I might see it; he refused—I went to London Bridge, Bucknell was not there, I waited there about twenty minutes, and then went back to the stable and saw Russell—he took me to a public-house close by—Bucknell and White were there—I asked Bucknell how it was I had not seen him at London Bridge—he said he had been there waiting for me—I asked him if he was really going to buy the horse, or if he was only playing with me—he gave me his word it was his intention to take the horse when I handed it over to him—I then left the public-house, and Bucknell and White followed me to the stable, and I asked Bucknell to take the horse and pay the money—he said that would not do, I must pay it, and then he would take it—Forbes then made out a second receipt, and Biggs signed it in the name of J. Wood—this is it: "Sold to Davis a bay mare for £11, warranted, quiet in harness and sound in wind and limb"—I showed the receipt to Bucknell, and told him I had purchased the horse, and asked him to come with me to the stable, and take it and pay me the money—I had paid the £8 in postal orders—I counted it out to Russell, and Biggs took it—we went to the stable, and Biggs told me to go and bring the horse out—Russell said he must take orders from Biggs—at last I brought it out and offered it to Bucknell—he refused to take it, and said I must make him out a receipt for the money before he paid it—I offered to do it with a pencil—he said it must be in ink—I had hold of the horse, and asked him to take it—he refused—I asked Russell to hold it—he said he would go to the public-house and et ink for me to make out the receipt, and I could put the horse in the stable and make it out there—I took it to the stable-yard, but Russell refused to take it, and when I brought it out again I saw Bucknell and the others running away—I asked Russell what he would keep the horse for, and also asked him the names and addresses of the others—he said he did net want to keep the horse, and he did not know them; that he had the. horse there for me—Forbes and Biggs walked back with me and White to the stable, but they waited outside, and they disappeared while I was arguing with Bucknell and White—Russell walked with me to the New Kent Road; on the way he offered to buy the horse of me; I asked what he would give me; I am not sure whether it was thirty shillings or £2, and then he offered me a pony in the stable; I saw it, and afterwards I saw that it had a blind eye, and a scar on the near fore-leg a little above the knee—I left the horse at the repository, and went to the Lambeth Police-court; from there I went to the Hackney Road Police-station, and on my way I met the prisoners in custody—I have since received from the police these four postal orders for two shillings, four shillings and sevenpence, seven shillings, and five shillings; they form part of those I</p>

               <p>had given to Biggs in part payment of the £8—when Bucknell agreed to meet me at London Bridge he gave me his address, which I wrote down, "H. Smith, James Street, Paddington"—on 1st March I went to the stable in Ripley Mews with Sergeant Brogden and Mr. Dossett, and there I saw the one-eyed pony and two others—in all my dealings with the prisoners I believed it was a <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> transaction, and it was under that belief that I parted with my money.</p>

I live at 64, Southwark Park Road—I am a collector to the Royal London Friendly Society—it is &amp; duly registered friendly society—I produce a certified copy of the rules registered in the office of the Registrar of Friendly Societies—I know Luckins—on 11th May last I went to her house, 41, Neckinger Street—I said I was a collector in the Royal London Friendly Society, and asked if she had anyone to insure—she said she would insure William Alford for a penny a week—she said she was the mother of the child—the child was brought forward—he appeared to be about seven years of age—£4 10s. would be secured by the payment of 1d. per week—if the child died within six or seven months of the policy being taken out the £4 10s. would be payable—I accepted the proposal, and a policy was issued—I called at the house and received the weekly payments—I knew her as Mrs. Luckins—I thought she had been married a second time, and that this was a child by toe first marriage—on 14th November last I called on her for the subscription—she said there was a mistake in the policy, that the name should be Ephraim instead of William—I asked her for the policy—she said she could not find it—I called again</p>

               <p>on Monday, the 16th—I did not see the child—she repeated that the name should be Ephraim—I compared the policy with my book, and they both contained the name of William—she wanted me to alter the name in the policy—I said I could not do that; she must go to the office and explain the case—she said William was dead—I made a report to the office—on 18th November I went to the house again with Superintendent Duffell; that was after I had seen a Mrs. Wicks—Mr. Duffell said, "I have called with reference to a claim that has been made with reference to Ephraim Alford; have you any child of the name of William?"—she said no—she also said she was not the mother of the child, but his aunt—on that same day we saw Mrs. Alford—Mr. Duffell said he had called with reference to a claim that had been made for Ephraim Alford, and asked, "Is there any William in the family?"—she said, "No"—Mr. Duffell asked her if she knew of a child in Mrs. Luckins' family of the name of William, aged between six and seven—she said there was a child about that age—I do not know that the name of Mrs. Wicks was mentioned—I did not see either of the prisoners again till the 14th February, when I went to Mrs. Luckins' house with Mr. Atherton, one of the managers of the Society—he said to her, "I have called in reference to a claim made for Ephraim Alford at our office; is William alive?"—she said, "Yes"—we then went round to Mrs. Alford, and Mr. Atherton asked the same question, "Is William alive?" and she pointed William out—on or about the 12th December Mrs. Luckins came to me and offered me ten shillings if I got the money all right—that was after she told me she was the aunt and not the mother of the child.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the superintendents of the Royal London Friendly Society—on 17th November last I received instructions to inquire into the policy of William Alford, and on the 18th I went to 18, Woods Place, Grange Road, and there saw "Mrs. Alford; I had previously paid a visit to Mrs. Wicks; I told Mrs. Alford that I had received a communication from the chief office of our society, and as the claim was not satisfactory I was to make inquiries, and having read through the particulars supplied to me, I asked her whether she had a child living of the name she had insured, William Alford—she said no, she had not a child of that name, and it was simply a mistake in the policy—I said, "Have you got a William at all in the family, or connected with the family?"—she said, "No, there was a William about 27 or 17"—I said, "Nothing like a child of that age?"—she said, "No, we have not a William living now, we never had a William of that age in our immediate family"—I told her I had called on Mrs. Wicks, and also told her what she had said—I said to Mrs. Wicks, "I wish, if you can, to tell me the address of Mrs. Alford; I wish to see her respecting her claim made on the Royal London Friendly Society, I believe you are related to her, I think?"she said, "Yes"—I said, "Do you know if there is a little child living by the name of William in the family?"she said, "Yes, there is"—I said, "How old do you think?"she said, "I could not tell you the age"—she seemed to have some motive in keeping the age from me; I had to suggest all sorts of ages, five or six, and she said, "Yes, about six"—I forget exactly the age, but I put it in my report, I put this conversation in my report; I repeated this to Mrs. Alford—she said, "Mrs. Wicks is a very bad wicked woman, I cannot understand why she should make such a statement as that, because there is no truth in it whatever"—after that interview with Mrs. Alford I went to Mrs. Luckins, and had the same kind of conversation, bearing on the same thing; I also told her what Mrs. Wicks had said—she said it was wrong, that Mrs. Wicks had no right to say such a thing, and she had insured the child in the name of William because she had a William herself and lost him; and Mrs. Alford told her, when she was carrying a child, if it was born it should be named William; the child was born, and she thought it was named William, but it was christened Ephraim unknown to her, that the mother had deceived her—I asked her if there was a William living now—she said no, there was no child of that name living—I went again to Mrs. Luckins' house somewhere about the 13th February, and had a conversation with her about the matter; the office did not intend taking proceedings, and I have no note of the date; she told me she was very sorry for what she had done, and she was dragged into it by other women; she was helped on in the matter by those other</p>
