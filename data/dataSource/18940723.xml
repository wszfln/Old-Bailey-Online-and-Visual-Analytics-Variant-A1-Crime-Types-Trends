Frost and Co., 73, in the Central Meat Market—he went up by train from Leytonstone—the prisoner knew where my husband worked—the prisoner was employed as a porter in the Meat Market—my husband was a meat salesman—I went to Holloway and saw the prisoner after receiving from him this letter; it is in his handwriting.

I said, 'I shan't go before you go,' and he says all right, and he went in the shop, and I don't remember seeing Alf since. We was on the best of terms when he was speaking to me. I had no animosity against Alf in the least. Two can visit me any day in the week except Sunday. You can show this to all. I shall be glad if you can cheer up and write, if it is only two or three lines. Give my very best love to the children and yourself.—I remain, your unfortunate brother, <hi rend="smallCaps">WALTER</hi>. Remember me to all. I shall write to George and Sarah")—they are my brother and his wife—I went and saw him—I</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "H.M. Prison, Holloway, 12th July, 1894. My dear Sister,—I was so pleased to see you last Tuesday. I was sorry that Amelia (my sister) could not come in. I am sure I thank you very much for what you have done; I often think as I am sitting alone how nice and comfortable I was at your place, just the same as being at home, and how well both of you looked after my welfare, and then a gloom to come all at once like this. It very near breaks my heart to think of it, as I was so improving both in health and in strength. I can't explain my feelings enough, the kindness which was shown to me whilst I was staying with you both by yourself and my brother Alf. Dear sister, I hope and trust you will get all right again; it is a lot of trouble to be both on your hands and mind. Give my very best love to the children. I wrote to Alice yesterday to answer her letter; I told her the date of my trial, the 23rd of this month. I told her you was here to see me on Tuesday; I must conclude now with my very best love to you, from your unfortunate brother, <hi rend="smallCaps">WALTER</hi>. Give my love to your mother and all"—I went again last Saturday and saw him; he appeared very well then, to my idea—I did not see any difference in him from what he was when sober—it was on a Friday night in Sep<lb/>tember, about half-past ten, when he attempted to cut his throat—he was then living with us; he put the knife across his throat; he did not cut himself; I took the knife from him—he was very intoxicated indeed at that time; it was later on the same evening that he tried to kill himself by putting his head down the w.c.; he deliberately went through the kitchen, and did it directly after I took the knife from him; he was still very drunk—I went and took hold of him, and pulled him through into the back parlour—after that he went to bed—he was then so drunk as not to know what he was doing.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 8a, Manchester Square—I am an M.D., a Fellow of the Royal Society and the College of Physicians, and surgeon to the Hospital for the Paralytic and Epileptic—I have made a study of insanity, especially the branch which deals with epilepsy—in consequence of a communication from the Treasury solicitor I examined the prisoner at Holloway Prison on the 18th and 21st June—I have been frequently employed by the Treasury for a similar purpose—I had the depositions in the case before me, and I had also seen Dr. Walker and had a conference with him, and I have come to the conclusion that the prisoner is now quite of sound mind—I found no evidence of brain disease—I could find no history of epilepsy in him; nor did he give me any history of epilepsy in the family—I did not make any official report to the Treasury—I formed an opinion, and communicated that opinion to the Treasury—there is a well-known form of insanity known as impulsive insanity—a person may be absolutely sane upon a subject, except when homicidal mania comes on him; that is a well-known acknowledged form—it is generally of very short duration—assuming that the prisoner was not intoxicated at the time, that there was an insufficient motive, and that he was in his ordinary state of mind at the time, all the probabilities seem to me to be in favour of some temporary mental aberration—in their ordinary condition homicidal mania does not reveal itself—I should not attach much importance to reserve or sullenness; if a man has been sub<lb/>ject to epileptic fits, that would be a matter of very great importance—having regard to there being epilepsy in the family, that decidedly tends to strengthen the opinion I had previously formed—there are three things especially to which I attach importance: first, that he should do this act in the day, and in the place, when he might well have done it elsewhere;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189407230019"/>
               <p>secondly, that after he had done it he should be perfectly silent and quiet, and not excited; and thirdly, the utter improbability that a man of no education should allege as a justification that he had no recollection of what he had done—my reason for this thirdly is that I think it is characteristic of these cases of impulsive acts following epilepsy, that is, the absence of memory of the deeds that have been performed under these circumstances—I have met with many such cases—the time at which loss of memory occurs varies; it might be a few minutes or a longer period—I have had considerable opportunities of judging of the demeanour of persons, whether they are wilfully concealing or shamming—the prisoner's manner was certainly such as to make me think that he was really speaking the truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> As far as I could gather, he was of perfectly sound mind when I saw him at Holloway—he was perfectly calm and collected, and there was nothing at all remarkable, either about his appearance or manner—he had a mild sort of manner—there was no evidence of insanity—I had seen the second letter written to Mrs. Alfred Carter; the other I saw at my second interview—I spoke to the prisoner about it and he recollected that perfectly—his remark to me was that he recollected nothing after that act, or a short time after it—he said he had no recol<lb/>lection of the sharpening of the knife, as reported to me, that was the time his memory began to fail—I speak from his statement to me and to others—his statements were uniform with regard to that—of course I am dependent upon his statements—the loss of recollection is one of the three things I have spoken of—at the time he made that statement he was, as far I could ascertain, of perfectly sound mind and understanding—he seemed scarcely to realise that he would have to take his trial for murder—I never put it to him in that way—I imagine he was able to appreciate that he was about to take his trial for murder—in the letter of 12th July he speaks of the date of 23rd July, when he would come up for trial—of course he knew at that time all about it—the three reasons I have given cannot be separated, or dealt with separately; it is the grouping of them that is important—the non-recollection is important, not simply with reference to this case, but from my knowledge of previous cases—I attach great importance to that certainly—if in a diseased state heavy drinking would pre-dispose him to epilepsy—I could ascertain no history of epilepsy as far as regards himself; if there had been, it would have been a considerable guide to me in forming my opinion as to whether this had been epileptic insanity—I do not know that he had or had not fits of any kind—he did not tell me of fits in the family—there was no attempt to exonerate himself as far as I could see—I have known many men have fits after drunken bouts without any previous epileptic fits.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There is no motive in my mind why I should give a false opinion on this matter—I am absolutely colourless; I come as a friend of the Court—no hint was ever given to me as to what opinion I should form; I formed my opinion from the facts.</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical officer at Her Majesty's Prison, Holloway—the prisoner has been under my care whilst in the prison and in the infirmary—I examined him on several occasions, and I formed a certain opinion, which I communicated to the Treasury in the form of a report—it was an opinion as to his responsibility at the date</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189407230020"/>
               <p>when this crime was committed—Dr. Bastian was called in, independently of my opinion—he is looked upon as the highest authority upon insanity—I have made some memoranda in a note-book as to the result of my investigation, and I have set out eleven reasons as the basis of my opinion—the first is the absence of any rational motive; also assuming the absence of intoxication, that the deed was done at full noonday in the presence of four or five witnesses; I think that shows that the man was irre<lb/>sponsible at the time, although it is not actual proof—I agree with what Dr. Bastian has said with regard to impulsive homicidal mania—I also agree with him as to the absence of recollection of what was actually done after the impulse had subsided, although there might be a vivid recollection of all that preceded and subsequently occurred—I have had considerable experience in judging of the demeanour of prisoners under my care—in speaking of having no recollection of what had occurred, he certainly had all the appearance of speaking the truth; that would strengthen and assist the opinion I had formed—epileptic fits in the family would considerably strengthen my opinion, that he was suffering from what is known as masked epilepsy, that he was insane—I did not know of that when I made my report—masked epilepsy is a disease in which the fact of epilepsy is replaced by an impulse to do some outrageous homicidal act; there is no outward sign, there is no convulsion, or apparent loss of consciousness, the patient does not fall down—it is well known in medical science that cases of that kind occur; they are not very frequent, they are rare—I have heard of the case of Miss Lamb, a sister of Charles Lamb—the state<lb/>ment found on the mantelpiece seems to me a statement of a man labouring under some mental derangement at the time, rather than the statement of a drunken man—the friendship existing between the prisoner and the deceased certainly influences my opinion to a certain extent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have heard it stated in the evidence that the prisoner was under the influence of liquor at the time he wrote this memorandum; one of my reasons for the opinion I formed is that he had no recollection of this matter; that is not the strongest reason; there is the entire absence of an adequate motive; anger is a motive—as to his having no recollection, that entirely depends upon the prisoner's own statement; another thing is the evidence of epilepsy in the family—I heard of that two days ago, and his mental depression, and previous attempts at suicide—all these things assist me in my opinion that this is a case of impulsive homicidal mania, from masked epilepsy—a man suffering from masked epilepsy may do impulsive acts, which are acts of madness—masked epilepsy and impulsive mania are the same thing—I do not say that every case of impulsive homicidal mania is a case of masked epilepsy—masked epilepsy is epilepsy without any of the ordinary accompani<lb/>ments by which epilepsy is known; it would not have the ordinary epileptic attacks of convulsion or falling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The symptoms of masked epilepsy differ from those of ordinary epilepsy—I do not think a man would have any intelligible motive for killing his brother, unless he was insane, or a very great criminal, especially with such antecedents as the prisoner's.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective E</hi>). On 14th June the prosecutor made a complaint to me, in consequence of which I went to 34, Exeter Street, Strand, about 9.30 p.m.—I went into the first floor front room of No. 34, with the prosecutor—I did not see anyone there, nor did I find anything—I went again the next day; no one was in occupation so far as I could see—I pushed open the door with my shoulder—next day I went again; the prosecutor was not with me then—there are two rooms on the floor connected by a half-glass door—on the 15th, while I was there the prisoners came in—I said, "I am a sergeant of police, and shall take you both into custody for being concerned with another woman in stealing £95 in Bank of England notes from a gentle<lb/>man's coat pocket in this room about nine o'clock last night"—the man dropped his head and said nothing—the woman said, "I never saw a gentleman"—I said, "You did; you were in the back room; another woman brought him into this room, and you were both seen to hurriedly leave the house a few minutes after the other woman and the man had left"—Schneider said, "Well, we did not have all the notes; the other woman had some"—I took them to the Bow Street Station, and repeated in the</p>

We did leave the house as you say, and if we are kept here we shall have to put up with it"—Schmidt said, "Ah, if you know, that is all right"—I found on Schneider £12 10s. in gold and £1 18s. silver and a cloth cap—I said, "This is some of the money, I suppose?"—he said, "Yes, it is, I am sorry to say; we changed some of them"—on Schmidt we found 5s. 6d. silver and 4 1/2d. bronze—later on they were charged, and Schneider said noth<lb/>ing; Schmidt said, "We were not under the bed when it was done"—I had not said anything about their being under the bed—after I had searched Schneider's coat and vest, he said, "You will find some; half a minute"—and he brought out this purse with the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoners are Germans; they understand English perfectly—I had made inquiries—I knew they must have been in the back room; there was now here else for them to be—there are eight rooms in the house—I made the statement to them on my own authority—there is no one to prove they were in the back room—Schneider did not say when I asked him if he had any money, "Yes, I have money, but not stolen money"—I have not taken other people to the station to try and identify the prisoners—I did not tear Schmidt's dresses in the cupboard to try and find money—I left everything in good order, and her brother in charge—I don't know if someone else tore up the dresses—I did not caution the prisoners; I told them who I was—I did not want them to make admissions or contradictions—I never told Lewis that the man to be identified was a short man.</p>

There are two doors to the room, one from the landing and one from the other room—the door from the landing is on the left-hand side of the bed, quite close to the back of the bed—the room was bedroom and sitting-room combined—all the other people in the house were working people—I don't think a person could come through the door from the other room without a person on the bed seeing him, but if a person came through the door from the passage he would not be seen—through the glass door you can see what is going on on the bed—there was a curtain over the glass, but it left a little portion of the glass clear, through which you could see.</p>

I was present at Bow Street when these prisoners were charged by Hailstone—I heard what was said, and made a note of it, and I directed the sergeant to make one at the time, so that we both made independent notes—this is my note: "The prisoners were brought to Bow Street by Sergeant Hailstone, who told them they would be charged with another woman, not in custody, in stealing from a gentleman £95 in Bank of England notes at about nine o'clock on the 14th inst., at 34, Exeter Street"—the sergeant said, "You were both seen to leave the house hurriedly about a minute after the gentleman and the woman who had brought him there had left, and Schneider, you were actually seen putting your coat on when going down the street"—he said, "Yes, I am very sorry; it is true.

I keep a restaurant at 167, Shaftesbury Avenue, and lived there with my wife and four children, three boys and a girl—there is a door leading into the restaurant from the street; also a side door leading to the staircase and upstairs—there are two bedrooms on the first floor and two on the second floor, and two on the top floor—I and my wife occupied the bedroom on the first floor front—the two prisoners, Paul and Susannah Koczula, were in my service for nine months as waiter and general servant—they are married—here is a photograph of my wife; she was a tall, healthy, strong woman—she was in the habit of keeping the key of the wardrobe in our bedroom in her dress pocket—in that wardrobe we were in the habit of keeping money and valuables—my wife kept the key on a ring with others—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the ring,</p>

               <p>with the key of the wardrobe on it—I have known Schmerfeld six or seven years—for three months he took his meals at our restaurant, from September till, I believe, Christmas last—he owed me £3 or £4, I can't exactly say—there was one box belonging to him on the premises—he brought it with him the week after he came to England, in September or October last—I knew him in Germany—he took the box away about a fortnight before the murder—he told me he was going to take it away because he was going into a place again, and he asked me whether I would let him have the box on payment of a pound—I said, "Yes"—he did not pay it; he came next morning and offered me 10s., and asked whether I would let him have the box—I said, "Yes, you had better take the box away at once"—he said, "Not now, I will fetch it to-morrow," and he did—it was a large wooden box—this is it (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—it was then brown, it has been fresh coloured since—he did not tell me what he was taking in it; I did not actually see it go out of the house; my wife and I were still in bed when he took it away—Koczula helped him to take it out—the Koczulas had two baskets, with a lock, which they kept in the front kitchen below—I saw those baskets when they came to the house; they were full—prior to Friday, May 25th, I had no notice that the Koczulas were going to leave—on that Friday evening I was at home up to a little before eight—a customer named Fritz Klung and Schmerfeld were on the premises—I played cards with my friend Klung—he was in the habit of going to his club on Friday night; that was the reason he ceased playing—the club was in Dean Street, Soho, not far off—we had not many customers on a Friday night; Klung was generally the only one there—when Klung left Schmerfeld said, "Will you go with me for a walk to Hyde Park?"—I had been out with him for a walk of an evening before that, but not so far as Hyde Park, only in the neighbourhood—when we started my wife was in the bedroom asleep—she was in the habit of going to lie down of an evening, generally from about seven till about nine, and then my daughter Clara used to go and wake her up—I believe all the children were in the house when I left; nobody else, but the two Koczulas—we were out two hours and a half—I returned at half-past ten, a few minutes before or after—Schmer<lb/>feld returned with me—we were in two public-houses on the road, but not in one near my house, although he proposed to come into one which was near my house, at the corner of Frith Street and Shaftesbury Avenue—when we got home we went in at the restaurant door from the street; I cannot swear that the side door was open at that time, but I believe it was closed—I found the three eldest children in the shop—I asked them, "Where is mamma?" and in con<lb/>sequence of what they said I went upstairs—the bedroom door was quite open—I believe there were two lamps alight in the room, but I can't remember particularly—I can't say whether they were lighted before I went out, but the lamps did not belong to that room—one of them used to hang at the side of the wall in the passage, the other came from a room upstairs—the first thing I saw on entering the room was that all the drawers containing linen and other things were on the floor; the drawers of the wardrobe were also taken out—I first called for my wife—I did not know where she was; I received no answer—I went towards the place where the drawer was containing the money and jewellery, and I</p>

               <p>saw it had gone—I then ran downstairs, crying out, "I have been robbed"—I saw Schmerfeld in the restaurant, and he went back with me upstairs, and I then found my wife's body on the floor—the feather bed was on the ground—I am not sure whether it was not Schmerfeld that said to me, "Here is something lying"—I immediately went towards it; I removed something, and then I saw my wife; she was dead—there were sheets, pillows and bolsters on the floor; they were on the body—the mattress alone remained on the bed—Schmerfeld was there at the time I saw the body of my wife; I can't say what he did—I did not see him again that night, not till next morning, when I went to Charlotte Street with the police—I ran out of the house, and cried "Murder!"—the police came into the house directly I ran out—I did not look to see whether either of the Koczulas were there—they slept in the first floor back, the room at the back of ours—I cannot remember whether their door was open or not—I saw nothing of them after I returned that night—Schmerfeld did not tell me at any time that the Koczulas were going to leave—I cannot say exactly how much money I missed; I believe about £50—also a diamond ring, four other rings, three gold watches, a silver watch, two silver brooches, a garnet brooch, and garnets, and a lady's silver chain, a cigarette case, a lady's locket, a gentleman's locket, another chain, a necklet and garnets—I have since seen a lady's watch, the cover of the silver cigarette case, and a gold watch—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the upper part of the cigarette case; it has been broken at the back; it was in a perfect state—I noticed afterwards in examining the room a pair of diamond earrings on the floor underneath the wardrobe—they had been kept in the ward-robe—they must have rolled out when the paper and other things were taken out—I saw the cord which had been tied round my wife's legs, and also some cord that was lying on the floor in the room, a short distance from the bed—no such cord was in the bedroom when I left the house that night—there was some cord in the back cellar similar to that which was found on the floor—that is not the same cellar in which the Koczulas' baskets were kept; they were in the front cellar—I afterwards went with the police into the cellar where the cord had been, and saw that some rope had been newly cut which corresponded with that found on the floor of the bedroom—I was present when these keys were found by the police in the dustbin of my premises—I noticed a silk handkerchief that was round my wife's neck; she was in the habit of wearing it when lying down—I was present when the police made an examination of Koczula's baskets in the cellar; they were locked—the police cut them open, and found in them only a few old things of no value—I have recently known a woman with whom Schmerfeld had been living; her Christian name is Eleanor—I had seen her shortly before the Friday—I saw her in the house on the Thursday, the day before, she slept in the house, but the last time I saw her was when we were on the way home from our walk on the Friday night; we met her—on the Friday morning my wife came to my bed and showed me a £10 note, and I saw her take some money to give change for it, and she put the note into the drawer which usually contained the jewellery and money—that note was gone on the Friday night—I did not see Helena at the house on the Friday morning, nor Schmerfeld—I don't believe I saw Schmerfeld at all on the Friday till</p>

The washing-stand was combined with a chest of drawers—two of the drawers of the wardrobe were taken out, and also three of the drawers of the washstand, and the remainder from the chest, nine in all—the door between our room and the Koczulas' was usually locked, and the bed stood in front of it, so that nobody could enter—I don't know where the key of that door was kept, I did not see it; the door opened towards our room—the street door was generally shut, but if any lodgers were in the house my wife put a padlock to it in the evening—when there were no guests in the house it was simply shut, sometimes it was open—when it was shut it was latched, an ordinary latch, which shut with a spring—there was no handle on the outside.</p>

There is a door leading from the street upstairs, that does not communicate with the restaurant—people could come in at that door without being seen from the restaurant—they could not go upstairs without being observed, because the other doors were open—the passage has only a thin wooden partition—there is a full view of the staircase—the two doors were always open, for conveni<lb/>ence sake—there is a window half up the stairs, looking into the yard—if anything was thrown out of that window it would not go into the dust<lb/>bin, because there is a cover to it and a cistern above it, which was not in use—the dustbin is altogether covered by the cistern—I have been three years at 167—my house is conducted as respectably as the Hotel Metropole—I do not know the man Kewpf—the Koczulas have been in my</p>

I had known the Koczulas during the whole time they were in Mr. Rasch's employment—I had always considered them kind and respectable persons—they have sometimes conversed with me and my wife as neighbours—I was in the habit of seeing them daily—I have seen them outside for a few minutes, but not so long as this—they only told me once that they were going to leave—they once said they were going to America; that was a long time before—I said before the Magistrate, "The Koczulas had several times before the 25th May said they were going to leave Mr. Rasch's; I mean Susannah had told me she was going to leave"—she said, "We are going to leave"—after her confinement she said they were going to leave, and go to America—she was confined in January, while in Mr. Rasch's employment—there was nothing particular to attract my attention in seeing them walking up and down outside the premises; they were as usual, it did not strike me; I went away directly—Mrs. Koczula had no conversation with me about a robbery that had taken place at 177—she never spoke to me about a robbery—a burglary did take place at 177—there was no burglary: there had been several robberies at 177—</p>

Are you going mad?"—he said, "You will hear something to-morrow," and he went away again—he spoke in German—after that I saw him going up and down again, but I did not take much notice of him—I did not see him leave the premises.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189407230042"/>
               <p>I then saw—she was lying on the floor on her back by the side of the bed, about eighteen inches from it—her legs were semi-flexed; her ankles were tied together very tightly by one piece of cord somewhat more loosely by the other, the tight piece being above—there were extensive abrasions about the face; the right nostril was blackened; the whole nose was somewhat pushed over towards the left—the internal surface of the lips was bruised, slightly lacerated; the gums in front of the incisor teeth were also bruised—there was what appeared to be a thumb and finger mark on the neck, the thumb mark on the right and the finger mark on the other side, as though a hand had been held across the neck in front, and those little marks were curved like nail marks—the left hand had some small abrasions, not scratches; they were minute abrasions—the skin was cut very slightly; they were very minute, just above the knuckles—the body was still warm; death rigidity had not set in—I made the examination at twenty minutes to eleven—in my opinion she had been dead very probably about an hour or a little longer—the room was in great disorder at the time—the body was lying on the floor, the head towards the grate, about three inches away, in an opposite direction to the pillows—the head of the bed was towards the door—I formed the opinion that death had been caused by suffocation—I saw no bed clothing on the body when I went into the room—it had been taken away—I saw it afterwards—I was shown a bedgown, two pillow cases, one towel, one white silk handkerchief, and a pair of ladies' drawers; they were all blood stained; the white silk handkerchief was tied loosely round the throat—there was no blood from the ears; there was from the nostrils—that is usual in cases of suffocation—there was no more blood in this case than I should expect to find in a case of suffocation—I should expect only such as would enable the assailants to get away bloodless; there was no wound of any magnitude; the pressure over the mouth and nose would prevent the escape of any blood—my attention was afterwards directed to the mattress; I do not quite recollect whether it remained on the bed—I have no note of any fresh stains of blood upon it; I did not notice it—on Sunday, the 27th, I made a post-mortem examination, and I then saw all I have described on the body—there was an abrasion on the bridge of the nose—the left side of the heart was contracted and empty, the right side was full of dark fluid blood; that is an indication of death by suffocation—the heart itself was perfectly healthy—the vessels of the brain were congested with dark blood, another indication of death by suffocation—in my opinion death was caused by pressure of the hand on the mouth and nose—there was no bruising about the neck; no such injury to the larynx as would cause death—a deeper dissection did not show bruising of the larynx—the marks of the thumb and finger showed that the throat had been grasped and held—the abrasions about the face and hands indicated that there had been a tremendous struggle, and that she had made a forcible resistance; in order to overcome that resistance there must have been very considerable pressure—I should think it was quite consistent with the evidence that one person should have smothered her, whilst another tied her feet—to the best of my opinion the cord was tied round the ankles in the tight condition in which I found it during the woman's life; I made an incision beneath, and the extravasation was complete—on 29th May, about half-past seven in the morning, I saw</p>

               <p>Schmerfeld, and made an examination of his left forearm; I found on it two wounds that had been dressed, one a little above the wrist, the other a little below the elbow, and between those two another wound—the three were about three-quarters of an inch in length and across the arm—I also examined the right forearm and found a wound across it—they were such wounds as would be inflicted by a razor, not likely to have been accidentally, but intentionally inflicted, and possibly self-inflicted.</p>

There was not much to guide one in forming an opinion whether one person alone could have murdered this woman—I think if the cord could have been tied without waking her, then one person might have murdered her—from the position of the body I think the struggle probably took place on the bed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I say that judging from the position of the marks, the bed was against the wall—I should say it was a right hand that held the neck—there was nothing to prevent her getting off the bed unassisted as far as the legs were concerned; I can't see why she could not have got off the bed; she could not have walked.</p>

I do not think what I saw was consistent with the pillow or bolster being used; they would be too soft to produce such ex<lb/>tensive abrasion; it is clear that the hand must have been used to the neck; that was not the actual cause of suffocation; the skin was literally abraded all over the face; I don't think a pillow could have done that.</p>

The commission of such an act would occupy a very few minutes—I think it would be possible to tie the legs without waking her or enabling her to make an alarm, if rapidly and skillfully done—there were great abrasions on the face; the skin was moved all over the face, and a great deal of skin was rubbed off, as if she was struggling against the force used against her—she was bruised just about the throat, but I am unable to say whether that discolouration was post-mortem or not; the tissue was evidently bruised—there was no indication of a gag; I saw nothing of the kind—the cord on the ankle was tied in the very best kind of knot, a reef knot.</p>

               <p>I went out with Mr. Rasch last night; we went for a walk to Hyde Park; we returned about 10.30 p.m.; when we came into the shop the children were there. Mr. Rasch asked the children, 'Where is mamma?' The oldest boy said, 'Mamma is asleep.' Mr. Rasch went upstairs and had a look; he came down and said, 'Everything is upset, just come up and have a look.' I came up with Mr. Rasch; Mr. Rasch lifted up a cloth and said, 'There is my wife lying'; I had just a look at her face and Mr. Rasch screamed and went down; I ran down and holloaed out and ran for police towards Oxford Street; I turned to the left; I went to the corner of Shaftesbury Avenue, a clothing shop, and came back again. When I came back I saw a policeman there and a crowd of people. I did not see a policeman when I first went out. Afterwards I went towards Regent Street, telling people what had happened. I told some men and some women; I do not know their proper names. I walked about. I was beside myself. I did not like to hear Mr. Rasch and the children crying. I was in the Leicester from 12 to 12.30 a.m. I went home when I came out of the Leicester, to bed. I knew Mr. Rasch's servants as long as they were in the house. They said they came from Cologne. I have not seen any letters from their friends. I live at 89, Charlotte Street. I am living with a party named Kempf on the third floor. It is a woman. Both servants (Koczulas) visited me at Charlotte Street. I saw them last Wednesday dinner-time. They were sitting at the table eating. I have not seen them since. I had no idea where they have gone. I do not know if they have a box. I have seen no box belonging to them. I stopped with Mr. Rasch when he came here; I have been in Charlotte Street since February. In February when I left Mr. Rasch, the two servants were still there. I had a box of clothing, which I left with Mr. Rasch as I could not pay. I took it away about three weeks ago, and cook it to Charlotte Street. It is not there now; it does not belong to me now; I sold it. I sold the box to a seafaring man; I sold it in Charlotte Street two days after I took it away. I came to know that the seafaring man wanted a box, in a beerhouse in the neighbourhood. I am a waiter, but doing no business now. I have not heard the servants say they were going away; they visited the woman Kempf. I am not living with her. I occupy the front room on the third floor, and pay 4s. rent a week for it. The woman Kempf occupies three rooms on that floor, and she supplies me with food. After I left Mr. Rasch's house I spoke to Rudolph, who lives at Goldstein's, furniture dealer, New Compton Street. I spoke to a woman named Visole, who lives at Goldstein's also. I said, 'They robbed Rasch.' I said, 'Mrs. Rasch was lying on the floor.' I did not know what was the matter. Mr. Rasch and I went to several public-houses. I paid for drink, and Mr. Rasch paid for some. Mr. Rasch paid for the last drink we had at the Swallow public-house"—Having made that statement Schmerfeld was permitted to go—he was retaken on the 29th May, when I charged him with being concerned in the murder—he spoke English very well—the charge having been read over to him he said, "I know nothing about this charge at all."</p>

I am an Inspector of the Thames Police—about 2.20 a.m. on 29th May I saw Schmerfeld at a part of the river called Ratcliffe Cross, crouched behind a pile on the shore—I asked him what he was doing there—he replied, "I want to get on that ship"—two vessels were lying in the stream—I asked him what he wanted to go on board for—he replied, "I want to get to Holland"—I said, "This is not a proper time in the morning to come down to get on board of a ship to go to Holland; what are you?"—he said, "I am a German waiter"—in my printed infor<lb/>mation I had a description of him, and said, "Show me your wrist"—he showed me his wrist and I saw he had a bandage on it—I said, "What is the matter with your wrist?"—he said, "I cut it with a piece of glass"—I said, "I shall arrest you and take you to Wapping Police-station"—at the police-station I asked him where was his stick—he was supposed to have been carrying a crook-handled stick—that was part of my informa<lb/>tion—he replied, "At the house"—I said, "What house?"—he said, "Mr. Kempf's"—I said, "Where is Mr. Kempf?"—he said, "I don't know, I have not seen him since last Friday week"—that was the Friday pre<lb/>ceding the murder, the 18th—I searched him—he had no money.</p>

On Saturday, 26th May, I received from the landlord or agent of the house this key of No. 89, Charlotte Street (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—Mr. Maitre is the landlord or agent—I have since found the key belongs to the front door of No. 4, York Street, Commercial Road—I showed the key to Schmerfeld on Saturday, 26th May, after he had been discharged—he said, "It is not my property; I have never seen it before in my life"—I told him it had been found in a recess on the stairs at 89, Charlotte Street—he said, "I know I shall be blamed for this, but I am innocent; I went for a walk with Rasch, and when I got back to Shaftesbury Avenue I heard the children crying, and I was frightened; I ran away; I went to Oxford Street and then back to the Leicester public-house" (that is at Leicester Square, the corner of Wardour Street); "I went back home and stayed there until the police came and fetched me"—this was at 89, Charlotte Street—he asked me if I could speak to him outside—I said, "Yes"—he said, "If I knew where these people were I would tell you"—no reference had been made to any people—this was about six p.m.—he was in bed—I waited for him—I went to the Blue Post public-house—he said he would try and find out where the people were, and let me know by twelve o'clock on Sunday—I left him—I went back to the house on Sunday, 27th—he was gone.</p>

About 3.30 a.m. on 29th May I went to Wapping Police-station, where Schmerfeld was detained—I said, "I am a police officer, and I shall take you into custody on a charge of being concerned with Paul and Susannah Koczula, who are already in custody, in stealing a quantity of jewellery and money, of the value of about £80, from Mr. Rasch, of 167, Shaftesbury Avenue, last Friday night"—I said, "Do you understand me?"—I knew he was a German—he said, "Yes; I was not in the robbery at all"—I had received from the police there one pair of gloves, one tobacco pouch, and one rubber stamp—those were the only things found on him—I conveyed him to Marlborough Street Police-station in a cab—on the way he said, "Everyone must speak the truth; I did not do any thing, but I was afraid. I have had nothing to eat since Friday last but two eggs, which I found in Regent's Park under a hedge, where I slept since last Sunday. Last night I walked to the docks to try and get on a ship to go to Rotterdam"—I afterwards went to 89, Charlotte Street—I saw in the room which had been occupied by him clothes saturated with blood—the prisoner was charged at the Police-station with being accessory to the robbery, and the articles were specified—he was also charged with attempting to commit suicide—he said nothing when that charge was read over—I examined the premises, 167, Shaftesbury Avenue, about 3.30 or four p.m on 26th May, to ascertain if there were any signs of a person having got in or escaped by the back premises—I could not discover any—there was a ladder leaning against the house—it was not in a position as would assist any person to get in or out—I put the ladder against the back of a house in New Compton Street to look over the other side—there was no sign of anyone having scrambled over.</p>

In the letter Schmerfeld states that he has committed suicide, and that the murderer of Mrs. Rasch can be found at 181, Hampstead Road"—I went on to say, "Schmerfeld's room is swamped with blood, but I have been unable to find him"—both prisoners were standing together; the male prisoner shrugged his shoulders—they said nothing.

I have secreted from you that that old servant girl had not been in Germany, and that her child had died here, but I never think any evil inclination or business. I now have the address of the murderer, and am compelled to inform you of it. Come to see me. Offer me your hand in death to say good-bye, for I cannot do better than to die. The address of the murderer is Hampstead Road, 181. Good-bye till we see each other again. Your friend till death, better than dis<lb/>honour or shame,—Schmerfeld. Forgive and forget me.

                  </hi>. I am chief clerk at the Thames Police-court—on 3rd July warrants were issued against Charlotte Pfretschaer and Frederick Metz for offences against the Excise laws—I produce the warrants—I was present when they were heard—Pfretschaer was con<lb/>victed, and fined £102 for selling beer without a licence—this is a cer<lb/>tified copy of the conviction—on July 6th there was an appeal against the conviction and on July 7th, the prisoner Bruster attended, and entered into recognisances in £80 for the defendant, and £40 for each surety—he was sworn in Mr. Dickenson's presence, and I questioned him as to his means, and asked his address—he said, 143, Holborn, but that he lived at 45, Calais Road, Brixton, and that he was trading as Holmes, Bruster, and Co., lager beer importers, and was worth £120 after all his debts were paid, and had book debts to the amount of £400, and furniture and stock in trade at 143, Holborn, value £170 to £180, and that one machine alone was worth over £100—he was then allowed to enter into recognisances, which I have here and the fiat—this is Mr. Dickenson's signature—the signature to the public examination is the prisoner's writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The woman Charlotte either pays the £120 or goes to prison, but the prisoner had nothing to do with that—if the appeal was unsuccessful, and the Excise proceeded against him, they would have to proceed by distress, and, if the distress was not sufficient, he would have to go to prison during the Queen's pleasure—Metz said he was carrying on business with Mr. Sharplin, who was the co-surety.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a produce broker, of 13, Cullum Street; I was formerly in partnership with Charles Holmes, who is now dead—we were both acquainted with the prisoner Coe, but I had never seen the others—on June 7th, the day after the Derby, Coe called and asked if we would lend him £250; we asked him what it was for; he said, "I have won £100 on Ladas, and shall have to produce this money to obtain my winnings"—after talking the matter over, Mr. Holmes said, "I will come with you and bring £150, but I shall not let it go out of my possession"—Coe said, "That is all right; the bet is safe; it has been made with Mr. Topping, the bookmaker, who is a member of the Victoria Club, Wellington Street, and has registered the bet there; the bet has been made on my behalf through Mr. Brown, of 118, Pall Mall"—I had never heard of Mr. Brown, but he said that he was Mr. Lyons's, an estate agent, managing clerk, whom I knew—I then drew two cheques, one for £100, and the other for £150—the £100 cheque was to be paid into Mr. Holmes's bank, being payable to him, and the £150 one to be paid over the counter—the crossed cheque was payable to Coe—I said that it must be paid into Coe's bank, and draw a cheque against it, and hand the proceeds to Mr. Holmes—he said there was no necessity to part with the £250; Mr. Holmes need only show it in one hand and receive the £100 winnings with the other, and the £250 would then be paid to meet the £150 cheque—Coe mentioned his bankers, Reinhardt and Co.—they then started to go to the bank, and as they were going out I said to Mr. Holmes, "Now, whatever you do, you are on no account to part with those notes," and I said to Coe, "This is done with the distinct understanding that the money does not go out of Mr. Holmen's hands"—he said, "All right, my boy, no fear about that"—they then left to go to the bank; that was about 11.30 a.m.—I got a telegram about 3.30 p.m., purporting to come from Mr. Holmes, in consequence of which I went to our bank directly, the National Provincial, and obtained the number of a £100 note, and then went to the Bank of England to stop it, but was ten minutes too late; it had been cashed—I saw Mr. Holmes about four o'clock; he made a complaint to me, and at 5.30 we were sitting in our office, in consequence of what Mr. Holmes said, ex<lb/>pecting Coe to call, but we received this telegram from him: "Have got man's address; after him; see you to-morrow"—this (<hi rend="italic">The original telegram</hi>) is in Coe's writing—he never came as arranged, and we went to his house, 34, Weymouth Street, where he carries on the business of a</p>

               <p>dentist, and occupies the whole house—a servant opened the door; she made a statement, and I was not admitted—she was going to shut the door, but I prevented her by putting my foot on the step; and seeing Coe at the ground-floor window, we went in, and Coe came out and met us in the hall; the door of the room from which he came was open—I believe he would be able in that room to hear the conversation between me and the servant—he said, "Come into my surgery"—that is the room from which he came—I said, "I am rather surprised that you did not turn up as you promised; I shall be glad if you will kindly inform me the meaning of this business"—he said, "Oh, it's all right, don't excite yourself"—I said, "It looks all wrong"—he said, "You have nothing to fear; I know Brown, who is a member of the Victoria Club; he is a man in a very good position, and frequently dines with lords and dukes"—that was the first time he had told me he was a member of the Victoria Club—I said, "The whole thing looks very suspicious"—he said, "Do you think that I am in the swindle?"—I said, "We shall not express any opinion"—he said, "In order to show you my <hi rend="italic">bona fides</hi> I will give you a cheque for the £250" and drew this open cheque for £250, post-dated the 14th, and said, "I have not the money to meet it just now, but I shall have some money on Saturday or Monday"—this was at 7 or 7.30 p.m.—he then said, "I have been to Bow Street and Vine Street with Brown, and the detectives are after these fellows; we shall have them by 10 o'clock to<lb/>night"—we said that we thought the whole thing was a swindle—he said, "It is all right, I know Dale and Stebbings"; Mr. Holmes had mentioned them—Coe said he thought they were swindlers—Mr. Holmes said very little; I did most of the talking—Coe said, "It is all right; I have done busi<lb/>ness with them, and know them well; they are perfectly honest and respectable"—we then left, and went to Vine Street to make inquiries, and then to Bow Street—I presented the cheque on the day it was due, but did not get the money—it was marked, "Refer to drawer"—I wrote this letter to Coe the same night, after going to Bow Street. (<hi rend="italic">Informing them that unless the £250 was paid by two o'clock next day he should obtain summonses against Coe and the individual he called Brown and his satellites.</hi>)—I posted that that night, but got no answer—next day I con<lb/>sulted Messrs. Lewis and Lewis, who wrote this letter to the defendants. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that they were instructed to take proceedings, but before doing so wished to give them an opportunity of explaining their conduct.</hi>)—I have never seen any answer to that—I afterwards went to the defendants' solicitors, Messrs. Wilson and Wallace—on the next day, the 22nd, Mr. Holmes died by his own hand, as found by the coroner's jury—I have never had the £250 back—both these cheques have come back to me through my bank—I am credited with the amounts—we were to get £25 consideration—no letter mentions that as far as I know; that was by word of mouth.</p>

I have known Coe ten or eleven months—I have been to his house in Weymouth Street pretty often—he curries on the business of a dental surgeon there, and has done ever since I have known him—I slept in his house one night—I never dined there, but I have been there frequently in the evening—I also went to Norwood once when he was there—I had ample at my bankers to meet the two cheques, but not on the current account, and I told Coe so—the</p>

               <p>amount was to he transferred from our deposit account to our current amount—that would not take a minute—it was not said that that should be done—the £150 cheque was to be paid to the credit of Coe's account, and drawn against—that would take a day—the money was said to be required that very day—he was to get the £150 from his own bank and £100 from mine—when I saw Coe he told me that he and Brown had been to Bow Street together; that was to put the police in motion, that they might take the guilty parties in custody, but they never went there at all—Coe had told me that Stebbings and Dale were perfectly honest men, who were well known to him, and yet he had been to the station to give information against them—that did not surprise me, because I was flurried—I have been seven or eight years in business—I wrote, "Unless the money is paid by to-morrow afternoon at three o'clock we are to institute criminal proceedings"—Coe told me that he had been to Lewis and Lewis's office on Monday, June 11th, with a private detective named Chamberlain, whom he had employed—he did not tell me on June 7th that he had already sent for a private detective, and was expecting him at that time—I do not know that a private detective was acting for him from June 7th—I know he swore an information against Stebbings and Dale, but I don't know the date Stebbings was arrested—I made inquiries of Watson and Lyon, of Pall Mall, and found that Brown was employed in the <hi rend="italic">Rod and Gun</hi> office—Coe said he should have sufficient to meet the cheque on Monday; that was before it would become due—I had one cheque of his dishonoured previously—the information of June 13th was not at my instigation—I have no doubt a private inquiry agent acted for Coe in investigating the matter.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant E</hi>). On June 7th I was on duty at Bow Street, and shortly after ten p.m. the prisoner Brown was introduced by a public-house manager; he gave his name Edward Walter S. Brown—I made a brief note of what he said: "On the 6th inst. I made a bet on behalf of Dr. Coe, of 34, Weymouth Street, on the Derby, with a man named Stebbings, of 33, Standof Street, Kennington Lane, of £200 to £100 on Ladas; it was £50 on Bullingdon to win, starting price. I paid with a crossed cheque which he accepted. The cheque was to be taken to the Victoria Club, Wellington Street, of which he was a member; on the 7th, the day after the Derby, at 3.30, I saw Stebbings in the presence of Dr. Coe and another at Pall Mall, and we went together to Wellington Street; a man named Dale accompanied Stebbings, and said that he, Dale, was a member of the Victoria Club, and when we arrived at the club, Dale entered, stating that he was going to register the bet; we walked together to the club, and on the way Stebbings said that the bet was all right, subject to proof of genuineness of cheque, and the production of notes for £250; believing his statement to be true, I handed him £250 in Bank of England notes, two for £100 each, and one for £50. Stebbings then handed the notes to Dale, who said, 'I will be back in a few minutes, and will pay the amount of the bet, £300.' He returned shortly, and said his principal was not in the club, but would return in a quarter of an hour. Dale re-entered the club. We waited three-quarters of an hour, during which time Stebbings said, 'I will go and see what is keeping Dale.' Stebbings entered the club, and we saw nothing of either of them afterwards. I made inquiry at the club, and found that neither of them were members, but were known there as runners, that is, to run messages"—I said, "Well, Mr. Brown, this is a very extraordinary tale; how long have you been in London?"—he simply smiled, and said, "I believe I have been done"—he never mentioned Mr. Holmes from the beginning to the end—that was the first time I had ever seen him—on June 13th I received a warrant for the apprehension of Stebbings and Dale, and arrested Stebbings the same day, and found some betting slips on him, and these letters from a man named Brown, which I showed to Brown next day, and said, "I have found some letters on Stebbings which show a close intimacy between you"—he said, "Yes, I am very sorry; I am afraid I have more or less compromised myself in those letters, to tell you the truth, I was more or less in pecuniary difficulties, and I believed Stebbings to be a man of money, and asked him for a loan; from what I have since learned I find that I have made a mistake"—I showed him the letters—he said, "Yes, they are mine"—I mentioned them at the Police-court, and the solicitor said, "You can use them for the purposes of the defence." (<hi rend="italic">A selection from the letters was put in; they were from Brown to Stebbings, relating to bets, and asking Stebbings to lend him £10 till the end of the next quarter, and enclosing a promissory note.</hi>)—On June 26th I arrested the eldest Dale</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189407230068"/>
               <p>about one o'clock in front of the Bedford Head Hotel, Tottenham Court Road, on this warrant, obtained at the instance of Mr. Holmes. (<hi rend="italic">Charging him with stealing several bank notes, and conspiring with Brown, Dale, Coe, and Stubbings.</hi>)—He said, "I know all about it; it is that betting affair. I am a commission agent, and have been acting for Coe and Brown and Stebbings in the matter; it is quite right: I received the notes, and cashed one of them for £100 the same day, and brought the money back, but I decline to tell you who I gave it to, Brown's share was to be £42; the bet was a <hi rend="italic">snide</hi>"—that means a counterfeit, a bogus bet—" it was first paid for by a draft, which was nothing; the man Coe was at the bottom of it. I never saw the man that paid the bank note before that day; he was a stranger to me. I went into the Victoria Club on other business, not in connection with a bet at all"—I took him to Bow Street Station, where he was charged; he made no reply—on the same night I went with McCarthy, another officer, to 2, Grosvenor Park, Camberwell, from private information, and saw Ellen Dale; she is Frank Dale's wife—I said, "We are police-officers; your husband, Frank Dale, is in custody, charged, with others, with stealing £250 in Bank of England notes; we have information that you have the bulk of the money"—she said, "No, I have not"—I said, "My information is different; if you received it honestly from your husband it will not be an offence"—I had no intention of arresting her then—she said, "I did not know what I was doing; my husband told me he won the money on a bet, when I found it was stolen I gave all I had to my son; they were small notes; I was all of a rumble, and feeling very uncomfortable; the little girl will show you where my son lives," pointing to a little girl in the room—Sergeant McCarthy then went out with the little girl, and while I waited with the prisoner she went into the bedroom, and came back and handed me £3 10s. in gold, saying, "That is all I have got out of the lot"—McCarthy came back with Herbert Joseph Dale, and said, "This is the son, and he denies having received anything from his mother"—I said to the mother, "You hear that; have you anything to say?"—she said, "To tell you the truth, I burnt the notes; I was afraid to keep them"—the son then said, "Mother, I never had anything from you"—I told them that in consequence of their conflicting statements I should take them both in custody for feloniously receiving the notes—the son said, "You can search my place; I have no money, and never had any notes"—I then went to 104, Westmoreland Road, where he lodged, and took him with me—that is about half a mile off—I left his mother with a policeman—he took us into his room, and while searching he said, "If you know as much as I do you would not give yourself so much trouble; you will find nothing"—I saw McCarthy find a small canvas bag containing gold and silver, in the fireplace among some shavings—he said, "That is mine"—I said, "Why conceal it in the fireplace?"—he said, "I have a drunken wife"—I said, "The grate seems to be daily done up; it is the very place where she would find it"—I con<lb/>tinued the search, and in the back room, which was used as a kitchen and bedroom, I found, in a locked box, a small canvas bag containing £4 in gold and 15s. in silver—he said, "That money is mine, too"—I asked him for the key; he said he could not find it, and I had to pick the lock—I had previously found forty-four pawn-tickets, all of different dates, for</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189407230069"/>
               <p>small amounts, none over 10s.—I said, "The possession of so many pawn-tickets, all of recent dates, does not seem to be consistent with so much money"—he said, "Later on I shall be able to explain where I got the money"—we took both mother and son to Bow Street, and they were charged with receiving the bank notes, and, when the words "bank notes" were mentioned, the male prisoner said, "Observe, there were no bank notes found on me."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector E</hi>). On June 8th Brown came to me at Bow Street, with an officer from Vine Street—he gave me this card, "E. W. S. Brown, 118, Pall Mall"—I asked his business; he said, "A land agent"—I asked him the nature of the complaint—he said he wanted to give in custody a man named Dale, and another named Stebbings, for robbing him of £250—I asked him the particulars—he said, "I have been acting for Dr. Coe in making a bet for Ladas and Bullingdon for the Derby;" and that he had parted with the £250 to Stebbings, who handed it to Dale on the steps of the Victoria Club, Wellington Street, Strand—I said, "Whose money was it?"—he said, "Dr. Coe's"—I said, "What is his address, and why did not you bring him with you?"—he said that his address was 34, Chesham Place, which I wrote down; and then he said, "No. 34, Weymouth Street"—I said, "When did it happen?"—he said, "On the 6th"—I said, "Well, as you have not got Dr. Coe here, I must decline to act"—he then said that the bet had been sold to a Mr. Holmes, of the address which he mentioned—I said, "Well, the matter is a betting transaction, and appears to be complicated; I will not allow any of my officers to arrest anyone without a warrant, but I shall be ready to render you any assistance, and if you will be here in the morning at ten o'clock with Dr. Coe, I will take you, or send you into Court, to lay an information"—I was not aware that he had been to Bow Street the previous night—this was six or seven p.m.—he then left, and I discovered that he had been to the station the night previous; and I kept Sergeant Ward there next morning, but neither of them came—subsequently an information was laid, and the warrant returned to me for execution against Dale and Stebbings, which I handed to Sergeant Ward for execution, and wrote down Brown's description of Stebbings and Dale—a warrant was issued on June 21st for the arrest of Coe, Brown, Dale, and Stebbings for conspiracy, and I went with Sergeant Ward to 34, Weymouth Street, about 11.30 a.m., and saw Coe—I told him my name, and said I had a warrant for his arrest, which I read to him—he said, "That is extraordinary; I have a perfect answer to the charge"—he was taken to the station, and 30s. was found on him; he made no reply to the charge—on the same day I took Brown in the</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Harrington Road, South Kensington—in October, 1889, the prisoner was introduced to me—a day or two after I had an interview with him in his chambers, Garden Court, Temple—at that time I had a certain amount of litigation pending against my brother, Colonel Lewis—I discussed it with the prisoner at that inter<lb/>view—at the end of January, 1890, I received this letter from him. (<hi rend="italic">This confirmed an arrangement respecting Mrs. Bevan's cases; the prisoner having her authority to employ a solicitor who should act solely under his instruc<lb/>tions, and he (the prisoner) to act as her counsel; he undertaking to see that the costs were kept at the lowest possible scale, lie estimated the cost at £200, which she should either deposit with him, interest being allowed at 5 per cent., or she should pay down £100 and further sums as were needed; all costs recovered in the action to be refunded</hi>)—I wrote this letter of the 31st in reply, consenting to that arrangement—I went to his chambers again, and was introduced by him to Mr. Moeran, a solicitor—I paid at the prisoner's request £200 by this cheque on the National Provincial Bank, Piccadilly Branch, into the Agra Bank, on 6th February, 1890—I got this receipt from the prisoner: "Received from Mrs. E. E. Bevan as a deposit on account of litigation to be launched, the sum of £200 only, to bear interest at 5 per cent, per annum, to be settled monthly"—I told the prisoner I had paid that money into his account—between</p>

               <p>February and May, 1890, he asked me if he might take the £200 out of the Agra Bank and put it at 10 per cent, for me—I said, "Yes"—he said it would be available for litigation whenever it was necessary—I understood it was invested; nothing was said as to in whose name the investment was made, it was to be in his name I suppose—afterwards he told me that he was accustomed to have people's money and invest it in his own name; they trusted him—he said, "I think money should be invested in one's own name"; and that he did not care to trust people and do business with people who did not trust him altogether—I said I should not trust him with a large sum of money as a young lady he mentioned to me had done—after I had parted with the £200 I saw him in the Temple and elsewhere from time to time in reference to this litigation—in October, 1890, I lent him £100 for a month at his request—this letter refers to that £100. (<hi rend="italic">This enclosed a formal receipt dated</hi> 31<hi rend="italic">st October</hi>, 1890, <hi rend="italic">for</hi> £100, <hi rend="italic">received from Mrs. E. Bevan on loan until</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">th December</hi>, 1890)—as far as I recollect we were at his chambers, and Mr. Moeran came in, and there was conversation about being short of money to buy a house with, and that was how I lent him the £100 for a short time—particulars of the expenditure of that £100 are written on the back of the receipt that was produced—in November, 1890, I parted with a further £200 to him—this is the receipt for that sum: "Received from Mrs. Bevan, to be returned in six months from date, the sum of £200 with interest at 10 per cent, per annum, payable in advance"—that money was advanced for him to invest on his own personal security, and pay me the interest—he was to be personally liable for the 10 per cent, interest—the expenditure of that £200 is accounted for, I believe, by what is written on the back of this receipt from time to time: "Returned £126 0s. 7d. by cheque dated 1st August, 1891"—about November, 1890, he told me he was going to Vienna for a week—at the end of Novem<lb/>ber or the beginning of December I got this letter from him from Brussels. (<hi rend="italic">A number of letters were read from the prisoner to the witness dated from Brussels, Vienna, ss. Ganges near Aden, Calcutta, Hyderabad, and Deccan, in which he expressed admiration of and affection for the witness</hi>)—he wanted me to accompany him to Vienna; of course I declined—he returned to London at the end of June or the beginning of July—I saw him from time to time after that—at one of our meetings after his return from India he said he had not made so much money in India as he had expected in rela<lb/>tion to the £1,000 he was to have for going out there, but that he had returned with some concessions; and he mentioned the iron ore conces<lb/>sions in Madras, and another concession to do with electricity—soon afterwards he said as to the iron ore, "It is a very good thing; I am going to form a syndicate," and he asked me to put £200 in, and if the syndicate was not formed by January the £200 was to be returned to me; if it was formed and was successful, I shoulder get a bonus of £400, and that he would insure his life to secure the money to me, as he was in delicate health; he said he had typhoid fever in India—he afterwards told me that a Mr. Gillingham had put £1,000 into the syndicate—this conversation took place in his chambers at Figtree Court—he had moved there—on a subsequent Friday, on 31st July, I went to his chamber again and he asked me to sign this agreement, which was drawn up—h</p>

               <p>had wanted me to sign it two days before, and I would not; I had not the money ready or anything—on 31st July I wanted to lay it aside till Saturday, I did not like signing it on Friday, and I wondered that he was so pressing; but he called in his clerk, J. C. Frawley, who signed as a witness—the prisoner gave no reason for wanting it signed that day; he only said he did want it signed on that day; I said it was very unlucky, but gave way—I think he read it to me before I signed—this is the agreement. (<hi rend="italic">This was to the effect that whereas 0'Flynn was arranging a syndicate to secure con-cessions to float a company to work the iron ores of the Madras Presidency A and was desirous that Mrs. Bevan should contribute, it was agreed that Mrs. Bevan should pay to 0'Flynn £'200, he undertaking to repay that sum within twelve months, and a further sum of £800 in the event of the successful floating of the company, and that as a security for the repayment of £200 he agreed, within fourteen days of the signing of the agreement, to hand over to Mrs. Bevan a policy of assurance on his own life of the value of £400, and undertook to maintain the premiums on the policy</hi>)—I took the £200 in notes to his chambers on 4th August, and gave them to him—the receipt appears on the agreement, "Received £200 in notes"—I did not receive the life policy for some time; but eventually I received from the prisoner this policy for £500, dated 21st May, 1892, on the Church of England Life and Fire Assurance Company—I was continually asking for it—I wrote to, and called on from time to time the prisoner, asking for the return of the money I had entrusted to him—I wrote him this letter of November 10, 1892. (<hi rend="italic">This asked for the return of the £200 from the person the prisoner said he had lent it to</hi>)—the prisoner told me he had lent some of it to Mr. Ginghorn, or some such name, and it had not been returned, and he was trying to get it from him—he said he hoped to get it before another three months was out—he told me the man to whom he had lent it would pay it last August—he said I was to ask for the money personally, and not through solicitors, because I had asked the solicitor to get it, and he could not get it—I received this letter from the prisoner of 13th May, 1893: "You may count on having £100 on or before Monday next"—I did not have one penny of that money—I received this letter of 12th July, 1893(<hi rend="italic">Asking for a loan of £10 till Monday, as he said heavy liabilities to meet, and giving his word of honour that site should have it back on that day</hi>)—I wrote back saying I could not do it—I received this from him of the 5th August, 1893. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that if she would call or send on the</hi> 12<hi rend="italic">th instant he would pay the</hi> £400)—I went to see him and he said he ad not received the money and could not pay it, but that he expected advances; that he was in treaty to sell the <hi rend="italic">Whitehall Review</hi>, but he had no money—I received this from him of 8th January, 1894, from the <hi rend="italic">Law Gazette office.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he would send her money almost at once, but that he must point out that the first</hi> £200, <hi rend="italic">originally paid for his getting a solicitor to take up her case, was almost immediately afterwards placed at</hi> 10 <hi rend="italic">per cent, and that the interest of</hi> 10 <hi rend="italic">per cent, and been paid to her half-yearly up to and including November</hi>, 1893)—I received from him this letter of 31st January, 1894.

               <p>I replied that I could not trust his promises—the premiums on the policy were not kept up, only the first was paid; I went to the office myself in March, 1893, and found that out—these are the receipts for the interest on the first £200; they cover the period up to January, 1893—the expen<lb/>diture of the £200 is shown on the back of this receipt—one of the ums, £126 0s. 7d., was paid through Mr. Carter, a solicitor, to Mr. Calkin Lewis.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner told me afterwards that he had had some difficulty in getting his life assured—I think I asked for the policy, and then he gave me the reason—after a year or more I got the policy; I had great trouble to get it—I don't pretend to be a very clever woman—I am afraid I am very easy to deceive, because I have been brought up honourably, and do not mistrust people—I never lent the prisoner any money for a period of two years—these are receipts for the interest paid, not for the money advanced—this receipt states that the £200 was lent for two years—I signed it because the prisoner asked me to do so—I was talking to him at the time, and he said, "Will you give me a receipt for the interest for the litigation money?"—I have been tricked—I have been engaged in a good deal of litigation, unfortunately, through my lawyers—I have made a list of the lawyers I employed, with an account of what they did, and why I dismissed them—I have employed about four or five firms on this litigation, I should think—bills of costs were to be paid by my trustee out of my estate; my income cannot be anticipated—part of the thing I went to the prisoner for was to settle these lawyers' bills of costs—after a time he settled some of the bills with a portion of the money I had lent him—he settled Mr. Rushton's bill of £29 with £15 after some years—he told me Mr. Rushton had been settled with, and Mr. Rushton told my friends he had not, and then I told the prisoner he must be paid—Mr. Moeran was paid in good time; his bill might have come to £42—I paid him £24 in settlement by the prisoner's cheque on my money; I forced the prisoner to pay it—Mr. Calkin Lewis's bill of £126 0s. 7d. was settled in full—the prisoner persuaded me to run up costs in appealing from the taxing master—I was on friendly terms with the prisoner, as I should be with any gentleman who conducted himself as a gentleman—it was presumption writing to me "Dear Emma"; I told him there could be nothing between us—I wanted him to gain my case—I wrote to him after; I had a great deal to write to him about, because he had taken a special retainer for my cases, and I wished him to come back and finish them—I had no occasion to do other than write in a perfectly friendly way—I was not at all satisfied with what he was doing; he had gone to India unknown to me—I blamed him in one letter for going to India, and leaving me in the hands of a couple of lawyers I did not know, and he wrote and said he would make up for lost time when he came back—he said he was in the habit of consulting mystical men, and I said why did not he do so when he was in India—I do not re<lb/>member suggesting that he should do so—I was only dissatisfied that he had gone to India without telling me about it, and leaving my things—he said he was going to Vienna; he wrote stating that he did not like to tell me—he told me some months before that he thought he was going to India about the Indian Congress, but when he was departing he said he was only going to Vienna for a few months, and asked me to go out with</p>

               <p>him—he said he would do some law work there, and we could go to theatres in the evening; I was not accustomed to that sort of thing—I thought he could not have written such trash as that about my winsome face if he did not mean to win my case; I wrote back that I did not think what he said tallied with his conduct in leaving me—some of my letters were returned from Vienna—I could not help him writing to me—I asked him to come back and see after my affairs—I did not believe, "I could not when under your personal influence make up my mind to leave Eng<lb/>land and you," since his actions were totally different—he had deceived me—I told him many times when he came back that it was not the right thing to leave me in the lurch like that—I had a solicitor, but no Counsel while he was away, as he asked for a special retainer—afterwards I knew he was engaged on Congress work—for a married man to write such letters shows what he is—after he came back he went on conducting my cases for me—I went to the opening of the exhibition with him, and so did other ladies—he asked me to marry him when he came back, and gave me a list of houses to look at in South Kensington—I left the matter open, he must win my case; I could not think of matrimony at present; I was in legal diffi<lb/>culties—all he ever gave me was a white fan and a moonstone ring from India—I considered I advanced this money as a purely business transac<lb/>tion; I do not mix up love and business as a rule; I should not care for any<lb/>one who wanted a lot of money from me—the fact of his being a single or married man had no influence on me at all in this transaction—he was passing as a single man—I never took the iron ore agreement out of his office before it was signed and I had paid the money—when I signed the agreement I had not the money with me; I left with him—I did not take the agreement out of his chambers until I had brought him the £200 and he had given me a receipt—I cannot recollect whether I said before the Magistrate, "I cannot swear whether I had it or not"; I can swear I did not have it in my possession; I never took it away—Frawley, who witnessed the agreement, is an elderly man—Carr owed money to my mother's estate—after I had employed the prisoner I obtained judgment against Carr for £450; Mr. Moeran was my solicitor—I had and still have litigation with my brother—the prisoner launched into much further difficulties; he settled nothing with my brother—the prisoner never offered me back the £200 I advanced for the Iron Ore Company—he said he would try and sell a small portion of my share, but he did not—he said my cousin wanted to buy it, but I found it was untrue—he did not offer me the money, and I did not say I would not take it unless he gave me a bonus of £600—he said I could not expect a bonus if he sold it; I understood from him it was all coming in, but it was untrue—I called and saw him after receiving his letter—he never offered me a penny; I should only have been too glad to take it—I told him I had seen a solicitor, Mr. Kennedy, whom he knew well, and that he had told me the prisoner was a swindle and a fraud; that was when the prisoner told me to ask him personally, and not through a solicitor—the solicitor told me to have the onus—I did not demand the bonus and the £200—the solicitor had written to him—I could not have the bonus, because the thing had not been floated; it was not in existence—it appears that the syndicate was not formed—I think he owes me some interest on the money I lent—he took some for Counsel's fees—£297 has been paid out—he told me he had a con<lb/>cession,</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This repeated the terms agreed upon at the interview, stated that if the engagement was terminated at the end of the first month he would repay the fifty guineas, and made an appointment for the following Friday</hi>)—I instructed my bankers to pay him fifty guineas, and I received this letter of 28th December, 1892, acknowledging its receipt—I did not work at the office, I took work there every day—about Christmas, 1892, he mentioned that his banking account showed a balance every night of £200, and that he got a higher rate of interest from the bank on condition of his doing so—I had money on deposit at Windsor—he asked me where I banked and the amount of interest the bank allowed on deposit—I said two per cent.—it was then he said he got three and a half per cent, on condition of always showing a balance of £200—he told me he lived at Dulwich, that he was often very late, and sometimes did not get back from his work till two or three, but that the servants always left the supper things ready for him—he spoke of his Indian property—I concluded he was in very good circumstances—I began work there about 17th January—he had been ill in January—I had this letter of 16th January from him—something had been said about my coming up to live in town—I came to live in town, taking rooms with my sister; not at the prisoner's suggestion, but in order to be near the work—I had no notion he was married; I believed him to be single—I went on work<lb/>ing and going to his office when I came to town towards the end of January I was taking steps with regard to selling my house—I told the prisoner what I was doing, and about the price, and so on—a solicitor at Windsor was acting for me in the matter—the prisoner witnessed the execution of the conveyance dated 11th February—the house sold for £900; the mortgage, £600, and expenses had to be deducted, and I was to get the difference—when I told the prisoner about the house and so on, he asked me if I would invest some money in a white lead company—that was about the same time, while the negotiations were going on—he said the company was being started, and it was doing very well indeed, and he recommended it as a good investment—I said I was arranging to take shares in the Windsor Bank—he said this other would be very much better, and that I</p>

               <p>need not put it in permanently, but I could have it out at the end of a month if I cared to invest £100—he said the company was in Glasgow—he spoke to me about it on several occasions—I was not willing to do it at first—I told him I had not the money then—he said, "I have £100 lying idle; I will buy the shares for you, and you can repay me when the negotiations about the house are completed"—I consented to do so—next day he told me he had bought the shares in the white lead company, and put in £100 for me in my name—I believed his statement—two or three days after<lb/>wards he began to ask me to repay the money; he asked me two or three times—he said he was temporarily pressed for money as he had to meet a bill—he said Chapman, the draper, of Notting Hill, had failed, and he had £600 in their business, and had lost it—I believed those statements—as soon as the negotiations about the house were completed, and the money had been paid to the solicitor at Windsor, I went down to Windsor, and got £100 from the solicitor there on 14th February, 1893—I brought the cheque to town, getting back between live and six—I saw the prisoner the same evening; I gave him the cheque at the office, Savoy House—he knew I had gone to Windsor; I saw him the morning before I went, and he asked me to get it and bring it back if I could—he was actually waiting for it—he said I must get the remainder as quickly as I could, or, if I did not, I should not be able to get it for a long time, because solicitors would not give it up—once it got into solicitors' hands, he said, it was very diffi<lb/>cult to get it out again—I saw him next day, the 15th—I suggested going to Windsor again, and he said he would send my sister—after seeing him I wrote to my solicitor, and my sister went down on the 15th, and returned with a cheque for me—I paid that into my bank at Windsor the same night—on the morning of 16th I received this letter of 15th from the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">This asked her, if she had no immediate need for £100 of the money Miss Hope had got for her (hat day, to spare it for two or three days, and concluded by saying that a lady of title had just been secured</hi>)—the prisoner had spoken of the lady of title in connection with the white lead company—I went and saw the prisoner on 16th—he said he wanted this loan to meet the bill; the banks were closed and he could not get any money, and it would save him borrowing money from his broker—he required £100—he said, "If you lend me £100, it will save my going to ray brokers"—he said he wanted the money for two or three days, and would return it on the following Monday, this being on the Thursday—at that time I had complete confidence in the prisoner, and I believed the had lent me £100; that was why I lent him the second £100—I accordingly gave him this cheque for £100 on my bank at "Windsor on 16th February—he did not repay me £100 on the Monday; I don't think he alluded to it then—two or three days afterwards he said he had not been able to get it out; he had been too busy; he had not been able to get it from the bank—I asked him for the money then—after<lb/>wards I asked him for it; he said he would get it for me, let me have it the next day—he paid me a sum of £2; I don't know whether that was for salary or part of the £100—I continued to attend regularly at the office—I asked him for the £100 I had lent him on several occasions; he always put me off, said he had not been able to get it; he had sent to the bank and it was closed, and he made various excuses—after I had parted with this money, and when I had been there some little time, he became very</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The letter of '2nd May, 1893, stated that he had to go to the House of Commons that evening in pursuit of pupils and the syndicate</hi>)—in August my sister made a communication to me, as the result of which I went to Dulwich and made inquiries; some time afterwards I told the prisoner that I found he was a married man with a family—he denied it—he said it would be a cruel wrong to me if it were so; but "The woman you are pleased to call Mrs. O'Flynn is not my wife, and has nothing to do with me"—I asked him to explain it—he said he would write me an explanation, and that he meant to tell me all about it—I believed his statement that he was not married—he said, "I swear to you before God that I am not married"—I said I would wait for his explanation; he did not give it to me—my sister got her £50 back with a great deal of difficulty; a solicitor sued for it, and it was afterwards paid in instalments—I went to Messrs. Paine and Co., solicitors, to con<lb/>sult them about my sister in the first instance, in April, 1893—afterwards they learnt about my position with regard to my £200; they wrote to the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Whitehall Review</hi>—I learnt afterwards that they had sued O'Flynn for my money, and got judgment—O'Flynn spoke to me about it, and said an execution had been put in his house—he said he had written to the solicitors making a proposition as to the repayment of the money—he said that writs would neither hinder nor advance the matter—he said the house did not belong to him, he had only one room there, and only about £10 worth of property in the house, perhaps not that—I believed what he said, and eventually instructed my solicitor to withdraw the execution—he said the house belonged to Mr. Long—after some little time had elapsed and I had made inquiries about "Houlgate, I saw prisoner—I believed I was engaged to be married to him—Messrs.

Chapman, of Notting Hill; he said he had had to meet a bill"—I do not remember his saying "unexpectedly"—he mentioned at the same time of the failure of Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and a member of the firm of Paine, Blythe and Huxtable, formerly Paine, Son and Pollock, of St. Helen's Place—in April, 1893, I received a communication from Miss Michel, and had an interview with her, as the result of which I wrote the letter of 10th April, 1893, to the prisoner—I was naturally desirous of getting her money for her if I could—I acted for her sister in getting her money—I tried to get judgment under Order 14; that was resisted—ultimately I got judgment in respect of Miss Hetty Michell, but not in respect of Miss Hope Michell, and the defence was set up that she was a minor—after some correspondence with him, and after judgment had been signed and an execution put in on 24th April, he called on me with Miss Michell, and said the sheriff was in possession of his house; that the house and the furniture did not belong to him; I understood him to say that he had the furniture from a hiring company, and that he was only occupying one room in the house, and living on 15s. or £1 a week, less than some of his employes, and that I could get nothing by the execution, and he urged me to withdraw the sheriff—I said Miss Michell had told me the money was advanced to him for the purpose of being invested in a white lead company or syndicate, and I asked him to produce evidence that the money had been properly invested—I understood him to say he was in a position to produce the certificates then, that the money had not been invested in a formal company, but in a syndicate which was preliminary to the company being formed, and that negotiations were proceeding, and representations had been made in high quarters which would lead to the invention becoming of great value—I took Miss Michell into a separate room, and had a conference with her—ultimately I received her instruc<lb/>tions to withdraw the sheriff—I had further correspondence with the prisoner—I think on the 24th the prisoner said he was interested in the <hi rend="italic">Law Gazette and Whitehall Review</hi>, and had money coming in from those, and he suggested the appointment of Miss Michell as receiver under the judgment—we found another receiver in front of us—I ceased to act for Miss Michell in consequence of her not acting on my advice—I discon<lb/>tinued the action brought for Miss Hope Michell because the prisoner set up she was a minor.</p>

Cannon and Palmer after the execution had been put in—I did not tell Miss Michell we had discovered there was a Mrs. O'Flynn; she told me—six weeks or two months subsequent to the judgment she said she had had a promise of marriage from Mr. O'Flynn, and I think at the same time she said she had been down with her sister to "Houlgate," and they had ascertained that Mr. O'Flynn was living with a lady under suspicious circumstances, but she told me she had been assured that the lady was not the prisoner's wife—I think she said there were children—I thought she was acting wrongly in instructing us to</p>

Fellow Workers. You have expended life, energy, and skill in building this bridge. Now come the Royal vermin and rascally politicians with pomp and splendour to claim all the credit. You are condemned to the workhouse and the paupers' grave to glorify these lazy swine, who live upon your labour. I heard men saying, Leave tears and praying, The sharp knife heedeth not the sheep.

I am a commercial clerk out of employment, living at 77, Whitechapel Road—on Friday, 29th June, I went to Tower Hill to see the decorations on the Tower Bridge, which was to be opened the next day—as I was passing in front of a tea warehouse I saw Cantwell get on a wall—he unrolled a poster of this colour (<hi rend="italic">yellow</hi>)—</p>

               <p>I could rend all of it, except the four lines of poetry at the bottom—it was pasted on a piece of brown paper—at first, when he began to speak, I was a little way off—after a little time I drew nearer to him—he was then making a reference to the position of capital and labour, referring to the unemployed, exhorting them to join his party, as they were being de<lb/>ceived by both political parties—he said, "I am very ill, hardly able to be here to-day"—he was asked by one of the crowd, "Are you an Anarchist?"—he said, "Yes, I am; I am proud of it"—further on in his speech, referring to the Prince of Wales and the Royal Family, he used these words, "As for the Prince of Wales and the Royal vermin, I would serve them as other vermin are," and referring to the next day's ceremony, the opening of the Tower Bridge, he said, "As for the blackguard crew who will be on the Tower Bridge to-morrow, they are only fit for bombs"—he then asked where were the widows and orphans of those men who had lost their lives in the building of the Tower Bridge—for anything they knew they would be starving, while Royalty would be feeding—further on he said, "I have fought for the cause; I have suffered for the cause, and I am willing to die for the cause; we shall be heard of again and again "in reference to the next day, and he was willing to lead any who chose to follow him—referring to the assassination of President Carnot he justified it, as having been an act committed in the best interest of the working classes, and asserting that that view was held by Lord Salisbury and Lord Rosebery, and he proceeded to quote from what he said was in a recent speech of Lord Rosebery's to that effect—as soon as the crowd found what were the sentiments and the object of Cantwell they became extremely hostile, and there was a great deal of commotion—it was very difficult therefore to hear all that he said, but I am sure I heard what I have repeated—at last, when he got to the end, there were cries of "Lynch him!"—that was after Quin had spoken—Cantwell got down from the parapet, and handed the placard to Quin, who mounted the parapet, and opened his speech with these words, "Comrades and fellow workers, I fully endorse the able speech which my comrade has placed before you"—further on he was greatly interrupted; the crowd told him they had heard enough; they did not want to hear him—further on, in the course of his speech, referring to the assassination of President Carnot, he said, "Comrades, we have been heard of in France, and we shall be heard of again to-morrow"—he did not say what he was, but he said he fully endorsed the sentiments of his comrade—he held up the Anarchists as being the only sound party, and the friends of the working men—I recollect nothing further in his speech—it was a scene of continual excitement—he was pulled down from the parapet; the crowd raised the cry of "Lynch him! Lynch him! Lynch them!" the speakers—during the course of the proceedings, references to the Anarchist party were met by the crowd with cries of," Shoot them! Shoot them!" and when Cantwell was referring to the members of the Royal Family in the vile language he used the crowd called for cheers for the Queen and the Royal Family, and they were given—Quin was hustled down from the wall, and I saw him and Cantwell run away, but they were so com<lb/>pletely hustled by the crowd that I lost sight of them when they turned the corner of the tea warehouse—I lost sight of Cantwell for the time being, but I saw him afterwards—I followed him into Gracechurch Street,</p>

               <p>and there saw him claiming the protection of the police—Quin entirely disappeared from my sight—Cantwell appeared very haggard, and appealed to the police to save him from the crowd—it was an excited crowd, which blocked the whole traffic—that was the last I saw of Cant<lb/>well.</p>

Support should be given to the widows and children of the men who have lost their lives"—then he said, "Do not allow him to open the bridge.

I suppose you are one of the associates of those engaged in the assassination of M. Carnot"—he said, "Good will come of that, and the crowd hissed him down off the parapet—after that I went to the corner, and he was giving pamphlets away, of the same pattern as this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), "Why Vaillant threw the Bomb"—while Cantwell was distributing the pamphlets Quin got up and began to ad<lb/>dress the crowd—I took out a card from my pocket, and said, "You should have your likeness taken, to know you"—he went on with the same language; the crowd got hot on him, and he had to get down and run—I kept alongside of him—he ran into a church; I went in and saw him go into a pew—the police went in and he was sitting reading a book; I pointed him out, and the Inspector came in and took his name and address—they took him out at the back door, and that was the last I saw of him—I did not see what became of Cantwell—he ran down Seething Lane way, followed by a number of the crowd—I ran close alongside of him, and asked him what he had done with the bill he had in front of him—he said it was stolen away from him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant</hi>). I was present on 1st July at 24, Sidmouth Mews, a loft over a stable approached by a step ladder—I there found a printing machine and a set of type; several copies of a pamphlet, "Why Vaillant threw the bomb," sixty-three in one bundle and sixteen in another; about sixty-five copies of the yellow placard, and a quantity of other literature; some copies of the <hi rend="italic">Commonweal;</hi> some pamphlets called, "What Anarchists Want," "The Walsall Anarchists," "Chance for Socialists," "A Talk About Anarchist Communism," "Facts for Socialists," and so on—they exceed two hundred—I found some photographs of Ravachol; memorial cards of Bourdin; this manuscript book relating to chemistry; a five-chamber revolver, loaded in four chambers—there was a couch in the room, which was used for living and sleeping in, as well as a newspaper office, apparently—Sager was with me at this time—the manuscript chemistry book might have been left for the purpose of printing. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MATHEWS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">read a few extracts from the book</hi>)—I see the passage, "Great care must be taken that the oil of vitriol or sulphuric acid be not brought into contact with these explosives, as the smallest drop will instantly explode it"—I brought it away with the their things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My knowledge of chemistry is very limited indeed—this manuscript book is written by Mr. Barker, whom I know very well; in my opinion it is in his writing—it is lectures on the general history of chemistry—the name, "W. Barker," appears on the second page—there are a great many recipes for making explosives, but it all has relation to chemistry, so far as I can judge; it does not relate exclusively to explosives—there are three or four explosive recipes in the whole book; there may be several others if the book were examined minutely by a person who understood it—I don't know if any ordinary chemical book would have recipes for explosives—the last line of the Vaillant pamphlet is, "Issued by the Necessity Group of English Anarchists"—as far as I can say I should say that group is the same as the Commonweal group; they are all the same group, and the same membership; there is no distinction whatever—I have never heard that the English Anarchists of the Commonweal group have always strongly deprecated outrage—I never heard that the English Anarchists of the Freedom group always deprecated outrage—I do not know that this pamphlet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) deprecates outrage; I have not read it—I know most of the people in this photograph; they are not the members of the old Socialist League—most of them are members of the Commonweal group of Anarchists—I do not recognise anybody in it who was a member of the old Socialist League when the photograph was taken some time ago—I know many of the members of that league—it is difficult to answer whether Socialists advocate outrage—some are very extreme, and some are very moderate—speaking of Socialists as a whole, I should gay "No"—Mr. John Burns, M.P., and</p>

               <p>Mr. Tom Mann were members of the old Socialist League—I do not know if Cantwell has worked in America—some copies of <hi rend="italic">this</hi> pamphlet were found at the <hi rend="italic">Commonweal</hi> office two and a half years ago—it is no crime, I believe, to have a revolver in this country, so long as a man has a license; you want a license to carry one, and I suppose that is about the same as having it in the house—I have heard Quin speak several times in Hyde Park—I was present there on May 1st, when a meeting of English Anarchists was broken up—I assisted in keeping the public back from them—I did not assist in breaking up the meeting, nor did I suggest to anybody to break it up—the language got so inflammatory that the crowd broke it up, and if it had not been restrained it would have killed them—I did not strike anyone, I was assaulted myself—Quin was arrested on 6th May, in Hyde Park; I heard the Magistrate dis<lb/>miss the charge—I took notes of a meeting on the 16th January; I have destroyed my notes—we attended the meetings on Tower Hill to frustrate any attempt to proceed to the West-end or destroy property—we generally take notes and compare them, and then one officer will make out a report and read it to the others, and if it is agreed to it is kept for a record, and the notes are destroyed—this is the report of the meeting of 16th January—at that meeting, Williams, the secretary of the unemployed, announced Quin as chairman—Williams is not an Anarchist—I did not forcibly remove a witness for the defence last Saturday—about twenty persons were standing outside the door, and as I was going out a dangerous Anarchist put himself in my way, and I moved him out of the way with my hand—I did not put my hand on a lady and move her out of the way.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> At the meeting on 1st May, in Hyde Park, at which Quin was a speaker, very violent speeches were delivered, and the crowd broke up the meeting—at the Tower Hill meeting, on 16th February, Quin said, "Fellow workmen, I have come here to-day as I have a few hours to spare; I must tell you I have employment during the evening, but it is not sufficient to keep me from agitating. Of course, you are all well aware I am an Anarchist, and if you will only adopt our system, and follow the principles of my colleagues and myself, you will soon obtain your object; using bombs and any other destructive weapons you can do something to forward the cause"—I have been present on many other occasions when he has made speeches advocating the use of force; he always does so; it is notorious—his own colleagues would say they never knew him make a mild speech in his life—his speeches are always characterised by inflamma<lb/>tory language—two and a half years ago I was present at the <hi rend="italic">Common<lb/>weal</hi> office for the purpose of arresting the then editor, Nichol, and Mowbray, and seizing the type—Cantwell then opened the door to me—the office was searched—I then found a great many pamphlets headed, "Address to the Army"—it is similar to this.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a compositor—I have had about thirty years experience in the printing trade—on Thursday, 5th July, I went to 24, Sidmouth Mews, with Cox, and examined the type and printing machine pointed out to me—from the type, as it was set up there, I printed this impression of this yellow placard—it is not complete—the rest of the type was not to be found there—this kind of type is very often borrowed by these small printing offices—I say this I printed is the same as the yellow placard in a skeleton form—I took these pulls from twenty four stereotype plates I found there—among them is a pamphlet of two pages, headed. "An Address to the Army"—I also pulled off other pamphlets—I found the type there in case, not set up, for printing the body of the pamphlet, "Why Vaillant threw the bomb," but not for the head or subhead of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not find the type for the skeleton placard set up, but it was scattered about on the premises, some on the floor, some in a box—the last line, "the lazy swine," was in case, thrown in together—I set it up—more than one piece of yellow paper was produced by the police, and I was told to use it to print this—there is hardly a letter in this poster that I could produce from the printing office at which I am engaged—I would rather not state the name of it—I do posters and every class of work—the yellow paper was in the office when I went there—I did not find the ornamental line at the office—I had to print the imita<lb/>tion placard by doubling the paper, and printing with two separate formes and two impressions—unless that were done in a proper manner you would have a set-off—there is a set-off in this placard of the words rascally politicians"—if it were not folded properly it might not come true; but you can make it come true—it would be a slow process; it is an old fashioned press—if only a few numbers were required you could print the placard in the press I found in the office—I feel quite sure this was printed in this press—I do not consider a compositor responsible for everything in a printing office—the Vaillant pamphlet is printed in four kinds of type—I only saw one kind of type for the principal part of the pamphlet, two pages—I did not find the type for the third or fourth pages—I never gave evidence for the police before this case—the type I did find was very common in printing offices.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 32, Branscombe Road, Acre Lane, Brixton, and am a hackney carriage driver—I have been a police constable in the P and D Divisions—on 29th June I was on Tower Hill with my cab, on the rank—I heard the prisoners speaking from the parapet—I did not hear them incite to murder, or use the word "bomb"—I had never seen them before—I did not hear them say, "The deeds that have been done are not half bad enough to an extent; we must make war against the blood-suckers; plenty will be served the same in England; it will be necessary to remove the heads of States"—I heard something about the working classes, that they would not put up with the capitalists—I did not hear, "They have done a good thing in assassinating Carnot"—I heard them say, "We shall be heard of again"—I thought they meant the next day—I saw some pamphlets in the crowd—I did not see either of the prisoners distributing them—I did not hear Quin say, in reference to the assassination of Carnot, "Out of a little harm great good will come," nor about using bombs—I did not hear him say, "I hate the Royal Family"—he said, "There is quite as good in the meeting to go and open the Tower Bridge to-morrow as the Royal Family"—I did not hear him say," D—the Queen."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was some uproar during Quin's speech among the crowd—I could hear pretty plainly—I did not hear Quin's speech—I was on my cab, twenty-five yards away—I could hear pretty well what he said—I have said what I did hear—there were 300 or 400 people, I should think—two or three people seemed to annoy the rest; they kept interrupting the speakers—Cantwell got down, because the crowd swayed towards him—there were two or three agitators in the crowd who were annoyed at him delivering his speech—I don't know the agitators' names—they were agitating against the prisoners—</p>

               <p>I could not say they were annoying the rest of the people—I believe Quin was pulled off the wall by the agitators—I did not see the prisoners run for their lives; they ran away, and the crowd followed up—they could not run very fast, with such a crowd round them—I could not say they ran away; the whole crowd went after them, because, I suppose, the agitators going after them, the crowd followed, as they usually do—I heard Cantwell's speech fairly well, considering the noise—I heard him say, "The working classes will not be depressed by the capitalists," and "We shall be heard of again"—after that he made some remarks about the Tower Bridge opening to-morrow; that was the next thing—he had said it before, but he brought it forward again—I am positive I did not hear the word "bomb" used by anybody—somebody called out "bomb," but it was not the prisoners—I did not hear any reference to Monsieur Carnot by anyone—Cantwell made some reference to France, saying "The Government of France has been oppressive, and other Governments will have to be come at in some way; we shall have to make them come to the working classes"—I did not hear him say, "M. Carnot, the Presi<lb/>dent of the Republic, has been assassinated, and there will have to be something of the same kind here, in order to get the working classes' rights"—I left the police in 1878, because I lost a sister-in-law who was on board the <hi rend="italic">Princess Alice</hi>, and I went to the Inspector and asked him to let me off that night, to make arrangements, and he would not allow me of, and so I took leave, and I was compelled to resign.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was a rush upon him—if he had excited the public to murder he would not have been living, and in the dock now—the prisoners both ran away, and so would you if they had tried to kill you—the crowd ran after them—I went about my business—I went to Lockhart's for my tea a little after four, and then made a note of the speeches—at any public meeting I go to I take a bit of a note; it is a hobby of mine—I have been at a few meetings, not on Tower Hill—I was at the back of the crowd; there might have been more than 400 people—there was more shouting than disturbance—I cannot say why the crowd said the prisoners ought to be taken before Mr. Justice Hawkins.</p>

I am a commercial traveller, of 125, Randolph Street—on June 29th, the day before the opening of the Tower Bridge, I heard Cantwell speak—he did not incite to murder anybody—I went to Tower Hill on business, and was there from one to 2.10 or 2.15—I do not know either of the prisoners—I saw a notice in the Echo from Mr. Bam<lb/>ford, saying that if anybody happened to be there, to come forward and state what they heard, and my wife said it was my duty to go—I stood in front of the speakers during the meeting, about the fourth row from the parapet—I heard all Cantwell's speech—I did not hear him say, "The deeds that have been done are not half bad enough in extent" re<lb/>ferring to the assassination of M. Carnot, or "We must make war against the blood-suckers, "or" Plenty will be served the same in England," or "It will be necessary to remove the heads of States," or "Bombs shall be used," or "They have done a good thing assassinating Carnot"—I heard, "What about Carnot?" shouted out as an interruption to his address—I have it on my memory because I was anxious to know how anybody could justify the murder of Carnot—he said, "There are fanatics in every cause, and I am not here to defend them"—I have no recollection of hearing him say, "We shall be heard again and again"—I did not hear him say, "There are plenty willing to die, and I will lead them if they will follow"—I did not see either of the prisoners distributing pamphlets—I heard the whole of Quin's speech; he was not so long speaking as Cantwell—the first words he said were, "I stand here as a Christian Anarchist," and he went on to speak of the orphans of those who lost their lives in building the bridge which was going to be opened the following day, and quoted a few lines from Edward Carpenter and Shelley, and some Biblical quota<lb/>tions in reference to Christ—he said he was a Christian Anarchist, and that Christ said, "Suffer little children to come unto me," and he was only speaking on behalf of the helpless orphans and widows—I did not hear him say, "Further than France we shall be heard of again"—I never heard any justification from either of them of the assassination of Carnot—I did not hear the word "bomb," or "I hate the Royal Family"—he did not, at the end of his speech, say, "D—the Queen."</p>

I am the wife of George Pollard, of 27, Costa Street—the deceased and Hampton stayed at my house from June 2nd to 19th as man and wife, passing as Mr. and Mrs. Freeman—the prisoner came on 18th June, and again about half-past ten on the morning of 19th—the deceased was not in then—he asked for her as Mrs. Freeman—I told him she was not in—he said, "She promised to be at home by appointment this morning"—he said he would call again, and went away—he came back in about an hour, about half-past eleven—he told me the day before her name was not Freeman—he said he was sorry she was not in, and he told me for the first time he was her husband—he said he gave her 4s. 6d. towards the rent last week—when he said he was her husband I was surprised, and said, "You had better take her home, for she cannot stop</p>

               <p>here"—he said, "I suppose not"—I said, "Would you take her back?"—he hesitated a moment, and said, "I am afraid things have gone too far," and then he said, "Yes, I would take her back, for I care for the woman, for I love her dearly"—he said he would not mind if she was living with a man who could keep her, but that man could not, and it worried him so thinking about her and thinking she wanted.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 8, Huguenot Road, Peckham, and am a tailor—about 112.30 on 19th June I went into the Atwell Arms—the prisoner, the deceased, and Hampton were there; I went into the same compartment—the prisoner was sitting in the corner on the right-hand side of me, and the deceased next to him by his side, and Hampton was on the opposite side, on the left, facing them—I ordered some drink, and drank it at the bar—two little girls came in—while I was drinking I heard the prisoner mumble something to the woman; I could not hear what it was, and I heard her say, "No, no," two or three times—I thought I heard her laugh when Hampton wiped the little girl's nose—I did not hear her say anything else—I heard a movement and turned round, and saw the prisoner with his hand up to his top breast-coat pocket—I could not say whether he had anything in his hand—the woman was sitting on the chair; she looked at me and put her right hand up to her breast, and fell forward off the chair—the prisoner said, "I have done it, and I will suffer"—Hampton went out; I could not say whether he said anything—I did not hear him speak to the prisoner or his wife while he was there—I went out and spoke to a policeman.</p>

I keep the Atwell Arms, Atwell Road, Peckham—on June 19th I served three people with beer, and then I left that part of the bar—I came back in a few minutes, and saw the deceased, who was on the floor leaning against a chair, and partly supported by the prisoner, who was sitting on the chair against which she rested—I thought she had fainted, and asked him if she was in a faint or a fit—he answered, "I have killed her"—I said, "Don't be foolish; give me a straight for<lb/>ward answer"—I did not think he was serious—he repeated the same words, and said, "You will soon know, as the police will soon be here"—I offered to assist him; he made an off-hand remark, when the constable came in and stopped the conversation—after the constable came in I saw the prisoner take the knife from his outside left-hand breast pocket, and hand it to the constable.</p>

About 12.45 on June 19th I was on fixed point duty at the Triangle, Rye Lane—someone spoke to me, and I went to the Atwell Arms—in the private bar I saw the deceased on the ground in a sitting position, and the prisoner was sitting on a chair close by her, with her head leaning against his knees—I asked him what was the matter—he said, "I have murdered this woman"—taking this knife from his left-hand overcoat pocket, he said, "This is what I did it with"—I saw that the woman was bleeding and unconscious; she did</p>

I am a medical practitioner, at 204, Rye Lane—at 12.45 on June 191 was called to the Atwell Arms—the deceased was lying on the floor of the bar, on her back—she was dead—the prisoner was sitting on a chair—I recognised him, as I had treated his father—I examined the woman—while I was fastening up her clothes again the prisoner said, "Cannot you do anything for her, doctor?"—I said, "No, I fear she is beyond my help"—he said, "Is she dead?"—I said, "Yes"—the prisoner turned scarlet, and tears came into his eyes—he asked if he might be allowed to kiss her—I said, "Certainly," and he kissed her—he said, "She had a good home and a good husband, but she would go with that" I think, "beast of a fellow"—I am not quite sure of the word; I did not catch it—I made a post-mortem examination—I found an incised wound on the left side of the chest, penetrating the heart; it would necessarily be fatal—in my opinion that wound was the cause of death—it might be made with this knife.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer, of 35, Birdhurst Road, Wandsworth, and manage that department at Messrs. Arding and Hobbs, of Clapham Junction—early in July the prisoner called on me to take some property into our hands for collection of rent and general arrangements of a house in Orville Road, Battersea—after a little time he said he wanted a small advance on the security of the collection of the rents—I said we could not entertain that—he said, "Why?"—I said, "That is no security"—we received letters from him—this is one of them. (<hi rend="italic">Dated July 6th, stating that he had a house at Battersea let in three flats at 35*. and 41*. 6d. a week, upon which he requested a loan of £25, and stated that he teas coming into property value £300 a year</hi>)—he said the lease was 90 years at £7 ground rent, and that there was a rent due which he would pay—I also received this letter from him, (<hi rend="italic">Dated July 10th, regretting that they did not see their way to oblige him, as if they had done so he should have given them the management of his oilier property; and in another letter of July 12th stating that he would take £15 and guarantee the rent of 14s. 6d. a week, paying it himself if the premises were empty</hi>)—I do not think I saw him between July 12th and 31st, when I received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Offering to deposit the lease if they would let him have £30 instead of £25, he paying the rent and ground rent</hi>)—we had made no agreement to advance him £25—I then made an appoint<lb/>ment for him to call, which he did on August 3rd, and I took him to Mr. Arding—he produced this lease of 33, Orville Road, which pur<lb/>ports to be from Emily Bridgwater—Mr. Arding looked through it, and it was arranged that he should deposit it with us, and receive the £.30 less the amount of the rate—he was given this cheque for £27 12s. 6d., and we took this promissory note for £35 on demand—it is marked, "No account"—we went on collecting the rents; he wrote this letter authorising us to do so, in my office—after the promissory note came back I made inquiries, and, on May 24th or 25th, Messrs.

My husband is a cellarman, of 88, South Lambeth Road—I had a newspaper business at 6, Hockington Road—I got to know the prisoner by her coming there as a customer before August, 1890—she said she was a widow and had mortgaged her property for seven years, and would positively be in possession of it in June, 1891—she said the property was in Westbourne, and in one of the squares—she spoke of her cousin, Colonel Dickenson, and Mr. Nathanial Cox, of Cherry Gardens, Kensington, as co-trustees of her property, and said that Mr. Cox was going to intercede with someone to get her property before June—I believed her statement—on August 8th she gave me this letter (<hi rend="italic">Asking the witness to lend her</hi> £1, <hi rend="italic">for which she would give a promissory note for</hi> £2)—I let her have £1, and she gave me this note for £2—after that she called and said she was going to Liverpool about her property, and brought me a letter from Mr. Cox advising her to go, and asked me to advance her the money to go—I believed that the letter was from Mr. Cox, and advanced her £10—she wrote to me from Bond's Hotel, Liverpool, for more money, and I sent her £5—on September 2nd she wrote asking me for £5, and I sent her £4—she was sometimes a day or two on 1 in the date of her letters, but she acknowledged the £4 and the £5—on September 1st she wrote asking me for £20—I was not in a position to send it, but sent her £7 in a registered letter, which she acknowledged—later in September I sent her £2, and afterwards £3—she said she had gone to Birkenhead to meet Mr. Cox—I wrote to him there, and the letter came back through the Dead Letter Office—I told her about that, and she said that he had been upset by having insolent letters sent to him, and he would not take in any more; but she would write to him, and beg him to write to me—on November 11th I got what I believed to be a letter from Mr. Cox. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated November 11th, and stated that the moment his physician would permit him to go out he would pay all claims, and said</hi>, "If you can oblige Miss F. with £3 it will be worth your while; she will be able to pay a fair £1,000 sterling in a few months")—I believed that to be a genuine letter—on December 24th I let her have 30s. more—she applied again, but I could not let her have it, but gave her 10s. weekly till it amounted to £6—I had other letters of the same sort of Mr. Cox, from Chenies Gardens, Chelsea—in January I made her a further advance of £6—she spoke to me continually explaining how the delay was—I also advanced her £2 10s. to enable her to go to Birming<lb/>ham—I wanted to see Mr. Cox, and she took me to 17, Chenies Gardens, and said, "Wait at the gate; I will go in and see if he is disengaged, and I will call you"—she knocked at the door and a servant came—she came, back and said, "Mr. Cox is called away on business"—I believed that—a proposal was made to purchase my business, and I received a letter from Mr. Cox asking me not to sell it, as he wanted to buy it for a friend—he obtained from me £40 10s.—I am certain of that—she disappeared about June, 1891, and I heard no more of her till she was in custody.</p>
