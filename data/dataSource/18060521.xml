On the 29th of April, about half after nine in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180605210004"/>the morning, her box had been opened before I came, and some spoons had been found in the box, which were delivered to me, the linen I found myself in the box; I searched her pocket and took out this pocket book and the broach; I asked her where she got it, she said that she found the pocket book and the broach when she was sweeping a room, between two and three years ago; I then asked her where she got the spoons, she told me that she bought them at a pawnbroker's in Red cross-street, and gave five shillings or five shillings and three pence for them; I asked her where she got the linen from, she said she had them left her by an aunt of hers; the letters has been picked out, but there is very plain the remainder of the V, on the tablecloth; on the towel there is the remains of the V, and the number 18, on it.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) Are these things your property. - A. With respect to the linen I cannot venture to swear to, but as to the spoons I have no doubt at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there on the linen any mark. - A. Yes, the towel has a V and the figure 18.</p>
               <p>Q. Your surname does begin with a V. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know whether your linen was so marked. - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the habit of having your linen marked with the initials of your name, and numbered. - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. From the circumstance of being marked with a V and numbered, do you believe they are yours. A. I verily believe they are, I cannot take upon me to say positively, but I have no doubt in my own mind that the table-cloth and the napkin are mine; with respect to the table cloth we have some of the same identical pattern that I remember in use, but I own that it is not decisive; the spoons I venture to swear positively are mine, they are particularly marked, and I think I know their faces from the frequent use of them; the desert spoon is marked with the crest of a mermaid, the tea spoon has a

             under the Hall mark, at the back of the spoon, they were missed at the time the prisoner was in my service, and great search was made for them; it is our practise to have the plate put into a particular place every night.</p>

             sworn. I am clerk to Mr. Vandercombe and reside in his house; the broach which was produced I am perfectly confident is my property; the pocket book I believe to be mine, the broach was enclosed inside of the pocket book when I lost it, the pocket book has been very much worn since and defaced, I lost it shortly after it was given to me, I put it in my drawers in my bed room in Mr. Vandercombe's house: I do not know that my drawers were always locked.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked up the pocket book when I was sweeping up the room after the carpenters had done working in the room, the young gentleman moved out of his room into another room, I did not consider the pocket book of any value, I thought it was to be thrown away; that gold pin I never noticed was in the pocket book; as for the spoons I gave five shillings and ninepence for them, they have been in my possession near five years, I bought them at a pawnbroker's in Red-cross-street, the table linen has been mine fifteen years, before I ever saw Mr. Vandercombe.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) Whether this is possible to be true that she should have the plate and the linen in the way she states. - A. The linen she says she has had fifteen years; I cannot say any more than I have, it may possibly be the case, but with respect to the spoons they have been in my house before April 1805.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was she in your service. - A. Only two months.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner live near you. - A. Yes, in the same house in the three pair of stairs room, and I lived in the two pair of stairs. On the 19th of April I went down to Margate, and I returned on the 26th; I missed my property on the 28th, I took a clean striped cotton shirt to a pawnbroker's, and asked him if he had got any striped cotton shirts or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180605210005"/>handkerchiefs pawned at his house in the course of the week, he told me had one, it had been fetched out half an hour before I came there, I went to another pawnbroker's, he told me that two of the handkerchiefs that I had described were fetched out that morning, and he had one left, I asked him to stop the person that pawned them and send to me, which he did, and the prisoner was taken to the office in Marlborough-street; after that she owned to the three handkerchiefs and the two shirts that she had taken out of my box.</p>
               <p>- ROBERTS sworn. I live at No. 25, Great Windmill-street, I keep a sale shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar, did you ever see her before. - A. I think so, she came to me on the 28th of April with an old check shirt, said her husband had gone to sea and left her, I told her it was not good enough; she asked me if I bought silk handkerchiefs, she had the ticket of three in her hand, she said she would bring them, instead of bringing three she brought but two, a cotton handkerchief and a silk one; I produce them; I am sure I had them of the prisoner. (The property identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in distress when I took them, I had not a bit of bread to eat for my child nor myself.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

             sworn. On Sunday the 27th of April myself in company with Stanton and Wood, two brother officers were going down Saffron Hill, I saw a number of Irish people collected together, I then informed my brother officers there was a noise amongst the Irish people and that we would go down and quell them; when I got there I heard the last witness tell the prisoner that he had been knocked down and robbed of his hat, and that he had got his hat on his head, the prisoner tried to strike the prosecutor, and would if he could have got at him; I heard first of all the word, police officers, by some of the Irish people who were standing around; we were all three around him at that time, he attempted to run away, I ran through the mob, and got hold of him by the collar; I then took off the hat and told Wood to hide it, and not to let the prosecutor see what marks there were about it, Stanton took hold of the other side of him, we then led him away; going along, the prosecutor said it was his hat, there had been some paint dropped on the top of it which had been scraped off, the hat was so marked as he has described; I handcuffed him, and thought he was secure, then he made his escape and ran away, we caught him again with the handcuffs on; I took this hat from the prosecutor, this is the hat the prisoner left behind; the prisoner said this was his own hat that he had left behind, and that he had picked up the prosecutor's hat by accident. (This is the prosecutor's hat, and here is the place as he has described.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my hat.</p>

I was going down Field-lane on Saturday night, I saw a row before me, when I came up I was knocked down, and my hat fell off, and I picked up the first hat I could, I do not know whether that is the hat or no, I was drunk, I did not know what I was doing of, I was going home.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) You have no doubt of that lead being yours. - A. I have not the least doubt in the world.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was along with a few relations, it was late before I came home, I went up stairs and pulled my shoes off; I was taken so bad with a pain in my bowels, I came down to ease myself, I saw a man run away; before I could get my breeches unbuttoned the watchman came and took me to the watchhouse.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been in the habit of receiving orders for Mr. Harrison, whatever order I received from Miss Clift, or any other person's order, I entered down in my book; during the time I was at Mr. Thresher's, Mr. Harrison came after me, he wished to get me away, he knew I had a good connection, and during the time I was in his house he never went round to one customer, I have even given him the money in public company, he has been the person that has introduced me into company, (for singing) which has been my ruin.</p>

             sworn. I am a shoe binder, I live at No. 16, Peter-street, Bishopsgate-street, Without. On the 12th of May the prisoner came to me and asked me if I would go with her and buy a gown, and to pay so much a week, I told her I bought things of Mr. Tray, I took her to his shop, and after the gentleman had taken down two pieces of cotton I saw my young master coming, I followed my master, he went to my room, and I went after him, I forgot to go back to the person I had left in the shop: I had been home ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before I found that she had taken this bit of cotton.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Phillips) You had not agreed to let her have a gown to pay so much a week. - A. I had not.</p>

             sworn. I live at No. 60, Skinner street, Bishopsgate street. On Tuesday fortnight I sat at my back window that looked into Acorn alley, it joins Bullen alley; I saw the prisoner Blake with the leather on his back, I saw him go into Bullen yard with it, and pitch it into the house of one Richardson.</p>
               <p>Blake. I admit that I had the leather; I look upon it impossible from where she represents she lives, for her to see me go into Bullen alley, as it is for any gentleman in this court to see St. Paul's.</p>

I saw him go to the back part of the house and pull out from the boards a bullock's hide, which I produce; I then turned round to Dodson, and outside of the door I saw Blake, I brought him in; I then asked Dodson how the leather came there, he told me that Blake had brought it there; Blake denied it, and he said he knew nothing at all about it, I then handcuffed them, and brought them and the property away.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Dodson. - A. He was once a respectable man in our parish and kept a public house; he sells braces now about the street.</p>

             sworn. I am an officer. On the 6th of May I received information that a hide of leather was carried into this alley by the prisoner Blake, into the house where the prisoner Dodson was, I applied to Mr. Sapwell, we went to the house of Dodson the prisoner, Dodson was then sitting at the door with the child in his arms; in going to the back part of the shop I found the hide covered over with two shutters and a basket, I took the hide up; Sapwell instantly secured the prisoner Dodson; at the instant of securing him, Blake made his appearance outside of the door, Sapwell also secured him, we brought the hide and the prisoners away. (The hide identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Blake's Defence. On the 6th of May last, coming from Bilingsgate (I am a porter, and get my bread at various markets, and sometimes at Bilingsgate, I have a wife and three small children), I had left my basket at Bilingsgate; a man at the corner says, porter, do you want a job, I says yes, he agreed to give me a couple of shillings to take it to the Blue-Coat Boy, he said he was not in a hurry, I might take it at my leisure; I goes home to leave what supply I had, my wife was not at home. That man is totally innocent, you may depend upon it; I asked him to let me leave it there till I found my children; I went to the prisoner's house to buy some potatoes after I had found my children.</p>
               <p>Q. Now where is the man that gave you this to carry. - A. I never saw the man from that time to this; frequently as I go along the street I carry things of this sort.</p>
               <p>Dodson's Defence. I can say no more; he came in and asked me liberty to put it there while he looked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180605210011"/>for his children, it remained there during half an hour; during that time Mr. Sapwell came in, I told him Mr. Blake brought it.</p>
               <p>Blake. The officer seems to tell you as how the hide was secreted and covered over; I pitched it in the shop, I assure you.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell the officer you knew nothing at all about it. - A. If I did, my lord, at the time, it was from the agitation of my mind.</p>
               <p>Blake called no witnesses to character.</p>
               <p>Dodson called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you observed any Mocoa coffee in that warehouse. - A. Yes, and there was one bale cut, and there seemed to be three or four pounds gone; as he was going out of the door I said I was going to rub our gang down, he appeared confused in my rubbing him down, in two small pockets hanging quite behind, I felt something like coffee, I told him he must go with me to the elder's office, he immediately answered, pray Mr. Soul do not take me there, for God's sake, do not; on being taken there an officer was sent for; in his pocket was found one pound seven ounces of coffee.</p>
               <p>- BURGESS sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are the King's locker. - A. Yes, I found the coffee in the possession of the prisoner, it weighs one pound seven ounces, it is Mocoa coffee.</p>

In the morning I hung up my coat about eight o'clock, I never was nigh it till after three o'clock, I know not how the coffee was put in my pocket, there was nothing in my pocket when I hung it up; I said for God's sake do not say this coffee is in my pocket, it is unknown to me.</p>

               <p>Q. You had worn them twice and injured the value of them to a purchaser. - A. I might.</p>
               <p>Q. These breeches are a common colour, you stated that you knew them by a white calico lining, a little spot, and a white metal button, did you ever see any breeches lined with any other calico than white, there is nothing peculiar in their having white calico lining. - A. I do not know; the last time I wore them I rode to Windsor and back again, the lining doubled under my seat, I found the inconvenience of it, in consequence of which I wore them higher, and the front button was torn out, and it is torn out now.</p>
               <p>Court. These are very common sort of breeches. - A. I should not have taken notice of them except from the circumstances I have mentioned.</p>

             sworn. I am one of the patroles belonging to Bow-street; we apprehended the prisoner on the 11th of this month, he had the breeches on him, he is detained for something else.</p>
               <p>Court. (to prosecutor) What was the amount of your loss. - A. It cannot be less than between two and three hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor in one place observed that there is a button which is nearly coming off, which supports the gallowses, which is in consequence of his wearing his breeches so high; when I had these breeches this button was perfectly fast, and it is lose now, in consequence of the heavy irons they put on me at Bow-street; I purchased these breeches promiscuously, in the middle of the street of a Jew, I saw them hanging across the man's arm, they attracted my attention seeing them a good pair of breeches, to the best of my knowledge I gave twenty-three shillings for them, if they are stole it is unknown to me.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Lavender.) Had he heavy irons on before you took off the breeches. - A. Yes, he had an iron on about a week, and he wore these breeches, because we knew nothing about them breeches.</p>

             saw it, I asked them whether they intended to murder me, I took a hair broom, and said if they did not let me out, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180605210016"/>would break the windows.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the woman that you picked up assist. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to make such an effort as that while you were in the room three hours. - A. I did, I called the watchman, when I was up stairs the watchman knocked at the door; when I said I would break the windows if they would not let me out, Ranger took me by the shoulders, opened the door, and pushed me out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask for the two pound note. - A. No, at the time that I was put into the court, I called the watchman again.</p>
               <p>Q. What court was it. - A. Marygold court, in the Strand; the watchman came to my assistance, he knocked at the door and was refused admittance; he advised me to go to St. Martin's watchhouse, and relate the story to the constable of the night, which I did, the constable came from the watchhouse with me to the house, he knocked and was refused admittance; I told him the situation I was in, and all the circumstance, he saw how my shirt was torn and my hand was bleeding; when he knocked they said Mr. Ranger was gone out and they had lost the key, they could not open the door; we heard Ranger talking to some of the women.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this. - A. That was after two o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What o'clock was it when you first went. - A. About a quarter before eleven; the constable went away and desired me and the watchman to remain at the door till he should return, he returned to the watchman and me, we waited at the door till half after six, at last a man came out of the house, we then gained admittance; we went up stairs and found the woman prisoner in bed with her clothes on, the constable took her into custody, and returned down stairs and knocked at Ranger's door, he refused opening it, a girl came from the back parlour and told him if he went through her room there was a little door with a bolt, he might go into it, which he did and found Ranger in bed; after we had got him in custody, he asked leave to go into the yard, the constable gave him leave (he had not quite dressed himself), instead of going in the yard he went up stairs and made off out of the back of the house, and was missing for about a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your note again. - A. No, I did not see it after it dropped on the ground.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. You picked up up this girl and went into Marygold court. - A. She picked me up.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you had been in the room some time before she and you had a dispute. - A. I had not been there above five or ten minutes before the dispute began, I offered her a compliment, but she did not think that was enough; there was some words between us, but there was no disturbance.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Ranger came up upon being called, and after he had been there a little while he returned down again. - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then this woman put herself against the door, and vowed you should not go till you had paid her what she demanded. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You got down stairs after being there about three hours. - A. Yes, when I got down stairs Mr. Ranger locked the door, Mrs. Gamble came down stairs as the mistress of the house, she vowed I should not go any farther without paying immediately; she saw the note in my hand, she put my hand into her mouth and bit it.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that Mrs. Gamble at that time knew that you had a two pound note in your hand. - A. I certainly could not swear to that, I believe she knew it by her attempting to bite me, I resisted by striking her.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether with the pain that you received from the bite the note did not drop on the floor. - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how the note went. - A. I should naturally suppose that she took it out of my hand, I can only venture to swear I lost it there.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, will you venture to swear that Mr. Ranger knew any thing at all of your having a two pound note. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Ranger called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a watchman of Cripplegate Within.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you upon your beat on the 17th day of April last. - A. I was; on that morning, at the hour of half past four, I went by this warehouse, and took particular notice (I had a great charge upon me of taking care of this warehouse); I found every thing safe, and the padlock was on the door.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you try the padlock. - A. Yes, it was safe as far as I know; I went to the watchhouse and resigned my coat and lanthorn, and about five o'clock I went round again; on my going on to cry the hour of five o'clock, I observed a hackney coach draw up to the warehouse door, I took particular notice of the number, 146, it was a yellow bodied coach, I directly walked down to see what they were about, I had great suspicions that it was a robbery, I saw the property put into the coach, by the coachman and another person who is not here.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know the coachman. - A. Yes, I took particular observation of the person of the coachman, the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner and the other person bringing the property from. - A. From the warehouse of Messrs. Garcias and Lewis; I attempted to follow the coach, to see where these goods were deposited, I could see nobody in the street, the watchmen were all off their beats; I followed the coach as far as Jewin-street, and then he drove at such a last rate that I lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not you get up behind it. - A. Yes, but I was afraid he would give me a cut or two.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the coachman again. - A. On the Friday following I saw the prisoner at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner, whom you saw at Bow-street, the person that you saw drive the coach on that morning. - A. I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. What quantity had been put in the coach, do you know. - A. I could not tell, I suppose I saw eight or ten large parcels put into the coach.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a watchman, you say you saw the coach at the prosecutor's warehouse, how many persons did you see at the warehouse. - A. I only saw one besides the coachman.</p>
               <p>Q. What time do the watchman go off their beat. - A. At five o'clock, at that time there is no watchman to be seen.</p>
               <p>Q. But there were some people going to work. - A. Not at that part.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you read. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the number of the coach was 246. - A. No. 146.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen the coachman before. - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from the place when you saw the things put in the coach. - A. I suppose about an hundred yards, I walked nearer the coach when I saw the number, I was opposite the coach when it drove in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not make any alarm. - A. No, I could not see any body, I made an alarm, so far, I went and told the constable of the night.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the coach drive up to the door, why did not you go to the watchhouse and get assistance. - I was afraid the coach would get off.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL TAUNTON sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am an officer of Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. From information that you received, did you apprehended the prisoner. - A. I did, in company with Townshend, on the 17th of April last, at No. 20, William's Mews, Devonshire-street, Portland Place, between nine and ten o'clock at night; when the prisoner opened the door I informed him that we were two officers, that I suspected he had some property that did not belong to him, he replied that he had nothing but what he worked hard for, and paid for, and that we were welcome to search any part of his premises that we liked; we went up one pair of stairs and searched two rooms and a hay lost, and found nothing, I then came down stairs and and searched the stable, and inside of the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the number of the coach. - A.146, a yellow bodied coach; I then renewed my search up stairs, and opened a window of a back room (his bed room), there was a kind of blind which went up two foot from the lower part of the window, sloping in this way (witness describing); I pushed up the window, and there I found two pieces in paper, and two pieces out of paper, there was four pieces altogether; I then told the prisoner that was what I was looking for, I asked him where he got it, he told me that he found them in his coach when he came home at five o'clock; in the afternoon on the Friday following he was examined at Bow-street, and this property was identified by Mr. Macalpine. The prisoner is the owner of the coach, he told me he had only one pair<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180605210020"/>of plates, he drove them himself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (to Macalpine) Look at that muslin, is that one of the four pieces that were missing on that day - A. I believe it to be, I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was called by a person in Cheapside, at two o'clock in the morning, he ordered me to Finsbury-square, he stopped me at Moorgate, there a person came to the coach, he said something, what I do not know, to the man in the coach; I was desired to go up Chiswell-street, I waited there two hours, when a parcel was brought to the coach; I went away according to his directions, he ordered me to 61, Smithfield, when I got there he stopped the coach again, he ordered me to go to Back Hill, when I got there he pointed to the place opposite of the hill, that leads to Clerkenwell Green, there he went out with the things, he told me he should be back again to pay me my fare; I waited there a considerable time, and during the time I waited I got into the coach, and on my sitting down in the straw I put my arm on the parcel; I waited, no person coming to me, I went home, I informed my wife that I had had a job and had not got my fare; I described the person, saying, that if he called by that description, there was his property; it was on my drawers, I went out with the coach the same day.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was you at five o'clock in the morning. - A. I was not home till half after five.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you at five. - A. I was in Fore-street then.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Who had the dial under his arm. - A. I cannot say, it was under the arm of one of them, I was so terrified I cannot say, I hallooed out, and these two gentlemen went out and they were taken.</p>

             sworn. I was coming by with a prisoner at the same time Mr. Warren was in at Mrs. Molloy's, Warren called to me, I stepped into Molloy's shop to speak to Warren, mean while Foley and Aris came by, I knew them, I drew back and secreted myself in Mrs. Molloy's shop, I said Mrs. Molloy, there are two thieves, they are going to rob you, step out, you will see what they are about; they went into the next door, and took the time piece out of the shop; Mrs. Molloy says, come out, they have got it. Warren and I followed them down the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180605210022"/>Hampshire Hog yard, and I believe it was Aris, the smallest prisoner, that flung away the pedestal; I picked it up, Warren pursued and overtook Foley, and apprehended him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the clock. - A. I cannot say; when Warren laid hold of Foley it was in a narrow passage, I could not get by them; Aris ran away and got off; they were both in company together.</p>
               <p>JOHN WARREN sworn. Q. You are an officer. A. I am; on the 25th of April I went to Mrs. Molloy's house to buy a pair of shoes, and whilst I was fitting them on I saw Mr. Blackman over the way, I called to him, he came into Mrs. Molloy's, he had not been in the house two minutes before he saw the two prisoners at the bar looking in Mrs. Molloy's window, Blackman says there is two thieves, take care Mrs. Molloy else you will be robbed, she immediately went out of doors and looked about, she had not been out half a minute before she cried out they had got it; I immediately ran out of the house and followed both of the prisoners into the Hampshire Hog yard, I think it was Aris that threw away the pedestal, I did not stop to pick it up, I pursued them and took Foley in the little court.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any thing in his hands. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the time piece nobody knows. A. No.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HARTWELL sworn. I only know that this is my property; this is the pedestal of the time piece, I lost the time piece and the pedestal altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find the time piece. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see it. - A. On the morning of the 25th of April, before I went to work.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that to be a part of the time piece you left in your shop when you went out. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that worth. - A. The pedestal is not worth any thing; I suppose the time piece and that altogether was worth about ten or twelve shillings; I am sure the pedestal is mine.</p>

            . I am an officer belonging to the police office, Hatton Garden. On Friday the 2nd of May two watchmen brought this woman in custody from Hampstead with four hen fowls and two Guinea fowls alive, there is two of them dead since; there are some alive now, I produce them. I asked the prisoner how she came by them, she said that a man gave her them that she formerly lived with, that he had not money to support her, he gave her these fowls to make money of, she said he was a clerk, and had taken them from his master's house, about four mile in the Hampstead road, near the sign of the Swan; I went down there, and after several enquiries I found the fowls belonged to Mr. Clive; I asked the last witness, he said they had lost fowls, he claimed them; I then found that she had lived with the last witness's brother, I traced him at about two miles distance from that place, I took him in custody; upon her examination again, when he was there, she was asked that question by the magistrate; she said no person was concerned with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180605210023"/>her, she took them herself; I told her she was a very bad woman to involve an innocent man, she said she was very sorry for it, she was afraid she should be hung; she would not tell where she lived, she said it was of no use of my going to search her box.</p>
               <p>- FRENCH sworn. I am one of the watchmen of the town of Hampstead. On Friday morning the 2d of May at half past three, I observed this prisoner coming about an hundred yards before me, she shunned me as she went across the road, she had a pack at her back, I stopped her and found it contained a little hamper, with a saucepan at the top, I took the lid off the top, and found it contained a dead fowl inside of it, I took the basket from her, and there I observed the Guinea hens, I asked her a few questions, I could get nothing from her, I put her in the watchhouse that night, in the morning I brought her down to Hatton Garden.</p>
               <p>Stuchfield. I know this Guinea-hen by a bit of string round the leg, it had this bit of string round the leg when it was stolen; they are all my master's property.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence, nor called any witnesses to character.</p>

On the 16th of this month about three o'clock in the morning, as I came from Twickenham fair, I saw the man at the bar come out of my father's poultry house, I catched hold of him by the collar in my father's farm yard; I said what business have you here, he instantly chucked this bag with three hens and three ducks over the gate; I asked him what he had got there, he said he did not know, I took him back and called the servant up, while I went and got this bag; I went directly, and found this parcel over the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. What did that parcel contain. - A. Three hens and three ducks, they were all tied up, I put him in the washhouse, I produce one hen; I know this was the hen that brought up some young ducks, I heard the young ducks hallooe, which gave me the alarm, I knew them all, they were all warm.</p>

I had been to this fair with gingerbread and nuts, I got a little drop of beer, I went into the farm yard about eleven o'clock, and about two o'clock, to the best of my knowledge, I was going to come home; a man hallooed out what have you got there, I said I only came to lay down and no harm to you; when I was coming just about five or six yards from the gates he laid hold of me by the collar, and says what did you do there over that gate, I said nothing, he took me to the house and called the men up and his father; now says he I will go and fetch a constable; the constable came about three o'clock and put me in the cage; I am innocent of that charge.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I saw him with the bag in his hand before he threw it over, I saw him throw it over, and I saw him come out of the poultry house, he had no time to go from me.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon her telling this story of her having the goods from William Lake he was taken up. - A. Yes, he was tried for stealing them.</p>
               <p>Q. He was tried, convicted, and sentenced to be transported. - A. Yes, that good woman was not well at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What was found in possession of the prisoner. A. Six pair of shoes.</p>

               <p>Q. She said at the police office that Lake was a servant of yours, and that he lodged in the same house with the prisoner. - A. Yes, and as you press me so close I must say that she knew they were stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. That is your conclusion; this poor woman was taken up, the magistrate admitted her to bail. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The reason that she did not appear last session was, because she was far advanced in pregnancy, she was brought a-bed lately, and this session she comes here voluntarily. - A. Yes.</p>

On the 24th of February I was fetched by Mr. Page the pawnbroker, saying he supposed there was a woman in his shop with some stolen shoes, he could discern the marks on the toes of the shoes had been scratched off; in our way to his shop we saw the woman coming with the shoes wrapped up in her apron; we watched her to Mr. Armstrong's in Baldwin's Gardens, she went in at the shop door and we went in at the private door; I went round the shop and stood a little behind her, while Mr. Armstrong and she were discoursing about the shoes; Mr. Armstrong asked her who made the shoes, she said her husband, I then told her I should take her in custody and the shoes likewise, I suspected they were stolen; going along I asked her where she lived, she hummed and sung to herself, and seemed quite saucy; she says you know, why do you ask me this question; after I got her to the office she did then say that she lived in a court on Saffron Hill; I went there and was informed there was one Lake a shoemaker lived in the house, and one Tiller a hackney coachman lived in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180605210024"/>the same house.</p>

               <p>Q. To sell for him. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In going to the house did you find Lake there. - A. Yes, and I found some more shoes in Lake's apartment in a box, I was obliged to break it open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find where the prisoner's apartment was. - A. On the next floor in the same house, I found some new leather there, in a drawer, the prosecutor would not swear that they were his; I produce the shoes.</p>

             sworn. I am a pawnbroker, I live in Liquorpond-street. On the 24th of February, the prisoner brought a parcel of shoes to sell, I looked at them, and observed some marks had been scratched out of the toes, I told her they were not a kind of a shoe that I wanted; I took no farther notice, but went out of the shop to fetch an officer; I saw Trott on our return, I saw her coming from my shop, I pointed her out to Trott, we followed her to the shop of Mr. Armstrong, Trott there took her in custody; she brought all these shoes to my house to sell, I refused buying them; I had bought shoes of her before, and used to suppose that her husband made them, which I thought was Lake, he used to come to my shop.</p>
               <p>- ARMSTRONG sworn. Q. Do you remember the prisoner at the bar coming at any time to offer some shoes to sell. - A. Yes, on the 24th of February.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she the shoes with her. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do these appear to be the same shoes. - A. Yes, she offered to sell them in consequence of Mr. Trott following her; I asked her who made the shoes, she said her husband (I had bought shoes of her frequently); Mr. Trott immediately said, I suspect you have stolen them, and took her into custody.</p>
               <p>(The shoes identified by the prosecutor's workmen.)</p>

This young man (Lake) and his apprentice lodged in my house, they used to board with me, he had a deal of work on his own account; he used to cut out in my room, I used to go out of his errands, and carry home his work, he gave me these shoes, and asked me to sell them, which I did; Lake told the officer that I was the person he had sent with them; I should have appeared last sessions but I have laid in, I have five small children.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. You had a desk in which you kept your money, was that in your room. - A. It was in my sitting room; I had fifty-two guineas in gold in a purse in this desk.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you missed this property had you seen these fifty-two guineas. - A. I cannot precisely say, within a month I had looked at them.</p>
               <p>Q. On the day this woman was taken up did you miss any property out of this desk. - A. On examining the desk I found the guineas reduced to thirty.</p>
               <p>Q. You had locked your desk, and when you opened the desk, you found there was only thirty. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. You had not taken any out for your own use. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you miss at any time a silk handkerchief. - A. I did.</p>

               <p>Jury. Was the desk kept in a continual state of being locked up. - A. I always locked it, I am positive of it; the fifty-two guineas were in the purse altogether.</p>

               <p>RICHARD LOVETT sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am an officer of Marlborough-street; I went to the lodgings of Mr. Macdonald, and searched a box of the prisoner, on the 12th of this month.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was the prisoner's box. A It had been out of the house, and was brought back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you searched a box; in that box, let it belong to whom it will, did you find any thing, and what. - A. I found this silk handkerchief, the box was remarkably full of clothes and trinkets, the handkerchief and the trinkets I have here; one of the constables of Hanover-square had apprehended the prisoner, I fetched her out of the watchhouse, I asked her how she came by so many fine things, she said some of the trinkets she bought with some money she had from her brother, and the rest were bought with the money that she took from Mr. Macdonald's purse; she said she had spent it all; in her box I found a seven shilling piece and a crown, that was all the money that she had; I produce the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my handkerchief, it is marked J. M. No. 6, in the border, all my handkerchiefs are marked in the same way.</p>

             sworn. I live at No. 104, Whitecross-street, at Mr. Salmon's. On the 29th of April, the prisoner at the bar came to our shop, I believe about the middle of the day, to pledge a saw and three planes, I advanced him ten shillings on them.</p>

             sworn. I am a constable, I produce the saw, I received it from Mr. Salmon.</p>
               <p>Nelson. That is the saw I received from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am certain it is my saw, it is worth six or seven shillings, I was using the saw about an hour before I missed it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing at all about that saw; last Monday I went to pledge two saws of my own, and the first place I carried them to, a pawnbroker's in Chiswell-street, I told him I wanted seven shillings, he said that was too much, he would lend me six shillings, he said are they your own saws, I said yes, he said there is a young man has lost a saw, and it has been found in Whitecross-street; as this gentleman would not let me have seven shillings, I went to this gentleman's in Whitecross-street, I laid the two saws down on the counter, I told him I wanted seven shillings, he asked me my name, and I not telling him my own name, I happened to think of the name that that saw was pledged in; the pawnbroker says, have not you any tools here before, I said I have not, he said are you sure of that, he brings me this saw down, and asked me if I knew it, I said I did not, he detained me and sent for the prosecutor, that was the instigation of my being brought here.</p>
               <p>Nelson. In consequence of his bringing the two saws which he just mentioned, I sent for Torry, and his giving the same name, as he had done on the 29th of April, he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the prisoner brought that saw. A. I am certain that he is the identical man; he said it was his own property.</p>

               <p>ELIZABETH - sworn. I am servant to Mr. Kemshead. On the 28th of April as I sat at my dinner, about two o'clock, in the kitchen, I saw the prisoner shut the door three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner work in your house. - A. No, she came for the washing, she was in a room below in the house; seeing her shut the door three times, I went up the last time to see what she shut herself in for, the door had wooden panes and one pane was out, I looked through, I saw her take one silver spoon out of a glass that had wine and water in, it had just come out of the coffee room, she put it in her bosom, I ran and told the head waiter, the waiter told master, and master sent for her back.</p>
               <p>Q. When she put the spoon in her bosom she went away out of the house did she. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) You remember when the waiter told you that the spoon was lost. - A. I do, in consequence of that my waiter brought her back from the Swan, at Charing Cross, I immediately ordered a constable to be fetched, he came, and took up the prisoner.</p>
               <p>- CLEMENTS sworn. I am a constable. On the 28th of April, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was ordered at Mr. Kempshead's, to take the prisoner into custody; I searched her, and found these two spoons I now produce, they were twisted up in the corner of her apron which she held in her hand.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. One of the spoons is marked with a cross and a K, I am certain that is my spoon, with regard to the other, I will not swear to it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My mistress told me to make haste with the basket of clothes, and as I came back to bring one of the children with me, I brought two with me, I asked the cook for a little bit of bread and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180605210026"/>meat, I just shut the door after me while I eat some of it, then there was a parcel of dirty coarse kitchen cloths, which I put in my apron, as we never put them with the clean linen; the waiter came after me, he says you are wanted back, I went back with him, Mr. Kempshead told me to sit down, he locked the door, I says what is the matter, he says I do not know, but if it is true you may be transported; these cloths I laid down on the table, and when the constable came I took the cloths up in this hand, the constable searched me, and when he had done that, he takes these greasy cloths, and the two spoons fell out.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Clements) When you took the spoons from the prisoner at the bar, had she any thing in her hand but her apron rolled up. - A. There was no towel about her, there were only the two spoons in the corner of her apron; she was very loth to let me open her hand.</p>

On the 15th of May I came forward to send one of my servants of an errand, at the same time he accused her of taking something from the counter; I immediately said to her if she had not taken nothing she should not be blamed wrong, at the same time I insisted upon seeing whether she had or not; I looked over the counter on the floor, fearing she had dropped something there, I found nothing, I went round the counter and examined her minutely, and I saw the cloak laying at her feet.</p>
               <p>Q. What cloak was this. - A. A lace cloak; she had got her gown wrapped about her very much.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her take it. - A. I did not, there is a person here that did see her take it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. You say this cloak was laying at her feet on the floor where the prisoner stood. - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many cloaks laying on the counter at that time. - A. I cannot say myself, my servant says there were three.</p>
               <p>Q. Then whether it was thrown down by accident, or how, you cannot say, how long had the cloak been in the shop, was it an an old one or a new one. - A. It had been in my house about four or five months.</p>
               <p>Q. You have laid it in the indictment at forty shillings, you have given the prime cost, I presume. - A. I have no doubt but it cost me fifty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. After being in your shop about five months, must not your having kept it so long have lessened its value, you know that forty shillings would affect her life. - A. I have learned it since.</p>

Yes; the prisoner came to our house on the 15th of May, along with another woman to buy some lace, Mr. Brown's brother shewed them some, they could not agree for the price, they went out, they came back to me, as Mr. Brown's brother was not at hand, and said they would give a penny more a yard for the lace, I told them we could not take it; they stood talking to me while I was behind the counter folding the things up, but what they said to me I did not take any notice of; that woman turned her back towards me, I saw her take something off the counter.</p>

Yes, I asked her what she had got, she persisted that she had taken nothing; I had folded three lace cloaks up a few minutes before, I looked to see if they were all there, I found one of them was gone; they laid close to the prisoner's elbow on the counter, I saw her take something off the counter, but I could not see what it was she did it so quick, she drew it under her cloak into her gown; when I accused her of taking something, and she said that she had nothing, Mr. Brown came forward, he gave me a parcel to go out of an errand, and when I was going out of the door, the cloak was found laying close by her feet.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether it is not possible that she might have pulled the cloak down by accident. - A. No, it was not near the edge of the counter, it was about an inch from the edge of the counter, she had her right arm upon the counter, she did not move that to take the cloak, she took it with the left, she had her back towards me, and put her right on the counter; I believe she put her left hand so.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not see her. - A. No; I believe it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about the worth of this said cloak. - A. No, I had not been two hours in business.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. Very likely you had been asleep at that time. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to say you saw her take it up, what it was you do not know. - A. Not till it was found.</p>
               <p>Q. I should think you might, if you had not been asleep, told us what it was. - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. She denied it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And just at her feet, after you had been folding them, when you came round, there was one laying at her feet. - A. Mr. Brown found one at her feet.</p>
               <p>Court. It might be swept off the counter.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I looked over the counter when she was first accused; there was no such thing laying there.</p>

             put his hand upon the paper and draw it towards him, I took no more notice, I went to the other side of the shop, and he said in the shop about a quarter of an hour afterwards, then he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. When he went away did you perceive that parcel on the counter. - A. No, it was not on the counter, because I took and rubbed the counter down as soon as he was gone, because it was all over dust, and I was going to get my breakfast.</p>
               <p>Q. When did your master first come to know it was missing. - A. About half after three he came and enquired about the money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see Joseph put it in his pocket and take it away. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw him take it off the counter. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. It was about half past three before there was any enquiry about it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. By that time there was a great many customers in your shop. - A. I have no doubt but there was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave him in the shop. - A. When I went down stairs he came down after me, and when I came up he came up, and we left master down stairs; I had to tie up a couple of hats that he had bought of my master, and then he went away directly.</p>
               <p>Q. And this was after all had passed up stairs about the money. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.(to prosecutor) When did you first know that this money was missing. - A. After I had dined a customer came in to pay me a bill, he wanted change for a five pound note, I felt in my pocket, and I found that I I had not got any change, directly it struck me that this boy had not been to Mr. Pedders with this seven pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this. - A. I think it must be before three, because we were down at Whitechapel before four; when the boy came from breakfast I ordered him to wipe the windows, it struck me that I should have to go into the city, I thought no more of the seven pounds after that till I wanted to give this gentleman change; I says boy, give me that seven pounds, says he, I have not got it sir, I laid it on the counter,

               <p>Court. That was his idea of the matter, whether the Jew took it will be for the consideration of the gentlemen of the jury.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You went that same afternoon to Solomon's. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never wronged any body of a farthing, I have dealt with this gentleman four or five years, for new hats; for him to say that I had his money, I never saw it; when that gentleman came to see me I was very glad to see him, I asked him where he came from, he said he came to see me, I owed him seven pounds, I said seven pounds for what, he said do not you recollect that you owe me seven pounds, I said again for what, for if I want money, I can have it lent me in the neighbourhood, he says come along with me, when I came out of doors there was his brother and two other gentlemen; when we came to Lambeth-street he told me that I had robbed him; I never in my life did hurt a worm, nor was I ever dishonest to any body of a farthing, I was fit to faint, they shoved me into a public house and tore my clothes to pieces.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The first word that I said to him was you are determined to make me come to see you, you have repeatedly asked me, but I am much surprised at your conduct and the cause of it, how could you think of taking my seven pounds this morning, says he what seven pounds, I says seven pounds you took from out of my shop, says he how could you think of me taking seven pounds, I said I could not help thinking of your taking it when I have so clear evidence against you; there is no doubt you took it out of a joke, and I would wish to pass it off as such, says he I have not got your seven pounds, I says I shall take you to the police office immediatly, I called in Mr. Pedder and another friend; I did not stop a moment hardly.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. On Friday the 9th of May, as I was coming through Baldwyn's Gardens, the prisoner at the bar said to me, I should like to split your scull, I said why, she said because you are like my husband, I said I should be very sorry if<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180605210029"/>I was, because I should not like to have such a drunken wife, she reeled very much, and was sometimes off the pavement into the road, I paid very little at tention to the conversation, she said she had been into the fields to keep herself sober, and there she found a child in the morning, the child had nothing on, she said, but a flannel bed gown and a pair of earrings; she said the child turned to her and called to her, and called her aunty, she asked the child where she lived, the child said Mutton Hill; she had, she said, been all the day and could not find the parents of the child, she had left it at Clerkenwell workhouse; I thought it was a strange story, when we went almost to the bottom of Holborn she asked me if I would drink, I told her by no means, she says I would wish you to drink with me; I thought I might have an opportunity of getting the whole of the transaction out of her; I went into the wine vaults, I looked at the woman, her right eye was black, she had a glass of gin, and when she came out of the wine vaults a woman that sold gingerbread accosted her, and says what have you done with the child you took down Holborn; I went back, asked her what she said about the child, she said this woman led a child away, she said it was Coleman's child in Field-lane; I went to Coleman and found he was out with the beadle having the child cried.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, if I am right, you afterwards found the child in Clerkenwell workhouse. - A. We both went there and found the baby, we brought her back; I told Coleman if he would go with me up to this wine vaults, probably they might know something of this woman; I said I am positive I should know her; we went into several houses about Saffron Hill, we could see nothing of her, when I was with her she said she was going to meet her husband at the Cow, in Cow-lane; we went there and the first object that I saw when we were at the door was this woman, we took her up, she was searched, and a great many duplicates were found upon her.</p>

             sworn. I am a watchman of St. Sepulchre's parish. When I was calling the hour of three o'clock in the morning, I picked up this duplicate off the pavement; the next day at Guildhall, it occurred to me when the name of Brown was mentioned, that I had a duplicate I picked up in that name; I went up to sir Watkin, and informed him that I had something that would bring the matter to light, here is the duplicate. (The frock and petticoat identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in Cold Bath Fields, I met this poor baby, about the hour of half past eight, or near nine o'clock, I could not hear who it belonged to one way or other; I went up and down Mutton Hill for half an hour, I could not hear any thing; there was a poor woman that persuaded me to take her to the workhouse, I took the child to Clerkenwell workhouse, there I left word my name was Brown, and my father lived in Shoe-lane; I told this good man that I was going to meet my husband at the Cow, in Cow-lane, is it likely that I should have told that if I had robbed the child; I have had seven children of my own, I never touched the child's clothes, I have too much feeling for a baby.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner, Browner. - A. I never saw him in my life till I saw him at the police office, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Dempsey procure you a birth on board the Europe. - A. He sent for me on Sunday evening, I was not in health at the time; I went to his house, he told me he thought he had a good birth for me on board the Europe, providing I would go on board, I told him as I was not in health, I did not think<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180605210030"/>I was fit to go, he said there was a very good doctor on board, it was better to go there than to be on shore, he got me a birth on board the Europe.</p>
               <p>Q. What was due on account of board or any thing else from you to Dempsey, before you went on board the Europe. - A. There was nothing due at that time for board; I told him the night I agreed to go, between ten and eleven o'clock, I must go to the washerwoman's, and when the washerwoman brought my clothes, I told him to pay the bill, he said he would, the washing bill amounted to seven shillings, I gave him the seven shillings on board the ship; after we had settled that, he asked me if I would leave an absent bond for a woman that I lived with, I told him I would not, Coleman was present and said you are very right, do not leave none to no person; I then gave him one guinea and two seven shilling pieces to pay one Macdonald, there was nothing else due then after that was settled.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went from Dempsey's house to go to Gravesend, had Dempsey made any application to you for any power. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you upon your oath execute any power of attorney at Dempsey's house in St. George's in the East. - A. No, nor no where else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on board the ship at Gravesend, or before you failed, execute any power of attorney. - A. I did not indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand you that you never saw Browner before you failed. - A. I never had seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you failed for India I suppose. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you returned to England. - A. I came home this winter in the Lord Hawkesbury; after I failed in the Indiaman, I was on board a man of war, the Russel, and I was invalided; I returned in the Hawkesbury a little while after Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you made application to the magistrate at the Thames police office. - A. Nearly six weeks, I went after the man to get the money from him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you apply to the India house. - A. The second day after I arrived at London, I applied to Mr. Steward at the India house to get my money, they refused payment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apply for your wages or any thing else. - A. For my wages of the Europe, the ship that I went out in; they told me that Dempsey had got the money. The next day after I was at the India house, I went to Dempsey, I found him in Newgate; I asked him how he came to get my money at the India house; he told me then he did not know he had got it rightly, but says he, it was either upon an absent bond or a power of attorney, I do not know which; I told him, you know I never empowered you to get any money, he told me to make myself easy, he expected to be out of Newgate in a few days, but in fact, says he, I do not know whether I have got your money or not, but if I have, when I come out I will make a settlement with you; about a week or two I think I waited upon Dempsey at his house in Dock-street, St. George's in the East; there he said he did not know but I was indebted to him; I never could get him to do any thing with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any power of attorney produced to you on your return to his house. - A. No, never; afterwards there was one brought to the Thames police office by Dempsey.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember that power of attorney. - A. No, (a paper handed to him). I think that is the one I saw at the Thames police office which Dempsey produced to Mr. Harriot the magistrate; it was afterwards shewn to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon this being shewn to you you were quite satisfied that you never executed it. - A. I was, I never gave a power, I never saw Browner till he came a witness against me at the Thames police office; Dempsey called him, Dempsey had two or three examinations before this Browner could be found; since that time Dempsey and Browner were committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Since that time have you received from the India house your wages. - A. Yes, every farthing that is due to me.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you claim no wages at all from any one. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. From what ship had you come from at the time you lodged at the house of Dempsey. - A. From the Three Sisters of Philadelphia.</p>
               <p>Q. I think that you stated at the police office that you had received your wages from the captain of the Three Sisters in the presence of Mr. Hull of Virginia street, Wapping. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But Mr. Hull was not present. - A. He saw the money as soon as I saw it, Mr. Hull went down to the coffee house where the captain was; when I came into the office to be paid Mr. Hull was there waiting for me till I came out, and when I came out I shewed it him.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you did not state that your wages were paid you by the captain in the presence of Mr. Hull. - A. I am not certain whether he did or not.</p>
               <p>Q. According to your account you was on shore only about six weeks, you boarded at Dempsey's house all that time. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You chuse to state now that at the time you quitted Dempsey's house you paid him every thing. - A. He had my money in his hands, I gave him my money, and I could never get my money out of his hands, I brought a great many Spanish dollars.</p>
               <p>Q. We must take your word for that, he cannot be examined as a witness; when you came back this last winter you went to him, he told you you were indebted to him. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And when he had looked among the papers he did not at all deny that he had received three pound ten shillings, but still said there was money due to him. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to the police office for an order for the magistrate to make him pay the money. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of your application he came there and produced the paper to which you have been speaking. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The magistrate asked him if he had any thing of that sort to shew, he said he had, he would bring it, and upon that he went home, and did bring it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180605210031"/>the next day of meeting. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The enquiry was then made whether they could or could not find Browner, who was a witness to it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Dempsey said he would endeavour to find him, upon which he was allowed to go home again. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And after some days he brought him to the office. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When Browner came there he stated to your face that he had witnessed that bond. - A. Yes, and he told me that he saw me sign it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that the magistrate committed him as well as Dempsey. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have since got all the money from the East India house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know except that you sware that you had not executed that absent bond, that you could never get that money. - A. I did not know it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know this, that provided you had signed that paper, that Dempsey was well warranted to receive that money at the India house. - A. If I had left him one; I knew perfectly well that I had not left him no absent bond; I said to him I will try by the laws of your country; I thought to have got the money from him.</p>

             sworn. I am a fish monger's servant, I live with Mr. Bayley, Newgate-street; I had been in Portland-street, Oxford Road; coming back I saw the prisoner at the bar and another after picking a gentleman's pocket, then they went down <placeName id="t18060521-52-crimeloc275">Red Lion-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Are you sure that the prisoner is the person. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Where was I when I took the copper from the boy. - A. In Red Lion-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have a witness to the contrary; it was in Eagle-street, the boy asked me to carry it for him into Holborn.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. In consequence of information, I followed them into Eagle-street; the prisoner at the bar was carrying it on his head; they were walking very fast, they turned into Dean-street, and when they had got a little way down Dean-street, I came up to them. I immediately collared the prisoner at the bar with the copper on his head; the other person ran off, I asked him how he dared steal the copper from the door, he said he was employed by the person that was with him; in the scuffle he got from me and the copper fell off his head, with assistance I took him again; he never was out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I shewed him the boy who hired me to carry it, and begged of him to take him.</p>
               <p>Court. You know him I suppose. - A. I never saw the boy before.</p>
               <p>(The copper produced and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have a witness that saw the boy call me to carry it, that was coming by at the time he hired me.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to gather some dandelion, and coming along this road, where I serve with asparagus, some women called after me, you have got something that does not belong to you under your cloak, I turned back to go to the woman that said I had got the property, and before I got over the second channel, a man came out and said he would take good care I should not go; I stopped an hour before the officer took me, the officer took me into a public house and searched me, I had not any thing in the world but one halfpenny; he asked me where I lodged, I said it is nothing where I lodge, I get my money very hard; I am really innocent of the fact, you may depend upon it, as innocent as God is just and true in heaven.</p>

               <p>Q. In the month of October last did the prisoner call upon you. - A. He did, he is an oil-broker; he stated that he understood that we had a pipe of olive oil to dispose of, and requested a sample, he had a sample, he made an observation when the sample was given him that it looked rather dingy, he asked the price, I made answer seventy pound per ton; a day or two afterwards he called again and requested a fresh sample, he said it looked dingy, and requested the man to put the searching iron in to ascertain what grease or dirt might be in the body of the oil: the man did it and brought it to Mr. Ayres' inspection; he went away and returned again in about three days, and requested to know if I would take sixty-five pound per ton for it, I said as I had only that one cask, I would dispose of it at that price; he said he had sold it to Mr. Payne, a spermaceti refiner, Berwick street, Soho, he said he had sold it for sixty-five pound, he then gave me a note in my presence (the note read in court); he then said he had two or three little packages to take to Mr. Payne, he must have a cart for them, and if it made no difference to me, he would thank me if I would let him take the olive oil with him, as it would save the cart hire, he requested to have the oil got up for him by eleven o'clock, it was got up for him, and he called a little after eleven o'clock and took the cask of olive oil with him, and said he would make the allowance for the dirt and grease in the oil shortly.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the quantity and value of the olive oil in that cask. - A. I think about ninety-three gallons, and it was worth about twenty-four or twenty-five pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. This was on the 25th of October he took the cask of olive oil with him. - A. Yes; in about three weeks afterwards I met him in Leadenhall-street, I told him we had not his return, he made answer we should shortly have it, he never called on us; in about a month or five weeks afterwards I met him again, I then asked him the reason that he had not brought the allowance for grease and dirt down to our accounting-house, he said it was owing to the severe cold weather, it was impossible to ascertain the allowance, but now being placed in a warm situation, he would shortly take it and bring it down to us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any idea that the oil had not gone to Mr. Payne. - A. None at all; after that one morning I called at his dwelling house George-yard, Lombard-street; he then said he would bring the allowance down for the cask, he never came near us, I called again, he then stated that he had lost the paper that had the allowance on it; I then sent to Mr. Payne: I saw Mr. Ayres after that, I told him that Mr. Payne knew nothing of the transaction, he had never ordered him to buy the oil of us, he answered me he would call down and settle it, I saw him again, he promised to call; at last I told him I should take out a warrant against him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you apply to Mr. Ayres to pay the money. - A. I never applied to him about the business of the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was you to receive the money from. - A. From Mr. Payne, we looked to Mr. Payne for the money, it was sold to him.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time you sold it, how long elapsed before you made application to Mr. Payne. - A. Near four months.</p>
               <p>Q. And he not being able to pay did not give you such security as you approved of. - A. Ayes offered security, but I told him I did not approve of it.</p>
               <p>Court. He offered security and you refused it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>- PAYNE sworn. Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you receive a pipe of oil from Messrs. Stratton and Hemmit on the 25th of October last. - A. I did not, I permitted him to make use of my name, but it never came.</p>
